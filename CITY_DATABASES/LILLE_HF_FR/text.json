        "wiki": "Lille ( LEEL; French: [lil] (listen); Dutch: Rijsel [\u02c8r\u025bis\u0259l]; Picard: Lile; West Flemish: Rysel) is a city at the northern tip of France, in French Flanders. On the De\u00fble River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region, the prefecture of the Nord department, and the main city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille.\nAs of 2017, Lille had a population of 232,787 within its administrative limits, and Lille is the first city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille with a population of 1,146,320, making it the fourth-largest urban area in France after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nArcheological digs seem to show the area as inhabited by as early as 2000 BC, most notably in the modern quartiers of Fives, Wazemmes and Vieux Lille. The original inhabitants of the region were the Gauls, such as the Menapians, the Morins, the Atrebates and the Nervians, who were followed by Germanic peoples: the Saxons, the Frisians and the Franks.\nThe legend of \"Lyd\u00e9ric and Phinaert\" puts the foundation of the city of Lille at 640. In the 8th century, the language of Old Low Franconian was spoken, as attested by toponymic research. Lille's Dutch name is Rijsel, which comes from ter ijsel (at the island) from Middle Dutch ijssel (\u201csmall island, islet\u201d), calque of Old French l'Isle (\u201cthe Island\u201d), itself from Latin \u012ansula, from \u012bnsula (\u201cisland\u201d).\nFrom 830 to around 910, the Vikings invaded Flanders. After the destruction caused by Normans' and the Magyars' invasion, the eastern part of the region was ruled by various local princes.\nThe first mention of the town dates from 1066: apud Insulam (Latin for \"at the island\"). It was then controlled by the County of Flanders, as were the regional cities (the Roman cities Boulogne, Arras, Cambrai as well as the Carolingian cities Valenciennes, Saint-Omer, Ghent and Bruges). The County of Flanders thus extended to the left bank of the Scheldt, one of the richest and most prosperous regions of Europe.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe Carolingian duke \u00c9vrard lived in the city in the 9th century and participated in many of the day's political and military affairs. There was an important Battle of Lille in 1054.\nFrom the 12th century, the fame of the Lille cloth fair began to grow. In 1144 Saint-Sauveur parish was formed, which would give its name to the modern-day quartier Saint-Sauveur.\nThe counts of Flanders, Boulogne, and Hainaut came together with England and East Frankia and tried to regain territory taken by Philip II of France following Henry II of England's death, a war that ended with the French victory at Bouvines in 1214. Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders was imprisoned and the county fell into dispute: it would be his wife, Jeanne, Countess of Flanders and Constantinople, who ruled the city. She was said to be well loved by the residents of Lille, who by that time numbered 10,000.\nIn 1225, the street performer and juggler Bertrand Cordel, doubtlessly encouraged by local lords, tried to pass himself off as Baldwin I of Constantinople (the father of Jeanne of Flanders), who had disappeared at the battle of Adrianople. He pushed the counties of Flanders and Hainaut towards sedition against Jeanne in order to recover his land. She called her cousin, Louis VIII (\"The Lion\"). He unmasked the imposter, whom Countess Jeanne quickly had hanged. In 1226 the king agreed to free Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders. Count Ferrand died in 1233, and his daughter Marie soon after. In 1235, Jeanne granted a city charter by which city governors would be chosen each All Saint's Day by four commissioners chosen by the ruler. On 6 February 1236, she founded the Countess's Hospital (Hospice Comtesse), which remains one of the most beautiful buildings in Old Lille. It was in her honour that the hospital of the Regional Medical University of Lille was named \"Jeanne of Flanders Hospital\" in the 20th century.\nThe Countess died in 1244 in the Abbey of Marquette, leaving no heirs. The rule of Flanders and Hainaut thus fell to her sister, Margaret II, Countess of Flanders, then to Margaret's son, Guy of Dampierre. Lille fell under the rule of France from 1304 to 1369, after the Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305).\nThe county of Flanders fell to the Duchy of Burgundy next, after the 1369 marriage of Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, and Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Lille thus became one of the three capitals of said Duchy, along with Brussels and Dijon. By 1445, Lille counted some 25,000 residents. Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, was even more powerful than the King of France, and made Lille an administrative and financial capital.\nOn 17 February 1454, one year after the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, Philip the Good organised a Pantagruelian banquet at his Lille palace, the still-celebrated \"Feast of the Pheasant\". There the Duke and his court undertook an oath to Christianity.\nIn 1477, at the death of the last duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian of Austria, who thus became Count of Flanders.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\n\nThe 16th and the 17th centuries were marked by a boom in the regional textile industry, the Protestant revolts and outbreaks of the plague.\nLille came under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1519. The Low Countries fell to his eldest son, Philip II of Spain, in 1555. The city remained under Spanish Habsburg rule until 1668.\nCalvinism first appeared in the area in 1542, and by 1555, the authorities were taking steps to suppress that form of Protestantism. In 1566, the countryside around Lille was affected by the Iconoclastic Fury. In 1578, the Hurlus, a group of Protestant rebels, stormed the castle of the Counts of Mouscron. They were removed four months later by a Catholic Wallon regiment, and they tried several times between 1581 and 1582 to take the city of Lille, all in vain. The Hurlus were notably held back by the legendary Jeanne Maillotte. At the same time (1581), at the call of Elizabeth I of England, the north of the Seventeen Provinces, having gained a Protestant majority, successfully revolted and formed the Dutch Republic. The war brought or exacerbated periods of famine and plague (the last in 1667\u20131679).The first printer to set up shop in Lille was Antoine Tack in 1594. The 17th century saw the building of new institutions: an Irish College in 1610, a Jesuit college in 1611, an Augustinian college in 1622, almshouses or hospitals such as the Maison des Vieux hommes in 1624 and the Bonne et Forte Maison des Pauvres in 1661, and of a Mont-de-pi\u00e9t\u00e9 in 1626.Unsuccessful French attacks on the city were launched in 1641 and 1645. In 1667, Louis XIV of France (the Sun King) successfully laid siege to Lille, resulting in it becoming French in 1668 under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, provoking discontent among the citizens of the prosperous city. A number of important public works undertaken between 1667 and 1670, such as the Citadel (erected by Vauban), or the creation of the quartiers of Saint-Andr\u00e9 and la Madeleine, enabled the French king to gradually gain the confidence of his new subjects in Lille, some of whom continued to feel Flemish, but they had always spoken the Romance Picard language.\n\nFor five years, from 1708 to 1713, the city was occupied by the Dutch during the War of the Spanish Succession. Throughout the 18th century, Lille remained profoundly Catholic. It took little part in the French Revolution, but there were riots and the destruction of churches. In 1790, the city held its first municipal elections.\n\n\n=== Post-French Revolution ===\nIn 1792, in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the Austrians, then in the United Provinces, laid siege to Lille. The \"Column of the Goddess\", erected in 1842 in the \"Grand-Place\" (officially named Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle), is a tribute to the city's resistance, led by Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9-Bonte. Although Austrian artillery destroyed many houses and the main church of the city, the city did not surrender, and the Austrian Army left after eight days.\n\nThe city continued to grow and, by 1800, had some 53,000 residents, leading to Lille becoming the seat of the Nord d\u00e9partment in 1804. In 1846, a railway connecting Paris and Lille was built. In the early the 19th century, Napoleon I's continental blockade against the United Kingdom led to Lille's textile industry developing even more fully. The city was known for its cotton while the nearby towns of Roubaix and Tourcoing worked wool.  Leisure activities were thoroughly organised in 1858 for the 80,000 inhabitants.  Cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1,300, or one for every three houses. At that time the city counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations. Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets festivals and competitions. In 1853, Alexandre Desrousseaux composed his lullaby P'tit quinquin.\nIn 1858, Lille annexed the adjacent towns of Fives, Wazemmes, and Moulins. Lille's population was 158,000 in 1872, growing to over 200,000 by 1891. In 1896 Lille became the first city in France to be led by a socialist, Gustave Delory.\nBy 1912, Lille's population stood at 217,000. The city profited from the Industrial Revolution, particularly via coal and the steam engine. The entire region grew wealthy thanks to its mines and textile industry.\n\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nLille's occupation by the Germans began on 13 October 1914 after a ten-day siege and heavy shelling, which destroyed 882 apartment and office blocks and 1,500 houses, mostly around the railway station and in the centre. By the end of October, the city was being run by German authorities.\nBecause Lille was only 20 km from the battlefield, German troops passed through the city regularly on their way to and from the front. As a result, occupied Lille became a place for the hospitalisation and the treatment of wounded soldiers as well as a place for soldiers' relaxation and entertainment. Many buildings, homes and businesses were requisitioned to those ends.Lille was liberated by the Allies on 17 October 1918, when General Sir William Birdwood and his troops were welcomed by joyous crowds. The general was made an honorary citizen of the city of Lille on 28 October.\nThe only audio recording known to have been made during World War I was recorded near Lille in October 1918. The two-minute recording captured the Royal Garrison Artillery conducting a gas shell bombardment.Lille was also the hunting ground of the German World War I flying ace Max Immelmann, who was nicknamed \"the Eagle of Lille\".\n\n\n=== Ann\u00e9es Folles, Great Depression and Popular Front ===\n\nIn July 1921, at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin discovered the first anti-tuberculosis vaccine, known as BCG (\"Bacille de Calmette et Gu\u00e9rin\"). The Op\u00e9ra de Lille, designed by Lille architect Louis M. Cordonnier, was dedicated in 1923.\nFrom 1931, Lille felt the repercussions of the Great Depression, and by 1935, a third of the city's population lived in poverty. In 1936, the city's mayor, Roger Salengro, became Minister of the Interior of the Popular Front but eventually killed himself after right-wing groups led a slanderous campaign against him.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring the Battle of France, Lille was besieged by German forces for several days. When Belgium was invaded, the citizens of Lille, still haunted by the events of World War I, began to flee the city in large numbers. Lille was part of the zone under control of the German commander in Brussels, and was never controlled by the Vichy government in France. Lille was instead controlled under the military administration in Northern France. The d\u00e9partments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais (with the exception of the coast, notably Dunkirk) were for the most part liberated from 1 to 5 September 1944, by British, Canadian and Polish troops. On 3 September, German troops began to leave Lille out of fear of the British, who were on their way from Brussels. The city was liberated by a British force consisting largely of tanks.Rationing came to an end in 1947, and by 1948, normality had returned to Lille.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\n\nIn 1967, the Chambers of Commerce of Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing were joined, and in 1969< the Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Lille (Lille urban community) was created, linking 87 communes with Lille.\nThroughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the region was faced with some problems after the decline of the coal, mining and textile industries. From the early 1980s, the city began to turn itself more towards the service sector.\nIn 1983, the VAL, the world's first automated rapid transit underground network, opened. In 1993, a high-speed TGV train line was opened connecting Paris with Lille in one hour. This, with the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 and the arrival of the Eurostar train put Lille at the centre of a triangle connecting Paris, London and Brussels.\nWork on Euralille, an urban remodelling project, began in 1991. The Euralille Centre was opened in 1994, and the remodeled district is now full of parks and modern buildings containing offices, shops and apartments. In 1994 the \"Grand Palais\" was also opened for the general public, which is free for the public to enter on the first Sunday of every month.\nLille was chosen as European Capital of Culture in 2004, along with the Italian city of Genoa.\nLille and Roubaix were affected by the 2005 riots, like all of France's other urban centres.\nIn 2007 and again in 2010, Lille was awarded the label \"Internet City\".\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLille can be described as having a temperate oceanic climate; summers normally do not reach high average temperatures, but winters can fall below freezing temperatures, but with averages quite a bit above the freezing mark. Precipitation is plentiful year round.\nThe table below gives average temperatures and precipitation levels for the 1981-2010 reference period.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nLille is noted for its air pollution, with a 2018 study attributing 1,700 deaths per year in the agglomeration of Lille to pollution. In 2018, Lille held France's record pollution peaks.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nA former major mechanical, food industry and textile manufacturing centre as well as a retail and finance center, Lille is the largest city of a conurbation, built like a network of cities: Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing and Villeneuve d'Ascq. The conurbation forms the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille which is France's fourth-largest urban conglomeration with a 2016 population of over 1.15 million.\n\n\n=== Revenues and taxes ===\nFor centuries, Lille, a city of merchants, has displayed a wide range of incomes: great wealth and poverty have lived side by side, especially until the end of the 1800s. This contrast was noted by Victor Hugo in 1851 in his poem Les Ch\u00e2timents:  \u00ab Caves de Lille ! on meurt sous vos plafonds de pierre ! \u00bb (\"Cellars of Lille! We die under your stone ceilings!\")\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment in Lille has switched over half a century from a predominant industry to tertiary activities and services.\nServices account for 91% of employment in 2006.\n\nEmployment in Lille-Hellemmes-Lomme from 1968 to 2006\n\nEmployment per categories in 1968 and in 2006\n\nUnemployment in active population from 1968 to 2006\n\n\n=== Enterprises ===\nIn 2007, Lille hosts around 21,000 industry or service sites.\n\nEnterprises as per 31 December 2007\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nLille features an array of architectural styles with various amounts of Flemish influence, including the use of brown and red brick. In addition, many residential neighborhoods, especially in Greater Lille, consist of attached 2\u20133 story houses aligned in a row, with narrow gardens in the back. These architectural attributes, many uncommon in France, help make Lille a transition in France to neighboring Belgium, as well as nearby Netherlands and England, where the presence of brick, as well as row houses or the terraced house is much more prominent.\nPoints of interest include\n\nLille Cathedral (Basilique-cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame-de-la-Treille)\nCitadel of Lille\nPalais des Beaux-Arts de Lille\nJardin botanique de la Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie\nJardin botanique Nicolas Boulay\nJardin des Plantes de Lille\n\n\n=== La Braderie ===\n\nLille hosts an annual braderie on the first weekend in September. Its origins are thought to date back to the twelfth century and between two and three million visitors are drawn into the city. It is one of the largest gatherings of France and the largest flea market in Europe.\nMany of the roads in the inner city (including much of the old town) are closed and local shops, residents and traders set up stalls in the street.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille has a mixed mode public transport system, which is considered one of the most modern in the whole of France. It comprises buses, trams and a driverless light metro system, all of which are operated under the Transpole name. The Lille Metro is a VAL system (v\u00e9hicule automatique l\u00e9ger = light automated vehicle) that opened on 16 May 1983, becoming the first automatic light metro line in the world. The system has two lines, with a total length of 45 kilometres (28 miles) and 60 stations. The tram system consists of two interurban tram lines, connecting central Lille to the nearby communities of Roubaix and Tourcoing, and has 45 stops. 68 urban bus routes cover the metropolis, 8 of which reach into Belgium.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nLille is an important crossroads in the European high-speed rail network. It lies on the Eurostar line to London (1:20 hour journey). The French TGV network also puts it only 1 hour from Paris, 38 minutes from Brussels, and connects to other major centres in France such as Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse. Lille has two railway stations, which stand next door to one another: Lille-Europe station (Gare de Lille-Europe), which primarily serves high-speed trains and international services (Eurostar), and Lille-Flandres station (Gare de Lille-Flandres), which primarily serves lower speed regional trains and regional Belgian trains.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nFive autoroutes pass by Lille, the densest confluence of highways in France after Paris:\n\nAutoroute A27 : Lille \u2013 Tournai \u2013 Brussels / Li\u00e8ge \u2013 Germany\nAutoroute A23 : Lille \u2013 Valenciennes\nAutoroute A1  : Lille \u2013 Arras \u2013 Paris / Reims \u2013 Lyon / Orl\u00e9ans / Le Havre\nAutoroute A25 : Lille \u2013 Dunkirk \u2013 Calais \u2013 England / North Belgium\nAutoroute A22 : Lille \u2013 Antwerp \u2013 NetherlandsA sixth one \u2013 the proposed A24 \u2013 will link Amiens to Lille if built, but there is opposition to its route.\n\n\n=== Air traffic ===\nLille Lesquin International Airport is 15 minutes from the city centre by car (11 km). In terms of shipping, it ranks fourth, with almost 38,000 tonnes of freight which pass through each year. Its passenger traffic, around 1.2 million in 2010, is modest due to the proximity to Brussels, Charleroi, and Paris-CDG airports. The airport mostly connects other French and European cities (some with low-cost airlines).\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\n\nLille is the third-largest French river port after Paris and Strasbourg. The river De\u00fble is connected to regional waterways with over 680 km (423 mi) of navigable waters. The De\u00fble connects to Northern Europe via the River Scarpe and the River Scheldt (towards Belgium and the Netherlands), and internationally via the Lys River (to Dunkerque and Calais).\nShipping statistics\n\n\n== Education ==\nWith over 110,000 students, the metropolitan area of Lille is one of France's top student cities.\n\nWith roots back from 1562 to 1793 as University of Douai, (then as Universit\u00e9 Imp\u00e9riale in 1808), the State University of Lille was established in Lille in 1854 with Louis Pasteur as the first dean of its Faculty of Sciences. A school of medicine and an engineering school were also established in Lille in 1854; and the University of Lille was united as the association of existing public Faculties in 1896. It was then split into three independent university campuses in 1970: Lille 1 University of Science and Technology, Lille 2 University of Law and Health, and Lille 3 Charles de Gaulle University of Humanities, Social sciences, Literature and Arts.At the beginning of 2018, Lille 1, Lille 2 and Lille 3 merged to form the new University of Lille (student enrollment: 70,000).\nIt is part of the Community of Universities and Institutions (COMUE) Lille Nord de France and the European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France.\n\nThe Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech, an engineering graduate school of industrial and mechanical engineering, settled in Lille in 1900. This campus is one of the eight Teaching and Research Center (CER) of the school. Its creation was decided by Pierre-Nicolas Legrand de L\u00e9rant.\nEcole Centrale de Lille is one of the five Centrale Graduate Schools of engineering in France; it was founded in Lille city in 1854, its graduate engineering education and research center was established as Institut industriel du Nord (IDN) in 1872, in 1968 it moved in a modern campus in Lille suburb.\n\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de chimie de Lille was established as Institut de chimie de Lille in 1894 supporting chemistry research as followers of Kuhlmann's breakthrough works in Lille.\n\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de journalisme de Lille, journalism school created in 1924.\nSkema Business School established in 1892 is ranked among the top business schools in France.\n\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies settled in Lille in 2009.\nESME-Sudria and E-Artsup settled in Lille in 2012.\nThe ESA \u2013 \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Affaires is a Business Management school established in Lille in 1990.\nIEP Sciences-Po Lille political studies institute was established in Lille in 1992.\nThe Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action is also located in Lille.\nThe Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group) established in Lille in 1988.\nThe European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France is headquartered in Lille Metropolis and includes 3,000 PhD Doctorate students supported by university research laboratories.\nThe Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Lille was founded in 1875. Today it has law, economics, medicine, physics faculties and schools. Among the most famous is Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers (ICAM) founded in 1898, ranked 20th among engineering schools, with the specificity of graduating polyvalent engineers, Ecole des Hautes \u00e9tudes d'ing\u00e9nieur (HEI) a school of engineering founded in 1885 and offering 10 fields of specialization, \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes commerciales du nord (EDHEC) founded in 1906, IESEG School of Management founded in 1964 (17th place in the latest Financial Times global ranking of the 90 best masters in management, published on Monday 12 September 2016).  and Skema Business School currently ranked within the top 5, the top 10 and top 15 business schools in France, respectively. In 1924 ESJ \u2013 a leading journalism school \u2013 was established.\n\n\n== Notable people from Lille ==\n\n\n=== Writers ===\nJacquemart Gi\u00e9l\u00e9e (13th century), poet\nYvonne Chauffin (1905\u20131995), writer, winner of the 1970 edition of the Prix Breizh\nJean Prieur (1914\u20132008), writer and professor\n\n\n=== Scientists and mathematicians ===\n\n\n=== Artists ===\n\n\n=== Politicians, professionals and military ===\n\n\n=== Sportspeople ===\n\n\n== Media and sports ==\nLocal newspapers include Nord \u00e9clair and La Voix du Nord.\nFrance's national public television network has a channel that focuses on the local area: France 3 Nord-Pas-de-Calais\nThe city's most major association football club, Lille OSC, currently plays in Ligue 1, the highest level of football in France.

        "wiki": "Bamse \u2013 V\u00e4rldens starkaste bj\u00f6rn (Swedish for 'Bamse \u2013 The World's Strongest Bear') is a Swedish cartoon created by Rune Andr\u00e9asson. The highly popular children's cartoon first emerged as a series of television short films as well as a weekly half-page Sunday strip in 1966, before being published periodically in its own comic magazine since 1973.\nAndr\u00e9asson did all the artwork himself until 1975 and wrote all the comics until 1990. Francisco Tora did all the illustrations from 1976 until he was joined by Bo Michanek in 1983. Several new writers and illustrators were hired in the early 1990s, including Claes Reimerthi, Anna Friberger and Tony Cronstam. Andr\u00e9asson continued to do the magazine cover illustrations until 1992.\nThe series somewhat changed direction when Bamse had children, specifically triplets, in 1982. He had a fourth child in 1986, and his friend Lille Skutt had one at the same time; this saw the series focus more on family, while also discussing other values such as gender equality. In 1989, the character Skalman noticed that Bamse's fourth child Brumma had some intellectual disability, later defined as Asperger's syndrome, which again brought up the subject of equality. The children did develop in real time within the magazine, but seem to have been fixed in age since around 1990. They are now around nine years old, in a narratively advantageous eternal state as third-graders.\nBoth the early Sunday strips and the early magazines have since been reprinted as glossy hardbound volumes.\nIn 1998, the theme park 'Bamses V\u00e4rld' (\"Bamse's World\") started as an attraction at the Kolm\u00e5rden Zoo, with theater performances, restaurant and houses from the comic.\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n=== Protagonists ===\nBamse, the main character, is a brown bear who becomes the world's strongest bear by eating a type of honey called dunderhonung (lit. \"thunder-honey\"), specially prepared for him by his grandmother. (Almost) anyone else who eats it, apart from Bamse's pet bee and his daughter Brumma, ends up with three days of stomach ache. Bamse is also the kindest bear in the world (according to the comic), and is often seen helping those in need. The name Bamse comes from a Scandinavian word for \"bear\" or \"teddy bear\". \"Bamse\" can also translate to \"giant\" or \"big one\", though that would be something of a misnomer, as Bamse is rather diminutive in size compared to many of the other characters.\nBrummelisa (\"Growlelisa\") is the daughter of a forester who could always rely on Bamse helping out; soon they fell in love. In 1981, they all went on a boat trip to the north of Scandinavia (financed by individual odd jobs), climaxing in a view of the midnight sun (an anti-climax to grandma's cat and mouse who expected it to look different). Back home, Brummelisa and Bamse staged a secret wedding and became parents to triplets: Brum (\"Growl\"), Teddy, Nalle-Maja (\"Teddy-Maja\"). Brum is artistically gifted, but somewhat shy. Teddy spends a lot of time by himself, and loves reading and learning. Nalle-Maja is the most extrovert kid, and loves sports and activities. Once their personalities began to shine through Teddy gravitated towards Skalman who noticed what the others failed to; Teddy's clumsiness stems from his eyesight and only needed a pair of glasses. Nalle-Maja has inherited more than just her father's looks; she also inherited his ability to get strong from the dunderhonung. To prevent her from injuring herself or her brothers, Bamse's grandmother attempted a new dunderhonung recipe to avoid making her strong. She partially succeeded; Nalle-Maja draws strength from it, but also winds up with the stomach ache. Late 1985 the triplets were informed on the arrival of another sibling; Brumma (\"Growla\"), who - when eating Dunderhonung - neither gets strong nor is affected by the stomach ache.\nLille Skutt (\"Little Hop\") is Bamse's and Skalman's best friend. He is a very fast but notoriously frightened white rabbit with a red bow tie. However, his ability to run quick and jump far (not to mention braving his fears whenever someone he cares about is in danger) has saved his friends' skins on more than one occasion. Lille Skutt is the village postman, albeit on a part-time basis. He also works part-time as the head chef of the local restaurant. Like Bamse, Skutt ended up marrying his girlfriend; Nina Kanin (\"Nina Rabbit\"), best friend with Brummelisa. Nina and Skutt became parents to a son Mini-Hopp (\"Mini-Hop\"), a hyperactive kid with an apparent lack of fear. He has eight siblings including Happ. Happ is a gay rabbit. He and his life-partner Lille Sixten have adopted a little girl named Suddan who is around Mini-Hopp's age.\nSkalman (\"Shellman\" / \"Shellback\") is an ingenious tortoise who invents all sorts of things, including spacecraft and time machines. He stores just about anything in his carapace except for locomotives, spaceships or atlantic steamboats (and also firewood, due to him getting splinters in the back). Skalman seems to be a polyphasic sleeper, and according to himself, his best invention is the food-and-sleep clock, whose calls he follows slavishly, even at times when sleep seems highly inappropriate. To this date, he has only ignored the alarm call a few times, including the discovery of a dinosaur's egg, the birth of Bamse's children, and a state of deep depression due to the false belief that his carelessness had caused the death of Bamse's children. None of the other characters come close to Skalman's intellectual level and he is sometimes seen playing chess with himself (he has stated that he has met and beaten the chess world champion). Rune Andr\u00e9asson has stated that he brought the food-and-sleep clock into the series for much the same reason as the dunderhonung; during a dangerous adventure, Skalman could just pull something out of his carapace to save them, or help the trio with his intellect. That's when the food-and-sleep clock calls Skalman to sleep, forcing Bamse and Lille Skutt to think on their own.\nVargen (\"The Wolf\") is a black wolf who was the original main villain (later anti-hero) of the comic; a criminal and a bully who at one point was named \"World Champion of Evil\" by his colleagues, but who later on proved to not be such a bad person if given a chance. Vargen grew up on the wrong side of the tracks and was introduced to a life of crime by his villainous stepfathers. When they eventually ended up in prison he knew that it was time to make a fresh start but his past turned against him as nobody wanted to give him the chance to better his life. Bamse, however, did, and eventually managed to reform the wolf by consistently treating him with kindness. Vargen occasionally slips back into his old ways, but as far as the other wolves are concerned he blew it by joining Bamse's club.\n\n\n=== Antagonists ===\nKr\u00f6sus Sork (\"Croesus Vole\") is an often cruel capitalist and secondary villain of the comic; born as a banker's son he was forced to play second fiddle to his brother Sl\u00f6sus (rough translation \"Wasteus\") who couldn't put a foot wrong. After Sl\u00f6sus later won a lottery (ticket no 88), Kr\u00f6sus forged his own ticket (no 89), switched the tickets, claimed Sl\u00f6sus' prize and let the unknowing Sl\u00f6sus get detained for forgery while coming to pick up his prize. Sl\u00f6sus was devastated to discover the truth after his release and they had a falling-out. Meanwhile, Kr\u00f6sus built up his fortune with blood money and let other voles do the dirty jobs. While Kr\u00f6sus has on occasion showed some small shred of conscience, he is still by far the most amoral and ruthless of the comic's villains; willing to do just about anything for profit.\nKapten Buster (\"Captain Buster\") and his three clumsy sideman pirates, Rusken, Slusken and Stollen. (Approximate translation: \"Rover,  Sloven and Silly\".) They are largely incompetent and unsuccessful, and have mostly given up their life at sea thanks to a tendency towards seasickness.\nKnocke & Smocke, (\"Knocker & Socker\") two large thugs with flat caps who have performed several unsuccessful criminal attempts. They usually rely mainly on brute force and are generally outwitted by Skalman or others.\nReinard is a sly fox and the newest main villain of the comic; who became an addition to the crew in 2006. He is shown to engage in all kinds of villainy, from shoplifting to explicit attempts on Bamse's life (which, curiously, has resulted in no retribution, or even rebuking, from Bamse's side).\n\n\n== Moral values and criticism ==\nThe magazine has educational goals. On special \"school\" pages, the characters educate the reader about animals, cultures, the Universe, and other subjects. They often deal with superstition, and Skalman's sceptical views (\"I only believe in what I know\") wins over those of his more naive friends. On the other hand, beings like trolls, tomtar and dragons exist on a very real plane in most of the stories. As the series have evolved, the values expressed have become more general and less ideological. A fact sheet written and published by Andreasson in 1983 following a trip to the People's Republic of China became very controversial as it seemed to praise Mao Zedong's dictatorial rule as a \"liberation\" and claimed that \"nobody's starving anymore\" in China under Communist single-party rule. It was later edited heavily when the adventure was reprinted in 2004.\nBamse and his friends are very clear about their views. They are strongly opposed to racism, bullying and violence. Bamse is not only the strongest bear in the world, but also the kindest, often repeating his slogan \"Nobody gets better from being beaten\". Bamse's own world seems to have strong implications of anarchism or libertarian socialism, combining private ownership with communitarian solidarity (from most of the characters), though a single policeman, Pontus Kask (named for his classic-style policeman's helmet, or \"kask\" in Swedish) and a small prison exists.\nThe original villain, a black wolf simply called Vargen (\"The Wolf\"), became a friend of Bamse after consistently being treated kindly. The only villain that is depicted as unredeemable is Kr\u00f6sus Sork (\"Croesus Vole\"), a crude capitalist who will do practically anything for money.\n\n\n== Films and other media ==\nSix animated black-and-white short films were produced for television in 1966. In 1972, seven more animated shorts were shown in colour. Another two shorts were released in 1981, and a direct-to-video movie became available in 1991.\nThe later colour films have aired frequently on TV in Sweden, and have been released on VHS and DVD. The black and white films had been unavailable to the general public for a long time, but were released on DVD by late 2006. The colour movies were low-budget productions with actor Olof Thunberg narrating and voicing all characters, but are considered to be classics. The musical theme, composed by Sten Carlberg, is easily recognised by most Swedes.\nIn 1993, a Game Boy game (in Swedish) was published loosely based on the Bamse characters. The game received generally poor reviews; it was in fact little more than a sprite replacement of Beam Software's Baby T-Rex, which explains the game's setting. The \"Bamse version\" is not the only time this happened; the game went through the same procedure for other regions featuring other characters. The \"Bamse version\" has not been officially released outside Sweden.\nIn October 2006, forty years after Bamse was created, Ola Andr\u00e9asson, the son of creator Rune Andr\u00e9asson announced that an animated feature film would be made, featuring better animation, a full voice cast, and a budget of SEK 25 million. An estimated release date of 2012 for the film was proposed. It was finally released in 2014 as Bamse and the Thief City. The film was followed by Bamse and the Witch's Daughter in 2016.\n\n\n== Translations ==\nIn the 1960s, there were a few translations of the series \"Bamses skola\" (\"Bamse's school\"), where the characters were given English names:\nBamse - Bamsy\nSkalman - Professor Shellback\nLille Skutt - Little Frisky\nVargen - Willie\nFarmor - Granny\nKatten Janson (literally Janson the Cat) - SootyIn this translation, the dunderhonung was given the name magic honey. However, in the 1980s, Andr\u00e9asson referred to it in English as thunder-honey, which is the literal translation also used in the Netherlands and Belgium (donderhoning).\nIn the cancelled movie Bamse and the Time-Travel Machine from 2009, the names were translated differently:\n\nBamse - Bamse\nSkalman - Shellman\nLille Skutt - Little Skip\nKr\u00f6sus Sork - Victor Vole\nDunderhonung - Superhoney\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBamse - Official site (in Swedish)\nOfficial site for Bamses v\u00e4rld (in Swedish)",

As we went to the Citadel, and entrance was only \u20ac4 each, we decided to pop in. Fabulous value for money and surprisingly lots to see. Loved the red pandas and meerkats,",

          "We spent an enjoyable hour at the zoo. It\u2019s pretty small and you can walk around everywhere in under 30 mins. Lots to see without it being overwhelming. We went on a hot day in the afternoon and most of the animals were asleep.",

          "We had a good look around and it took 1hr 30 min at a relaxed walk. It was only \u20ac11.50 for all 5 of us to get in. We enjoyed a good variety of animals and my partner loved the red panda.. There are Rhino and lots reptiles to see",
          "We visited this zoo whilst in France for the zoo it did take us a while to find it but had a lovely surprise when we eventually did. It cost just 10 euros for 2 adults and a child which is very cheap. Plenty of toilets all the way round and a good selection of animals. Would",
          "At 8 euros for two adults and an under 5 this was great value for money with plenty of animals and reptiles to see. The food available outside the zoo is reasonable and very fairly priced. Would definitely visit again.",
          "Very busy and deceptive in size little zoo. From reading some of the less positive reviews on here it is clear that many changes have been made to improve the enclosures of most of the animals. The parrots though need much more space but hopefully that is coming. Small but",
          "Superbly maintained smallish zoo with happy animals and great enclosures. Planned in a walk around a route one way it was very interesting, half of the animals I had never heard of. Fascinating for all ages",
          "It's a small zoo. Don't expect to see many animals. Nevertheless, you can visit especially if you have kids. The park around the zoo is very nice and relaxing.",
          "We spent about 2 hours in this well maintained, nicely landscaped zoo. Of course this is not the largest zoo you will have seen, but the entrance fee is only 4 euros and they still have rhinos:).",
          "Sure this place is in a park, next to the children's playground and meant for families but as you come over the bridge it is not marked that you should take the first path in. So we passed it and had to return back. Then we saw the path inside is pebbly so not good for our",
          "Very nice parc for only 2\u20ac. A lot of animals. You are in the Citadelle area and you have a lovely promenade around.",
          "Great little zoo with some pretty cool animals. Also it is free, so you can wander in and out as you will. Also around the park, which has lots of entertainment here as well.",
          "Natural surroundings for the animals. All were well fed and conditions very good no nasty smells! Used to be free but now 4 Euros, worth it as it goes back into the Zoo.",
          "This is a lovely little zoo considering the very low entry fee, with a somewhat surprisingly selection of animals. It was a lovely visit although on a hit day some of the animals and birds were in hiding. Please note there are no refreshments inside the zoo but there is a",
          "Our guide book said this zoo was free but we had to pay \u20ac4 for each of us but our 2 year old was free. However we did not begrudge this cost as it was great value. For a small zoo it had a wide range of animals - big (zebras & rhinos) and small (frogs & snakes) as well as",
          "Although small, this is a lovely zoo. The entry fee is minimal and definitely value for money. All the areas are labelled showing which animals/birds/reptiles are in there, with a little bit of information about them (some in English but mostly in French at present). All the",
          "A nice small size zoo, with a new free flight bird enclosure and new species in the zoo. Loads of European wild animals as part of breeding programmes to ensure animal survival.",
          "What a place. What a delight. There is no reason why you cannot walk to Parc Zoologique. A free attraction! Why every city doesn't have one of these, I do not know. Birds, monkeys, zebras, Rhinos. It's brilliant. A true must for all, adults and children alike. Well done Lille!",
          "very little is free these days, so this was an unexpected pleasure - a very pleasant little zoo by Bois de Boulogne.",
          "A nice walk, its great that its free to walk around and obviously popular with the locals for their Sunday afternoon walks :)",
          "A nice way to spend an hour with the kids. Zebras, rhinos, monkeys are all here. A small amusement park is just outside too) payment required for the rides)",
          "A perfect family day out to enjoy this great zoo! They have more collection of wonderful animals from around the world! Highly recommended!",
          "It is a nice surprise to stumble across a free zoo and I do not mean to sound ungrateful but it is not a very good one. Fun for families with small children (and there are a lot of children everywhere), but not adults. It is quite small and boring, the animals do not seem to",
          "Free, moderate in size, this is worth a stroll around for an hour or so if you are in Lille more than a few days. Good variety of animals, most look pretty happy although a few enclosures might be a little on the small side for some people.",
          "As it's free it is a nice asset to the city. Unfortunately it is closed during the winter months. Could do with some signs to indicate where zoo entrance is located.",
          "I was visiting Lille by myself, and was looking at attractions to visit when I stumbled across this online! I was pleasantly surprised and decided to give it a visit. It was quite a distance from the station to work, definitely one for using maps on my phone! It was situated in",
          "Considering this attraction is free, how can you complain! Some of the animal enclosures are a little small, but the larger animal enclosures are big enough for them to have a nice run, are clean and appear well maintained. Well worth a visit when having a walk in the park - you",
          "Nice zoo, it's free but you have quite some exotic animals. The parc is not so big but you can see the animals very well and get close to them",
          "This is a very small zoo, but it's free! So take your children and enjoy the animals and the green environment.",
          "Really strange to find a mid range zoo, very close to the centre, that is free. Great for a walk out, brilliant for kids as there's a big play park near the entrance as well. For a family in Lille who have the time, a great place to go. Did I mention it's free?!",
          "Considering this is free the zoo is worth a quick visit if walking around the area anyway. Situated in a beautiful park, the zoo itself is very small (there are a few birds, monkeys and llamas) but the park / forest around it makes up for it.",
          "Great little zoo. Lots of birds and small animals. Especially enjoyed seeing the huge tortoises. Rhinos were away but back shortly hopefully. I nice couple of hours in a beautiful city",
          "A Sunday in Lille when most things are closed, how on earth do you enertain a 4 year old? We miraculously stumbled upon this zoo..... This FREE zoo! It is very well maintained and all the animals (inluding Rhino and Zebra) look well looked after. Outside of the zoo there is a",
          "What a fantastic idea a free zoo in the city. We had a lovely morning walk round here. The only thing I would say is they should make were to give donations more obvious.",
          "First off, this is free. No charge at all. It is not the largest zoo you will ever visit but it is an enjoyable way to pass a few hours when in Lille. Some of the enclosures seem a little small but I suppose they meet accepted standards. For the size, and the cost of entry (I.e.",
          "Stumbled across this on a visit to the citadel. A lovely little collection of animals and no entrance charge. Nice way to spend an hour.",
          "It is free! Few animals - the orang utans were rather noisy. There seemed to be more parrots rather than animals in this zoo. Nice to walk around, if you have time to kill. Check out the nearby park too.",
          "We had read the good reviews of this destination and my family and I had a great time. It is very well set out by type of animal and the facities are very clean and the animals seem ed to enjoy themselves. The monkies were hilarious. It is about a 15 walk from the Grand Place",
          "Free zoo on the edge of main area. Not lots of animals, but they're well looked after and all seemed to be happy and not in distress.",
          "This was a good little zoo especially as free, reptiles, monkeys, zebras, rhino and others. Nice feel to place.",
          "While walking around the Citadel we diverted into this great little zoo. Not on our agenda for the day but we were very pleased that we did. And its was FREE entry. Please give a donation though, we all know how much it costs to visit any attraction and it all has to be paid for",
          "This is a very nice zoo, my friend and I really enjoyed walking around looking at the animals under the shelter of lots of beautiful greenery",
          "A nice and unexpactable place with quite exotic species in a relaxant environment. It also surprises with the free entrace!",
          "I so love this zoo. A lovely collection of animals and birds who all seem to be accomodated in ultra clean, spacious environments. A very very very nice place to visit. HIGHLY recommended.",
          "Quite small with a limited selection of animals, this zoo is probably best suited for an afternoon out with young children.",
          "Animals look content and have good space to move around, small zoo but plenty of interesting things to see.",
          "This was bigger than I thought it would be with a good variety of animals. It is nicely laid out and you do not feel that it is crowded, and the animals seem to be well cared for. On a very hot day for Lille (34+) though some were obviously having a great time, whilst others",
          "Had an enjoyable time meandering through the zoo. It's small enough to cover easily with young children. Closed on a Tuesday though. There's a good park just next to the zoo too so easy to while away a whole day.",
          "A really nice clean little zoo! My family thoroughly enjoyed our time there. We took a picnic and enjoyed it in the park before the zoo. It was a cheap fun way to spend an afternoon in Lille.",
          "A good variety of animals including zebra, hippos, snakes , giant tortoise, birds - best of all, it was free! It's not huge but was a lovely end to our day in Lille at the park which is literally next door! Glad we found it.",
          "Don't go on a Tuesday - zoo closed, car park closed - utter chaos. Came back the next day and enjoyed a lovely afternoon. It is a lovely stroll through mature woodland with some exotic animals thrown in. First some colourful bird - I call them all parrots, then some excitement",
          "This zoo is fantastic and unbelievably free! In the UK would would spend about \u00a335 for this as a family! It is really clean and a great way to spend a couple of hours. There is a kiosk near entrance where you can get burgers fries etc which wasn't great but acceptable. Don't be",
          "Watch out for the Pokemon Go addicts. Pleasant little zoo that if I was a parent in Lille I would be taking my children there all the time.",
          "We visited Lille without our kids and went to check out the citadel, but went to the entrance of the zoo to check for the prices. We were happily surprised to see that it was for free. So it was absolutely marvelous. Rhinoc\u00e9ros, zebras, several monkeys, parrots, red panda, ...",
          "Spent a good afternoon. ...pack a picnic! Lots of animals to see! Quaint, well kept, clean little zoo!",
          "Set in the confines of the impressive Citadel Fort, Parc Zoologique is a great find that should be the top of visitors things to do in Lille. Like many other people, I stumbled upon it by accident while exploring the park. Furthermore, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that",
          "A zoo that's free. What else is there to say. Not only free but lots to do and see. Activities for kids just outside. Loads of animals and birds to see. And just near to the citadelle for walking.",
          "We came across this Zoo by accident, as in area starting to walk to Citadel then noticed a small theme park then saw sign for zoo, as we entered we wondered where you pay.......well i do come from england where you pay for everthing.........but it was FREE, so at first thought",
          "Extremely small zoo, very tiny. The zoo has only a few animals caged in here. The Gibbons are very active and always having fun with each other. There are a few species of mammals and birds. If you have nothing going on for a couple of hours is worth the trip. The best part is",
          "Small, free and very well-organised. Little zoo near to city centre, you can spend about 1 hour. Bring your water...",
          "The Zoo is not very big, but well kept. It is a fun afternoon expierence. The park surrounding the zoo is very nice.",
          "I've visited this zoological garden several times and I liked it. There are all sorts of animals, birds and many species that people may have never seen in real life. I am happy to have discovered the red panda that is so sweet and always sleepy! I also saw a lot of amazing",
          "In the heart of Lille it was refreshing to find an attraction suitable for families that is free! Parc zoologique is a small, but surprisingly good zoo, offering a fun morning's entertainment. I visited the zoo at probably its busiest time but still got a good view of the",
          "Lovely little zoo - close to Lille Centre, in fact about a 20 minute gentle stroll. FREE to enter, and, although smallish has a lovely display of animals kept in clean and well maintained enclosures. Definitely worth a visit on a sunny day",
          "This is a small zoo but delightful. All the animals are kept in large paddocks and the park is kept clean with flowered borders and hedges. The zoo has a free entrance and there is a caf\u00e9 at the entrance. Very relaxing.",
          "Set in an extensive park in the centre of Lille this is a good place to relax. An old style zoo rather than a safari park it is easy to walk around with plenty of places to stop and rest, or even have a picnic as I did with my son. Free to enter you have nothing to spend on but",
          "Was closed on the day we tried to visit, despite checking website on the day. Lots of other disappointed people as well. A long way to go from our hotel to find out it was closed. Very disappointed children.",
          "It's next to the Citadel, so if you went there for a walk, it's worth stopping at the Zoo. It's free, it's small, it's clean and it's a fun visit.",

          "This zoo was a bit random but it's very well kept and it's free! Has a really diverse range of animals - the red panda is a must-see! Would recommend, especially on a sunny afternoon. It's not just for the kids.",
          "I love a zoo whenever I go somewhere as I know it will be a good way to pass the time. Lille zoo is, I would say, small to medium sized and doesn't have big attractions like tigers or elephants but it is good considering there is no entrance charge. It is also very central in",
          "The zoo is on the small side but they did a really good job making the most of it. Highly recommended if you have a bit of time around the Citadel",
          "The zoo is a short walk from the city centre. It is free - wow! It is next to a children's fairground in which the rides are not free. It has some well-designed enclosures, with a variety of animals and birds. You walk round on good paths and can do the whole zoo in 1-2 hours.",
          "Whenever you are in Lille it is worth checking out the free zoo. It doesn't boast quite the range of large beasts you might get in other places but there is plenty to look at and enough to keep children amused for a couple of hours. Just next door there is also a childrens fun",
          "Loved it. My son even found his father. It is not too busy either with clear views of all exhibits. I will bring the rest of my family.",
          "We hired some bikes and cycled to the Citadel with the Zoo and a picnic in mind. A few too many schoolchildren for our liking as we are middle aged and intolerant \ud83d\ude03 but what a beautifully kept place, well worth spending a hour.",

          "We wandered around the free zoo in the sun, fantastically well looked after animals and birds, clean cages. Beautiful surroundings, stunning zebras and white rhinos. Amazing dark house with great variety of snakes and lizards etc. Would definitely recommend if you came with",
          "Just got there because it's 1. Free 2. Nice and green 3. Only 10-15 minutes walk from center and 4. It is small but has exceptional animals... If you have time visiting lille don't miss it.",
          "It's not the biggest nor the best, still it's a nice place and free... It has been improved these Last years, all Armand is Vauban fortification, annoter must see when coming in Lille",
          "Located close to our hotel we went in on our last morning to while away a couple of hours and were most charmed by the wide variety of animals on show. Grooming pelicans, a cross porcupine, a couple of rhinos having a stand off followed by a joint wallow in the mud, indoors",
          "If you have a family, the zoo is just a perfect place to spend an hour; the animals look content and the structures are in pristine condition.",
          "It is a very small zoo, and during the weekend, if the weather is nice, it gets really crowded. But if you have kids, it is a nice way to spend a couple of hours (go in the morning!) , they will be happy. You have to appreciate that the city doesn't charge a fee for it, and",
          "Very family-friendly zoo, free of charge. Although not so big, quite nice variety of animals can be found there.",
          "We went on a Public Holiday so there were many families and lots of children. It was near our hotel so we went but I'm not a great fan of small animals in cages and I thought it was all a bit shabby.",
          "Free parking, free zoo entry and some of the most beautiful animals in a stunning natural setting. Your little ones will absolutely love it, with the little funfair and parks to round off the afternoon in the shady woods next door.",
          "To be honest, I have no idea how a zoo like this runs for free, but it is awesome. The place is actually quite large, and contains a range of different creatures: owls, iguana, various monkeys and birds, a snake, porcupine, meerkat, zebra, rhino...but I think the red panda was",
          "Came across this by accident when we went exploring. Lovely to wander round in a bit of green space in the city and see the animals.",
          "This Is a lovely way to wile away an hour or so on a sunny day. As a free attraction well worth a visit especially if you have children as a huge play park. Not that many animals but well laid out and beautiful park around it.",

          "Found this to be very close to our hotel. Small size of zoo with limited to birds and small mammals at entry. South American and Africa regions had very limited number of animals but they had decent enclosures. Monkeys were on islands in large ponds. Good place to just relax",
          "Zoo with no entrance fee and tastefully located in a very nice greenish area. I have spent wonderful time with my little children. It's not immense so it's ideal for an afternoon stroll and picnic. Highly recommended for a relaxed family visit",
          "Great zoo, they just added tasmanian devils to their collection. You can spend extra money and go behind the scenes to see how their routine is with the animals. While you are there, you should also consider taking a stroll at the Citadelle",

          "Amazed to find it free, it's beautifully kept and the animals well cared for. We watched keepers feeding and cleaning. Obviously a conservation Animal Park. We were very impressed and left a donation.",

          "Unbelievably this little zoo has free entry. On Sunday morning in spring it was full of families with young children. Lots to see including rhinos and chimps. Cafe could have been more alluring.",
          "What a lovely free attraction. We spent a very enjoyable couple of hours here, but BEWARE pickpockets operate near the entrance where it is crowded. Two women tried to steal from me but fortunately my husband was carrying our cash. Otherwise highly recommend a visit.",

          "What a wonderful small zoo we came across on our visit to Lille. We were astonished to find it was free to go in. Although it is small we spent two hours wandering around and being entertained by monkeys playing. There are rhinos, zebras and a variety of small animals and a",
          "Even though its a small zoo its worth visiting and i find it to be one of the best attributes of the city. It's a hidden gem in Lille",
          "What a wonderful surprise this zoo is. It is situated within the Citadel Park and most importantly entrance to the zoo is free. We liked it a lot and visited twice during our stay, making sure to give a donation on our way out. The animals all looked well cared for and the",

          "This zoo surprised me I loved visiting all the animals. The red panda was so adorable and the white owl! The staff are friendly and the animals have nice enclosures. I also enjoyed watching the monkeys play I could watch them for hours! Happy day! \ud83d\ude0a",
          "I heard that Lille had a small zoo and went there only because I had a spare couple of hours to kill. What a gem, its much bigger than you think, they have a huge collection of animals, the white handed monkeys never stopped howling and it was a very enjoyable visit.On top of",

          "Lovely seeing all these beast with the sun out on a nice hot day Nice canteen onsite, have to visit the Rhino, that's a must. The Meercats are cheeky little sods, so they are a must see also",

          "A fairly small little zoo, but with some really interesting animals and what looks to be very good facilities for the animals in question. Particular star of the show is the red panda, but all around a good fun afternoon out. Come here every time we visit the city and I dare say",
          "nice and free. you can walk here from the town center (like 20 minutes on foot) and visit also the cittadelle",
          "It is quite difficult to visit a public attraction when it closes annually for effectively two-thirds of the winter. A number of things are closed in Lille on Sunday so you'd expect something like the zoo to be open. The official website also has conflicting information with",
          "We were a little gutted that the zoo was closed NYE and Day . Lots of families clearly thought it would be open also but there was no sign up to say why and the notice board implied it should be open but there were just locked gates and sad looking children",
          "This little zoo, situated a short distance from Lille centre, is a must. It may be smaller than many but it's free. That's unique nowadays. There are a fair number of animals and birds on show and the baboons were really funny and entertaining, so much so that we went back the",
          "Well this was a unexpectedly fun hour or so, it's not huge but it is free and there are a good range of animals to see. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. It is a short walk from the centre. The help information is good to support the exhibits. This was suggested by",

          "Putting aside the weather we had it was a great day out and well worth seeing. I would recommend this place to families.",
          "Nice and free zoo, perfect for a stroll during a nice sunny day. What else could you ask for? There's heap to visit in Lille, but with kids, that s a good alternative to the in town visits and museum visits.",

          "Fantastic place to spend up to 2 hours close to Dunkirk ferry port. 2 adults and 1 child was 9 Euros unlike the U.K. over priced places. If you want to see big animals this is the wrong place for you. We were lucky enough to go into the nesting area of the beavers along with one",
          "Admission is free. The place is not big, but is very clean, including the toilets. It is located in one of the most beautiful areas of the city. Very good option to take a walk and relax. You can also rent a bike to take a ride in the area outside the zoo (Citadelle de Lille).",

          "We visited this zoo, it was free, and well run. All of the animals and birds seemed content and unstressed. The red tree bears (?) were great, and the indoor display with spiders and snakes suitably creepy. A good way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "Well worth a visit. A small zoo with lots of interesting birds and small mammals along with rhinos and zebras. Very well kept and clean with informative signage.",
          "This being free, we expected little more than a kids' petting zoo but although it's on a modest scale this facility boasts zebras, hippos and monkeys among its attractions. Very popular with the kids, it's in a park with children's amusements and picnic tables and is close to a",
          "What a lovely find whilst away in Lille, A lovely small zoo in a beautiful park, the zoo will occupy you for a hr or so, it has a really lovely atmosphere , the animals seem happy and have plenty of space. You do not need a car as the transport system is excellent in Lille. A",

          "When you have some free time you can always have a walk in the zoo. Nice place but not lots of animals. Given the fact that it's for free and suitable for kids. I give it a 5 Snakes area is lovely !",
          "realy enjoyed the zoo some interesting animals ,monkeys, birds, Meercats ,and the roux panda bear was so cute , and set in the park with lots of places to picknic or buy from the restaurant /icecream stand ect",

          "we found this hard to find from the Rihour Metro its quite a walk. the zoo itself was clean and had small cages with birds and small mammals , and some Zebras in a compound it is set in a wooded area and a pleasant walk round . we were surprised to find that on a Tuesday with",

          "We spent a very enjoyable few hours at this little zoo in Lille. It was free to enter so we were not expecting very much... how wrong we were. Spotlessly clean and plenty of animals to see. I especially liked the Red panda, who popped out to say good morning as we arrived at",
          "I was suprised to see that this mid-size zoo is free of charge. It is located near the citadel and park a 15 minutes walk from vieux-lille. It is a midsize zoo - completely renewed in 05/2015, all facilities are to the newest standards. You can see that the animals love their",
          "This is a small free zoo very close to the centre of Lille. There are not many animals, but it is set within nice grounds and surrounded by a nice play park for kids to go to when you have (quickly) completed your zoo visit. The walk to the nearest Metro and centre of town is",
          "lovely little Zoo worth a visit as its FREE! We spent a long time watching the gibbons who were great fun.",
          "This zoo is aimed at kids who want to see animals, while this is fine in itself, we were swamped with strollers and parents who let their children roam free, which is really annoying. There are three 'areas', one with monkeys and birds, one with rhino's and other animals, and",
          "Zoo could be stretching it a bit with the main attractions being 2 rhinos and not much more big wild life apart from a few zebras a few monkeys a couple of hogs and cages of birds a couple of giant tortoise , set out to stay at a stretch a couple of hours tops . Worth seeing but",
          "I have been to bigger zoos and maybe some of the enclosures could be a bit better but for a free activity it is nice for an hour or two. There is not so much written in English but how many attractions in the UK have multi-lingual information - not so many in my experience and",
          "A small zoo /free entry / a bit like Noah's ark two of this two of that , though mainly birds / the zoo is in the middle of a park which is very popular with the locals on a warm Saturday afternoon when we went it was very busy . Easy walk from the town centre .",

          "This zoo is free and therefore we were not expecting too much, but we were surprised as actually the zoo is well kept and lots of different animals could be seen. It's a bit of a walk from the city center but worth it as you can spend few hours wondering around and check each",
          "The park is free to visit, which is great. The animals don't seem to have too much space to move around in, (or maybe other zoos we have visited have more) There isn't as many animals as they have advertised, but still quite good as it's free.",
          "It's free, what can you say... It's amazing that they still have big wildlife like elephants and zebra's without the entrance fee. Nice for an hour walkaround in a green environment.",
          "Amazingly delightful and free! We had a fun couple of hours strolling around the zoo and enjoying the antics and the sights. It was busy (school holidays) but not over-crowded. Thumbs up to Lille for providing a facility like this.",
          "It's a small little zoo. I found it entertaining even if we visited in the morning and it was very noisy because it was full of schoolchildren.",
          "I'm not a huge fan of captive animal exhibits but this is a well thought out small zoo with good sized enclosures and habitats for most of the animals. Most generous of the city of Lille to offer this as a free attraction which in my experience is unheard of. Good on you.",
          "The zoo is not that big but cages seems suitable for the animals inside, some animals, like monkeys, are not even in a cage but on an open-air island. You don't have a bad feeling when looking at them. A big part of them has even been captured in the city of Lille itself, lost",
          "It was initially a nice surprise to come across in Lille. However, There was seemed to be nobody around looking after the animals. The Rhino and Zebra enclosure was shockingly small. The Pelicans kept trying to get out bite the wire fence to get out. They had to share the small",
          "Very surprised to see a zoo of this size for FREE. Right alongside a children's parc, and rides that are open Wednesday and weekends. What a great find and a way to occupy the kids.",
          "Well, firstly it's free, which is amazing!! Whilst we were a group of 5 adults and no children with us, I am a grandmother and therefore I know for certain my 5 year old granddaughter would absolutely love this. Walking towards the entrance of the Zoo you have a mini railway",
          "A great little zoo on the outskirts of the city within walking distance from the city center. Well worth a visit for families, couples and solo travellers alike and can be done within a morning or an afternoon.",
          "We tried to visit this Zoo in 2014. Unfortunately the Tour de France put paid to that as we chose the day it visited Lille \ud83d\ude12. Not to be put off we decided to visit today. I had heard it was free, though the car parking for three hours was \u20ac2. Not enough to put me off \ud83d\ude03 For",

          "We spent an afternoon at the zoo, the nearby amusement park and the old citadel fortifications. The zoo is worth a visit, it's rather small but beautifully laid out. With (young) children, you can spend about 2 hours and then finish with the amusement park and playground next",
          "Was amazed to come across this free zoo, which has a small but select number of animals - loved the red panda who wandered around near us - bonus! Spotlessly clean, well cared for animals, small enough to go round in about an hour and a half and worth it.",
          "first time i went was amazed that there was all this on offer for free! a very good zoo...however if its a sunday afternoon and hot maybe do something else as the rest of lille will also be visoting the zoo!",
          "Considering it was free, the zoo was marvellous and worth a trip, with or without children! We went without. It was very busy with school children and under 5's too but it did not affect our enjoyment.",
          "A compact, but free zoo in the Citadel park, this had a surprising variety of animals and was very popular with school groups of small children on our visit. Information boards in French are easily read and have English names as well; the larger boards additionally having some",
          "We actually stumbled apon this zoo whilst exploring around Lille. I love animals but I'm not keen on zoos in the UK as I have experienced not cruelty but a sense of \"sadness\" from the animals (I know that seems silly, but I' sure other animal lovers will get my drift!). I was",
          "Beautiful small zoo near to Vauban Citadel in Lille. This zoo has free admission and is a well laid out zoo. A perfect place to have a leisurely stroll around or take children to. Well worth a visit or two",
          "You must come here. It's walking distance from the centre and most importantly it's free. It's really well maintained and the variety of animals is amazing - rhinos, monkeys, zebras, meerkats etc. The day we went there were about 1000 school children but it was fine. Plenty of",
          "Free zoo in the outskirts of the centre of Lille but only a 30 minute walk from the centre. We were pleasantly surprised by the variety of animals to see at the Zoo considering it is free entry. After finishing at the zoo, if you have young kids, there is a playground just",
          "This was a very good Quality free Zoo ,you dont see many of those. Well worth a visit and we are not even Zoo people.",
          "It was closed and the surrounding area was closed too. Felt very creepy like a closed down derelict fair ground! Very confusing as it said it was open!",
          "This is up there with the best zoos I've been to in the world. Two giant rhinos residing in Lille? Who knew? And a great selection of other rare animals too. A great way to while away a morning or afternoon. Could desperately do with a cafe though!",
          "Lovely play area for kids, small interesting zoo, and great park, plenty of parking, no toilets, that is a shame, two nice cafes",
          "This is the only free zoo I have ever visited, but it is delightful and very much worth the visit. Largest animals are rhinoceros and Zebra, some monkeys on islands within the zoo, and a variety of other small mammals and birds. Extremely clean and tidy, and within walking",
          "Stumbled Across this really lovely zoo whilst on a walk. Good variety of animals in a tranquil setting. Clean and pleasant",
          "This zoo is relatively small, but the diversity of the animals and their health is extraordinary for a zoo that is free if charge. Plus it's in the citadel of Lille that you must visit anyway in case you are in the city. So, don't miss the zoo once you are in Lille (you can do",
          "We were walking to the Citadel and came across the zoo! all four of us really enjoyed the experience and we are all over 55! It's not large... but very well set out, and clearly a lot of it has recently been redone. It was lovely to see all the apes having a great time",
          "The zoo had an interesting array of animals, including rhinos, monkeys and meerkats. The zoo has been recently renovated, so everything looked in great condition and well looked after. The animals also looked as though they were being kept in good condition, which is always a",
          "Fantastic FREE attraction with a range of animals. Not huge but what do you expect for free entry? Great kids area surrounding also. Not far to walk from main centre of Lille",
          "It's a very sweet place to visit during the stay in Lille and I'd highly recommend coming here. I always get a bit taken aback with zoos because I don't like seeing the wildlife away from their natural habitat, but when you see the keepers really looking after and taking",
          "Found by accident Parking 2\u20ac for 3 hours or 4\u20ac for the full day Very pleasant visit Great range of animals including ones we haven't seen in England or Scotland zoos Seen saw staff cleaning the enclosures which is also a rarity",
          "We hadn't planned to visit the zoo and whilst walking around the citadel ended up going in, mainly because it was free. Not sure if it will always be free, but worth paying for if they charge, great for small children, the zoo isn't huge which makes it good for children as they",
          "A great place to visit, really enjoyed watching the Red Pandas. I wasn't expecting it to be free, so it was a pleasant surprise. A downpour meant it was a fairly quick visit, we would have happily spent longer wandering around if it hadn't have rained.",
          "Closest I've ever been to Red Pandas, one of my favourite animals. It's pretty small but very well presented and excellent value for money.",
          "We planned this in our visit as you don't get many FREE zoo's. It was closed for refurbishment but was open the day we leave to come home so headed there first thing. We would have been happy to pay for the visit, you can tell it has had a major overhaul as everything is new.",
          "A stroll out of the the city center in the direction of the Vauban's fortifications brang me to the cute small zoo where I enjoyed watching the monkeys on their island, the brightly coloured birds in their cages, and some exotic mammals. A nice break in my cultural trip.",
          "Zoo was closed whilst we was there so just had a little stroll around the park - was a nice little stroll - would be a lot more to review on if the zoo etc had been open.",
          "The Zoo has free entry and is a very pleasant place to visit. Plenty of animals etc and their surroundings in the enclosures looked like they were well looked after. The park itself is very nice with some very pleasant walks.",
          "This place is huge and well maintained, you can definitely spend half a day here. I'm a photographer by hobby, So it's a treat for me.",
          "This zoo in Lille is closed at the moment unfortunately, however from various points on the outskirts, the public can see the animals, such as the zebras, rhinos, monkeys, pelicans and red pandas. As the zoo is free, the staff don't seem to mind you climbing the small hill",
          "Not too large, easy to find way around and you get to see a lot of animals and birds quite close. Near to river for a nice walk too. One of my favourite zoos and of course it is FREE entry",
          "A very lovely little zoo which is very professionally maintained. It is free to visit and being compact is convenient for young children.",
          "Nowadays it is not easy to do fun things for free, amusement parks, movies, etc, became pretty expensive, if you're a broke student or a family with kids, you have other priorities. But in Lille, you can visit the zoo for free! Yes! See red pandas, rhinoceros, zebras, alpaca,",

          "Despite its somewhat small size, this free zoo near the citadel in Lille, France was a good way to spend a couple hours with our kids. We visited Lille over Thanksgiving and hit the zoo at the afternoon feeding time. Al the animals were active and looked well cared for. The",
          "We combined this a visit to the Xmas market in mid December. After a brisk walk to the citadel which is only worth a look as you cannot get in as occupied by French forces and a soldier shouts at you if you step onto the bridge! Went to the zoo only to see a sign that it was",
          "The fact this zoo is free means it's great for a day out with family and friends. Only problem is it closes during Winter months",
          "Small zoo located by the Citadel. We visited in mid December and naturally several of the tropical animals were keeping warm indoors. There was also some renovation work taking place. Well worth a visit if you are nearby especially considering it's free.",
          "A small zoo situated on the outskirts of the citadel. Entrance is free - added bonus. There are a variety of animals ranging from birds to meerkats, giant turtles to rhinos.",
          "The zoo is free which is brilliant but it is closed between December and May 1st. There are quite a few animals including rhinos, zebra and giant tortoises. Well worth a visit for free if you're there at the right time.",
          "Free entrance, that's the best thing to mention. Can't be compared with other zoos I've already visited, where you have to pay. Worth the visit, you've seen al the animals in 45 minutes. Nice walk in combination with a walk around the Citadel...",

          "A great little zoo, inside the walls of the Citadel. Some really great animals too: rhino, zebra, mouse deer. Much better than many zoos that charge an entry price. Fantastic entertainment for the family - especially for free.",
          "just been, can not complain, its a very good zoo for something that is free, the rhino and zebra enclosures were empty but there was a sign explaining and I gather that this was either the time of year or maintenance work, this did not take away anything from the experience, the",
          "The zoo has a good mix of animals including a cool tropical house with various serpents. The top attraction are the rhinos. It's nicely located close to a playground and a small game park so perfect for a family outing.",
          "Love the zoo and park for kids to play in. The citadel is great fir walks or running. Even the little fun fair isnt too pricey. Little ones love it.",
          "Really surprised by how good this was , considering it is free entry ! Lots to see for young children and a good range of animals. Also great location as you can easily walk from Lille City Centre. Beware, however, it is not very well signposted so we ended up walking for miles",
          "Right inside the Citadel is the most adorable little FREE zoo. My husband and I enjoyed an hour-long visit on a Saturday morning when it seems the animals were just getting into the swing of things. Lots of raptors, 2 red pandas, monkeys, rhinos, and an indoor tropical exhibit",
          "For a free zoo I thought this was pretty good. They have a range of animals, ranging from zebra, birds, monkeys and rhinos. The zoo is not huge, but its a nice trip. I went on a Sunday when most things are closed, so was a good as gives you something to do.",
          "What more could you ask for. Loads of animals all kept in large cages or spaces for them move about. All very clean and well cared for. Superb little tots fun fair close by and a good cheap cafe too.",

          "I went on a Monday morning at 10 - wonderfully quiet and conducive to a good bit of photography! The zoo also seem to have a spooky ability to make groups of schoolchildren disappear - I saw a couple of groups appear and despite the zoo being very compact with no indoor areas,",
          "You don't get much for free, so when visiting the Citadel take a stroll around the zoo. Birds, monkeys, zebras, reptiles, rhinos and many more",

          "We were surprised at the types of animals in this free zoo near the citadel. Ranging from parrots to rhinos to a night exhibit. There are clean toilets inside zoo compound and a place to eat and drink just outside. Animals appeared to be well cared for, monkeys on island had",
          "Yes, the zoo is free of charge and it's a very calm and relaxing place to visit for a walk. It's captivating to watch the wide array of animals (mostly small to medium size). For that, I would say that this would be rated \"very good.\" However, it's the twenty-first century and",
          "Shady and quiet place with interesting mix of animals, who,all looked happy and well looked after. Can't believe that it is free of charge. Clean toilets too and snack food near entrance.",
          "Fantastic place. Gibbons were so funny and looked to be having a lot of fun playing. Snakes were horrible - as you'd expect. My highlight were the two wonderful tortoise. They were massive Definitely worth a visit and I'm still baffled that it's free. One word of caution",

          "It's a very nice zoo considering the free entry. There was a wide range of animals arranged in a very good way. I especially liked the tropic zone which is an independent building full of snakes tortoises and monkeys :) A very good way to spend your Sunday morning at Lille!",
          "They were showing off the whole time and when ever people copied their noise it made them make more noise love them!",
          "Surprised this was free, a good many animals. If you have choice avoid weekends when its very busy. No tea/coffee stop available nearby.",

          "Nice park and free zoo. Was a bit old looking. Most animals in good condition. Rhinos and zebras in large area. Take a picnic as cafe very busy and food limited. Bar and beer more of a priority, weird to see but common in lille. Good assortment of animals. Good for family with",
          "The zoo in Lille is free, which is a bonus! A visit here as you explore the park surrounding the Citadel is definitely worth it! Enjoyed seeing all the animals and I really thought the zoo was nicely layed out! Was a great way to spend a morning! I recommend a visit here!",
          "We went to this zoo before a day out in Lille and we were all really impressed. The animals are well Looked after, the zoo is clean and they even have rhinos! It's a shame they don't have a donations box as we would've put something in.. Definately worth a visit",
          "We were shocked it was free. The grounds are nice with a wall and castle area. There is also a play park for younger children right next to zoo.",
          "More of a zoo park than a zoo although they have two Rino anyway it is free. Great for children when we visited there was also a funfair nearby. Follow directions for the Citadel to locate.",
          "Well cared for animals and lots of interesting information about them. All of them in settings which seemed appropriate for the creature.",
          "The zoo is free and is situated in the Citadelle park that also is worth seeing. The zoo has a few animals, but is a nice walk around attached to seeing the Citadelle park.",
          "visited the park and zoo with family. Enjoyed a relaxing and interesting walk around the park and zoo. Good range of different animals on view. Only concern was that some animal enclosures looked a bit dilapidated and some of the animal enclosures look a little small",

          "I happen to be in to this zoo accidentally while I was searching for the citadel De Lile. You have to turn left from the statue near the citadel entrance and walk along. When I went there, I felt lucky that I have found it. Nice landscaping in and around the zoo. Above all",
          "When I read that the zoo was free admittance I was slightly concerned that the living conditions for the animals would be bad. Fortunately, this was not the case at all and the zoo is an excellent, budget friendly way to kill time. I expect this would be terrific with kids.",
          "The zoo is free. That's good, but it is lacking. The enclosures are well sized and the animals seem fairly happy but the premises, paved areas, and general design hasn't really been updated for the 1980s. All and all though we had an enjoyable day, and it was completely free.",
          "This zoo is a great place to visit and is completely free! Good size enclosures and animals are grouped in categories. Very interesting and would cost a fortune to visit with a family in the UK.",

          "A lovely little zoo, surprisingly free. The gibbons are very entertaining. Very popular with local families and schoolchildren. Well worth a visit. Go for a stroll in the park and round the Citadel at the same time.",

          "Its just not right that animals should be kept in such places. there are some big rhinos that should have been wondering free to fulfill there full potential. Most of the animals looked unhappy and listless.",

        "wiki": "Jean Joseph Marie Gabriel de Lattre de Tassigny, (French: [\u0292\u0251\u0303 d\u0259 lat\u0281 d\u0259 tasi\u0272i]; 2 February 1889 \u2013 11 January 1952) was a French army general during World War II and the First Indochina War. He was posthumously elevated to the dignity of Marshal of France.\nAs an officer during World War I, he fought in combat in various battles, including Verdun and was wounded five times, surviving the war with 8 citations, the Legion of Honour and the Military Cross. During the Interwar period, he took part in campaigns in Morocco where he was wounded in action again. He then pursued a career in the general staff headquarters and as a commander of a regiment.\nEarly in World War II, from May to June 1940, he was the youngest French general. He led his division during the Battle of France, at the battles of Rethel, Champagne-Ardenne, and Loire and until the Armistice of 22 June 1940. During the Vichy Regime, he remained in the Armistice Army, first in regional command posts, then as commander-in-chief of troops in Tunisia. After the disembarking of Allied forces in North Africa, on 11 November 1942, the Germans invaded the free zone; de Lattre, Commander of the 16th Military Division at Montpellier, refused the orders not to fight the Germans and was the only active general to order his troops to oppose the invaders. He was arrested but escaped and defected to Charles de Gaulle's Free France at the end of 1943. From 1943 to 1945 he was one of the senior leaders of the Liberation Army, commanding the forces which landed in the South of France on 15 August 1944, then fought up to the Rivers Rhine and Danube. He was the only French general of World War II to command large numbers of American troops, when the US XXI Corps was attached to his First Army during the battle of the Colmar Pocket. He was also the French representative at Berlin on 8 May 1945, with Eisenhower, Zhukov and Montgomery.\nCommander-in-Chief of French Forces in Germany in 1945, then Inspector General of the French Army, he was the vice-president of the Supreme War Council. From 1948 to 1950 he served as Commander-in-chief of the Western Union's ground forces. In 1951, he was the High Commissioner, commander-in-chief in Indochina and commander-in-chief of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps, winning several battles against the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. His only son was killed there, then illness forced him to return to Paris where he died of cancer in 1952. He was elevated to the dignity of Marshal of France posthumously in 1952 during his state funeral.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born in Mouilleron-en-Pareds, Vend\u00e9e, in the same village of World War I leader Georges Clemenceau, to an aristocratic family.From 1898 to 1904, he prepared for the \u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr, where he won a place in 1908. He was a cadet from 1909 to 1911 (his year was the Mauritanie promotion) and graduated 5th in his class. Then, he entered the Cavalry School at Saumur.\n\n\n== World War I ==\nIn 1912, he was a Sous-lieutenant assigned to the 12th Dragoon Regiment. He was wounded for the first time on 11 August 1914, by a shrapnel munition blast during a reconnaissance mission. On 14 September, he was wounded again by an Uhlan's lance while leading the charge of his dragoon troop. Weakened by his wound, he was saved from captivity by an officer of the 5th Hussard Regiment. He received the Legion of Honour on 20 December 1914.In 1915, he was promoted to Capitaine in the 93rd Infantry Division and fought in the Battle of Verdun for 16 months enduring 5 wounds, for which he received 8 citations and the Military Cross. Consequently, he was then assigned to the 2nd bureau of general staff headquarters of the 21st Infantry Division.\n\n\n== Interwar ==\nIn 1919, he was assigned to the Franco-American section at Bordeaux, then to the 49th Infantry Regiment at Bayonne. From 1921 to 1926, he was posted in Morocco and took part in various battles, where he was wounded, received three citations and was promoted to the rank of Chef de battaillon.From 1927 to 1929, he took further courses at the War College, where he was awarded the ceremonial honour of chief of the graduation class. In 1928, he was assigned to the 5th Infantry Regiment.In 1931, he was assigned to the bureau of the Chief of the Defence Staff. With the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, he was assigned to the general headquarters staff of G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Maxime Weygand. During this posting, he was tasked mainly with following foreign international policies, internal politics and the challenges of complex military budgets initiatives. With the retirement of Weygand who had reached mandatory retirement age, de Lattre was retained in the general headquarters staff of G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Alphonse Joseph Georges. In 1935, he was promoted to Colonel and appointed regimental commander of the 151st Infantry Regiment. Between 1937 and 1938, he studied courses at the Centre for Higher Military Studies (CHEM \u2013 an advanced staff college for generals). In 1938 he became Chief of Staff at the headquarters of the military governor of Strasbourg.\n\n\n== World War II ==\n\n\n=== Battle of France ===\n\nPromoted to Brigadier General on 22 March 1939, the youngest g\u00e9n\u00e9ral of France, he was subsequently assigned as Chief of Staff at general headquarters of the 5th Army, on 3 September 1939. In January 1940, he took command of the 14th Infantry Division engaging the enemy at Rethel where his division resisted for an entire month, three times repelling enemy assaults in front of the River Aisne. The division continued to fight at Champagne-Ardenne, at Mourmelon, then conducted delaying actions on the Marne, Yonne, Loire and Ni\u00e8vre. The division retained military cohesion and unity in the middle of chaos and debacles. A German officer likened its resistance to the Battle of Verdun.\n\n\n=== Army of Vichy ===\nFollowing the Armistice of 22 June 1940, he remained in the Army of Vichy and from July 1940 to September 1941, he was the adjutant to the g\u00e9n\u00e9ral commanding the 13th Military Division at Clermont-Ferrand and military commander of Puy-de-D\u00f4me. During these complex times, de Lattre played an important role in maintaining military cohesion, confidence and discipline. At this time he implemented government directives, believing that the regime of Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain was acting in defence of the national interest. Keen to encourage young men, he opened several field schools and military instruction centres \u2013 built up by Alsatians and soldiers \u2013 with the aim of producing capable officers and generals, trained in team work and able to spread their experience across the board of the armistice army. Promoted g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de division, he was the commander-in-chief of troops in the protectorate of Tunisia where he opened another military instruction centre. Following this four-month deployment from late September 1941 to 2 February 1942, he was recalled to France after a dispute with his superior Alphonse Juin and was reassigned. Returning to France de Lattre took charge of the 16th Military Division, based in Montpellier. Following the Allied landings in French North Africa on 8 November 1942, Germany occupied southern France and disbanded the Vichy Army. De Lattre was arrested and imprisoned for several months.\n\n\n=== Rallying to de Gaulle ===\nAfter managing to escape to London in September 1943, he went on to Algiers and joined the Free French. He was promoted to the rank of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e on 11 November 1943, by Charles de Gaulle. In December 1943, he commanded French Army B, which had been formed on 31 July 1943 as an amalgam of Free French Forces, the Army of Africa forces and volunteers. Once again he opened another cadre training centre in Algiers. De Lattre's army liberated the island of Elba on 17 and 19 June 1944.\n\n\n=== Operation Dragoon ===\nAs commander of Army B, he assisted in the preparations of Operation Dragoon which was to take place on 15 August, a number of weeks after Operation Overlord in Normandy. De Lattre's seven divisions (almost 256,000 men), along with three US divisions, Special Forces and Airborne Forces, made up General Alexander Patch's US 7th Army.\nWith the US VI and VII Corps, de Lattre and his commanders, mainly g\u00e9n\u00e9rals Antoine B\u00e9thouart, Edgard de Larminat (replaced on 31 August 1944, by Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert) disembarked in Provence on 15 August 1944 and took part with French Forces of the Interior, F.F.I in the battles of Toulon on 27 August and Marseille on 29 August. The liberation of these two sea ports greatly increased Allied capacity to land men and munitions, gaining them a decisive advantage on the Western Front.\nThe armies ascended up the Vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne and liberated Saint-\u00c9tienne on 2 September, Lyon on 3 September and M\u00e2con, Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, Beaune and Autun on 8 September.\nBy incorporating some of the French Forces of the Interior, de Lattre increased his effective strength from 137,000 men to almost 400,000. From September 1944, the French Liberation Army  was an amalgam of the Armistice Army, the Free French Forces and the French Forces of the Interior. This allowed Army B to be formed into the French 1st Army on 25 September 1944.\n\n\n=== Battle of the Bulge ===\nAfter it linked up with Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque's 2nd Armored Division coming from Normandy, to Montbard, Aisey-sur-Seine and Nord-sur-Seine, near Dijon on 12 September 1944, from the beginning of October the First Army took part in the Battle of the Vosges (1944\u20131945) with the US Seventh Army, took Montb\u00e9liard and H\u00e9ricourt (Haute-Sa\u00f4ne) on 17 November, then G\u00e9rardmer. They were the first Allied forces to reach the Rhine, on 19 November, then liberated Strasbourg on 23 November, Mulhouse on 24 November and Belfort on 25 November.The Battle of the Bulge (16 December 1944 \u2013 30 January 1945) briefly halted the Allied advance and for a while it seemed the Allies might have to abandon Alsace and Strasbourg. This was not a feasible option for de Gaulle, especially since Strasbourg had so recently been liberated. De Lattre had been under the command of General Jacob L. Devers's US 6th Army Group since 1944. In the meantime, on 31 December, the Germans counter-attacked again at Sarreguemines, Bitche and Colmar. The French First Army maintained defensive positions around Strasbourg despite heavy losses.Following his request for reinforcements on 19 January 1945, General Devers placed 4 US divisions of the XXI American Corps of General Frank W. Milburn under the orders of G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Lattre making of him the only French general of World War II to command United States units. De Lattre's army then participated on 20 January in the reduction of the Colmar Pocket. The city was liberated on 9 February 1945.The First Army crossed the Siegfried Line during the Battle of the Palatine on 19 March 1945. On 31 March 1945, the French Army crossed the Rhine at Speyer and Germersheim and advanced through the Black Forest and to Karlsruhe and Stuttgart while enduring heavy combat losses. The army of de Lattre advanced on Sigmaringen, taken by the French on 22 April, and then Ulm on the Danube on 24 April; it reached the Swiss border at Basel. The Rhin et Danube campaign ended in Austria after the army engaged the German 25th Army in Bregenz, Austria, and advanced through to Bludenz and Landeck.On 8 May 1945, de Lattre was in Berlin at the general headquarters staff of Marshal Zhukov.\n\n\n== Postwar ==\nFrom 31 March 1945, to 27 May 1947, de Lattre was the commander-in-chief of French Forces in Germany. On 17 June 1945, he welcomed the Normandie-Niemen squadron back to France. Between December 1945 and March 1947, he was Inspector General of the French Army and Chief of the Defence Staff, vice-president of the Supreme War Council while continuing to serve as Inspector-General of the Army and then Inspector General of the Armed Forces. From October 1948 to December 1950, with British Army Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, he was the first commander-in-chief of Western Union Defence Organisation ground forces in Western Europe. While in that post he bickered a great deal with Montgomery.\nFrom October to November 1947, he led a diplomatic and economic mission to South America where he held numerous talks with presidents from Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil and high-ranking ministers in the respective countries including French communities. He also took part in several related conferences.\n\n\n== Vietnam ==\nFrom 1950 to September 1951, he commanded French troops in Indochina during the First Indochina War. He was highly regarded by both his French subordinates and Vi\u1ec7t Minh adversaries and has been described as the \"Gallic version of [United States General Douglas] MacArthur \u2013 handsome, stylish, sometimes charming, yet egocentric to the point of megalomania\" and \"brilliant and vain\" and \"flamboyant\". After de Lattre's arrival in Vietnam, Vi\u1ec7t Minh General Giap proclaimed that his army would face \"an adversary worthy of its steel\".De Lattre's arrival raised the morale of French troops significantly and inspired his forces to inflict heavy defeats on the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. He won three major victories at V\u0129nh Y\u00ean, Mao Kh\u00e9 and Yen Cu Ha and defended successfully the north of the country against the Vi\u1ec7t Minh.\nAt the Battle of V\u0129nh Y\u00ean in January 1951, he defeated 2 Vi\u1ec7t Minh divisions, totalling 20,000 men under Giap's personal command, by taking charge of the outnumbered French forces, flying in reinforcements and mustering every available aircraft to bomb the massive Vi\u1ec7t Minh formation. Giap retreated after three fierce days of combat that killed 6,000 and wounded 8,000. De Lattre had anticipated Giap's attacks and had reinforced French defences with hundreds of cement blockhouses and new airfields.In March 1951, at the Battle of M\u1ea1o Kh\u00ea near the port of Haiphong, de Lattre again defeated Giap, who had underestimated de Lattre's army's ability to deploy naval guns and to move reinforcements aboard assault boats on deep estuaries and canals.However, de Lattre's only son, Bernard de Lattre de Tassigny, was killed in action during the war at the Battle for Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh, in late May 1951. He had obeyed his father's orders to hold the town at all costs against three Vi\u1ec7t Minh divisions. After three weeks of battle the French victory halted Giap's offensive in the Red River Delta.On 20 September 1951, de Lattre spoke at The Pentagon to request American aid and warned of the danger of the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia if northern Vietnam fell completely to the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. However, the United States was preoccupied with the Korean War. The US sent de Lattre some transport planes and trucks and other equipment: a \"significant contribution\" but \"scarcely enough to turn the tide for France\" in Vietnam.\n\n\n== Death ==\nIn 1951, illness forced de Lattre de Tassigny to return to Paris, where he later died of cancer. After his return to France, his successors, Raoul Salan and Henri Navarre, did not enjoy the same success as de Lattre.\n\n\n=== Marshal of France ===\nHe was elevated to the dignity of Marshal of France by French President Vincent Auriol, on the day of his funeral procession, on 15 January 1952 at Notre Dame de Paris, Les Invalides in presence of Charles de Gaulle, Dwight David Eisenhower and Bernard Montgomery.\nThe dignity of the Marshal of France had not been bestowed since it was given to the victors of World War I; after de Tassigny, three g\u00e9n\u00e9rals were raised to this dignity: Alphonse Juin (1888\u20131967) (to next of kin), Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque (1902\u20131947) (posthumous), Pierre K\u0153nig (1898\u20131970) (posthumous).\n\n\n=== State funeral ===\nHe was buried in a state funeral lasting five days in what Life magazine described as the \"biggest military funeral France had seen since the death of Marshal Foch in 1929\". His body was conveyed through the streets of Paris in a series of funeral processions, with the coffin lying in state at four separate locations: his home, the chapel at Les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe and before Notre Dame. Those marching in the funeral processions, following the gun carriage on which the coffin, covered with the French flag, was carried, included members of the French cabinet, judges, bishops and Western military leaders. The pallbearers included other Allied generals of World War II, such as Bernard Montgomery and Dwight Eisenhower.\nThe route included the Rue de Rivoli and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. The processions went from the Arc de Triomphe to Notre Dame and then from Notre Dame to Les Invalides. The stage of the journey from the Arc de Triomphe to Notre Dame took place in the evening, and cavalrymen from the Garde r\u00e9publicaine flanked the coffin on horseback bearing flaming torches.\nWalking behind the soldiers marching in the funeral processions was the lone figure of the Marshal's widow, Simonne de Lattre de Tassigny, who was dressed in black and prayed as she walked. Thousands of people lined the funeral route, forming crowds that were ten-deep. The pageantry included the tolling of bells, and flags being flown at half-mast.\nThe final stage of the funeral was a journey of 400 km to his birthplace of Mouilleron-en-Pareds, in western France. There his 97-year-old father, Roger de Lattre, aged and blind, ran his hands over the ceremonial accoutrements on the coffin, which included the posthumously-awarded marshal's baton and his son's k\u00e9pi. The family line became extinct with his death.\nThen, the coffin was lowered into the ground and the Marshal was laid to rest beside his only son, Bernard, who had been killed fighting under his father's command in Indochina about eight months earlier.\n\n\n== Military ranks ==\n\n\n== Honours and decorations ==\nDe Lattre was awarded the following awards and decorations:\n\n\n=== Citations ===\nFor his promotion to Grand Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honour:\n\nYoung leading division commander. In the midst of the hard fights from 14 May to 4 June 1940, was by his valor as much as by the wisdom of his dispositions, one of the main elements of the recovery of the entire army of the Aisne. Rethel, where six times it rejected the enemy in the Aisne, will be inscribed on the flags and standards of the 14th division as a name of glory and victory.\nFor his promotion to Knight of the National Order of the Legion of Honour:\n\nPerformed several perilous reconnaissance with remarkable audacity and safety. First wounded on 11 August of a shrapnel during a reconnaissance. Sent on 14 September in reconnaissance, was wounded with a spear and cleared enemy riders who surrounded him by killing two of his hand.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMany memorials have been erected to his memory, including a stele erected in the countryside near Manziat, l'Aigle.\nAn annual military service, involving serving soldiers, veteran associations, and ceremonial carriage of the Marshal's baton, takes place at the graves of his family in his birthplace, Mouilleron-en-Pareds.The 1951\u20131953 promotion of de l'\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr Co\u00ebtquidan bears his name.\nVarious institutions, squares, boulevards, avenues and streets bear his name:\n\nA garrison at Metz\nA public school at la Roche-sur-Yon\nA regional establishment for adapted formations at Opme (in Romagnat); an old cadres institution constructed by him from 1940 to 1941\nThe Sports Complex de Lattre at Aubagne\nA Metro station in Paris\nA bridge on the Rh\u00f4ne in Lyon\nA bridge on the Rh\u00f4ne at Vienne\nA bridge on the Seine between Croissy-sur-Seine and Bougival\nA bridge on the Seine at Melun\nA bridge on the Seine at Ch\u00e2tillon-sur-Seine\nA former bridge on the Han River in Da Nang (Tourane), Vietnam built in 1951\nA dock at Saint-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges, as well as Bourges, at Sedan, at Manosque et at S\u00e8te \na square in the 16th arrondissement of Paris; and squares in other cities and towns: Angers, Argentan, Auterive (Haute-Garonne), Besan\u00e7on, Bizanos, Brive-la-Gaillarde, Brest, Carcassonne, Cavanac, Ch\u00e2teaumeillant, Chevilly-Larue, Colmar, Courcelles-Chaussy, Cr\u00e9mieu, Esp\u00e9raza, Flers (Orne), Floing, Foulayronnes, Gagny, Gonesse, Hautmont, Jarny, La Crau, Lattes, Lavelanet, Le Thillot, Levallois-Perret, Les Herbiers, Libourne, Longwy, Maisons-Laffitte, Mantes-la-Jolie, Mollau, Montmorency (Val-d'Oise, Moulins, Mourenx, Nice, Pontarlier, Reims, Remiremont, Rethel, Roanne, Rouen, Saint-Andiol, Saint-Brevin-les-Pins, Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume, Sainte-Flaive-des-Loups, Sarlat-la-Can\u00e9da, Schiltigheim, S\u00e9lestat, Strasbourg, Thann, Trouville-sur-Mer, Vanves, V\u00e9traz-Monthoux, Violaines, Vitry-le-Fran\u00e7ois, Voiron\nSeveral boulevards: In the cities of Fontenay-le-Comte, Ch\u00e2teau-d'Olonne, Chaumont, Chen\u00f4ve, Dijon, \u00c9vry, Haguenau, Narbonne, Rodez, Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie, Suresnes\nSeveral avenues: In the cities of d'Aix-en-Provence, Amiens, Angoul\u00eame, Arras, Aulnay-sous-Bois, Avignon, Bois-Colombes, Boissy-Saint-L\u00e9ger, Bondy, Boulogne-Billancourt, Bordeaux, Cachan, Caen, Charenton-le-Pont, Choisy-le-Roi, Compi\u00e8gne, Coulommiers (Seine-et-Marne), Cr\u00e9teil, F\u00e9camp, Fontenay-sous-Bois, La Celle-Saint-Cloud, Le Pecq, Limoges, Marseille, Metz, Meudon, Moissac, Montereau-Fault-Yonne, Mont-Saint-Aignan, Montesson, Nancy, Niort, Orsay, Le Pont-de-Beauvoisin (Is\u00e8re), Pontoise, Provins, Saint-Cloud, Saint-Denis, Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, Sannois, Savigny-sur-Orge, Senlis, Tarascon, Thiais, Toulouse, Troyes, Villecresnes, Villiers-sur-Marne\nSeveral streets: at Alfortville, Blanquefort (Gironde)|Blanquefort, Calais, Cambrai, Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, Chambon-sur-Cisse, Chelles, Clermont-Ferrand, Clichy, Corbeil-Essonnes, Ermont, \u00c9lancourt, Le Chesnay, Le Havre, Laon, Lille, Louviers, Maisons-Alfort, Massy (Essonne), Nantes, Neuilly-sur-Marne, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Plivot, Pont-de-Vaux, Rueil-Malmaison, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve-des-Bois (Essonne), Sartrouville, Sens, Sucy-en-Brie, La Turballe, Versailles\nA grand alley at La Rochelle\nA roundabout at La Ciotat\nA square at Asni\u00e8res\nA military garrison at Novo Selo in Kosovo since 2002\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Publications ==\nHistoire de la Premi\u00e8re Arm\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise Rhin et Danube.

Lille has played its home matches since 2012 at Stade Pierre-Mauroy in nearby Villeneuve d'Ascq, which replaced the club's previous home of Stade Lille-Metropole in the same community.\nLille was founded as a result of a merger between Olympique Lillois and SC Fives. Both clubs were founding members of the French Division 1 and Lillois was the league's inaugural champions. Under the Lille emblem, the club has won three league titles (in 1946, 1954, and 2011) and six Coupe de France titles. Lille's most successful period was the decade from 1946 to 1956 when the team was led by managers George Berry and Andr\u00e9 Cheuva.Lille has a long-standing rivalry with nearby club RC Lens, with whom they contest the Derby du Nord. The club is owned and presided over by G\u00e9rard Lopez, an entrepreneur-investor and an active Luxembourgish-Spanish businessman who invests in the sports industry.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1944\u20131955: The first decade ===\n\nBefore the Second World War, the city of Lille had two clubs in Ligue 1; Olympique Lillois and Sporting Club Fivois. Weakened by the war, the two clubs decided to merge in the autumn of 1944, giving birth to Lille Olympique Sporting Club (LOSC). Within its first decade of existence, the new club won two league titles and reached the second place for four consecutive seasons. In the Coupe de France the club accumulated five wins in seven finals, including five successive finals. The final of the Latin Cup was also reached.\n\n\n=== 1956\u20131980: Lille loses its way ===\nLille were relegated for the first time in 1956. The club became a mid-table side and in the late 1960s, after a long period of anonymity, and weighed down by a lack of facilities and resources, Lille abandoned its professional status. It was feared that the club might disappear. However, some young leaders, such as Max Pommerolle, came and gave new impetus to the club. Nevertheless, the results remained erratic and the only titles that ignited the fans' passions were won in the Second Division.\n\n\n=== 1980\u20132000: Laying the foundations for future success ===\nIn July 1980, Lille was the first French club to opt for the status of a mixed economy company, of which the city of Lille became the majority shareholder. The team of presidents Amyot, Deschot and Dewailly all struggled to compete with the top teams in the country. Jacques Amyot's resignation in 1990 led to three more difficult years for the club which compromised its very existence. It took Bernard Lecomte's arrival in 1993 to set the club finances on the road to recovery. After a final relegation in 1997, the team trained by Bosnian coach Vahid Halilhod\u017ei\u0107 was soon promoted back to the elite, in the same year the French Football League was privatised.\n\n\n=== 2000\u2013present: A steady climb to the top ===\n\nIn just its first season back in the top flight 2000\u201301 French Division 1, Lille qualified for Europe for the first time in the club's history, booking its place in the 2001\u201302 Champions League. On the back of the club's new status, Lille entered into a decisive new era under the guidance of chairman and chief executive officer Michel Seydoux and coach Claude Puel. The club left the historical Stade Grimonprez-Jooris to join the Stadium Lille M\u00e9tropole and became a regular on the European scene. Amongst its most emphatic results was the 1\u20130 victory over Manchester United at the Stade de France in 2005, the 2\u20130 triumph over Milan in San Siro in 2006 and the 1\u20130 home win over Liverpool in 2010. A steady development off the pitch (inauguration of the Domaine de Luchin training complex in 2007, opening of the Grand Stade in 2012), coupled with the sporting progression under the expert hand of coach Rudi Garcia, took Lille back to the summit of the French game with the League and Cup double in 2011 (56 years after the club's last trophy). In 2012, LOSC confirmed its place at the top table of the domestic game with another qualification for Europe's most prestigious club competition, the Champions League in 2012\u201313. With the club finishing just outside the UCL places that season, Garcia left to join Roma, while former Montpellier coach Ren\u00e9 Girard was appointed the new Lille manager. After two years in charge of the club, Girard left his role as the head coach by mutual consent. He was joined by assistants Gerard Bernadet and Nicolas Girard in making the exit. In May 2015, the Ivory Coast national team head coach Herv\u00e9 Renard was appointed as the new manager.  On 11 November 2015, Renard was terminated as manager and was replaced by Frederic Antonetti. On 23 November 2016, a year after being appointed, Lille terminated Antonetti's contract with the club lying second last in the table. In March 2017, Lille appointed Marcelo Bielsa as new manager of the club. In November 2017, Bielsa was suspended by Lille following an unauthorized trip to Chile with the club lying second from bottom on the table again and only managing 3 wins from the first 14 games of the season.On 23 December 2017, Bielsa was terminated by Lille and replaced with former Saint-Etienne manager Christophe Galtier. After a difficult 2017\u20132018 season, Lille managed to avoid relegation to Ligue 2 by defeating Toulouse 3\u20132 in the second last game of the campaign.In the 2018\u201319 Ligue 1 season, Lille secured the second place to qualify for the 2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League group stage, they returned to the competition after a seven-year absence.\n\n\n== Stadiums ==\n\nStade Pierre-Mauroy was inaugurated in 2012. Originally named the Centre Olympique de Lille Est, the club's sporting venue is spread over five hectares and features three natural grass football pitches and one synthetic pitch, as well as a number of buildings including a medical centre and gymnasium. These attributes had seen the club house part of the LOSC Youth Academy here, before all the club's operations were moved to the Domaine de Luchin in Camphin-en-P\u00e9.\n\n\n== Club rivalries ==\n\nThe Derby du Nord is a football match contested between Lille and RC Lens. The derby name refers only to their geographical location in France since Lille is the only club of the two actually situated in the department of Nord. Lens are situated in the western department of Pas-de-Calais. The name can also refer to matches involving Lille and Valenciennes as both clubs are located within Nord, however, the match historically refers to matches involving Lille and Lens. As a result, the Lille\u2013Valenciennes match is sometimes referred to as Le Petit Derby du Nord. The two clubs first met in 1937 when Lille were playing under the Olympique Lillois emblem. Due to each club's close proximity towards each other being separated by only 40 kilometres (25 mi) and sociological differences between each club's supporters, a fierce rivalry developed. The Derby du Nord is underpinned by social and economic differences, since the city of Lens is known as an old, working-class, industrial city and Lille as a middle-class, modern, internationally oriented one. Nowadays the matches, which can spark intense feelings on both sides, have gained prominence as they may determine berths in continental competitions.\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== Current squad ===\nAs of 4 September 2020Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Rudi Garcia, who played for Lille from 1980 to 1988, replaced Claude Puel at the beginning of the 2008 season. Puel had been with Lille since 2002. Thanks to his successes with the club, Puel had been approached by Portuguese club Porto to replace Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and league rivals Lyon to replace Alain Perrin; he finally decided to join Lyon after six seasons at the club.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Domestic ===\nLigue 1\nChampions (3): 1945\u201346, 1953\u201354, 2010\u201311\nRunners-up (6): 1947\u201348, 1948\u201349, 1949\u201350, 1950\u201351, 2004\u201305, 2018\u201319\nLigue 2\nChampions (4): 1963\u201364, 1973\u201374, 1977\u201378, 1999\u20132000\nCoupe de France\nChampions (6): 1945\u201346, 1946\u201347, 1947\u201348, 1952\u201353, 1954\u201355, 2010\u201311\nRunners-up (2): 1944\u201345, 1948\u201349\nCoupe de la Ligue\nRunners-up (1): 2015\u201316\nCoupe Gambardella\nChampions (1): 1960\nRunners-up (2): 1955, 2000\nCoupe Charles Drago\nRunners-up (2): 1954, 1956\n\n\n=== Europe ===\nUEFA Intertoto Cup\nWinner (1): 2004\nLatin Cup\nRunners-up (1): 1951\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "The old part of Lille is quite well preserved, at least meaning, being spared of 1960-1980 buildings that spoil large parts of the rest of the town. And, it is not too touristy. The neo-gothic cathedral, at least on the outside is nothing to look at, but the inside (certainly",
          "On first vision of Lille we were not impressed, it's a real mixture of old, 70/80 and new architecture to get the full beauty of the place you have to dig into the little cranny holes of the town, old churches and building are the key features, there is a similarity to Bruges in",
          "I went to Lille a couple of months back with my cousin we had driven over there and it wasn't to far from Calais. I loved the town and the architecture many different shops and restaurants to choose from and much to see",

          "Visiting the old town we did see some very beautiful architecture as we wandered around. It is such a shame the residents do not look after their buildings in the same way as in other cities we visited in Belgium. Most of the buildings were very grubby and unloved. Interestingly",
          "This is a beautiful small city and is ideal for a short break. We stayed 2 nights which was long enough to see many of its delightful flemish buildings and sample some tasty french food and wine in the fabulous restaurants it has to offer. What is more its only 1.5 hour journey",
          "Spent a good few hours exploring, lots of shopping and museums to find. Worth the visit as we\u2019re not sure what to expect from Lille.",
          "If you take one of the \"navettes\", at public transport prices, this gives you a better and cheaper view of the old city (though minus the commentary of course) then the official tourist bus tour. You can get off whenever you spot an interesting building, and there are plenty of",
          "The old part of the city is full of interesting places and buildings. If you use the city tour bus to begin with, you will have a good orientation of what to see. People-watching is certainly a good way to pass time in these busy streets and squares.",

        "wiki": "Lille Cathedral, the Basilica of Notre Dame de la Treille (French: Basilique-cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame-de-la-Treille de Lille), is a Roman Catholic church and basilica located in Lille, France. It is the cathedral church of the Archdiocese of Lille. An example of Gothic Revival architecture, the cathedral is considered a national monument.\nThe church was built in honor of the Virgin Mary and takes its name from a 12th-century statue of the saint that has miraculous properties ascribed to it. The project of its construction, which was carried out by a commission that brought together representatives of the clergy and lay members of the upper middle class such as fr:Charles Kolb-Bernard, had a twofold objective. The first was to rebuild a large church in the heart of the city, after the destruction of the Collegiate Church of St. Peter during the French Revolution, which had housed the statue of Our Lady of the Treille for more than six hundred years. The second was to establish an episcopal see in Lille, which then belonged to the Archdiocese of Cambrai. This creation was considered essential to establish the city's status as a religious capital and to serve the growing population during the period of the Industrial Revolution. The building was therefore designated from the outset to be a future cathedral.\nIts construction, which spanned nearly a hundred and fifty years, began in 1854 with the laying of a foundation stone and the launch of an international competition for the design of a building inspired by the \"Gothic style of the first half of the 13th century\". Of the 41 submissions made, the first two prizes were awarded to English projects. However, the idea of entrusting the construction of a church in honor of the Virgin to foreign architects of an Anglican confession raised objections. Therefore, the realization of the project fell into the hands of Lille architect Charles Leroy. The construction of the church faced many difficulties, especially to raise the necessary funds for the continuation of the work. The cathedral was built in stages under the direction of several generations of architects from 1856 to 1975. It was completed in 1999 by the installation of a modern facade, with part of the initial program having been abandoned.\nOriginally a simple church, it was given the title of minor basilica by Pope Pius X in 1904. In 1913, the Archdiocese of Cambrai was split to create the diocese of Lille, with the basilica serving as its new cathedral. In 2008, following the reorganization of the ecclesiastical provinces of France, the diocese of Lille was elevated to the status of metropolis and the cathedral became a metropolitan cathedral, seat of the Archbishop of Lille.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Our Lady of the Treille ===\nThe cathedral owes its name to a statue of the Virgin Mary, known as Our Lady of the Treille, which was housed at the Collegiate Church of St. Peter from the beginning of the 13th century and has since been the object of devotion and veneration. The statue is described by Charles Bernard, parish priest of the Church of St. Catherine, as a statue of stone \"a little more than two and a half feet high; she has a scepter in her right hand, and from her left she supports the baby Jesus on her knees.\" He mentions a trellis of gilded wood surrounding the statue and its pedestal, and specifies that the old trellis made of gilded iron was lost in 1792 during the destruction of the Collegiate Church of St. Peter. He speculates that this trellis is what gave the statue its name, although it is more likely that the name came from Treola, a place existing in the 9th century in what is now Lille.Three series of miraculous events are associated with the statue, occurring in 1254, from 1519 to 1527, and from 1634 to 1638. The miracle of 1254 was the healing of the patients who resorted to her intercession. The miracles in the 16th century were varied and included deliverance from demonic possession, hernias, blindness, paralysis and plague. In 1254, a confraternity of Our Lady of the Treille was canonically established by Pope Alexander IV, and since 1259, an annual procession in honor of Our Lady of the Treille was held, a practice which continued until the French Revolution. In 1634, Jean Le Vasseur, mayor of Lille, consecrated the city to Our Lady of the Treille. In 1667, Louis XIV, who had just taken Flanders, took an oath to respect the freedoms of Lille before the statue.After the destruction of the Collegiate Church of St. Peter, which had been badly damaged during the Austrian siege of 1792 before being demolished in the French Revolution, the statue largely fell into oblivion. It was bought by a sexton, Alain Gambier, who placed it in the Church of St. Catherine, where it remained between 1797 and 1802. It was not until 1842 that Charles Bernard, parish priest of the Church of St. Catherine, restored the cult of Our Lady of the Treille and tried to strengthen it again: he instituted the month of Mary, patron saint of Lille, and had the statue placed in the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin of St. Catherine's Church. The celebration in great pomp of the secular jubilee of the first miracles of Our Lady of the Treille, in 1854 constituted a decisive step in this restoration work. The restoration project is also believed to have been marked by providence, due to the unexpected acquisition of the land on which the new church in honor of the Lady of the Treille would be built, making it possible to lay the church's foundation stone before the end of the jubilee celebration.\n\n\n=== The Creation of the Diocese ===\nIn the middle of the 19th Century, in spite of the size of the town and the growing population of the surrounding region, Lille did not have its own bishop, but belonged to the Archdiocese of Cambrai. While proposals to create a new diocese for Lille and its surrounds had been made in the past, they had not been successful. In 1852, however, the Lille deputy Charles Kolb-Bernard recommended the creation of a new diocse, which would cover the districts of Lille, Dunkirk, and Hazebrouck, in a public report entitled Int\u00e9r\u00eats communaux de la ville de Lille. An anti-Republican Legitimist and a spokeperson for the protectionist upper bourgeoisie, Kolb-Bernard was dedicated to the moralisation of the working class at a time when social tensions were exacerbated by mass immigration from Belgium and the impoverishment of large parts of the population due to industrialisation; he saw the creation of a new bishopric as a means to \"re-Christianise\" a population largely denied the spiritual relief of religion. The cause was likewise taken up by the lawyer Armand Prat in his 1856 memoir, Thoughts on the Creation of a Bishopric of Lille.\nThe creation of the new bishopric also involved financial and linguistic considerations. The Diocese of Cambrai covered, in effect, two distinct linguistic areas, with Flemish the majority language in the north-west, due in part to the heavy immigration from nearby Belgium. Indeed, a few decades later in 1896, a report found that 25% of the residents of Lille did not hold French citizenship, and of these more than 98% were Belgium, mainly from Flemish-speaking Flanders. From the 1870s, the Flemish represented two fifths of the population of Wazemmes and half of the population of districts such as Moulins and Fives, and the town of Roubaix. From a financial perspective, the growing population was anticipated to provide a substantial income to a new diocese, while the expenses of the creation would fall primarily on the state.\n\n\n=== The Construction of a Cathedral ===\nIn early 1853, Charles Kolb-Bernard and his cousin, Charles Bernard, vicar general at Cambrai, created a commission with the object of building a magnificent church in honour of Our Lady of the Treille. The commission brought together representatives of the clergy and the industrial bourgeoisie of Lille, who strongly supported the creation of a new Bishopric, and soon began to think of the planned church as a future cathedral. Land in the heart of Old Lille, the site of the ancient, recently-levelled castle mound, was purchased for a sum of 223,000 francs.An international competition was launched in 1854 for the design of the church, which was to be inspired by the Gothic style of the early 13th century, and the first stone was laid on the first of July 1854 by the Archbishop of Cambrai, in the course of the celebration of the feast of Our Lady of Treille, drawing large crowds including the mayor and ten bishops. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBernard, Charles-Joseph (1843).

          "Well worth a visit if you are ever visiting Lille. It has been beautifully restored and the interior of the church is warm and welcoming which is so difficult in large open spaces. Some lovely stained glass windows to see. The church was a little difficult to find but well",
          "Beautiful cathedral with breathtaking stain glass windows. Highly recommended to visit early in the morning or late in the afternoon!",
          "Come and see this grey stone 19th century gothic edifice when they finish cleaning it. They've only just started and the clean bits look constructed out of plasterboard on a 1930s set for the Emerald City on the MGM lot. There's a 20th century facade tacked on, this time from",
          "This cathedral was reported as damaged during warfare and instead of a sympathetic restoration there is a stark modernist facade which leaves the visitor in no doubt as to the statement being made regarding moving on",
          "The modern entrance looks a bit strange from the outside but, once you're inside it's beautiful, particularly the stained glass windows above the old doors. The old part (towards the back) is also lovely. The choral music helped build the ambiance and make our visit very",
          "The cathedral is a odd mix of old and new architecture but somehow it works well. An oasis of peace & calm away from the busy Christmas markets. Lots of opportunities to light a candle and reflect or say a prayer. As we were wandering around one of the priests started to chat",
          "This cathedral is a lovely place to visit and a welcome calming experence away from the hustle and bustle of the City. Beautiful stained glass windows and lovely architecture with the quirky mix of old and new. At Christmas there is a nativity scene and you are invited to write",
          "If you're looking for old, original architecture - this isn't it. The cathedral is an odd mix of the old (towards the back), and then abruptly very new and modern in the front. Also did not appreciate getting stopped by a panhandler inside - perfectly polite and will back off if",
          "I\u2019ve seen more cathedrals that I can count and I work in finance so that\u2019s saying something lol. But few if any are as wonderful as this one in Lille. The exterior design may not be to everyone\u2019s liking but once inside it is positively stunning. They\u2019ve also done a world class",
          "Such a delight to see a cathedral that has kept the old part of the building but has a new section also.",
          "On first sight from the outside this building does not really look very inviting or interesting but when you go inside it is very surpising and has many different features, both old and new. The transept is very spacious and there are some interesting art works in the chapels",
          "We stumbled across this and then we were taken to it on our walking tour. Such an interesting story and from the outside when you go inside not quite what you would expect. The glass windows form inside are beautiful.",
          "Enter from one end and exit from the other for the contrast- going forward or back in time. The older part of the church with its beautiful mosaics though, gets my vote. Look for St Anne\u2019s Chapel with some lovely mosaics of different occupations.",
          "From the outside you are tested by the very new architecture of the frontage. Inside is a more traditional gothic looking cathedral. However, be impressed by the affect of light streaming through the unique frontage. Once again, it really pays to take time to do some research",
          "This odd west face looks quite odd. Originally I thought it must have been a replacement after war damage, but actually it was the final part - in the late 20th century - of a long-running building project! Much more interesting from the inside, where the central panels are",
          "This is a grand old cathedral with a new front, including doors. It\u2019s spectacular without the splash of colour one gets in some cathedrals. Well worth a visit. Look at all the figures on the doors.",
          "We visited here when in Lille recently with our granddaughter. She lives nearby and considers this \"her\" cathedral. The inside story is that it was planned to have a more traditional front with 2 grand towers but the builders were running low on funds and decided to build the",

          "The cathedral opens by 10.30. Since I visited the cathedral when it had just opened up for the day, it was quite peaceful. Situated amidst a quiet locality, this church is quite a site. It also has a souvenir shop adjacent to the main building with an interesting collection of",

          "This is a cathedral started in the 19th century and finished more recently. It is extremely large and well situated. It has an extremely interesting circular wind and is certainly worth a visit. However, I did not warm to it but felt this was a problem with me rather than",
          "Great place to visit. This is a cathedral that was started in the 19th Century and finished later on aso has some peculiar featured. Amazing portuguese marble stone facade, a must see when in Lille",
          "This XIX century cathedral is a piece of art with many altars, a stain glass windows, sculptures, paintings. It is a mix of many styles. The most beautiful is Our Lady of the vine chapel with the Blessed Sacrament. It is a worth visit this church!",
          "Strange exterior but inside is truly beautiful. Need time to thoroughly take in all the contents. Superb colour combinations and mixtures of materials in statues and pictures.",
          "We visited with our young french friends and my mate told me he didn\u2019t like what they had done to the front of the cathedral. When we looked at it from the outside I could see what he meant, it looks a little out of place a bit too modern. However, it really works from the",
          "A striking cathedral which is kind of a surreal mixture of old Gothic and modern designs. The architecture is very much like 16th Century cathedrals but with elements from the 20th Century. Not everyone will like it, but I found it fascinating.",
          "Kind of weird looking on the outside then standard cathedral on the inside. Nice choral music playing in the background",
          "I find the building strange and cold from the outside, as well as some part inside, but that is what makes it attractive. The mix between modern and tradition is not to be seen very often in the region. On the side of the cathedral you may see skaters from the city practicing",
          "From the outside it doesn't look like much but it is well worth stepping inside as it is stunning. It's a very large cathedral with beautiful organ pipes and gold trimming. A little difficult to find - we found it by chance in the end but worth looking for.",
          "I don't really know where to begin? The front built 30 years ago? The 200 year old Back? The pretty cottages? The pointless tower? The art exhibitions in the crypt? or the modern stain glass window? Odd.",

          "In facts not really worth the detour, but since Lille is a small city you will certainly pass by and it will not cost you much effort to have a look !",
          "Build between the late 19th and early 21st century, it was supposed to be one of the grandest cathedrals in France. However, currently, it even lacks towers. Although not completed to the original design, it is a large cathedral, with minimal interior decorations. The front was",
          "Approaching the Cathedral through the streets of Old Lille, my heart sank - the front facade would not look out of place on an industrial estate...however... As you explore this unusual place of worship it does cast a spell, ultimately I was smitten by the unique mix of 1990s",
          "Well worth a visit. Really nice modern finish to a traditional building and stunning rose window. One of the highlights of our visit to Lille.",
          "On first impressions this building looks a bad hodge podge of styles from the outside. The cladding on the front is reminiscent of a shopping centre and looks most odd against the OTT metal worked entrance doors. Inside though it is a lovely space and has amazing acoustics.",
          "This cathedral is spectacular inside as well as out and is notmtoo far from the main square. It was free to enter and would recommend looking inside",
          "Well worth a visit but I think is closed on mondays...at least it was when we first went....beautiful inside with fabulous paintings with the stations of the cross. Perfect mix between old and new. Amazing ceiling and has many little alcove churches inside with a lot of history.",
          "A nice church with a mix of old and new. Check when open as our guide book said they were open in the morning but they did not open until 12pm.",
          "A must see when visiting Lille. We visited early on a Saturday, it was very peaceful & the stained glass windows are amazing.",
          "This cathedral is lovely. The artwork in the various chapels is beautiful, and the mosaics on the walls and floors are very cool. I liked the holy water trough with carved animal feet. I also thought it was nice that the cathedral really felt like part of the community --",
          "Well worth a visit as a large cathedral with some nice stained glass. Historical information is mostly in French, but some is in multiple languages.",
          "this 'recently completed' cathedral offers a really spacious place for worshippers .. the frontal facade built up of marble plates (held by a steel framework) is translucent and also includes nicely designed/sculptured doors and a stained glass window (designed by Kijno)",
          "Really worth a visit, old with a new front of Portuguese marble that lets in light the cables on the front are meant to be there. The mosaics on the floor are truly breathtaking.",
          "Always enjoyed visiting cathedrals for a peaceful change to hectic day, especially on a rainy day. Well worth a visit!",
          "I am a bit of a traditionalist, so I had to look past all the modern features and art to find the beauty. The stained glass is spectacular! There was music playing that made the experience wonderful.",
          "The Cathedral is a creation of the late 19th Century but must be on the site of a previous church' cathedral. It is gothic in style with soaring arches and a feeling of space. One feature was the west end of the building which is clad in a marvellous amber, translucent marble.",
          "Must see the south facing window when the light shines through it is amazing it makes the rest of the Cathedrale rather dark.",
          "From the outside not so nice, grey in contrast with the mostly 3 colored old houses in the city. Impressive however is the new entrance. 110 marble plates allow sunlight to pass trough although they are 2.8cm thick. Nice effect, at night, light from inside can be seen standing",
          "Relatively speaking, it's not a very old church. The stained window is lovely. Toward the back there are several stunning chapels, including one to Joan of Arc. The docents (if that's the right word) are very knowledgeable and helpful if you want a little more information",
          "The outside of this church looks interesting and when you go inside and look back at the inside of the frontage, you realise how special it is - semi translucent marble gives an amazing effect on the modern front, meanwhile the inside is an expansive neo gothic church. Beautiful",
          "Small for a cathedral and relatively modern. Enjoyed the small saints chapels and stained glass. Underwhelming from outside but fairly impressive inside. Colder inside than out too, on the day we visited! Walk around the back to see the incredibly tall and thin houses and to cut",
          "We have not seen anything like this before. The traditional stained glass windows were beautiful but the 'new' marble edifice was amazing - even with low later afternoon winter sun shining through the this panels. Excellent visit, we will come again and bring friends - maybe",
          "It is the saddest church I have ever come across. It does not look like a cathedral. There are many beautiful churches in Lille, could one of them actually become \"the\" cathedral? The marble panel looks atrocious from outside and so odd from inside. Like an old bathrooms'",
          "One of the few places in Lille open on a Monday morning; very interesting history in terms of how it was built over the last 100+ years. Worth a visit.",
          "Very unusual, modern cathedral. We are used to tour cathedrals and churches but this one was nothing what we expected. It was a very pleasant surprise.",
          "Known as Notre dame de la Treille The cathedral was built around the 1800s to honor the Virgin Mary. It houses the statue of the Virgin known for her miracles. The outside is quite massive, high steps lead you to its doors. I actually went there to enjoy the sunshine sitting on",
          "The construction of this modern neo-gothic cathedral started in 1854 and not finished until 1997. It faced financial troubles during the whole construction and the construction of the two bell towers was officially abandoned in 1991. A model inside shows the original design. The",
          "WOW . I`ve seen a few church`s in my time but this delight is up there with the best of them .Situated 7 mins walk North of Grand Place , This cathedral ( and it`s free ) is stunning , Once inside you feel so humble . As you enter look for the model of the cathedral in it`s",
          "Though not an especially religious person, I usually make a point to visit the local churches/cathedrals in my travels. The cathedral in Lille is less magnificent than others I've visited, but it is still worth the time to visit.",
          "The cathedral is tucked away along a side street in the old town, however it is definitely worth a visit while there. It is free to enter and walk around at will, spacious and peaceful inside (though somewhat cold in the winter), with background music playing. There are useful",
          "With a modern front door and translucent wall of marble, this 'new' cathedral is a triumph of architecture and its small chapels are perfectly formed and has a great little shop selling trappist monks wares including soaps and perfumes",
          "Not what I expected. Inside the the Gothic style with stained glass windows is a sharp contrast to the contemporary design used to form the front section and main entrance facard. This was, I understand due to the economics of construction, forcing the end of the first phase of",
          "Work stopped on this building when money ran out. Re-started some decades later so a massive contradiction of styles. I really didn't rate the modern aspect but maybe others would.",
          "I love a good cathedral - but this one isn't that great. Built (or half-built) in the second half of the 19th century, it doesn't have the feel of a medieval cathedral. The exterior main facade was not completed until the 1990s and is positively ugly. Due to its relatively short",
          "The Cathedral is worth a quick call but not particularly special in any way except for the ugly way in which the west end is currently finished off. This wall is interesting from the inside but very ugly from the courtyard outside. I'd visit only in passing by",
          "It's not much to look at from the font of the cathedral but the gargoyles around the back are spectacular. Inside the artwork and stained glass windows make this a very peaceful place to visit.",
          "We stayed for over an hour admiring the stained glass windows, the statues and architecture. The building was constructed over decades completed finally in 1999. A limitless brochure available in English was inside and described the incredible story of this cathedral.",
          "Having visited pretty much all the great Gothic and Romanesque Cathedrals of France I have say I wasn't overly taken with Lille's offering; perhaps because it was only started in 1854 and finished as recently as 1999. While if has a number of clearly Gothic features (and some",
          "You must first take in all the outside, and then go inside to be even more surprised. The outside looks like it is unfinished, however once inside it is the perfect jewel.",
          "Striking exterior as it looks fairly contemporary and sleek. Inside the high ceilings, stained glass and artworks are striking and grand. A quiet and massive space. Behind the entrance is a beautiful wall of textured glass, which looks beautiful with the sun shining through.",
          "Pretty average cathedral. Nice exterior but quite simple inside. Free entry so worth going in if you need to kill some time.",
          "The church is located just on the edge of the old town and is only a short walk from the main centre of the city. The most impressive feature (for me) is seen when you enter and turn back to see the door that you used....and you are then struck by the enormous and beautiful",
          "The front facade of the cathedral make you think is under refurbishment or is unfinished as its very modern compare with the sides. Very nice inside, modern and classic at the same time, inviting to walk around.",
          "a Church where old meets new and was very impressed with the stained class entrance Worth the visit even when its raining",
          "The first glimpse we got was quite a surprise, then we realised it is still under construction. An interesting experience as most cathedrals are fairly historic, but this is modern by comparison. Amazing masonry within, and interesting modern artwork on display adding quite a",
          "This is my second time back to the Notre Dame de la Treille. Early last year, when I visited, I found it to be a beautiful place. There was actually still scaffolding on part of the exterior. This year, when I came back I saw that they had \"finished\" upgrading and modernizing",
          "Not as was expected, this cathedral offered its own unique characteristics in the form of various artistic features. From the outside it doesn't hit the wow factor, but when you walk through the unique doors you are thrown by the abundance of unique sites within the",
          "Who would have thought? A cathedral designed using modern artistic techniques. Well, I guess, only in France. Not my thing though.",
          "Do not be put off by the modern exterior. This is a beautiful place. Atmospheric and full of wonderful stained glass.",
          "This cathedral is tucked away in a smallish square close to the centre of Lille. We sat outside in a cafe opposite the cathedral before we entered and had some issues with persistent begging. This continued around the entrance to the cathedral. The cathedral was started in the",
          "Very interesting church with a huge history, Actually it is unfinished from the early original plans, It has undergone several renewed efforts with multiple designs. If you go inside in the afternoon, the sunlight streaming thru the front is beautiful!",
          "The history of this structure is not prominently displayed in English so I'm not sure of its place in the overall religious hierarchy, but the building is striking. The open plan makes me think it's ancient, the arches wonderful, the stained glass striking. Its location quite",
          "The first thing that strikes you about this building is the extremely modern looking entrance and facade above it. Once inside the peace and tranquillity that you feel is quite remarkable; during my visit there the peace was only broken by the announcement of and the performance",
          "Wonderful on the inside, one of the nicest French Cathedrals I have been in.the facade on the outside ,is quite bland, but once inside ,the outside lights up with a rose like marble that is fascinating .",
          "Loved lille but even in the churches you have people sitting in the door begging. They harass you as u walk around. As I'm travelling alone I did not feel safe. A crowd of them would come up and beg for money. I had four men at one time.",
          "Haven't really knew about this place for nearly a year but once I visited, I would always like to come back here! Beautiful artwork",
          "In the old part of Lille but not very far from main square, beautiful place to visit, lovely little streets you go down trying to find it but not along walk",
          "This is a lovely cathedral with an incredible mixture of styles within the building. And everything sits comfortably with its neighbour. Bold statements are made, but things seem to blend in well together.",
          "It was interesting to see mixture of styles used outside, but also it looks really nice on the inside. Worth visiting.",
          "Probably this was my favorite part of my one-day trip in Lille. It is a really interesting church, you defenetaily should see to inside of it. From outside it is kind of \"not a big deal\", but there is a square with place to sit, and on a sunny day there a lot (but not too much)",
          "The interior of this Notre Dame was beautiful and authentic. It was not so big but still good to have a visit for 15 to 30 minutes.",
          "Really worth the visit. I couldnt visit it inside, since there was a wedding going on. But even from outsite you can have a nice view of it.",
          "A lovely visit to this interesting cathedral which was not teeming with tourists which added to the ambience of the place.",
          "This was a surprise as the outside was very modern and inside a mixture of old and new. Well worth the visit. You can light a candle and make a small donation. There was also a pretty nativity scene. It's lovely to have a look around - plenty to look at and get away from the",
          "When being in Lille, you have to got to that cathedral. You do not need to stay that long there (unless your are really interested), but the mixture of art (Gothic and modern) is amazing. One minor remark, all information boards are in available in French language.",
          "the cathedral was beautiful the organ impressive with a double pipe feature there was an opportunity to pray and reflect and write a message or light a candle. I prayed for a young boy recently taken by God to be a bright star. The art was varied and well lit and i was moved by",
          "This is not an iconic French cathedral; yet none the less impressive for that. A statue of the Virgin Mary surrounded by an iron grille had stood on the site, in the heart of Lille, since the 13th century. In the religous fervour of the mid-nineteenth it was decided to build an",
          "If you are visiting Lille, then don't miss this Cathedral - it has a very unusual combination of old and contemporary style.",
          "You can find this cathedral in the centre of town and it's worth a visit: a nice refuge from the hustle and bustle in the centre.",
          "What a lovely cathedral. An odd (but in my opinion it works) marriage of old and modern architecture. Even if it doesn't float your boat it will certainly get you thinking. The Place Gilleson has cafes with terraces which add to the charm of the whole place. Definitely worth a",
          "What you will remember more about this place is surely its contrasts. Incredibly ugly the facade, it will make you wonder if you really want to get in. But then, when inside, you will be shocked and astonished for how incredibly beatiful it is. The internal little chapels where",
          "We didn\u2019t know what to make of this cathedral offering a weird hodgepodge of 19th and 20th century interpretations of the gothic style. At first we even thought the ugly fa\u00e7ade, combining a metal grid and thin marble plates, was still under construction. In fact it was finished",
          "From the outside it is a mish mash of modern and late 19th century but go inside - wow! Light, airy and beautiful. Not to be missed.",
          "I felt really good in this place. Everything was very calm and slow and organ music was brilliant! Also they had a nice exhibition of paintings dedicated to Jesus.",
          "We went in as part of the guided tour and it is a beautiful place. I am not religious at all but found this place relaxing and serene. The architecture is grand but modern in places - a beautiful building!",
          "I did not know what to think when I saw the exterior. It is fair to say it is better on the inside than the outside. Worth a visit.",
          "Unusual cathedral with modern fa\u00e7ade, modern doors and some obvious modern amenities. All that distracted from the historical experience.",
          "Walking from outside into the church I experienced a total different environment.The architect had drunk too much (nice) French wine I guess",
          "Well worth a visit. The outside is a mix of old and new architecture which has been melded in a very special way, the classical interior was enhanced by the lovely organ music playing as you stroll around.",
          "Stunning church, large and spacious and it really felt like a living church mixing modern and old. Beautiful stained glass windows and felt very peaceful inside.",
          "Great design blending the old with a modern twist. Nice surroundings and great to take a coffee or beer in the square outside",
          "A mixture of old me new. This cathedral Offers a great mix for the whole family and can throw a few surprises. Surrounded by trendy cafes and wonderful side streets this is a must see cathedral.",
          "special visit to this church for two reasons. 1. its time to build lasted several years which you can sea at the building and 2 the marmer front of the lastest build part.",
          "I was amazed by the modern, yet sympathetic restoration of this beautiful Cathedral. From outside you would think they had got it wrong, but go inside and you will be amazed at the beautiful stained glass windows, and the modern tableaux in front of altars a d statues of saints.",
          "First impressions are of a unattractive poorly executed to the rest of the building frontage built in 1999, designed by someone with very little soul. It actually works surprisingly well inside - but externally it is bad enough to nearly walk away without going in. Would appear",
          "this big church is very recent although certain parts look older. It has been built in concrete in a kind of gothic style mixture. It is not a whole but a mixture of different construction. It has no spirit nor historical value.",
          "Nice gothic cathedral with a surprising modern facade. Interesting exhibit on the history of the cathedral and the Lille diocese.",
          "Stunning interior with a contemporary art exhibition to view whilst moving around the place. A place to be inspired and look to the gods.",
          "Beautiful place to visit and also enjoy a wine with view on the notre dame ;-) There is old windows and statues, but also modern art. Magnificant.",
          "With its translucent glass wall, beautiful ceilings, grand entrance way! Well worth the time to visit!",
          "Stunning church. The focal point of the old town. Well worth a visit. Surrounded by restaurants and shops and bars.",
          "This building is an interesting experiment of mixing the traditional and modern architecture. The front wall of the cathedral is a semi translucent material, most intriguing. best bit was watching a par-cour exponent leaping, twisting and jumping up the side steps and rails.",
          "We went around the outside as the bells were ringing very loudly calling the faithful to mass and we didn't want to be disrespectful during a worshiping. There is a statue outside the new extension on the belfry side which looks like Voldemort!",
          "Our Group were privileged to sing within Mass and after. We were made very welcome. The Cathedral also has a challenging sculptural exhibition right now",
          "Go in and enjoy, then walk around the exterior to view the gargoyles and intricate stonework. The inside has so many alcoves and off shoots it will take 30 minutes to do it justice. Pipes alone are amazing. I had piped music and it was beautiful. Light a candle, sit and stare at",
          "This beautiful cathedral has a very modern feel to it and adds to it's beauty. There is nice background music playing which gives it a holy feeling. As you can see from my photographs there is a large suspended screen and a lovely stained glass window. Well worth a visit.",
          "We were lucky to visit the cathedral with a Greeter ( great one ) and we learned a lot about this religious building whose construction was spread over the 19th and 20th centuries ; this explains the big difference in architectural design between the back and the front ! The",
          "The cathedral is surprisingly new, only 20 years or so since it was finished. The interior is unusual but very beautiful. Less said about the outside the better!",
          "From the time you climb the steps into history, you are never disappointed with the ambience of this huge cathedral. There is a sort of thoroughfare that circumnavigates the central and holy areas and it is easy to walk around. When we were there, there was music playing over",
          "A friend and I happened to be out shopping one afternoon in Lille when we found the church open. We weren't quite sure what to expect due to the imposing front exterior, but inside were greeted with glittering light and old world charm. The stained glass inside is beautiful and",
          "Must visit, if you like beautiful old, well preserved places, amazing stained glass windows and amazing walls snd celing, made for great pics",
          "It is a very large an interesting Cathedral, not exceptional but very good. Its a good place to have a peaceful stroll around to break the day. Plaza outside is also very nice.",
          "After seeing lots of cathedrals I find this one a modern architectural decision which can not match my expectations for a traditional or beautiful cathedral. If you want to spent some time in the open spaces in the city I propose to you to go to the central square of the city.",
          "We were not sure if we were in the right place, as the outside is a very dull grey brick, however the inside is breathtaking. High stain glass windows, wonderful mosaic, stunning alters. This worth a visit, don't forget change to light a candle, ranging between 2 and 13 euros",
          "This Cathedral appears unappealing from the front steps but please step inside to see the full effect of the marble window and also the interior is magnificent It's a fairly modern build which was only completed at the front for the Millenium........",
          "While you are strolling through the Vieux-lille, it's inevitable, you will end up somehow near \" La treille\". Go in, it's worth seeing. If you can time it to make it for a free tour, that's even better! Mix of old and modern. Loved it!",
          "Very large cathedral and interesting art and stained glass windows.Don't be misled by the front facade which must be there as a temporary arrangement, I think.",
          "Very modern exterior and the main door is spectacular looke at from the inside with the sun shining in. Well worth a visit.",
          "We have been into Kant basilicas, cathedrals, churches and chapels. We almost did not go because of the bleak weather but we were so surprised when we arrived. The cathedral is relatively modern and is such an interesting mix of styles...old and new and full of art works,",
          "This is a beautiful building where modern meets classical in a good way. The to me the stand out feature was the doors: they're huge, hand crafted metal frames with thick glass panes, cherubs and little gargoyles all made by hand. The church itself is set in a nice little",
          "Highly recommend you pay a visit here. Lille is beautiful. A refreshing break from Paris. One hour TGV ride from CDG. Convenient connections right throughout the day.",
          "Fabulous exterior and interior. Mix of gothic and modern facade. Very interesting pieces of religious art inside. Amazing stained glass windows. Modern facade covered in sheets of white marble.",
          "This is for sure a different church, with a modern touch mixed with the old style. The atmosphere inside is more happy and transmits a positive feeling. Very interesting to visit.",
          "This is a very interesting Catherdral, the main body of the building is hundreds of years old and inside there are some fantastic stained glass windows, However the front of the catherdral was renovated in the 1990s and is in a very modern style. The mix sounds awful on paper,",
          "A very large Cathedral with amazing stained glass windows and paintings. Excellent place to have some quiet space. Well worth a visit on a trip to Lille.",
          "We were walking round Lille and came across this almost by accident. Wandering down a side alley we came out at the back of what we thought was an oldish church. Wandering around we were not tempted to visit until we saw the main entrance - a modern section \"stuck\" onto the",
          "It isn't everyday that you get to visit a modern cathedral built in the recent centuries, but this one is without a shadow of a doubt worth the visit. The interior is absolutely magnificent. The way in which the sun shines through the stained glass windows and lights up the",
          "Stunning as the sun shines through the stained glass window, free entrance, worth a look around, easy to find in the centre of Lille",
          "A quiet and massive church with great glass paintings. Try to go in when the sun shines on the great glass paintings, they are beautiful. We thought the church was old but its just 150 years.",
          "You don't visit that often a cathedral built between the 19th and 20th century, so it's a very interesting experience, a bit mix of styles but certainly worthy to spend a bit of time in it",
          "It is a massive church in Lille, very beautiful and lights come through the window. As I heard it was expanded but never finished the construction as original plan.",
          "As other travelers are saying, the interior of the Cathedral is stunning, the acoustics is excellent, definitively a moving experience when there is a concert. However, I hate the modern fa\u00e7ade, I do not think it works well. Somehow it seems that they got tired and built that",
          "While the church looks a little strange and uninviting from the outside, the inside is welcoming and impressive. The light shining through the marble wall is very special.",
          "Lovely outside and in. Really peaceful and a quaint little gift shop. Place to light candles for those we've lost.",
          "This traditional cathedral had two hidden delights for us. On entering we wondered at the apparent temporary modern facade but all was revealed on seeing the effect of this from within the building itself but the best aspect of attending during a service was the beautifully",
          "We came across this Cathedral one rainy afternoon in Lille. It looked quite large from the outside and when you walk in, you truly admire the impressive and grandeur interior. There is an interesting modern facade to one part and if you Wikipedia the cathedral, you can learn a",
          "We very much enjoyed this cathedral. It is not the grandest we've ever seen but certainly very nice. Super stained glass windows. No charge to get in",
          "From the outside, this cathedral looks like your stereotypical building. Once you enter, you get to see the magnificent interior which is simply stunning. Whether or not you follow a particular religious belief, this cathedral is well worth visiting, if only to admire the",
          "What a beautiful, interesting cathedral! The contrast between the recent and older parts is huge, yet somehow it works really well. The windows in the older part are absolutely stunning, framed by equally beautiful paintings. Definitely worth a visit whilst exploring Vieux Lille.",
          "The outside of the cathedral is very modern, what a surprise when you go inside, it is beautiful and very gothic. Stained glass is gorgeous. Well worth a visit. Shame about the beggars by the doors.",
          "A very impressive cathedral - unique shape and design. The thing I found strange was all the tables for the restaurants and bars on the opposite side of the road that were set up right at the foot of the steps to the church.",
          "Not being a religious person I do not normally have too much interest in churches or other places of worship. While in Lille with my wife we did decide to take a look inside. The architecture is stunning and what a peaceful atmosphere. Definitely worth a look.",
          "If you like visiting Cathedrals then it is definitely worth a visit. Make sure you walk round the whole of the outside as the front is modern but the rest of the building is not and in my opinion is far nicer to look at.",
          "From the front, this looks very modern, in cathedral terms it was finished relatively recently but still is what you would expect inside. Had a lovely feel to it, the chapel at the end was especially nice. Some lovely stained glass windows too. Not in the same league as some",
          "Built in an older style, mostly gothic, this is surprisingly a youthful cathedral, less than 200 years old with lots of the building being relatively recent. Nice inside and definitely feels older that it is. There isn't that much to view inside and it takes about as long to",
          "Beautiful church with modern touch, this architect combined a modern entrance with the beautiful old building. Also inside you'll find a mixture of both old and new. Free entrance",
          "We entered this interesting church, not sure what to expect. The exterior is both modern with Gothic design influence present as well. We have visited MANY Cathedrals all over Europe but this one was different. Inside, the structural design is traditional but, definitely",
          "This church very interestingly mixes elements of old with modern designer elements. Interesting to see, but not for those of you who prefer old and original beauty of churches and cathedrals. I do recommend a quick walk around the church, as the houses and gardens connected to",
          "Compared to other cathedrals in Europe, this one isn't all that distinctive but it's still pretty to visit. I wouldn't go out of my way, but if you're in the area, it's worth about 15 minutes to stroll around.",
          "This neo-Gothic cathedral stands on the site of the old feudal motte. The first stone was laid in 1854 but the fa\u00e7ade was only built in 1999, hence its modern appearance. If you like traditional churches, don\u2019t be put off by this modern exterior, inside is huge, gothic and",
          "If you are tired of gothic and romanesque... try Lille's Cathedral. It starts gothic on one end and ends modern on the other. It is interesting just for the variety of styles inside and out. Purists might poo poo it, but I think it is a monument to perserverance. Definitely",
          "Although this looks like an old building it was actually built relatively recently, although you'd never guess from the outside. A dour looking building, the inside is quite beautiful and provides lots of opportunities for photography. Stained glass windows and vaulted ceilings",
          "This large cathedral in the centre of old Lille is an interesting fusion of old and new. A modern facade, complete with an unusual stained glass window, has been been grafted onto the front of the building, and even inside there's quite a contemporary feel to this half of the",
          "A cathedral started 1854 and latest addition 1999. A work in progress. Mix of old and very modern and stunning with it. Be there when the organ plays, it may just move you a few steps closer to God.",
          "Beautiful cathedral, enormous and interesting. I don't normally enjoy religious places but this was spectacular",
          "an enrmous and beautiful church.Fantastic marber facaded which the light shines through. Before Christmas, the most beautiful display of cribs, including many by childfren from local schools... very impressive.",
          "Outside is not very nice looking but inside is breathtaking and helped build atmosphere with lovely music. Nice to spend half hour or more walking round then a drink outside in one of the cafe/bars. It wasnt very nice having a young beggar boy fall at his knees in front of us",
          "A lovely cathedral, walk all the way to the front before you turn around to look at the front door! Music at lunchtime this Summer which is new and great idea",
          "This was the last place we were able to visit on our limited two days in Lille and it was a spectacular highlight. A stunning cathedral and worth the effort to visit.",
          "Despite not being massively religious I like a cathedral or two. This one really confused me. It is the architecture and the achievement of the stonework and the construction before the times of big cranes that impresses me. I really don't understand how you could start with",
          "Just few blocks from the Lille city center, this cathedral is one of the most amazing pieces of modern art I've ever seen. Definitely go in, don't judge it only from the outside.",
          "Pretty avarage Gothic church with 1 twist, the fact that the facade was never finished until recently when they gave the church a modern looking face. The chappels in the back are nice and wort seeing.",
          "An odd hotchpotch of architectural styles, somehow this cathedral works on the inside despite being a bit grim externally. The stained glass is worth a look, and as you leave the full impact of light through the main archway is very impressive.",
          "Found this unusual church by exploring Lille. It's just lovely, please make sure if you light a candle you make a donation. Always remember to respect the religion too - this is a place of worship and although they allow photography please be respectful of others. The place",
          "Beautiful. Well worth the visit. Have a good look around it, inside and out. The queues are fast moving.",
          "If this old church fails to amaze you, it is stunning, but it is still full of beggars, it is one of the finest churches we visited in France",
          "Another delightful venue to visit within walking distance of the centre of Lille. A delight to wonder at and savour its magnificence.",
          "It is not an old church, being finished in the 1940's. I don't find the outside of the church appealing, though the front does let a lot of light filter in. Can be skipped.",
          "Grand in scale but not awe inspiring. Not many stained glass windows. Statues very ordinary. Did get opportunity to hear Gospel choir rehearsing for concert. Acoustics here are excellent. I can only imagine what the organ would sound like.",
          "Beautiful stained glass and a mixture of temporary and permanent exhibits inside. No requested fees like some grand cathedrals would have. Well worth the visit.",
          "Very effective combination of traditional and modern architecture. Beautiful stained glass windows in the nave .Interesting modern stained glass Erie window above the entrance.",
          "I am a big lover of cathedrals but this left me with mixed emotions. If you ignore the ghastly modern facade that looks ridiculous, and walk inside you will be pleasantly surprised. Beautiful rose windows and a stunning organ. I was lucky to be there for the summer organ program",
          "Notre Dame de la Treille is a Neo Gothic cathedral. Its construction, like many cathedrals, lasted a long time, 150 years and was started in the 19th Century. It was finished in the 20th Century, which explains its very modern and a little disconcerting facade. It overlooks a",
          "This is an interesting building with its mix of old style and modern style. It was nice to get out of the cold wind for a while when visiting Lille. If you like architecture of varying styles then you will enjoy this. We particularly liked the modern facade.",
          "I wasn't at all sure about this church from the outside - the modern facade did not strike me as being at all attractive, and actually seems to jar with the rest of the building. Once inside, it is another story altogether. Seen from the nave, the modern stained glass and",
          "We enjoyed being able to get into this Catheral via the wheelchair access lift facility. Once in it was well worth the visit, we particularlly liked the mix of the upgraded & additional works that complimented the older part of the church.",
          "The building indeed is something amazing, combining old and modern. The facade is very impressive, even more from the inside. The inside is nicely decorated, as in many Catholic churches you have a lot to see. We attended the Sunday mass on the resurrection day (Holy Week). It",
          "I always like it when an old church or cathedral has a modern interior or elements of one mixing the stained glass windows with the mosaics and modern front entrance. Worth the time to visit if you are passing by",
          "A beautiful cathedral, which is sadly, mostly a museum these days. But it is truly amazing and well worth the visit.",
          "Enjoyed a stroll round Lille and made our way to this attraction don't be put off by the front as the inside is amazing. You have to wonder how this was constructed and how long it took to complete. I would have liked to have had some information on its history on English but",
          "This looks rather odd from the outside - a 19th century rather pedestrian Gothic revival church with a weird modern facade - but on closer inspection, the facade is a work of genius made out of translucent marble with an amazing modern rose window. Inside, the building is a",
          "An incredible experience. We entered from one of the side doors and hadn't seen the front of the cathedral, so the view of the West end took our breath away - particularly as we visited in the afternoon and the sun was streaming through the rose window, bathing the whole",
          "What a strange place! A cathedral built over the period of 150 years. Inside, it is rather traditional and not unattractive. Having walked to the east end and turned back to to face the west, you are struck by the wonderful modern Rose window. The whole of the central section of",
          "It was a surprise when we enter the church! I looks under construction from the outside, but its actually a nice work that they did regarding the destructions from the war periods. Worth a visit!",
          "Yes, the front fa\u00e7ade belies the splendor of the interior. Inside you'd think that this gothic structure must've been built over a period of a hundred plus years and date from the 15th Century or before. Check out the story and you'll be surprised that this house of God is a",
          "The exterior of the cathedral is initially off-putting. It looks lack a tasteless cheap concrete front on a gothic church. Step inside, though, and there is a transformation. The thin stone frontage allows the daylight to filter through and the effect is breathtaking. A wall of",
          "This is a relatively new church with unique architecture. One side of the cathedral has a Gothic facade and the other a modern facade. No guided tours and the programs weren't in English.",
          "I first saw this church in the book, 'Structure as Architecture' while in university (modern fa\u00e7ade on a gothic church), we unanimously agreed that the external structure made the church ugly. Then one day I came to Lille and realised that the external structure had a purpose...",
          "We always visit cathedrals whenever we visit a city. This one is something different. I understand it is quite new and that is clear from looking at the west front. I wouldn't say that is for me but venture to the east end and it really is quite stunning- lovely mosaics adorn",
          "I was there in Christmass time , it was fantastic , the lights , the athmosphere , the design , extremely wide church !! lots of things to see and a wonderful place for a pray as well !!!",
          "I can image people love this type of cathedrals, but not really my cup of tea. I prefer the real stuff...",

        "wiki": "The Citadel of Lille (French: Citadelle de Lille; Dutch: Citadel van Rijsel) is a pentagonal citadel of the city  wall of Lille, in France.  It was built between 1667 and 1670. It hosts the Corps de r\u00e9action rapide France.Dubbed \"Queen of the citadels\" (Reine des citadelles) by Vauban, it is one of the most notable citadels designed by Vauban. It is remarkable for its size, the quality of the architecture, and the state of preservation today. Its various components have been classified as historic monuments in 1914, 1921 and 1934 respectively.\n\n\n== A first-class military installation ==\n\nThis \"Queen of Citadels\" is the matrix of most citadels designed by Vauban. Established on the border of Flanders, it was part of a double-line of fortified towns between Gravelines, Dunkirk and Maubeuge-Rocroi. It delineated the famous \"Pr\u00e9 Carr\u00e9\" (\"square field\") conceived by Vauban comprising 28 fortified cities. From Lille, Vauban supervised the construction of the many citadels and canals of the North, which controlled the border between France and Belgium. \nLille was taken from Spain by French troops in August 1667, and Louis XIV immediately ordered the construction of a fortress. Louis Nicolas de Clerville and Vauban proposed plans. Vauban's were those chosen by the King. Work was started in 1668 under the direction of Lille's master mason, Simon Vollant. In 1671, the citadel became operational while Vauban continued to shape the city by constructing, a few steps away, a new neighborhood around the Rue Royale. The design of the citadel follows a simple but very effective idea: not one of its walls can be approached by the enemy without them being under fire from a nearby wall.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe citadel was constructed to the west of the city on marshland at the junction of the rivers De\u00fble and Bucquet. This allowed the use of swamp water and mud as a natural defense to make conditions more difficult for any possible enemy besieging the citadel. Through a system of locks and water gates, 1,700 hectares around the citadel could be flooded to a depth of 55 cm. A wide esplanade interrupted the plans, connecting the fort to the city. In 1750, a canal along the esplanade was drilled according to the plans drawn up by Vauban.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Citadelle de Lille at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Nice area to have a relaxed walk, since there are few people around, but the citadel itself is out of limits for general population, still being a military base. It's quite a sight, so it's too bad.",
          "Situated close to the city and accessible by foot from the centre this old army citadel now houses the NATO rapid reaction force of the army and has been there since the 18th century. The moat/canal has a delightful walk around the exterior, zoo and park. Group visits can be",
          "We really enjoyed this visit. There is a very attractive park next to it, river walks and then the Citidel has a circular walk around the stronghold beside a moat. You cannot go into the Citidel but it is interesting to see the stonework and various bridges along the route.",
          "Rather tricky to find, given how huge it is! Perhaps head along Rue de la Barre then go straight across the road. Look for the French flag flying ahead of you and head for that, as it is the main entrance. Vehicles do go in and out so you can get a peep inside if you are",
          "The old citadel is rated as a \"must see\" by most guides, but actually there's little of it that can be seen as it is still in use by the military. Between the citadel and the moat there is a nice path round the outside, but also they squeezed in the small zoo and a few car",
          "But we don't have the security clearance. It is an active military post for meetings but the grounds outside the walls have been made into a lovely walking area with playgrounds for children and a small zoo.",
          "He was the go-to designer of defensive structures across Europe in 15 - 16 century. Do not expect a castle - mostly banks and ditches - it is the layout that fascinated us. We strolled for half a day, zoo, boat hire too",
          "Although you cannot go in this is a lovely area to walk with lots of great photo opertunities. Peaceful",
          "Although you can't access the inner sanctuary, due to it being a military base. It's well worth walking around the outside. The construction was formidable, huge walls of brick forming a pentangle. The park with the old moat made a pleasant walk. There is also a children's zoo",
          "We walked and cycled around and it is a lovely chilled out space, we saw frogs, water rat, heron, and kingfisher and not many people. It is about a 2km loop if you do the inner path so not too taxing.",
          "A very nice walk around the Citadel following the old moat, but I couldn't help wondering what was going on over the huge walls! It's an active military base so you can't visit inside, but outside was wonderfully colourful and engaging on this hot June afternoon. The frogs",
          "This fortress is around half an hour from the centre of Lille on foot and is well worth a visit. It is in a lovely wild park and is used as a military NATO base so one cannot enter it. However, the walk around it is great and when we were ther, frogs were making a terrible",
          "The park around the citadel is very nice and picturesque in the summer sun. A good running route with some very small inclines but mainly level. Around 3km around the route.",
          "A very nice place to walk and have a quite time in the park with a lot of green. Generally people are running or just having a walk here. I did a lot of running myself in this park.",
          "The citadel is located in the middle of a big open space which is great for a walk around on a sunny day. It is also close to a children's playground and the small zoo. The citadel is spectacular and worth the walk to see it despite not being able to access it.",
          "Was looking for a park to visit while in Lille and this appeared on the map. It looked really nice so I gave it a go. There were not many people and it was so nice and quiet, perfect for photos.",
          "The paths and byways all around the Citadel were just super for taking a long walk and being protected from traffic. Very nice parkland to see and enjoy at every turn.",
          "Found this by chance what a fantastic area, quiet location. Well worth a visit, walk around the outside area and see the extensive work put in building this fortress",
          "Discovered this Citadel when we were in the park. Really worth visiting and not too many people about during the day.",
          "is a pentagonal citadel of the city wall of Lille, in France. There is so many places to sit and have a picnic and also so many different walks you can go on, only advice is I wouldnt walk late at night in here as not that well lit. Beautiful trees and architecture are apart of",
          "Quite impressive when you imagine it was built 400 years ago by Vauban the Minister of war of Louis XIV !",
          "In Lille for one night and was looking for a running location. Easy access 1 km from city centre I am rating the park rather than the old fortifications which I did not venture into. The woodland park is tranquil and served by wide well maintained paths. Ideal for walking,",
          "The fortifications were build by Vauban, and are considered some of the best and most beautiful in France. However, the site is still a major military centre, so one cannot enter the fortifications or the citadelle, other than on a few select days per year. One can walk around,",
          "Lovely grounds to walk around we arrived too late to gain entrance ( just before 4pm) the area also has a free children park that was good in size and a fun fair was close by but not sure if this was permanently placed, a good place to visit in Lille",
          "Be prepared to do some walking! Huge complex set amongst some of the most lovely gardens. The walls are facinating along with the lake areas hidden away.",
          "Very nice place where the history and the nature are mixed in an unque way. It\u021bs a nice, quiet place, very suitable for relaxation",
          "Definitely an enjoyable place to stroll along the paths and moats and marvel at the scale of construction. The entrance gate gives you an impression of the prestige of the Roi-soleil. Just have your eyes open for the bikes - they are a law unto themselves and some approach at",
          "The old citadel has some lovely walkways and scenery around the walls, but the centre is a an active military base and bot available for visits.",
          "I didn't go in the base, which I believe has restricted access. I did have a walk around the general citadel park though and it's definitely worth a visit, particularly given the lack of green space in Lille.",
          "Such a beautiful place to see, although the citadel is not open to the public. Nice open space to walk around.",
          "I found walking around the citadel fascinating. Passing the first set of ramparts and walking around the killing grounds of the voie de combatants. What would have gone through the mind (apart from a musket ball) of any poor soldier dropping the 50\u2019 into the space and then",
          "We started an evening stroll through town and ended up here at night. It is a good walk and pass through many lovely streets to get here, but there is not much to see at night. You can look up some quick facts to make it more enjoyable, and the few things light up look great.",
          "The Citadel is generaly closed to the public but on certain days guided tours are available which you need to contact the Lille tourism office for dates and times. A footpath allows you to walk around the site giving some nice views of the local wildlife as well as the",
          "Great for a walk in the park or for a morning jog. Unfortunately, the citadel itself was not open to public.",
          "As this is an active military installation you can walk around the 17th century battlements, the fort is in the shape of a star, typical of the era, its a tranquil walk around with the forrest taking over again with the outer walls and a peaceful hour away from the hub-bub of",
          "Since the Citadel is still an active military installation visitors are limited to walking around the Vole des Combattants, surrounding the inner wall of fortification. It is never the less worth the visit, and if you are active can enjoy the walk or join with those slightly",
          "As everyone has said, and the tourist information is quite clear about, you can't actually gain entry to the Citadel. However you can stroll along through the Bois de Boulogne with and independent air and enjoy the tranquility of the stream/moat around the military installation.",
          "The Citadelle is very large ,strong , and nice to stroll around to see the extent of the city defences put up by Vauban. However, as the area is still used by the military, you can't access the central part which really limits this to a nice walk around a set of very large walls",
          "the building is beautiful but can only be viewed from a distance as it is currently occupied by the armed forces",
          "The Citadel is huge and in the centre of a park where one can walk or run around (this is very popular with runners!) At the edge of the park is the zoo.",
          "The Citadel is a lovely, central park with walking and cycling trails throughout. It's a haven for joggers as well, and as you walk around the Citadel, you can see glimpses of the historic structure. I would happily take a walking tour to learn more.",
          "Shame you can't go inside, and it was fairly confusing to navigate the grounds to even find the path that surrounds the structure. **When you get to the park entrance head left through the children's play area and towards the zoo. At the zoo entrance there are posts marking a",
          "FYI - you can't go inside the citadel as it is an active army base. However, it is very beautiful to walk around it and the park is a really nice place to go on a sunny day.",
          "Lovely walk around the old ramparts- huge project of refurbishment planned to restore the star shape including the moat. Paths regularly used by joggers. As previous people have mentioned there is NO access inside as it is a working base by the RRF (a bit like our SAS). If you",
          "Shame you cannot go inside, as it's still in use, but the outer grounds are worth a look if you're happy to walk around it and take a break from the city and cobbled streets. A nice bit of nature. You cant really tell the shape of the structure, which seems so unique on a map",
          "We visited the Citadel and had a beautiful walk around the outer grounds. We couldn't enter as it's a working military base and we hadn't booked in advance. The grounds feature a beautiful moat with lots of trees and wildlife. definitely worth a visit for an evening stroll.",
          "it's nice to walk or ran in the morning. at this moment it's a working place at the front, it'a pity!",
          "Actually it is a military base, so you have to book ahead. However tours can be arranged, just not easily. There is a nice park around the outside though.",
          "Make time to walk across to the Citadel, amid the green park, alongside the zoo. Lots of work and updating going on but you can still have a leisurely walk around the outside of the citadel and stop for a picnic or pancakes and icecream, beneath the trees in the park. A lovely",
          "We sent for a Tourist Guide from Lille TB, which dually arrived . The Guide clearly says \"Visits are arranged regularly and booking can be made at the Lille Tourist Bureau\" On our first day in Lille we went to make a booking, we were then told that a booking had to be made 10",

          "Lovely park with place for ice cream/coffee/beer. Zoo was getting its spring makeover and so closed. The citadel itself is a base forthe French Rapid Reaction Force so you cannot go in but you can look from the outside.",
          "A lot of walls of the Citadels are not in good shape, gates that were nice in horrible condition and poorly maintained- is one of big impressions. Also you can't see much, but still it is nice place to enjoy as there is a lot of green areas around it.",
          "A short stroll from the zoo is the Citadel, the inside of which is not open to the public (at least not whilst we were there). Whilst impressive, the grounds themselves seemed poorly kept. You are better off sticking to the nearby Zoo/park area.",
          "Although it was very cold with a biting wind, we enjoyed our walk from the centre of Lille to the citadelle. Unfortunately we were too late in the day to gain entrance but we saw enough to make sure we visit it properly when next in Lille and hopefully when it is warmer too.",
          "Nothing \"citadel\" about this. All you can do is walk along the wall. However even this wasn't pleasurable due to the badly maintained grounds.",
          "I was unsure whether to rate this as terrible or poor but decided on terrible because of the total waste of a beautiful area. It is really run down and overgrown also the water is stagnant and smells. I love walking and we enjoyed walking all around the citadel but know nothing",
          "Huge and impressive. One of my favourite visits in Lille. A place where to walk around but also where to learn something about the history of militar defense of the cities. Used from the citizens more like a park, it will make you spend two or three nice hours of your time in",
          "The Citadel was built between 1667 and 1670 by order of Louis XIV, after taking the town from the Spanish. The Citadel is a masterpiece, it is beautiful and well maintained in the inside. It is off limits to unauthorized personnel since there is an active Military headquarters",
          "Would not go out of my way to see this. Grounds are not kept up. Did not see any organized displays. Just an old fort you can walk though.",
          "Nice to walk in the park but finding the citadel was a little disappointing as you cannot go inside as its a military building. The park itself could use a facelift, nice area for the children to play and a funfair close by which I imagine when open would be very popular.",
          "i love castles and such like, so when we where in Lille we ventured to the park and Citadel, we walked from the old town, and came across the big car park, as ou stand there looks more like a waste ground, first we noticed sign for Zoo which was very good then walked to the",
          "Went for a morning run and there were plenty of tracks to enjoy and explore. Lots of old portions of the citadel to be seen",
          "Walked to the citadel having really enjoyed visiting a similar fortress in Copenhagen. Must say I was disappointed, walls are in poor repair and given its the base for the French Military fast response team you can't go inside either. Oh and don't try playing Pokemon Go to close",
          "Pretty park with a zoo and trails surrounding the massive Vauban citadel. Good baraque a frites near the entrance. The citadel itself houses the French Rapid Reaction Corps and is only accessible with guided tours (ask at the tourism office).",
          "The locals, for some reasons, didn't recommend me to visit here, but I thought this place was worth a visit. This is a well-preserved one of the few remaining citadels.",

          "Not much to see apart from the walls surrounding the area. The main part is closed for training of the Quick Reaction French Force. The area around has been turned into a lovely grassed area where you can walk or cycle along purpose built paths. There is a playground for",

          "Due to major construction works and alterations to the local vicinity, it was not possible to view the Citadel from the inside. Outside, it looked suitably imposing and strong. Having made the walk through the park, from the zoo, to specially view this, it was disappointing",
          "A nice little walk in a patch of greenery. Worth pairing it with a visit to the zoo if you can! It's a little walking from the closest metro station, so if you have issues with the distance. Take the bus. But it's a fun activity when the weather is nice!",
          "We rented a bike with the city bikes and we had a refreshing ride across this extensive park. The air was chilli and the sun was shining across the trees. Partially wild, we found it beautiful and I was glad I visited it by bike as it is a maze of moats, paths and roads.",
          "A very pleasant area of the city with plenty of room to stroll, cycle or run amongst trees along grass bordered paths to see the remains of the old citadel . The area also contains a quite extensive children's play area with refreshment kiosks , a large open area where on the",
          "I was disappointed at the mess in what otherwise could have been quite a nice park, but it seems the town of Lille doesn't take much pride in it's appearance!",
          "Isn't possible to visit the citadel inside because it is used for military purposes. The walk around the walls is also interesting to know a bit better the place. It is close to the zoo.",
          "The Citadel of Lille (in French it is noted as Citadelle de Lille) and it is a pentagonal citadel of the city wall of Lille, built between 1667-1670 - like the Porte de Paris it was constructed under the instructions of Louis XIV by Vauban who also constructed the defences in",
          "Don't be put off by my rating - this place is really, really nice to wander around and the old buildings are really impressive to see. But given it is still central to a military facility, it is pretty much impossible to see behind the gates of the central part. Still would",
          "This place is ideally situated for a pleasant walk or jog around if you are based in the nearby main city",
          "We were expecting to be able to visit \"something\", but actually the heart of the citadel contains an active military facility, so it's a no-go zone. If you want to walk around the park, the citadel is fine, but if you want to visit something ...",
          "I have the privilege of working on occasion inside the Citadelle and would urge anyone to try to get in there on a public open day. The architecture of every part of this ancient building is absolutely spectacular and the history is fascinating, even though it is not that",
          "A great spot for a peaceful couple of hours away from the bustle and cobbled streets of the centre of Lille. Here you can stroll between the walls of the old fortifications and the numerous ditches and moats, through trees and by tall bulrushes, accompanied by birdsong rather",
          "The park around the citadel is quite nice, the walls of the citadel and the shape are quirky and interesting. It's about 1-1.5 miles loop round the path, absolutely full of joggers. Even in this short space it varies quite a lot from pretty run down to nice, green and paved.",
          "It is a nice green space and it's big enough for every purpose. I went there several times but it's the best when it's warm and the monkeys in the zoo are out so you can have a bit of fun during the day. Sometimes birds from the zoo fly in the park and you see them walking on",
          "it could be nice in summer times as i imagined while looking at those gay ducks quacking and fighting in the little pond/river. But in winter time it is really nothing special. and you cant really enter the main part of citadel. there are many people there running, walking dogs,",
          "The Vauban style defences are impressive as they always are anywhere but it's hard to get the scale as the area is today wooded or covered by a circus or a zoo! Plus you need an appointment to get in. Given the long walk out to it this has to make it a little disappointing",
          "Walked round the outside of the Citadel which was very pleasant on a chill October day, managed a view of a few different levels and could see parts of the inner buildings which appear very interesting ,especially as it is NATO establishment. The history and information boards",
          "I would really have loved to see inside the Citadel as I believe it has been fabulously restored and maintained by the French Army. I read so much before our visit and was disappointed that we could not visit the interior as, according to the Tourist Office, we would not be in",
          "I did not actually go inside the Citadel itself but the grounds are very pleasant to walk around. There were also lots of runners as well. There are lots of paths to use and there is a small fun fair but it was closed when I visited. Make sure you check out the zoo as well.",
          "Worked inside this fortification for several days. Beautifully maintained by the French Army! Still has all of the period feel that you would expect from a strongpoint such as this,",
          "The Citadel Park is leafy and green and really a refuge from big city Lille. You can walk up to the entrance gate of the citadel and if you are lucky a car will come and you can peak inside. It IS it's own city inside (and old French city too boot!) Not worth the effort if",
          "An amazing place surrounded by greenery and clean air. The best thing is that we can hear the NATO training as inside Citadel there is a NATO camp which is restricted to other people.",
          "This was something we were looking forward to viewing but when we got there realised it was still in use, so access was limited.......",
          "set in a lovely park lots of things for children to do , shame you carn't see more long walk from nearest metro station!! get the bus up Rue de la Liberte easier. lots of parking but is very bizzy and slow to get in and out",
          "The Citadel is a star-shaped fort built by Vauban for Louis XIV. It is currently occupied by NATO's Rapid Response Team and is only open for tours by appointment. The park surrounding the Citadel is a very pleasant place to walk. The Zoo is closed on Tuesdays, however, which",

          "We had a very nice Walk around the Walls, during which we found the amazing free zoo. On a sunny day well worth a go.",
          "You can visit the outside of this impressive fortress and it is well worth a look around. It has a fascination history.",
          "This is not a thing. Do not go there, thinking this is a thing, because it isn't. This, is an army base with a canal around it. I was furious. It's massive though, and by the time you realise what a bad decision you have made, you are already about 45 minutes from anywhere with",
          "When on a sunny day many people in Lille goes in this park of the citadelle, so you see many people with childeren and some young people doing yoging. Its not advisable to go biking in this park, but better do a walk, the zoo its not advisable since its small and very touristic.",
          "Had a really nice walk around the Citadel before going to the zoo nearby. A very pleasant way to spend some of your time in Lille, well worth a visit and the tired feet and legs afterwards. Lots of people jogging and walking around it but it didn't feel crowded so was still a",
          "The Citadel is an army barracks, still in use, 5 pointed and with moats and walls. There is a very pleasant walk around it, with ducklings, coypus and various other wildlife to enjoy. After a morning sight seeing, a walk here is great.",
          "You need to book a week in advance if you want to go inside. We didn't know this until we got to Lille so could only walk around it. The walk was very nice. It had been raining quite heavily so it was a bit muddy however it was a nice overall. Would recommend if you want a nice",

          "Very Interesting - and also a very pleasant walk ....certainly not what you would expect to find in the middle of a city! Certainly worth the visit",
          "This all adds to Lille's charm - a lovely place to walk over the ramparts and around the Citadelle. No matter the time of year it is always a pleasure to visit.",
          "Not too far from the centre and the place for a great walk around the park. This is undergoing a revamp and so is not at its best at present. There is a zoo ( open in summer)and you can hear the animals and see them on parts of the walk around the citadel's walls. The citadel is",
          "Masterpiece of Vauban. Can only be visited on reservation a few days a year, since the Citadel itself is now a military headquarter of the French army and NATO. Though even walking around the Citadel on the 'Voie des Combattants', gives a good impression of the genius Vauban was",
          "Nice walk along a flat path; several historic notice boards. lots of joggers but really not very busy on a Monday morning.",
          "Pooped over here to have a look around, but you can just look around the outside walls as it is closed to he public. If you go to the zoo, then this is nearby so worth just having a look.",
          "A lovely short walk around the citadel. Flat surface and if you can dodge the bikes ok you will enjoy the walk. The walls are very impressive but since it is a working army base you can't go inside. Worth a walk from the car park though.",
          "Walked round the outside at two different levels could see parts of the buildings. looks very interesting ,especially as it is NATO establishment. The history and information boards around the outside explaining past and current restoration were extremely interesting.",
          "While it's nothing spectacular, La Citadelle de Lille is a nice, relaxing, and peaceful spot in the city to relax with a book or take a stroll. If it's a nice weekend, you can expect it to be full of families and couples of all ages. Best/Busiest Times: sunny weekends Tip: if",
          "It is huge. Unfortunately one cannot go inside as it is still a military base. You can walk around it.",
          "Well worth walking around for an hour or so if the weather is nice. close to the free zoo. nearby is an outdoor cafe. also, a small children's park.",
          "No public access to the Citadel as this is now a military base. However the grounds are lovely to walk in and it also houses the zoo which is worth a visit",
          "We walked there - picturesque and lovely in the sunshine by the canal. Have to get some sort of permission to actually go inside.",
          "When we visited last week there was a market in the middle of the citadel selling all sorts of nostalgia - old books, comics, pottery and the usual sprinkling of rubbish. A great atmosphere in old surroundings. Great fun!!",
          "We enjoyed out walk around the Citadelle, but could be better if it cleaned up a bit and more care was taken looking after it.",
          "You can do nothing more than walk around the walls, which was popular with joggers and cyclists. Overgrown ramparts is all there is to see. A bit of wildlife by the 'river' perhaps. Little point in going there.",
          "We walked around the outside of the citadel, very easy walking, I'm not sure if you can go into the citadel because it is a military base. You can also visit the Zoo, the best thing is it's free and well worth an hour to look around as it's only a small Zoo.",
          "I am in the military so my time in Lille was actually spent inside the Citadel at work. It's true that you cannot access the interior unless you are military but the grounds outside are fantastic and open to the public - parks, animals/zoo, running/walking trails, etc. There",
          "This looked like it would be a nice patch of green within the city but the approach takes you via a dilapidated funfair area before a walk around the moat. The interior Citadel is in use by the Military with no access to the public, which was disappointing.",
          "Very pleasant to walk around the Citadel - they are doing a great job transforming the outer grounds into public spaces.",
          "On a damp Wednesday morning we walked the circumference of the citadel ! took about an hour passed by plenty of joggers and sneak peek at the monkeys at the zoo that can be seen from the footpath",
          "After risking sanity getting past a tacky fair ground, you cannot see anything as the French equialent of the SAS occupy the Citadel and block entrance with armed - yes armed guards. Waste of time trying. I am sure the Zoo is great",
          "We visited the citadel twice and walked around it. Many joggers and cyclist use this route. The citadel is next to the zoo. There were some information boards about the history of the citadel.",
          "Sadly, the central Citadel itself is still occupied by the military, and only open to booked, guided tours.",
          "This is a huge structure with a perimeter of 2 kms which you can easily walk around. Apart from one or two execution sites, there is very little explanation of the different areas of the citadelle. The public are not admitted to the central area as that is a military zone so",
          "So much to do there it is worth a visit. Geared toward young families. Zoo, parks and lots of sites. There is parking there too.",
          "I just visit the Park, the citadel required some kind of reservation for going inside the walls. But you can walk the trails and see several animals running around the Bois de Bologne, when you can rest among trees and a river.",
          "Only open on Sundays as is a N.A.T.O. army base you need to book to visit. Walkable from Lille city centre",
          "Though in use by the military it is a lovely walk round the citadel even eerie with the sound of the monkeys in the nearby Zoo sounding off at feeding time! Lots of info boards and beautiful trees round the moat.",
          "You are not allowed into the citadel but in summer it is a good 40 minute walk around it and with all the wildlife..... Very very enjoyable. Time well spent I say!",
          "I understood that you had to book an excursion at the tourist office , but on a sunday after 12, it's quite difficult. They don't expect tourists on sunsday afternoon. So we walked to the citadel , but lots of signs of military object , keep out etc. so no tour. Otherwise we",
          "Very peaceful and historic site (couldn't visit inside though) surrounding park is really nice for an hour walk with ducks and cows (?) around, if the weather is nice...",
          "When visiting Lille, we had initially thought that we could access the Citadel as it wasn't clear from our map that it wasn't a major tourist attraction. We walked through the park to get to the main part of the Citadel. We got to what we thought was the entrance, only to be",
          "Lego eat your heart out. Bricks everywhere. Good historic site with story boards giving information even if English is allocated only a small account. We tracked our visit and got the diamond even if it didn't feel like it on the way around.",
          "The right place to go to get away from the noisy and awful center. Water and trees make a beautiful scenery.",
          "A pleasant walk around this park on a sunny day is a very nice experience, with the wild flowers growing everywhere and the wildlife openly wondering about. a haven for joggers and cyclists. the free zoo is good for kids. However, I felt it could maybe use a little loving",
          "This is a pathway around a fort like structure. It is really long and is about 2 km. Therefore dont start going around it if you cant continue for 2 km. There are a lot of joggers and cyclists using the area. There are information boards, But everything is in French. There are",
          "take a shortcut behind the parking to avoid passing through a french disneyland. The part where we were was closed because it is a military domain.",
          "We were unable to see this as it is currently fenced off so cannot comment on whether it was good or not.",
          "The 1.7 km circuit of the Citadelle (you can't access the inside as it's still in use by the French Rapid Response Regiment) is in the process of some renovation to the old Vauban fortifications. It is used by walkers, jiggers and cyclists and the wildlife is so used to people",
          "It is a fascinating walk that takes about 1 hour strolling around the citadelle. There are panels explaning the whole site and citadelle's history. While strolling you'll see some wildelife (ducks, herons) and other animals if you are careful enough. It is quite fascinating.",
          "Although we were not allowed in the Citadel itself we did stumble across a free zoo which surprised us both with the animal s included and amenites",
          "The Citadelle itself is closed off from visit year-round (except a few weeks in summer, if you get reservations - check with the tourist office) since it houses the French-equivalent of SWAT. The entrance is pretty (drawbridge and lots of flags) and the entire place is",
          "This is an awesome place, very impressive. There are a lot of paths to walk around. But I can see that it can get crowded on a nice day.",
          "Interesting walk alongside the citadel's walls. Shame it isn't better exploited. But definitely worth having a look!",
          "The citadelle was constructed under the military architect Vauban and is still in use by the French military to this day. Vauban considered it the \"Queen of Citadelles\" and is a wonderful place to go for a run in one of the dry moats.",
          "Around you can visit and make a nice walk and find information about fortifications. To visit \"the finest citadel I made\" quote Vauban, you need to make reservations at the city information, because the citadel is still occupied by the French army and only onder excort and on",
          "Dont know if it is because of winter, but visitors were'nt allowed inside the Citadelle. So i decided to walk around the park instead, and, I'll thank myself forever for taking such a decision. To begin with, the park is beautiful - I mean it. Its beautiful. The trees were",
          "The citadel is a pentagonal citadel housing the rapid action corps of France. We were also told that it is a NATO base as we could see the flags of NATO countries flutering outside the entrance. The citadel is very popular with joggers and runners who prefer running around the",
          "Not a lot to see in the winter. Citadel is a building within a pretty park but used by Ministry of Defence so you can only walk around the base of the ramparts. Looks like there is a fairground and refreshments available in the summer but closed in the winter. There is quite a",
          "Imagine a park. Then imagine a building inside of the park shaped like Pentagon in the United States of America. Then imagine armed guards pointing guns at you when you want to approach. No, it's not Pentagon, it's La Citadelle. Around it you can find a beautiful park filled",
          "You can't go into the citadel as such but the park around it is really lovely to stroll around. There are a couple of good restaurants on the edge that are good spots to eat a bite with a view",
          "The star-shaped citadel is a beautiful place to go visit while in Lille. If you enjoy jogging, it's also the place to go, and you will certainly not be alone.",
          "Lots of professional sellers of antiques,bric a brac and some rubbish.sift through to find the gems.Opens approx. Friday lunchtime.",
          "Loved the size and historical reference of the citadel. The layout is ideal for a lovely walk or for joggers, which there were loads. The park was adjacent to the river so lovely place to picnic. Parking is a bit of a hassle if you don't know where your going.",
          "Although I went with my grown up daughter we had a lovely walk round- but the activities were superb for children - a must for a family.",
          "We love to wander and explore and came across The Citadel by chance especially as it's not on the main tourist map provided in Lille. It's an interesting area near the Canals, the free Zoo and lovely Jardin Vauban park. A good area to sit and take in the quieter side of Lille",
          "Not sure whether or not it was possible to go in as there were signs saying it was a military facility and entrance was forbidden. however, others have said you can go inside,",
          "a good walk around the citadel and the park. Great to leave the city for a few hours and see the park. Easy walk from the city centre to the park.",
          "This is the one that started it all! The desginer is buried next to Napolean. Don't miss this. Our Pentagon was designed by the person that designed this. Neat history",
          "The place is really nice to go running or set a bit in the sun (if there's sun) but the water channels around are really dirty and still and sometimes stinky",
          "The Citadelle is a bit far from the centre, but still within walking distance. Alternatively, you could rent a bike and cycle in the park that surrounds the fort. I found it very interesting as it is still in use: it's a military zone in fact! On the way back from the Citadelle",
          "We walked around the citadelle (about a mile I think) alongside a river or moat. This area is very well looked after and many people use it for a walk, run or cycle ride.",
          "The inside was closed without any notification given on site or in the tourist info. In front there is a Luna park ruining the perception of a place to see",

          "I've been going to the Citadel quite often and it is definitely one of Lille's charms, whether you take a stroll in their zoo (free of charge) or decide to walk around the park and by the canals it's always time well spent. Sunny days are the best times to visit, the animals are",
          "We walked from our hotel, easy walk, easy to find, even though we're were unsure what we were going to see. Popular area with the locals which is still being improved. A pleasant park area to walk througH.",
          "enjoyed the tranquility but it was February! Guess it get more popular in the spring & summer. If you want to visit the zoo check the opening times as it was closed until eary February.",
          "You can't go in to see the Citadel as it's a French Military base so you can just walk up to the walls and see the rather smart entrance. You can walk round the citadel walls, I would imagine on a nice day it's a good walk but it was very cold when we were there so we didn't",
          "just walked to this area from our hotel. quite a walk, but once there the stroll around the citadel interesting and enjoyable.",

          "Is a place for French fast response troops so no entry allowed. You can walk around a lovely park outside the walls but that is all. Not worth a visit unless you have the time to spare. In July 2012 there was a great funfair for kiddies nearby with plenty of parking.",
          "If you like parks and zoos on a lazy Sunday afternoon visit The Citadel . This is where the citizens of Lille on a sunny Sunday afternoon go ,. Picnics , Boules, and the wonderful zoo . Funny Meerkats , cheeky monkeys plus many more . It is a place for adults and children alike",

          "If you fancy jogging, you may go there. You cannot go in",

        "wiki": "The Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille (Lille Palace of Fine Arts) is a municipal museum dedicated to fine arts, modern art, and antiquities. It is one of the largest art museums in France.\nIt was one of the first museums built in France, established under the instructions of Napoleon I at the beginning of the 19th century as part of the popularisation of art. Jean-Antoine Chaptal's decree of 1801 selected fifteen French cities (among which Lille) to receive the works seized from churches and from the European territories occupied by the armies of Revolutionary France. The painters Louis Joseph Watteau and Fran\u00e7ois Watteau, known as the \"Watteau of Lille\", were heavily involved in the museum's beginnings - Louis Joseph Watteau made in 1795 the first inventory of the paintings confiscated during the Revolution, whilst his son Fran\u00e7ois was deputy curator of the museum from 1808 to 1823.\nThe museum opened in 1809 and was initially housed in a church confiscated from the R\u00e9collets before being transferred to the city's town hall. In 1866, the \"mus\u00e9e Wicar\", formed from the collection of Jean-Baptiste Wicar, was merged into the Palais des Beaux-Arts. Construction of the Palais's current Belle \u00c9poque-style building began in 1885 under the direction of G\u00e9ry Legrand, mayor of Lille, and it was completed in 1892. The architects chosen to design the new building were Edouard B\u00e9rard (1843\u20131912) and Fernand Etienne-Charles Delmas (1852\u20131933) from Paris. The building is located on the place de la R\u00e9publique, in the center of the city, facing the pr\u00e9fecture of Lille. It was renovated during the 1990s and reopened in 1997.\nAt the start of the 1990s, the building's poor state and the moving of Vauban's relief models of fortified towns to Lille forced the town to renovate the building. Work began in 1991, under the architects Jean-Marc Ibos and Myrto Vitart, and was completed in 1997. This allowed the creation of a new 700 m2 basement room for temporary exhibitions, as well as departments for the relief models and for 19th-century sculpture.

          "This museum, already a grand building in itself, is a real wonderful museum. Especially its collection of paintings is superb, with dutch/flemish greats like Rubens, Breughel and van Dyck and also other great artists like the Picasso and the french impressionists. It is special",
          "This was really a fantastic place to visit. It is an art museum with wonderful collections. Gallery 17 was amazing - you could get so close to Van Gogh, Toulouse Lautrec, Monet, Rodin etc. On 3 floors there is something wonderful to see at each turn. Also 2 for 1 ticket if you",
          "I went primarily to see the historical maps on the basement. They did not disappoint! Well laid out and labelled they were a fascinating record of the history of northern French and Belgian towns.",
          "The paintings highlighted on the Palais website - Bosch, Breugel, Degas, Rodin, Matisse etc. - really are the highlights and unless you're really into 19th century neoclassicism and stock religious themes you may find many of the painting galleries and sculptures pretty heavy",
          "Best way to enjoy Sunday rainy afternoon, specially when it is first Sunday of the month and the entrance to the museum is free.",
          "The museum has a big collection of all ages/periods. It\u2019s not very busy so lots of space to wander around.",
          "The Palais des Beaux Arts is a must visit when in Lille. Beautiful works of art spanning from the 15th century to modern art.",
          "We were on a day trip to the Christmas markets, on arriving in Lille the heavens opened and we needed to escape from the downpours. We headed one stop past the centre on the metro and arrived at the gallery, which has a metro station directly outside. As we travelled to Lille on",
          "Wonderful setting for wonderful art. The collection was a bit smaller than we'd imagined, especially in such a spacious setting and while the ground floor collection is beautifully displayed some of the upper rooms feel under-lit - but overall a stunning art gallery. The map",
          "The collection isn't huge but it's varied and really good. The relief maps of the old towns in the lower ground, the sculptures around the atrium and the paintings on the first floor provided a couple of interesting and enjoyable hours. The helpful guy on the ticket desk said",
          "Really, if you love art, don\u2019t visit here. A beautiful building with paintings in an interior so gloomy that it\u2019s really difficult to see anything. In addition, some of them have darkened with age and could be cleaned, so the overall effect is extremely frustrating.",
          "Quite a find it was to visit such a gorgeous art museum in a relatively small city such as Lille. Amazing collection, from trully extraordinary modells of the old fortified cities of the region, through some great paintings, to the fabulous sculptures, among which, one of",

          "We spent over an hour here yesterday and although we had been before there were new exhibits and a well constructed section on artists and how they began. We were given a map but actually it was easy to find one\u2019s way round because every room was well signposted. There is a cafe",
          "Spent a couple of hours here wandering around the exhibits. Stunning place with loads to see. Particularly loved the impressionist section. There are a lot of paintings and sculptures so plenty to see, plus a temporary exhibition worthy of a visit until 6 January 2020. A jewel",
          "It has the usual permanent collection of a municipal art gallery plus a temporary exhibition space, but what makes this one unique is its collection of relief models of the surrounding towns and countryside. Marvel at the level of detail that went into the making of these 300",
          "The Palais de Beaux Arts is huge - but there is plenty of seating so take your time. Worth going up to the first floor where the \"serious\" stuff is housed. I spent most of my time in the (deserted) medieval galleries in the basement. Fabulous icons and ivories.",
          "This beautiful old building displays some of the art masters works, but not well. The lighting was poor in order to obtain a good clear view of many of the works, especially those high up. We were either stretching over the security devices to get a clearer view or having to",

          "A beautiful gallery in a stunning building, an easy walk from the town centre. You MUST make it a compulsory part of your Lille visit to see the stunning relief plans from the 17th & 18th centuries in the basement, absolutely beautiful. Watch out for opening times, like much",
          "We went to the museum on a Sunday and got free admission. Large bags to be left in the cloakroom free of charge. Museum on 3 levels. Ground floor very under-utilised. Cafe very expensive, avoid. Ground floor hosts sculptures & pottery inc Delph and Limoges. Upper floor hosts",

          "Compared to other French regional museums there is a partial emphasis on large religious paintings taken from Belgian churches. The most interesting paintings are masterpieces from lesser known artists and secondary but beautiful paintings from Rubens, Goya, Velasquez, Bosch,",

          "The museum is much smaller inside than it looks from outside. However is leaves with very pleasant feeling and has well-appointed collection of fine arts incl. very famous names. Absolute must if you are visiting Lille.",
          "On the west side of the city centre you can locate this marvellous building, currently have some upgrade and tidy up and so the fountains aren't on, but well worth your time to visit.",
          "Lille claims to be the second city of France and the Musee de Beaux-Arts de Lille is really splendid. If you have travelled to Lille by Eurostar you get two entries for the price of one. We did not have enough time as you could easily spend a day looking around and still have",
          "Nice art but not all of the exhibits were open. Nothing special but the outside of it is very pretty in a nice area of lille! Try and go on a Sunday since it should be free on one Sunday a month.",
          "I did have a great time visiting this Palais and exploring many paintings and sculptures in this institution. It was truly a cultural feast to see Monet\u2019s The London Parliament, Merson\u2019s Le Loup d\u2019Agubbio or Goya\u2019s Time and the Old Women. There is an audio guide available but",
          "Visited this museum while on a weekend in Lille, and really enjoyed our visit. The building is very imposing and there is plenty of art to see! The paintings are well displayed, and unlike other Beaux Art that I have visited did not have a propensity towards religious paintings.",
          "My husband and I were somewhat disappointed with our visit to the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille. We did not find the staff very welcoming or helpful to English speakers. The young man at the ticket desk volunteered no information and seemed uninterested in speaking with us.",
          "What an amazingly well curated gallery. Easy to follow plan and a true celebration of many masterpieces.",
          "The building is beautiful and worth a quick visit. There are a lot of paintings some more well known than others. If you enjoy this kind of visit and if the weather is cold outside then it is worth a wander. We were surprised to find out that on a Saturday you do not pay.",
          "We had a Lille Card so on a rainy afternoon, spent a couple of hours wandering around the museum. To be honest, we prefer history rather than art, but the building was very interesting.",
          "We visit this 'attraction' on Thursday 07 March 2019 and left very disappointed. Here are the reasons why: It is poorly signed from neighbouring streets and you only know you are there when close-by. The painting collection is very uniform: far too much religious-themed only",
          "This was on my list to visit and I was not disappointed. The building is imposing and well maintained. The paintings are varied and yes there are a lot of religious scenes but they were standard for the time. There were sculptures by Rodin, paintings by Constable, Napoleon,",
          "Was one of my targets for my Lille visit and was not disappointed. A mixture of paintings and sculptures of which, the paintings are the star of the show. I don't recall seeing a Rembrandt but just about ever other major artist over the last 500 years peeks out. Very",
          "The gallery is the second largest in France after the Louvre. It has some very famous paintings and a collection of pottery. There is a smallish cafe.",
          "Lovely building, great staff who kindly told us about the 2 for 1 ticket option if you have your Eurostar tickets with you. Everything is in French even the new interactive gigapixel experience where you can zoom into the detail of a few selected paintings. It took me ages to",
          "Excellent value and just half price entry if you show your Eurostar ticket. Amazing art and ancient artefacts",
          "Great building all well presented, spacious and light and airy. A few nice exhibits, with just enough to interest. No pretender at greatness, but we enjoyed a peaceful few hours. One famous Monet, and a small Rodin.",
          "This is a real gem of a museum located in Lille. The collection is fantastic and very reasonably priced to enter. Highly recommended, especially if you are after a huge variety of art under one roof. When we travelled (Feb 2019) you could get 2 for 1 entry with a Eurostar ticket.",
          "We went there several times, and saw some very good temporary exhibitions, like the one about Millet. Outside of special exhibitions, I have been a bit disappointed by the permanent collection that I found a bit too common for such a big city as Lille.",
          "The Palais des Beaux Artes is a wonderful building. Make sure to watch the history presentation in the relaxing area on the main floor. While the building is magnificent, the exhibit itself is scattered, lacking direction. The antiquities section was closed when we visited. The",
          "A huge building housing lots of art. Paintings and sculptures as well as temporary exhibitions. The lighting isn\u2019t always good but plenty of different styles and art periods.",
          "I liked this museum, but agree with some of the other reviewers that the lighting in the museum is a serious problem. Too dark or too bright. Also the collection does not seem very logically arranged and it is hard to navigate the place. Explanations/discussions of art work",
          "Give it a minimum of half a day and take time, as we did to explore the collection. El Grecos, Goyas, Monets Vuillards are all to be enjoyed. The basement has some good medieval artefacts and paingings and there is an amazing Donatello bas - relief which should not be missed.",
          "After reading other reviews we thought this worth a visit, as it said it was only second to the Louvre. It cost \u20ac14 for two of us, but I would have to say it wasn't worth the money. Some areas are so dark you can hardly see the items on display, and the art is not varied",
          "Rather disappointing. We got in on a 2for1 deal using our Eurostar ticket but there is very little to guide you around once you are in. Endless rooms of paintings with poor lighting, no presentation and no explanation of the exhibits other than title artist etc in French. No",
          "Wonderful building, not too busy when we were there, helpful staff, average collection of art compared to galleries in major cities, and a nice way to get out of the Lille sun/rain. TOP TIP: KEEP YOUR EUROSTAR TICKET - IT GIVES YOU A 2 FOR 1 DEAL so the gallery is pretty good",
          "Seems to be half price admission, or two for one, for Eurostar travellers. Great art gallery with some fabulous paintings by Picasso, Klimt, Breughel, Bosch and many more.",
          "The audio commentary was one an ipod and no headphones available so you could hear people listening to this, which was very offputting. Also some of the pictures that had symbols against them, ie should have commentary, did not. I'd have liked more translations of the",
          "The art available for viewing was ok. Then I made the mistake of ordering a slice of pizza for lunch. Twenty-five minutes later I was finally served my meal. It was not worth the wait. I didn\u2019t expect much but the wait was annoying when the food was so mediocre.",
          "The collection of Palais des Beaux Arts is interesting, although a bit limited when compared to other French cities. The infrastructure of the place seems to be decaying. Toilettes completely out of order. Deficient WiFi. The local caf\u00e9 employs the grumpiest people in France.",
          "The Palais has plenty of worthwhile art, enough to fill a rainy afternoon like we had. However, it's the Beau Caf\u00e9 which did its best to spoil our visit; given the weather, we planned to eat there, and called in at 12:50pm, only to find a sign which said it was closed until",
          "Visited Lille on a Sunday, museum is one of the few things open on a Sunday. The art collection is really world class. The military plans-reliefs were undergoing restoration until March 2019, really wish I could have seen them as it appears larger than the collection at Hotel",
          "Amazing range of artists covered here. I started on the first floor (suggest having a coffee first!) and worked my way round all the schools of art. Then a decent meal with wine in the bright (daylight-lit) atrium, followed by exploring the rest of the building.",
          "Mainly an art gallery, but laid out in sensible sections (geography, era) and not too overwhelming. A great place for a visit maybe have a quickish tour round most of it on a first visit then return to look in detail at sections that interest you. During 2018 the military",
          "Its a nice museum, especially if you like paintings. You can see some peintures de van Dyck, RuBENS, Monet etc.Its disadvantage is the lack of English translation on the written commentaries next to the paintings but also for quite a number of them presented by tha audio guide.",
          "We spent an hour and a half here at this attraction in Lille,but you could easily spend a few hours here.If you are visiting Lille from British Eurostar,you get can get a 2 for 1 deal on entry tickets by showing staff your Eurostar tickets. This attraction doesn\u2019t allow",
          "What I really wanted to see, the military town models, are being renovated, you just have access to the workshop with a few segments on tables. The rest of the building feels like London\u2019s National Gallery, but less crowded. Statuary and fine art in lots of rooms, nicely",
          "Currently they are renovating part of the font of the building, as well as the part where the 3D displays of the towns and fortifications are kept. However, the rest of the museum is open. The museum is a bit of a labyrinth, but one can do it pseudo chronologically, with the",
          "Although not massive art enthusiasts, we spent about 2 hours looking at the works here. The cafe also does a lovely latte",
          "Although the museum is undergoing restoration it\u2019s still worth a visit. It\u2019s 7 euros with a free audio guide. The art is interesting and the medieval and Renaissance art on the basement level is especially worth a look. There is plenty to see regardless of you preference",
          "Nice collection of art pieces, devided in three flours. In 0 you can mainly find statues of the 19th century, in -1 medieval and a few antique pieces - as two very nice Dirk van Boutes and in 1 art after the 15th century. The contemporary Art collection is tiny but the modern",

          "I would highly recommend a visit to this fantastic art museum and stunning building! Not expensive to enter and you can spend hours just browsing.",
          "Experiencing the interior of the building itself is probably worth the price of admission, which is not very much for a museum of this stature (7 euro for adults, kids under a certain age free). An I-pod guide to the museum was included in the admission fee, which was a nice",
          "This is closed on certain days so check opening times. If you go late the entrance fee is reduced from 7 euros to 4 but we only had 45 mins which is nowhere near enough. But to see astounding works by Goya, Chagall, Picasso, Renoir, Monet and Brueghel among others for that price",
          "The forecast was for sustained rain, so this was the day to devote to the fine arts! What a wonderful collection of paintings, sculptures and other visual art objects. We used the free i-pod tour guides which helped us towards a better understanding of the artists and their",

          "A very good art gallery/ museum. Well worth a visit. They are having renovations at present. The entrance is tucked away in a corner on the right hand side.",
          "This museum is the 2nd most important art museum outside of Paris, so we were told. Entrance fee is 7 euros with no discounts for pensioners. Museum is undergoing major refurbishment to the exterior which was a shame as the bits that we could see looked beautiful. Go round the",
          "This museum is fantastic. The atrium is newly renovated and the space feels bright and open. The staff were friendly. The collection is vast but presented so well: there are modern counterpoints to the paintings on the upper floor, as the museum currently has a feature",
          "When you are in Lille, And you want to kill some time and experience nice museum this place is a must place to visit in terms of culture and history",
          "Brilliant venue, forward thinking, warm welcome, brilliant art, relaxing and totally un-stuffy. There was a really creative exhibition dotted around the various galleries while we were there, weaving modern cultural references to fine art by using examples such as clips from tv",
          "the art of the 17th-19th century consumes the majority of the space .. we are more interested in the late 19th and 20th century which is offered in only two rooms .. a beautiful Sonia Delaunay and a really nice Poliakoff .. various Nabis works .. also interesting El Greco's and",
          "We were very impressed with this magnificent building. A great range of exhibits No concessions for seniors but we got in 2 for 1 with our Eurostar tickets Well worth a look",
          "We looked around the museum at the lovely art collections they have and also really enjoyed the ceramic collection. Food in the cafe is REALLY expensive",
          "Not only does this museum have a very good and diverse collection of art but the building it self is worth the modest entrance fee just to wonder through. It's large but easy to navigate and when we visited only a few people were inside and they were mostly around the special",
          "Most of the names of the painters in this museum will be familiar to museum-goers, but few of the paintings are themselves famous. But the consequences of this is that there are not a lot of tourists jamming the exhibition halls. And there are some very fine pieces, including",
          "I love the place! Just adore it. First of all this museum gives you an opportunity to visit the it in paces: the ticket is valid the whole day. You start your visit in the morning and after a while you can go outside, have a lunch or coffee, take a break giving yourself time to",
          "This gallery is said to be second only to the Louvres in Paris - and it is magnificent. The building itself is lofty, bright, spacious and airy. It contains a large collection of paintings. There are paintings by Rubens, Watteau, Fragonard and other well known names but also a",

          "Lille is an excellent city trip alternative, also for art lovers. The Beaux Arts museum in the city centre has art from the 16th to 20th century. It is a beautiful building, relaxed in atmosphere and no queues. A good place to spend a few hours",
          "If you love art galleries this is the place for you. Wish we had used the linked up earphones now as you get a more detailed insight into each piece. Will defo do that this year. If you have come by Eurostar take your tickets as they give you 50% discount. Its also a nice",
          "I really enjoyed visiting this massive museum, featuring a huge number of paintings from various prominent artists and periods. Of particular interest is the current installation on TV series that are based on works of art. The building is very beautiful too. I spent about 2 and",
          "We went to see the Rubens. We stayed for a whole lot more. Extensive collections of 15th-17th century Flemish art, Impressionism, and decorative arts. We were surprised to find a good number of Courbet, including one of his Ornans paintings. The special exhibit while we",
          "The art collection itself is nicely organized and hits all the high spots. Better than the collection is the building; it is stunning. They seemed to have lots of activities for kids too.",
          "This is an incredible building (both in terms of size and architecture) but unfortunately it is mainly covered in scaffolding at the moment. The inside exhibitions are definitely worth a visit but I think they could do more with the space (it does feel a bit sparse in places -",
          "The layout of this building is strange and seems to be undergoing renovation at all levels. We found some interesting paintings, but were not overwhelmed. We had looked forward to tea and cake in the cafe, but were hugely disappointed as the caf\u00e9 area is small and does not have",
          "Wonderful collection of art, friendly staff and quiet, lovely cafe. Interesting works of art from impressionism, to flemish and dutch art. Had a wonderful afternoon here, and recommend it highly",

          "I really liked the feel of this gallery, there was a sculpture and interesting ceramics collection on the ground floor and various painting collections upstairs. It wasn\u2019t too clear which bits you paid for so we didn\u2019t see it all. Very relaxing place to spend a couple of hours",
          "This is an outstanding art gallery and we'll worth a visit. The entry hall has been transformed into an excellent facility with free wi-fi, a good caf\u00e9 serving home made food at a reasonable price, and also has sofas to drink your coffee in comfort! A vast improvement!",
          "Paintings I had only heard of displayed in their full glory. Amazed and delighted, good layout, excellent guide and fab bookshop for your souvenirs. If you are lucky and visit on the first Sunday of the month entrance if free.",

          "Wasn't clear which parts were free and which weren't but we walked round the ground floor and the upper floor; some interesting pieces. Cafe was average, not a great selection or enough tables.",
          "Visited for a couple of hours. The museum was undergoing refurbishment but using our two for one entry via our Eurostar tickets it was good value and worth s visit if you enjoy arts. The cafe looked disappointing so we chose up leave and visit a nearby coffee shop.",
          "Loved this gallery even though it is currently under some renovation there is plenty to see. The ground floor atrium including statue / sculpture gallery and decorative arts is currently free so if you have a spare half hour in Lille this is a must. The painting gallery upstairs",
          "Beautiful museum and a vast collection of works. We visited on the first Sunday of the month, so the entry was free. The coat check was fast and secure and the clerks were very friendly (and spoke English). We could have easily spent all day admiring the collection. This is",
          "This museum should top your list if you enjoy art, especially the great masters. The museum was renovated recently and the guest map is inadequate. As is the case with the Louvre in Paris there are not enough toilets. The caf\u00e9 is billed as having snacks and small things to eat",
          "Walked past here yesterday and never thought we\u2019d go in but apparently the first Sunday of every month is free to enter day. Nice place to go on a particularly rainy day. Good security in here as well bags checked and pockets emptied Very nice building lots to see especially",

          "The museum is a lot smaller than the Louvre museum in Paris, means less exhausting. They have an amazing collection. The free audio guide was superhandy and highlighted one or two artworks in every room. Famous works are \"Young women\" and \"Old women\" from Goya, \"Census at",

          "We were told that this musee has one of the largest art collections outside of Paris and we were certainly not disappointed. As always with large galleries, it makes sense to concentrate on one part rather than expose yourself to serious cultural overload. I opted for the top",
          "A nice museum, with the most unhelpful staff on the ticket desk. They didn't offer me a map or guide (I had to ask), and when I took an audio guide (which they also didn't offer) the headphones didn't work and the battery ran out half way through. Some of the key paintings were",
          "We were here for a couple hours on our visit to Lille, and it was well worth it. The museum itself is quite beautiful, and we loved the enormous modernist hanging sculptures in the entry. There were not a lot of \"masterpieces\" here, yet they had some standouts by Bruegel,",
          "I dropped a star here, because I didn't manage to find my way to the sculpture collection. Not sure if that was a result of the current refurbishment or me being ditzy. There is an excellent and varied collection of work on display here. Picasso, Van Gogh, Goya, Velazquez,",
          "Plenty to see as you wander around this beautiful space. Make sure you ask for an audio guide before you set off so you get the most out of the museum. Entry is free unless you want to go upstairs to the galleries. With our eurostar ticket we go a deal - buy one entry to the",
          "Not as good as the guide book suggested - a few clear masterpieces by eg Rubens, Brueghel, but a lot of inferior works including by well-known painters. A good gallery space however and an outstanding but simple cafe.",
          "there are many things to see in the museum, ranges from decorative arts, paintings and catholic figures.",
          "As a wet weather activity in Lille this is very worthwhile doing with some fine paintings through the ages. Very Good for an hour or two.",
          "This museum is located in an interesting building, though I forgot to ask about its history. The layout is simple, with a central round square, and around it one ring of halls. To me the most impressive part is the hall on the left, with three large paintings, about the",
          "This is a large collection of art and instead of becoming overwhelmed, we downloaded their App which gave us fascinating audio descriptions of some of their 'favourites'. It meant that we got so much more out of the works that we viewed and stopped at many that we would",
          "The relief maps in the basement were for me the most impressive thing there. A must if you're interested in maps at all.",
          "Looked like a lovely building behind the scaffolding, which was a shame. Collection is eclectic and spread out - could do with better signage. We didn't opt for the audio tour, but probably should have - especially for the artefacts below ground. Happy to see a couple of",

          "They say this is the second largest museum of France, the Louvre is number one ofcourse. It has certainly a very large collection of art and is worth visiting when you ared an art lover..a must in fact. It has a very large collection of paintings, Goya, Rubens, Courbet are just",

          "Don't forget to use the 2 for 1 offer on your Eurostar tickets! Plenty of art work to see, lots of famous artists, though many are difficult to see as they're mounted so high. All in all, worth the money-especially with the discount. Allow an hour an a half to whizz round.",
          "First of all I regret to say that the staff appear to be rather blas\u00e9 and not at all interested in welcoming you as we were sent from from pillar to post 'pas cette caisse', 'la caisse \u00e2 c\u00f4t\u00e9' without a bonjour or merci. Also the staff in the various rooms were engrossed in",

          "I was surprised by the breadth of the collection, with some very beautiful works on display. The exhibits are well organised, with rooms grouped either by medium (sculpture, painting) and/or period. The building itself I thought to be rather impressive too. The staff were very",
          "A really good collection of religious arts and of course a mini show on Napoleon. During our vist there was an interactive exhibition on a French comic author intertwined into the historic exhibits. If Paris is too far away, Lille gives you a great alternative for the Louvre.",
          "We stopped here in the afternoon and didn't have as much time as we would've liked although we did get a discount for the afternoon arrival. Its a really nice museum, my boyfriend was really excited by the town models, only wish we'd had more time to explore a bit more",
          "There are a lot of different items on exhibition over several floors are sections of a large impressive building. Chances are there is something you will enjoy. If you are an Arts/Museum enthusiast, this could easily fill a whole day. Cost was reasonable.",
          "This gallery contains a truly surprising number of magnificent paintings by the great Masters, in addition to smaller collections of sculptures and artifacts. For us, however, the highlight was the collection of restored models of fortress cities, housed in the basement. There",

          "Visited on a Sunday morning, efficient at getting in and through security and through the entrance billeterie. It's a big building, supposedly the second largest are museum behind La Louvre but it' s honestly a bit short of works to exhibit. The impressionist gallery is nice",
          "\u20ac4 to get in for a student is a good price. Real mixture of all sorts there from sculptures, fine art, statues, artefacts, modern art, and coolest of all (I think) dioramas or maps of local towns and cities. Easy to waste a few hours here, easy to get too aswell via metro.",
          "My partner and I visited the museum unsure as to whether we were going to enjoy it, as neither of us are real art experts. However when we got there, it was immediately obvious that there was so much to see that we could pick and choose what interested us. The descriptions of",

          "It would be very hard to sum up all that is to be seen in this magnificent gallery. We spent an afternoon rapt by the incredible selection of interestingly grouped works: a few Monets, a Picasso, a handful of Rubens, some jaw-dropping 15th century triptychs and stunning 17th",
          "If you have a couple of hours spare then this is well worth a visit. 4 euros to get in (closed Tuesday) so really good value. Some fabulous works of art from some very famous artists. There is a huge open space downstairs which is a great space for chilling or reflecting/",

          "There's a lot of art on show at this museum which will take at least a couple of hours to get around. Mostly the art is pre 19th century so there's a great deal of paintings with a religious subject. Personally I preferred the impressionist section and the sculpture's. At any",
          "I mean its OK museum. Probably the landmark of Lille. The collection is quit big and interior design is very nice. They have different collections. I think its kid of first thing to do in Lille - visit this museum.",

          "We had an enjoyable 4 hours looking at the various artworks. No English subtitles like the Louvre. We used free audio guide but only very select pieces have English commentary. Great value for 7 euros.",
          "I was here in July during a weekend trip to Lille. I think the museum is well worth a visit as is displays one of the largest art collection outside Paris. The collection is quite eclectic, with paintings from various time periods (some Manet, Monet also there), sculptures, etc.",
          "Advertised as the second greatest arts museum in France, we were underwhelmed. And, we had not yet been to the Louvre. We expected a much larger museum, many more objects and of a higher quality. Unless you are in Lille for another reason, we do not recommend spending the",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to this art gallery. We arrived lunchtime on a Sunday, and walked straight in, which worked out to be good timing, as by 3pm, the queue went around the outside of the building. Was thrilled to see Monet, Rodin, Rubens, Manet and many other Masters. Well",
          "We visited the Palais on the weekend of the Festival, although it is usually free on the first Sunday of the month, September is generally an exception because of the Festival. But because the Braderie had been cancelled it was free as usual. It tries to attract by mentioning it",

          "We very much enjoyed our trip to Palais des Beaux-Arts. It is a nice big airy space which has lots of paintings and sculptures. The cafe was also good if not a bit expensive. The place is definitely worth a visit. Bare in mind that if you want to borrow a free audio guide you",

          "The 'Beaux-Arts' exhibits are, in general, less than special although there are a few gems. I don't need to highlight them - they will shout at you! The whole visit took us around three hours but a sizeable chunk of that time was spent watching the creation (as live animation)",

          "Compared to the great parish galleries, this left me cold. Three of us with different tastes all felt the same",

          "The museum is animated by a cartoonist just now, his works flashing up between the regular treasures. It's drawing a young crowd. Some exceptional works ... I was most pleased by a Brueghel.",
          "This gallery is the second biggest fine arts one in France and well worth a visit. We saw paintings from 16th to 20th century along with French comic \"Zep\" cartoon videos throughout the gallery. These were great fun!",
          "A moderate size art collection that can be seen in a morning or afternoon. Good for adults and children. We particularly enjoyed the temporary exhibit done by Zep which added a bit of humour to classic art!",
          "this is an amazing space and space is what you get. Compared to similar institutions in other countries eg National Gallery in the UK it does not have as much to see and involves a lot of walking to see what there is. Still, a very interesting few hours wandering around",

          "We visited the museum for two hours, which gave us enough time to see everything we wanted and a bit of unexpected comical relief on top of that. We were introduced to 'Zep', the comic artist responsible for the character Titeus, in the statue hall on the ground floor. A Beamer",
          "As my hobby is photographing art in museums, I was fairly pleased with a large number of the works on display. Sometimes the lighting wasn't the best, but there was enough light for many good photos with my camera set up, which is optimized for hand-held low-light photography.",
          "This museum is well laid out an easy to navigate. There are art collections across the ages, including some really splendid church icons and screens from the middle ages. For me the real gem was the models of the fortress towns on the northern French border to be found on the",
          "Well worth the entrance price (7 euros) for a comprehensive trip through European art history. The circular sofas are brilliant for a lie-down now and again, and the little comic strip videos explain stuff in easy-to-understand terms. No-one minded a toddler running about,",
          "This museum is amazing. It is at the start simple but... A city museum with Rodin statues, Van Gogh and zadkine... It is an huge building with amazing great architecture. Well worth the 7,- entrance fee.",

          "Great Museum of Morden Art. It is worth a visit if you in Lille. It has some great sculptures. The downstairs models from a series of French towns from 17th to 18th century. Audioguilde is free and I recommend you take as it brings the history of the works in life. Not all works",
          "Visited Palais des Beaux Arts on our first full day in Lille and it was definitely worthy of a visit. The 7\u20ac entrance fee was well worth it (and we wish we had noted the 2-for-1 offer on the Eurostar website) The museum is made up of a number of areas - a big central area with",

          "I have visited this museum four times. The museum has a remarkable collection of paintings from different periods. You could find Monet, Leger, Rubens, Goya, Brueghel, van Gogh, among others. They have one of the finest collections of paintings outside Paris without a doubt. On",
          "There was a time...when Lille and Flanders (Flemish speaking region of Belgium) wore closely linked, even politically and certainly culturally. Nowadays, Lille is a very important economic pole in the Nord, but the cultural part has not been neglected. As a proof, this wonderful",

          "A grand building with a clever modern extension. Permanent collection of old french art and when we went they temporary collection was Joie de Vivre which was well worth the additional \u20ac10 entry fee. No charge for main collection. Located at the end of the main shopping area",
          "A large collection of lesser known art from well known artists. Rubens, Rodin etc. plenty of space and even the guided tours are politely non intrusive to other visitors, they don't dominate the room by shouting loudly as in some places. Highly recommended.",
          "This is a wonderful museum that you can see in half a day and worth a weekend trip to visit. There are a fair number of Rubens, Brueghels and Sisleys , the Rococo collection is very nice and the few Greek pieces are outstanding. Military buffs will enjoy the relief maps of about",

          "Spent a few hours in here avoiding the rain. Visited their temporary exhibit - \"Joie De Vivre\" which will end on 17 January 2016. Excellent. The Museum is large so I only had time to visit the Religious Arts and Plans-reliefs section in the basement. Fascinating place",
          "We spent a happy couple of ours walking the wide corridors and galleries taking in the wide range of art work, ancient and not so ancient relics. The pleasant experience was enhanced by the lack of crowds so we were able to take it all at our own pace. If you travelled by",

          "I have promised myself a visit to this prestigious gallery ever since it reopened after lengthy refurbishment, but it disappointed me. The art collection on display was mostly the less good works of famous artists, Lifts were out of order so difficuly to access basement",
          "Very classical museum with a huge collection well worth the visit. The collection spans several centuries of mainly European art and contains several works that are worth seeing. A bit to many religiously inspired works for my liking. On the ground floor there are 2 wings that",
          "Joie de Vivre is a fantastic exhibit: it's full of life and fun. It's hard not to leave feeling inspired, illuminated and pretty cheered up. The museum has a lot of great and famous paintings too. It's got some fantastic medieval art too.",
          "Friends had told me that this museum was a \"must\": they are right in every sense. The museum is hosting an art collection from Antiquity to the contemporary period (although the latter is probably better represented in the Villeneuve d'Ascq museum), hereby strictly focusing on",
          "There are some good paintings here spread across genres and they are well organised. It was disappointing to find the relief map room shut during our visit but it happens! Well worth a visit and reasonable entry fee of 7 euros",
          "Well, it seems these Americans do not find in Europe anything for their own standards. I think this museum is worth seeing. I was just lucky or....I had no such problems mentioned by all these people. We walked to the museum, emjoying an icecream. The people at the reception",
          "For the time and effort it took us on a driving trip to visit the Palais des Beaux Art (we parked in the garage next to it - very tight spaces), we will go elsewhere in the future. The collection on display is interesting, but few works grabbed us. One that did is a bronze,",
          "I'm not sure if it was done on purpose (to protect the old masters), but these beautiful paintings do really deserve better lightning! The building is fantastic and the paintings are divided by time-period and country of origin. The spacious rooms (with high ceilings) are packed",

          "There was an exhibition on but we just went around the main exibits. The word I would use for the gallery of paintings is eclectic. There was no apparent pattern to the way they were displayed and more could have been made of them. There were some very beautiful sculptures.",
          "The museum was one of the first museums in Paris established under the instructions of Napoleon I and is now one of the largest museums in France, and the largest French museum outside of Paris. It is a tremendous building with lovely fountains and statues in the front. Having",
          "The Gallery itself has a magnificent collection but the current Joie de Vivre is exceptionally good! From Picasso to Lichtenstein, every room brought smiles to our faces.....very well hung,with lots of seating, the curator has created a masterpiece of fun. Go and see it!",
          "Nice place to go if you enjoy to spend time culturally. The place is awesome from architectural point of view and has great painting collection.",
          "Some interesting art here but poor lighting and display lets it down. Having just visited the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam the curator of the Beaux Arts could take a few tips from the Dutch! AAmmAmsterdam the",
          "A wonderful museum with a rich painting collection. One of the must-see places in Lille, and not so expensive after all (4\u20ac for students, on Sunday free entry)",
          "A real gem of an art gallery, although there's almost too many paintings. The joie de vivre exhibition is fabulous. I suggest they shouldn't hang paintings above other ones - they end up being too high to view properly. Sadly, the caf\u00e9's appalling.",
          "A beautiful building with interesting architecture housing some of the paintings by many of the most famous artists especially French artists including the Impressionists, also examples from El Greco, Valezquez, Goya, Picasso, Marc Chagall as well as a beautiful Turner painting.",
          "We loved everything about this museum; a fantastic collection of eighteenth and nineteenth century European art in a glorious space. At the time we were lucky to view the works of the \u201cinterDuck collective\u201d a group of artists \u201cwho promote the idea that ducks have inspired",
          "Agreed to meet at the cafe inside the Palais des Beaux Arts.This turned out to be a big mistake as it was probably one of the worst ever!!! Terrible food and little variety. The whole place seemed rather soulless compared to many other major galleries.",
          "An amazing museum and even the ambience outside is so mesmerizing. moreover it is the second most viewed museum in France after Museum de Louvre",
          "Not an enormous museum despite the hype - this actually makes it very doable. A good selection of ceramics, some excellent statue work and a range of paintings - also quite a lovely interior to the building. There is a small cafe which serves tea, coffee, wine and some",
          "The museum houses a wide collection of arts. We even found a Van Gogh amoungst the paintings. We were a bit unfortunate in that we had just missed a large exhibition there though there were plenty of permanant arts there. One thing I was facinated with was the 3D scaled maps on",
          "In this beautiful art gallery/museum there is so much to see over the three floors, covering paintings, statues, china and other artefacts, that you need to allow yourself several hours to do it. I understand you get two-for-one entry with your used Eurostar tickets, but we'd",
          "We visited the museum never expecting to find such treasures. We spent a couple of hours here and enjoyed all of it. Would definitely recommend a visit, but steer clear of the gravlax salmon and potato.....it left me thirsty for days!!",
          "Typical square within this department of France. Pleasant place to either sit at a cafe for coffee or petit dejeuner or to sit by the fountain with a sandwich. Good architecture with considerable Flemish influence. The only downside is the number of what appeared to be",
          "This was a must see place, and we are glad we made the effort to go and wander round. there is a charge for this place but its not much and is most defiantely worth it if you are into looking at art and old fashioned items",
          "nice open spaces with lots to see..... we were a family of ages 16 up to 49 and there was something for everyone to enjoy either art or statues",
          "Regional crafts and all kind of historical samples (often religious). Very interesting to visualize the mixed influences of cultures where Lille is at the center. Many models of the cities, how they looked at the Middle Age. An at least two hour tour among this interesting",
          "The Palais des Beaux Arts collection is second only to the Louvre in France. It is unbelievable how close you can get to numerous pieces by famous artists. A must see.",
          "Very well organised and quite informative. Good facility and ancient environment. Makes you feel great. Left impressed. Recommended :)",
          "Second only to the Louvre in Paris, but without the crowds or headache of lines! Magnificent collection, much of it displayed in enormously tall rooms (often gallery style). Brueghels to Delacroix; Goya to van Gogh, and some fascinating medieval and Renaissance collections.",
          "This a magnificent building which was completely renovated a few years ago. It used to have a splendid terrace restaurant which sadly is no more - just a rather dismal little snack area. Admittedly it's August so notice happens bit I've been here twice before in August and the",
          "I visited this art museum while in Lille, France on vacation. Fine art museum - many interesting pieces and well displayed. Really worth a visit! Building itself was interesting, but would be a challenge for anyone with mobility issues. I visited while there was VERY strange",
          "This museum contained a large and varied collection of artwork and was worth spending half a day there. One can have lunch in the informal cafeteria as well. Glad we saw it.",
          "Our French speaker got us our tickets and after a bag search, we were directed to the media desk to pick up our head phones for the tour, unfortunately, only two of us had a drivers licence or a passport, so they would only allow two headsets out. The people in front of us were",
          "We spent FIVE HOURS in this museum, something that I have never done in my life. One reason why was the extraordinarily interesting and useful audioguide, which is free (upon the temporary surrendering of some form of identification). The collection doesn't have headliners,",
          "It can honestly be named as one of the highlights of the holiday. I could never have imagined to have seen work from the greats such as Renoir, Picasso, Van Gough and Monet as well as several others in such a surprisingly location. The building enough will blow you away with",
          "The second important artmuseum after the Louvre... That sets some high expectations. The artwork is plentiful and nice, but the arrangement and light spoil a lot of the mood. Because of the light it's difficult to see many paintings without the light reflections.",
          "We went in towards the end of the day (16.00) and discovered the price reduced from 7\u20ac to 4 at 16.30. So we spent our saving on delicious ice creams and waited half an hour. The draw back to this was that 90 minutes just wasn't long enough to enjoy the great works of art in this",
          "Would you believe that during the tourist season all the museums in Lille are closed on a single weekday. They don't even work different days - all closed together. There were a lot of tourists walking around the city with not much to do and I'm guessing they won't be",
          "Not to be missed, very interesting, something for everyone. Helpful staff and guides available in English",
          "A great way to spend some quality time with some quality Art! LOVED the Monet works and was able to sit in peace and just look...not an overcrowded museum, very stylish...make sure you bring some picture I.D. For the audio description equipment.",
          "Impressive building, large spaces filled to the brink with impressive art, whether you like Dutch or French medieval art, Italian renaissance, or more modern paintings. Lots of Baroque and als 19th century art. I especially loved the paintings by Odilon Redon.",
          "We spent a very enjoyable morning here at the Palais des Beaux Arts. The collection includes some very interesting paintings and sculptures. I'd recommend picking up a free audio guide.",
          "There's something about a grand French gallery. And this one has that something in spades! It's a grand building, with a fine collection laid out sympathetically. There's an inevitable but understandable emphasis on flemish painting. And there's a quirky little cafe",
          "We visited the museum as a place of interest and not because we knowledgable or have an undying love of Art. WOW were we surprised. Magnificient looking building and Parking on hand makes it an easy accessible place to visit. Due to the size of the permanent collection, This",
          "At the time of our visit there was an exhibition by a german collective of artists who has redrawn many famous paintings to include Donald Duck and his friends. Some of the originals where in The Musee des beaux Arts but some are to be found else where. We had great fun tracking",
          "Good selection of paintings but the lighting could be improved because it bounces off the paintings, but we found that common to all of the galleries in Lille. Think the palaver of handing in one's driving license or passport as security for a rather battered looking audio",
          "A terrific collection of artwork by major artists and an eclectic mixture of sculpture, paintings and artefacts. Only slightly marred by a bizarre Donald Duck exhibit woven in between phenomenal works of art.",
          "This collection claims to be one of the five largest museums in France, and the largest outside Paris - we believe those claims. Tickets to this attraction were not overly expensive, and additionally factoring in a promotional offer from our cross-channel travel provider made",
          "Monet, Manet, Rodin, all the greats represented in this beautiful building. Sculptures, paintings, ceramics, artifacts, and also, when we were there, a special duck theme!",

          "Wonderfully curated museum. Spacious exhibit rooms provide for a uncluttered visit. Great examples of noted Flemish artists (maybe too much). Three complaints: secured audio guide but not many works were included in guide. Too often those that were numbered and supposedly",
          "Even if you already did the museum, the new exhibition is funny, informative and very interesting for art and non-art lovers. A must see once you are in Lille (This exhibition is there until 5 july 2015)",
          "If you are in Lille with any time to spare, you should visit the Palais to broaden your mind. Lots of death & suffering scenes in the older works of art. Some nice later works. The Donald Duck thing was a distraction, not for me and I am in no way \"high-brow\"",
          "Best bit? The tapestries and wall hangings, which is what this part of France was all about. Not so good? Well, all the impressionists are in Paris I suppose.",
          "I visited here last week having been years ago. I didn't remember it being so poor. The lighting is very poor and the paintings all looked as if they could do with a clean. On top of that there was a silly Donald Duck exhibition with some of the paintings being depicted in",
          "The art is well displayed and the relief maps were particularly interesting. The 'Le Canard du Musee' - Donald Duck in Art was great fun. The visit was spoiled by the level of noise from students, pupils and even museum staff. No one expects museums to be quiet but shouting and",
          "The day we were to spend in Lille turned out to be a Bank Holiday for them and everything including transport was cancelled! We swapped our days and came back to Lille the next day. Having heard that this museum was the second in importance to the Louvre, we decided to visit",
          "This museum was on the top of our list for our visit to Lille and it did not disappoint. There was a great range of paintings and sculptures, including many very famous artists. There were also an interesting number of paintings where Donald Duck substituted figures in original",
          "This was a great surpise. The museum is located in a beautiful building and has a surpisingly good selction. On the first floor they have paintings, sculptures on the ground floor and in the basement they have medieval art and maquettes from the a couple of towns. I enjoyed this",
          "We had the fortune to visit this museum during the annual museum night, during which it was open for free until midnight. The palace itself is incredibly majestic, and the art pieces attractively displayed. To attract children, the crazy art collective called Interduck has",
          "For a young or old traveller, this museum offers a good overview of European (not only French) art. Museum is spacious, covers three floors, numerous halls, rooms and balconies. It is not busy at all, so you can relax and fully enjoy each painting or sculpture (make sure you",
          "Couldn't find any information in English not even a floor plan- no offer of audio so don't know if they were available in English. Loved the decorative arts section - beautiful pieces . As we had no map had to ask for everything. Where were paintings in my limited French? Loved",
          "They have a 'Donald Duck' exhibition on at the moment, with fine art pieces re-imagined using Donald Duck's family and other Disney characters. The pieces are dotted around the gallery and they're hilarious.",
          "A short walk from la Grand Place, the Palais Beaux Arts is well worth a visit. The building itself is very imposing - it really is a palace, all sweeping staircases, domes and stained glass. The 19th century art collection is particularly good - some Monets, Redons and Van Goghs",
          "We enjoyed our visit but when we were there they had a Donald Duck exhibition and had replaced quite a few of the pieces of art with copies which involved ducks. Would have preferred if they had left the originals with the duck version beside.",
          "This marked my third visit to this museum. The collection is superb, the second most important in all of France, the objects themselves, and their composition absolutely delightful, moving, and edifying, and never, ever, anywhere, have I heard better, more instructive, or more",
          "We went to Lille for Eastern, and unlike myself, did not do any research before we were in the city. Happily noticed that the museum was open even in the first day of Eastern. Went there to have a look, and lost myself in the museum for about 4 hours( would probably spend more",
          "We were lucky enough to be in Lille on the first Sunday of the month, so we got FREE entrance and audio guide! The museum is a beautiful building on the outside and has incredible master pieces in the inside. Even if you have to pay the 7\u20ac fee, I would say it's a must if you",
          "We wandered around here whilst on a day trip to Lille. We practically had the place to ourselves which was refreshing for a major museum. a nice mix of art on display. Worth seeking out if you have the time and like art.",
          "Outside of anything in Paris, this is the largest art museum in France and it is beautiful! The antiquities are beyond description. Don't miss it!",
          "There is such a wealth of different things to see in this museum - from eighteenth century china, to sculpture, to paintings from the middle ages and the renaissance through to modern art. The price of the ticket includes an audio-guide (but you will need some form of",
          "The artworks in this gallery are great, particularly the collection of impressionists. The audio guide which is delivered through an ipod touch (which was lent to visitors) was hopeless.",
          "a little further away from the centre of Lille but it was worth the walk. There are many art students sketching and painting which is very interesting to watch.",
          "This beautiful building houses much interesting art. Although much from Middle Ages and onwards, they also have some interesting contemporary art. My favourite was van Gog's cows which he based on an older painting from another painter, which painting they cleverly hung next to",
          "A nice museum with good exhibitions. Especially the audiotour is nice. I loved the details they give you on the paintings. Lovely works of Rubens, Brueghel, etc....",
          "Plenty to see over a couple of hours ranging over several centuries and different categories of art. Also good cafe and shop",
          "For a wet February morning in Lille, this was the ideal place to go. Fascinating collections of art, porcelain and sculpture covering a host of different eras, from 15th century religious paintings to works by Monet, Renoir and Picasso, as well as a number of Rodin sculptures.",
          "Lots to see in this magnificent building. A great range from early Flemish paintings to the impressionists. We thoroughly enjoyed the visit and were impressed with the variety and quality of art.",
          "A great selection of fine art ( more National Gallery than Tate Gallery ) the basement area is a bit of a mixed bag of artifacts with some models of historical town layouts which may be of limited interest.",
          "Not so crowded, space to move, excellent iPod self tour free with ticket ( need to leave Id as security). A gem of a museum. Great mix of ancient Egyptian through 20th century. We had brunch in the cafe inside. Not a broad selection but very good sandwiches, fresh salad and",
          "It is worth visiting but there was not in my books that much famous art pieces as I was expecting. 90 to 120 minutes and you have seen everything.",
          "This is one of the best museums I have been to. When we visited in February it was very quiet and I was surprised there were not more people there. The cost was very cheap - \u20ac7 for two of us with a Eurostar discount. The audio guide was also free and gave an excellent commentary",
          "Seeing Rubens, Van Dyck et al can only be a moving experience, but somehow the place didn't quite do it for us. The spacious entrance hall is beautiful, and too much signage would spoil; it, but it took a few minutes to work out where the cash desk was, and the person who gave",
          "We did a guide visit at the exhibition about egypt. It was very interesting! The building is very nice and they have a nice art collection. Definitely reccomended!",
          "I went here during the week and I was absolutely surprised at the beauty not only of the collections but also of the building itself. I loved walked around the cavernous basement. It was a tranquil, relaxing way to spend my day. Staff were very friendly. Note: The day I went it",
          "There are an amazing number of paintings, varieties and styles. Some of the great masters, and well known paintings can be seen. A lot are religious, especially Rubens. There is a lot of walking as its a large grand building with stairs. Some pictures were poorly positioned,",
          "I last went to the Lille Palais des beaux arts about 10 years ago. I liked it even more as they now lend freely special ipod with narrative explanations of some art works. Choose the French language option if you can as not all of them are explained in English. The portraits",
          "The 20th century has limited representation , but there are two very good Picassos. There is lot of religious work ( by Rubens and others) and a beautiful still life by Chardin. Current temporary show is of an Egyptian Pharaoh and is well presented but hard going if you are",
          "Second in France only to The Louvre, 22000 square feet of prestigious collections of European paintings from 15th to 20th centuries. Fantastic!",
          "The museum is normally closed on tuesdays. We found it open (30 December) as it was due to be closed on New Year's Day. We were charged the full price (including the exhibition) which was \u20ac18 for an adult and under 25. The Egyptian exhibition left a lot to be desired and was",
          "I lived in Lille back in 2012, for about a month, and made a point to know the city; The museum was one of my first stops, and my first let down. In spite of the facts that there are some good pieces in the museum, unless you're going in Sunday morning, it's not worth the",
          "This museum does not receive the credit which it deserves. An exceptional collection of varied interests , with something for all.",
          "This attraction is free on the first Sunday of every month and I would only recommend going then. The building is very impressive from the outside but inside, the collection is quite small and there isn't much variety. The impressionism paintings are enjoyable but the rest of",
          "Must visit when you are in Lille. Nice, varied collection. Same real masterpieces. For us the 'Plans reliefs' were also very interesting.",
          "We got in for free as it turns out that the permanent exhibitions are free for everyone on the first sunday of each month. Bargain! Spent an hour or so wandering the halls (also to get out of the cold). But a good selection of art in there. Worth a look!",
          "We were quite lucky - as it turns out the permanent exhibitions are free on the first sunday of the month, so we got a free visit. Pretty good selection of art in there. They say it is the next biggest after the louvre but I dunno about that. Nice to have a wander though -",
          "One of the main attractions in Lille an imposing and impressive building with an extensive collection ranging from Flemish paintings to Anthony Gormley. The use of an Audio Guide is included in the price of entry although you have to ask for a voucher when you buy a ticket.",
          "One of the best art galleries outside Paris in one of France's less well known cities. Spacious galleries in a beautiful building with all the big names: Renoir, Van Gogh, Manet, Monet, Rubens etc and even a Turner and Constable. Enjoy Brueghel's Le Denombrement de Bethlehem",
          "This is built up as a major attraction but I'm afraid my husband and I found it fairly boring. If you are into Flemish artists, it may be for you. If not, you'll find yourself seeing a good many religious paintings by people you've never heard of.",
          "We took a leisurely tour with audio guide; all the labels are only in French however, and the guide only had partial coverage, and many of the links didn't have any commentary (in English anyway). Lots of Flemish 16-18th C paintings with only few more modern ones; in the",
          "The building itself is gorgeous. Be sure to check out the modern administration building in the back! There is a wonderful collection of art so be sure to give yourself enough time. I suggest doing a bit of research, pick an area and really enjoy it. I'm a fan of Breugle and",
          "A perfect blend of incredible architecture, and great art. I'm a massive Anthony Gormley fan so was excited to see some of his work in the atrium. The rooms are curated well, and host some fascinating pieces. But the building itself is the star. Well worth a visit.",
          "As we were near Lille, we decided to stop and visit the Palais. We were so glad we did - even though parking was interesting in the city centre. (Not for the faint at heart!) If you're lucky, you'll find a spot in the parking garage just in front of the Palais. If not, don't",
          "Nice museum, one of the biggest in lille. Intresting exhibitions, specially for those who like the flamish art.",
          "Great museum, interesting collection, beautiful building, loved the miniatures of the 10 cities in the cellar.",
          "Very impressive building that housed a varied selection of artwork, there were rooms and rooms of very well displayed art including well known paintings. And as an added bonus there was a special exhibition on Ancient Egypt that was really interesting and well set out. The cafe",
          "We passed though the square on a rainy day and it still looked very pretty, Perhaps we will get chance to come back and sit for a while on a sunny day",
          "Worth a wander around although there is an awful lot crammed over 4 floors and many of the 'famous' artists are paintings that are 'attributed to' or 'from the school of' . We enjoyed the Egyptian exhibition but it was fairly limited; interestingly there was a lovely",
          "This is a large popular museum. We went on a Monday afternoon and there were queues all the time until we left. The layout is a bit confusing if you are after a particular section. Spend a few hours just wandering. The scale models of the local towns are amazing and quite eerie",
          "The museum is so beautiful and the location is a must to take a picture place. The square where the museum is also beautiful and a point of meeting the young student people who live in Lille. Around you can find restaurants supermarkets and pharmacies etc.",
          "Really good mixed museum. Free audio unit, free cloakroom and half price entrance with Eurostar ticket.",
          "I visited late in the day, so it was not crowded at all. The staff were very helpful and friendly, some English spoken but obvious willingness to help regardless. My great interest is Impressionism, and their collection was lovely and even included some wonderful artists I'd",
          "This is a very worthwhile provincial museum to visit, with substantial collections of fine arts and other attractions. However some rooms are closed which is annoying and the museum maps are out-of-date.",
          "Entry \u20ac7 per person - although show Eurostar tickets and you get 2 for the price of 1. Visited early on a Wednesday afternoon and it was not very busy, giving the chance to appreciate the exhibits at a leisurely pace.",
          "wonderful old building lovely paintings well worth a visit. Staff very helpful and spoke English. Sadly we missed an Egyptian exhibition due to start on 9 October this year.",
          "People say that the museum is the second (after Louvre) in term of number of visitors, but seem to me that it can not compare to Louvre. If you really love arts, wait for the first Sunday each month, then you can enter for free, with also the audio guide.",
          "We used the visual and audio guides and enjoyed our visit very much. Great building and fascinating exhibits.",
          "fascinated by lots of walks. Lille by boat, in the park. The old town with cobbled pavements, art quarter, lots of welcoming restaurants with bistros. Disliked too many beggars everywhere. It spoiled the charm and beauty of this attractive city.",
          "We began our visit in the basement to view the medieval and ancient world collection. The signposts to the basement were unclear, but once we found the stairs, we descended into the dark basement. The first painting we saw was lit from below in such a manner that we could not",
          "We like to visit art galleries and museums but on our first visit here found it was closed. On the second try, after going in (and expecting it to be free as in England) found it to be fairly expensive. No entry prices are displayed outside. We only had 2 hours until our",
          "I have to say that I liked the building more than the exhibits, but I'm not a great fan of renaissance art and religious paintings. Saved for me by the couple of Picasso and Chagall. Go after 6.30 and it is only 4 euros. Worth going for the building if you're not interested in",
          "This was a little harder to find than we expected but was very interesting. A very excitingly designed new extension to the rear was not available to visit, which was disappointing, but the content of the old building was fascinating. They give a portable commentary i-phone/head",
          "A wonderful museum building with great collections. Please visit the city models room with scale models of many regional towns in the reign of Louis XIV.",
          "In truth, I am not a great art gallery person. I tend to get cultural overload after an hour or so and then wander around not really taking anything in. And there is a lot to see at the Palais des Beaux Arts. Obviously it depends on taste but, for me, the entrance fee was",
          "Awonderful museum with some of the world's favourite art in situ. Atmospheric basement exhibits too. Well worth a few hours. Sadly the ground floor was under construction when we visited, but it was still awesome.",
          "This is probably the most well-known tourist attraction in Lille. It is said to be the second or third biggest fine art museum in France. However, the museum is not so big, the collection is not abundant nor wide-range, and the streamline of the flow is a bit weird. Maybe",
          "A very nice and varied collection of paintings, drawings, sculptures and antiquities. Excellent value as well for under 25s (\u20ac4). Well worth a visit.",
          "This was a recommended attraction, but a lot of the paintings were 16th and 17th century and were very dark. Not a lot of paintings from 18th and 19th century.Loved the two Goya prints featuring youth and old age.",
          "At 6 euros it is worth a visit. Architecture also amazing. Entrance for wheel chairs is on front part, website gives wrong directions. Lots of paintings, sculptures and artefacts. Some parts depressing and gloomy. Others pleasant. Basement areas spooky and industrial. Not good",
          "The Palais des Beaux Arts is a beautiful museum in a very nice building. It covers good ground on historic paintings during the ages and you can get a good feeling for what paintings different era's represent. I loved the museum and am definitely planning on a second visit later.",
          "This art musee is billed as one of the best in regional France, outside Paris, and that may be true. It is housed in a large ungainly late 19thC building, but the museum was extensively renovated in the 1990s. There is an appealing large vacant internal ground floor space, now",
          "Spent 3 hours here and what a grand election of paintings and artefacts. Second only to the Louvre and you can see why. Go and enjoy (and it is not expensive to enter).",
          "although not as extensive as the Louvre in Paris, the Musee des Beaux Arts in Lille has its own charm. It's housed in a grand palace, and its exhibitions range from ancient Egypt and the Middle ages to Picasso and other modern artistes. 4 euros with the audioguide if youre a",
          "Second visit to the best gallery out side of Paris I understand. You can hire hand held devices which explain every thing in English but you need your passport to hire one. A park like area in front of the gallery looks great on a sunny day although not as great as on the rain",
          "A very pleasant museum. Was there on a Sunday afternoon and it was very quiet, which is an added bonus nowadays. Very interesting collection with some top works of art. Recommended.",

          "In beautiful buildings with a long and fascinating history, there is art on the walls, craft in the tiles and furniture, and a tradition of care going back 900 years. An attendant who greeted us as we entered explained that the second half of the booklet provided with your",
          "This place has an amazing history, with art on the walls and pieces of heavy furniture enjoyed at the time. We had already visited it the day before, but our French guide was able to tell us more about the nuns who ran the Hospice and were able to help those without the means to",

          "One gets a glimpse of an era long gone, beautifully restored and well worth a visit. The chapel is beautiful and on a hot day I welcomed the opportunity to have a quiet rest in the courtyard. Not busy on the day I visited a tranquil oasis from the bustle of cafes.",
          "This very old hospital has a lovely peaceful atmosphere and a beautiful design; it is easy to see how it could all help towards being a very healing sort of place. There are whole walls of hand-painted tiles, finely crafted furniture items and numerous paintings. It is probably",
          "This is very good value for money, but the audio is a bit confusing, I could not find exhibit 1, it seemed to start with 8. The building has been loving restored and the exhibits interesting. The gentleman selling the tickets was charming and I was pleased to see that you",

          "This is one of the last vestiges of the work of the Flemish counts. The buildings in the main courtyard give an overview of architecture in Lille between the 15th and 18th centuries ( a ward, convent buildings, chapel). There are some original furnishings and art, but not",

          "Perhaps we visited the place at the wrong time, but the main room was closed due to an art exhibition and the chapel was shut too. For our 3,60 euro all we could enter were a few rooms and the courtyard. Nothing like the hospice in Beaune, disappointing.",
          "This is well worth visiting and has interesting artifacts contained in the many rooms. It is not as focused on medicine as the outstanding Hospices de Beaune or H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Beaune, which was truly extraordinary. However, we are glad we visited.",
          "Not large but a nice little museum, there are English speaking guide sheets available. Check out the hand painted tiles around the staircases - each one slightly different, look out for the one at the top of the stairs that is sideways! Maybe a tillers joke??",
          "The audio guide is OK but with lots of strange translations and pronunciations. Ground floor rooms were best and gave some idea of what the hospital would have looked like. Upper rooms are filled with museum pieces and were not so interesting.",

          "I honestly thought we would see a mock up of the hospital that was; I thought it would be a step back in time. Sadly although the building was beautiful and the herb garden a glorious Sun spot, all they had on show were very very old dark paintings, which I could admirer of the",

        "wiki": "S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, Seigneur de Vauban, later Marquis de Vauban (1 May 1633 \u2013 30 March 1707), commonly referred to as Vauban (French: [vob\u0251\u0303]), was a French military engineer, who served under Louis XIV. He is generally considered the greatest engineer of his time, and one of the most important in Western military history.\nHis principles for fortifications were widely used for nearly 100 years, while aspects of his offensive tactics remained in use until the mid-twentieth century. He worked on many of France's major ports, as well as projects such as the Canal de la Bruche, which remain in use today; his view that all infrastructure had a dual civilian and military function directly inspired the creation of the United States Army Corps of Engineers.\nHe founded the Corps royal des ing\u00e9nieurs militaires, the origin of modern French combat engineering units, whose curriculum was based on his publications on engineering design, strategy and training. His economic tract, La D\u00eeme royale, used statistics in support of his arguments, making it a precursor of modern economics. Later destroyed by Royal decree, it contained radical proposals for a more even distribution of the tax burden. His application of rational and scientific methods to problem-solving, whether engineering or social, anticipated an approach common in the Age of Enlightenment.\nThe most enduring aspect of Vauban's legacy was his view of France as a geographical entity. His advocacy of giving up territory for a more coherent and defensible border was unusual for the period; the boundaries of the French state he proposed in the north and east have changed very little in the four centuries since.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nS\u00e9bastien le Prestre de Vauban was born 4 May 1633, in Saint-L\u00e9ger-de-Foucheret, in the Ni\u00e8vre, now part of Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9. His parents, Urbain le Prestre (ca 1602-1652) and Edm\u00e9e de Comignolle (?-ca 1651), were members of the minor nobility, from Vauban in Bazoches. His birthplace was renamed Saint-L\u00e9ger-Vauban by Napoleon III in 1867.\n\nIn 1570, his grandfather Jacques acquired Ch\u00e2teau de Bazoches, when he married Fran\u00e7oise de la Perri\u00e8re, an illegitimate daughter of the Comte de Bazouches, who died intestate. The 30 year legal battle by the Le Pestre family to retain the property proved financially ruinous, forcing Urbain to become a forestry-worker. He also designed gardens for the local gentry, including the owners of the Ch\u00e2teau de Ru\u00e8re, where Vauban spent his early years.In 1660, Vauban married Jeanne d'Aunay d'Epiry (ca 1640-1705); they had two daughters, Charlotte (1661-1709), and Jeanne Fran\u00e7oise (1678-1713), as well as a short-lived infant son. He also had a long-term relationship with Marie-Antoinette de Puy-Montbrun, daughter of an exiled Huguenot officer, usually referred to as 'Mademoiselle de Villefranche.'His only sister Charlotte (1638-1645?) died young, but he had many relatives; his cousin, Paul le Prestre (ca 1630-1703), was an army officer who supervised construction of Les Invalides. Three of Paul's sons served in the army, two of whom were killed in action in 1676 and 1677. The third, Antoine (1654-1731), became Vauban's assistant and later a Lieutenant-General; in 1710, he was appointed Governor of B\u00e9thune for life, while he inherited Vauban's titles and the bulk of his lands.Vauban died in Paris on 30 March 1707; buried near his home in Bazoches, his grave was destroyed during the French Revolution. In 1808, Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte ordered his heart reburied in Les Invalides, resting place for many of France's most famous soldiers.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nThe first half of the 17th century in France was dominated by domestic conflict and foreign wars, including the Huguenot rebellions of the 1620s, the 1635\u20131659 Franco-Spanish War, and 1648 to 1653 Fronde. Vauban's family was one of many impacted by these events; his Catholic grandfather married a Protestant from La Rochelle, and served Huguenot leader Admiral Coligny, while two of his uncles died in the war with Spain.At the age of ten, Vauban was sent to the Carmelite college in Semur-en-Auxois, where he was taught the basics of mathematics, science, and geometry. His father's work was also relevant; the design of neo-classical gardens and fortifications were closely linked, since they both concerned managing space. It was common to combine these skills; John Armstrong (1674\u20131742), Marlborough's chief military engineer, laid out the lake and gardens at Blenheim Palace.In 1650, Vauban joined the household of his local magnate, the Prince de Cond\u00e9, where he met de Montal; a close neighbour from Ni\u00e8vre, the two were colleagues for many years, and often worked together. During the 1650\u20131653 Fronde des nobles, Cond\u00e9 was arrested by the Regency Council, led by Louis XIV's mother Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin. After being released in 1652, he and his supporters, among them Vauban and de Montal, went into exile in the Spanish Netherlands, and allied with the Spanish.Vauban worked on the defences of Sainte-Menehould, one of Cond\u00e9's principal possessions. While doing so, he was captured by a Royalist patrol in early 1653, and switched sides, serving in the force led by Louis Nicolas de Clerville that took Sainte-Meenhould in November. Clerville, later appointed Commissaire general des fortifications, employed him on siege operations, and building fortifications. Vauban was appointed Ing\u00e9nieur du Roi or Royal Engineer in 1655, and by the time the war with Spain ended in 1659, he was known as a talented engineer of energy and courage.\n\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, Spain ceded much of French Flanders, and Vauban was put in charge of fortifying newly-acquired towns such as Dunkirk. This pattern of French territorial gains, followed by fortification of new strongpoints, was followed in the 1667\u20131668 War of Devolution, 1672\u20131678 Franco-Dutch War and 1683-1684 War of the Reunions. In the course of his career, Vauban supervised or designed the building of more than 300 separate fortifications,   and by his own estimate, supervised more than 40 sieges from 1653 to 1697.The first of these was the 1673 siege of Maastricht, although he was subordinate to Louis, who ranked as the senior officer present, and thus took credit for its capture. Vauban was rewarded with a large sum of money, which he used to purchase the Ch\u00e2teau de Bazouches from his cousin in 1675.Post-1673, French strategy in Flanders was based on a memorandum from Vauban to Louvois, Minister of War, setting out a proposed line of fortresses known as the Ceinture de fer, or iron belt (see Map). He was made Mar\u00e9chal de camp in 1676, and succeeded Clerville as Commissaire general des fortifications in 1677.During the Nine Years War, he supervised the capture of Namur in 1692, the major French achievement of the war, while the 1697 siege of Ath is often considered his offensive masterpiece. He was rewarded with money, and made Comte de Vauban, a member of the Order of the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Louis, and an Honorary Member of the French Academy of Sciences.The numbers needed to conduct a siege, and prevent interference from opponents meant armies of the Nine Years' War often exceeded 100,000 men, sizes unsustainable for pre-industrial societies. It prompted a change in tactics, Marlborough arguing winning one battle was more beneficial than taking 12 fortresses. The armies of the War of the Spanish Succession averaged around 35,000, and siege warfare superseded by a greater emphasis on mobility.\n\nVauban was promoted Mar\u00e9chal de France in 1703, marking the end of his military career, although the Ceinture de fer proved its worth after the French defeat at Ramillies in 1706. Under pressure from superior forces on multiple fronts, France's northern border remained largely intact despite repeated efforts to break it. Capturing Lille cost the Allies 12,000 casualties and most of the 1708 campaigning season; the lack of progress between 1706\u20131712 enabled Louis to reach an acceptable deal at Utrecht in 1713, as opposed to the humiliating terms presented in 1707.With more leisure time, Vauban developed a broader view of his role. His fortifications were designed for mutual support, so they required connecting roads, bridges and canals; garrisons needed to be fed, so he prepared maps showing the location of forges, forests, and farms. Since these had to be paid for, he developed an interest in tax policy, and in 1707 published La D\u00eeme royale, documenting the economic misery of the lower classes. His solution was a flat 10% tax on all agricultural and industrial output, and eliminating the exemptions which meant most of the nobility and clergy paid nothing. Although confiscated and destroyed by Royal decree, the use of statistics to support his arguments ... establishes him as a founder of modern economics, and precursor of the Enlightenment's socially concerned intellectuals.\n\n\n== Doctrines and legacy ==\n\n\n=== Offensive doctrines; siege warfare ===\n\nWhile his modern fame rests on the fortifications he built, Vauban's greatest innovations were in offensive operations, an approach he summarised as 'More powder, less blood.' Initially reliant on existing concepts, he later adapted these on lines set out in his memorandum of March 1672, M\u00e9moire pour servir \u00e0 l'instruction dans la conduite des si\u00e8ges.In this period, sieges became the dominant form of warfare; during the 1672\u20131678 Franco-Dutch War, three battles were fought in the Spanish Netherlands, of which only Seneffe was unrelated to a siege. Their importance was heightened by Louis XIV, who viewed them as low-risk opportunities for demonstrating his military skill and increasing his prestige; he was present at 20 of those conducted by Vauban.The 'siege parallel' had been in development since the mid-16th century but Vauban brought the idea to practical fulfilment at Maastricht in 1673. Three parallel trenches were dug in front of the walls, the earth thus excavated being used to create embankments screening the attackers from defensive fire, while bringing them as close to the assault point as possible (see Diagram). Artillery was moved into the trenches, allowing them to target the base of the walls at close range, with the defenders unable to depress their own guns enough to counter this; once a breach had been made, it was then stormed. This approach was used in offensive operations well into the 20th century.However, Vauban adapted his approach to the situation, and did not use the siege parallel again until Valenciennes in 1677. Always willing to challenge accepted norms, at Valenciennes, he proposed assaulting the breach during the day, rather than at night as was normal practice. He argued this would reduce casualties by surprising the defenders, and allow better co-ordination among the assault force; he was supported by Louis, and the attack proved successful.Vauban made several innovations in the use of siege artillery, including ricochet firing, and concentrating on specific parts of the fortifications, rather than targeting multiple targets. His Dutch rival Menno van Coehoorn employed a similar approach. While the 'Van Coehoorn method' sought to overwhelm defences with massive firepower, such as the Grand Battery of 200 guns at Namur in 1695, Vauban preferred a more gradual approach. Both had their supporters; Vauban argued his was less costly in terms of casualties, but it took more time, an important consideration in an age when far more soldiers died from disease than in combat.\n\n\n=== Defensive doctrines; fortifications ===\n\nIt was accepted even the strongest fortifications would fall, given time; the process was so well understood by the 1690s, betting on the length of a siege became a popular craze. As few states could afford large standing armies, defenders needed time to mobilise; to provide this, fortresses were designed to absorb the attackers' energies, similar to the use of crumple zones in modern cars. The French defence of Namur in 1695 showed \"how one could effectively win a campaign, by losing a fortress, but exhausting the besiegers.\"As with the siege parallel, the strength of Vauban's defensive designs was his ability to synthesise and adapt the work of others to create a more powerful whole. His first works used the 'star-shape' or bastion fort design, also known as the trace Italienne, based on the designs of Antoine de Ville (1596\u20131656), and Blaise Pagan (1603\u20131665). His subsequent 'systems' strengthened their internal works with the addition of casemated shoulders and flanks.The principles of Vauban's 'second system' were set out in the 1683 work Le Directeur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des fortifications, and used at Landau and Mont-Royal, near Traben-Trarbach; both were advanced positions, intended as stepping-off points for French offensives into the Rhineland. Located 200 metres (660 ft) above the Moselle, Mont-Royal had main walls 30 metres (98 ft) high, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) long and space for 12,000 troops; this enormously expensive work was demolished when the French withdrew after the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, and only the foundations remain today. Fort-Louis was another new construction, built on an island in the middle of the Rhine; this allowed Vauban to combine his defensive principles with town planning, although like Mont-Royal, little of it remains.The French retreat from the Rhine after 1697 required new fortresses; Neuf-Brisach was the most significant, designed on Vauban's 'third system', and completed after his death by Louis de Cormontaigne. Using ideas from Fort-Louis, this incorporated a regular square grid street pattern inside an octagonal fortification; tenement blocks were built inside each curtain wall, strengthening the defensive walls and shielding more expensive houses from cannon fire.To create a more coherent border, Vauban advocated destroying poor fortifications, and relinquishing territory that was hard to defend. In December 1672, he wrote to Louvois: \"I am not for the greater number of places, we already have too many, and please God we had half of that, but all in good condition!\" \n\n\n=== Infrastructure and engineering ===\n \nWhile often overlooked, Vauban worked on many civilian infrastructure projects, including rebuilding the ports of Brest, Dunkerque and Toulon. Since his fortifications were designed for mutual support, roads and waterways were an essential part of their design, such as the Canal de la Bruche, a 20-kilometre (12 mi) canal built in 1682 to transport materials for the fortification of Strasbourg. He also provided advice on the repair and enlargement of the Canal du Midi in 1686.His holistic approach to urban planning, which integrated city defences with layout and infrastructure, is most obvious at Neuf-Brisach. His legacy is recognised in the Vauban district in Freiburg, developed as a model for sustainable neighbourhoods post-1998.Vauban's 'scientific approach' and focus on large infrastructure projects strongly influenced American military and civil engineering and inspired the creation of the US Corps of Engineers in 1824. Until 1866, West Point's curriculum was modelled on that of the French Ecole Polytechnique, and designed to produce officers with skills in engineering and mathematics.To ensure a steady supply of skilled engineers, in 1690 Vauban established the Corps royal des ing\u00e9nieurs militaires; until his death, candidates had to pass an examination administered by Vauban himself. Many of his publications, including Trait\u00e9 de l'attaque des places, and Trait\u00e9 des mines, were written at the end of his career to provide a training curriculum for his successors.\n\n\n== Assessment ==\n\nVauban's offensive tactics remained relevant for centuries; his principles were clearly identifiable in those used by the Vi\u1ec7t Minh at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. His defensive fortifications dated far more quickly, partly due to the enormous investment required; Vauban himself estimated that in 1678, 1694 and 1705, between 40 and 45% of the French army was assigned to garrison duty.Vauban's reputation meant his designs remained in use long after developments in artillery made them obsolete, for example the Dutch fort of Bourtange, built in 1742. The Corps des ing\u00e9nieurs militaires was based on his teachings; between 1699 and 1743, only 631 new candidates were accepted, the vast majority relatives of existing or former members. As a result, French military engineering became ultra-conservative, while many 'new' works used his designs, or professed to do so, such as those built by Louis de Cortmontaigne at Metz in 1728\u20131733. This persisted into the late 19th century; Fort de Queuleu, built in 1867 near Metz, is recognisably a Vauban-style design.Some French engineers continued to be innovators, notably the Marquis de Montalembert, who published La Fortification perpendiculaire in 1776. A rejection of the principles advocated by Vauban and his successors, his ideas became the prevailing orthodoxy in much of Europe, but were dismissed in France.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAfflerbach, Holger; Strachan, Hew, eds.

          "Went to Lille for the first time, for a day trip. It felt a safe town to walk round. It\u2019s a lovely town, with lots of history. Lots of cobbled streets with beautiful old buildings. The tour took you around the town and with audio guide telling you about the buildings and",
          "Break taking views of Lille in a Sunday rainy morning. You need to ring a bell to enter to the lobby, sign a logbook and climb 110 stairs until you get to counter to buy the ticket and take the elevator until the top of the tower. When you reach the top of the tower, you have",
          "The Lille City Pass is well worth having. We bought two three-day passes for 39 euro each: for that we got free transport all over the area, free entry to almost all the museums and galleries, a coach tour of the city, discounts at several restaurants - plus, best of all, a",
          "Great city. Loved the architecture. Enjoyed the city tour also. Food good also the wine. Would visit again. Hotel room small but adequate.",
          "It wasn't all that busy when we went but we still had to wait 15 minutes or so for our turn as only 19 people are allowed in the belfry at a time. Not sure what it's like in the summer. The climb to the top was fine, with an option to take an elevator after the first 110 or so",
          "One of the most iconic sights in Lille, dominating the views in the centre. Beautiful architecture and amazing details. A must-see.",
          "Organised our new year's Day plan around Lille bus guide tour...booked and paid online.was at the pick up point along with others waiting by 315pm...no show of bus. Rang company who apologized but stated they don't run on bank holidays...! However we booked online on that date !",
          "Great views over Lille from top of tower. Used to also be one of the 1st TV transmitters due to it's height. Informative displays. There is a lift if you don't want to climb the multiple steps to the top. Both inside and outside view and good view of the Porte De France",
          "This bell tower can be climbed by over 100 steps or by lift and offers 360 degrees view at the top. There are information boards as the visitor ascends or descends to read in different languages including English",
          "Easy to book and good value for money. The city tour was really good and the range of museums was great although so a selection had to be made in the short time we were there.",
          "Well worth doing as it gives you a great overview of the different areas of Lille. Driver polite and knowledgeable.",
          "This is a nice thing to do if visiting Lille, we took the lift from the interim floor and to be honest regretted it. The walk would have been quite challenging but it would have made the experience more fun I think. We walked down. Just be careful of the time you get there, if",
          "Worth of visit even in cloudy day. Nice view through Lille and good workout (or take a lift after climb first 100 steps).",
          "As 2 of the only 4 people on board who needed the English translation I was impressed with the driver's additional explanations. The recorded tour is fine but he added a few extras and carefully translated them all for us. And he even parked up a few times so we could take extra",
          "The City Pass is definitely recommended, whether you get 24, 48 or 72 hour version. As well as free entry to loads of museums etc., it also inludes the City Tour and free use of public transport. The clock starts ticking at the first time the pass is used however the start time",

          "The Lille City Pass was easy to book, pick up from the Tourist Office, and use for entry to museums, galleries and on the Metro",
          "Good experience. Great way to get an overview of the city and see how close things are. Just don't purchase this from T.A. separately if you intend to get a City Pass as its included and it is approx 50% of the cost of the 24hr pass.",
          "In fact as you climb the tower, the view constantly changes as you progress upwards and stop at the several windows on the way. There is a lift, but you need to manage about 100 stairs before you can catch it. It was well worth the climb though, and did offer fabulous vistas",
          "The bell tower dominates the skyline in certain parts of Lille and its at the south end of the city and well worth a walk to find, make sure you arrive before 17:00, otherwise you wont have time to go up for great views of the city.",
          "This is a lovely building right next to the Porte de Paris, and the views of Lille as you ascend are glorious. You have two choices when you get in, you can either walk up the stairs with interim viewing platforms and information every 100 (I Think) steps. Or you can take the",
          "We had a Lille Card, so took advantage of entry to this attraction. Do be careful, if you have limited mobility, it probably isn't for you as there are around 100 steps before you get to the lift. They also recommend walking downstairs, but we decided to get the lift back down.",
          "Useless to say the views from here are absolutely stunning, even on a cloudy day. It was very windy yesterday when I was at the top and outside, luckily it wasn\u2019t shut down so could still enjoy the views. There is a bell you need to ring in order to get access and a few stairs",
          "Great views when you reach the top. You can either walk the stairs but there are rest stops or go in the lift which isn't that big.",
          "The Beffroi is nice and you can tour it within 1 hour max. It has great views of Lille but Lille isn't as picturesque as Prague or France so the sites are average. I recommend taking the elevator to the top unless you want to walk the 7 stories up.",

          "An afternoon spare, we decided to climb some stairs! The Beffroi has lots. The walk up is broken up at each level with historical info. As you climb, you also gain an unfolding view from the windows at each level. The stairs are not for the unfit. They go on & on. The view is",
          "Great views from the top. You can walk or take the lift. I recommend the audio tour as it breaks up the walk if you are taking the stairs!",
          "While reinventing the Flemish past in the early 20th century (not sure why), they decided to also build a belfry, although the town never had had one, and obviously in 1930 a belfry no longer had any purpose. Still, the building is a nice piece of art deco architecture, and the",

          "This building is beautiful piece of architecture that can be admired on it's own, but it is worth taking the lift to the top to get an overview of Lille. Well worth it for the first time visitor to Lille, to get an idea of the layout of the city.",
          "To be honest I was disappointed with this UNESCO World heritage site.The Belfry is high up and you can get there via a lift or steps.You have to queue for quite a long time to get up there.Once you get up there the view isn't that great.The ugly netting spoils the",
          "Great starting point to your visit to Lille. It is a short walk from the main train station. There is an (very slow) elevator which takes you all the way up top. You can see all the major attractions of Lille from the tower. The signs leading up to the Belfry are lacking. You",
          "Well worth a trip up this tower to great panoramic views of the city. The guides were very helpful. Be aware that when you arrive the door is shut and it appears closed. You have to ring a buzzer to get in.",
          "This is well worth going to the top. The views of the city are spectacular. There are quite a few steps to manage before reaching the lift to the top. An audio guide is available to tell the history",
          "You would expect a tour bus to be an open topped double decker but in Lille it is an open topped mini bus. The tour was well worth the cost and we did see some areas of Lille that we probably wouldn't have seen on foot in a couple of days, however I feel the tour was a bit",
          "This tour was very informative, helping us to decide on the spots we wanted to go back and visit. Our driver not only provided supplementary information but loads of entertainment simply because of his big personality and good humour. Definitely a treat not to be missed!",
          "We actually missed this attraction on our previous visit! So up we went. Since it was almost 30 degrees Celsius, we took the lift. On the top we where treated with a great 360 view of Lille and it's surrounding. The Beffroi is very rich in history too. So definitly worth a",
          "If you want a view of the city from high up this is how to do it, so can't really deny it 5 stars! Please note that it closes for lunch (1-2) and the last climb before that is 12.30. If the front door is locked buzz the intercom and they will open up for you. The first 3 floors",
          "Well worth a visit. Good views of the city from the top. Don\u2019t be put off by the entrance being shut. You have to buzz in on the intercom to get in.",
          "It's a belfry, it's tall, lots of steps ( or lift )with great views of the city. Entry is 7\u20ac and audioguide another 2\u20ac ( easily shared between 2 ) but also has guides in English free to read. Please note: the place looks as if it is closed. Ring the bell for entrance.",
          "Fun way to spend an hour or so getting a bit of background and general overview of Lille. Well worth it for a first time visitor.",
          "Welcomed by friendly staff, forgiving of our basic French, we really enjoyed our time here. Fantastic views of the city and a very interesting experience.",
          "It was a little tricky to learn when this was open, but I'm glad we preservered. We took the stairs up, and there were ok displays along the way. The terrace is where you see it all, awesome!",
          "I would recommend the visit here. You need to ring a doorbell to enter and then ascend 109 steps to lift lobby. Some more active people (like me) will skip the small lift and do the extra 400 steps to the top! Good views, fairly cheap and worth an hour. It is a bit away from the",
          "It was nice to visit this unusual attraction close to the palais de beaux arts. It is the bell tower of the town hall and as such entry is limited- only so many people are allowed up at a time. There are several flights of stairs up to the level where you can take an old",
          "Quite a trial to get in, and there are 109 steps up to the lift to go to the top. Good views of the town on a nice day.",
          "Head south from Lille Centre along Rue Pierre Mauroy and you will come across this very impressive tower . Part of the town hall this stunning tower is must place to visit . 7-50 Euros to get in or on line 6 Euros (Feb 2018 prices) Remember to ring the door bell to be let",
          "Visiting one of the more charming areas of the city. Good idea if rain isn't too strong. Lol. We can take a tour to sightseeing the architectural beauty, art galleries, museums, theatres . Be careful, most of the Streets in the old town are paved. Avoid wearing high-heeled",
          "Not for someone afraid of heights! This high-level 360*C view of Lille is excellent to actually grasp how big this city actually is. You can see for miles and you can even spot LOSC\u2019s Stade Pierre-Mauroy in the distance. The price is very reasonable too. The payment desk is at",
          "go up the Beffroi, this old building famous in the north of France to get one of the nicest view of the city. The entrance my not be that easy to find, and mind the opening hours, but it is very nice. And there is an elevator to go to the top :-) !",
          "You can either climb the stairs or take the lift. The Views are great and it is resonably priced at 7 Euros. Well worth visiting.",
          "Every first wednesday of the month the entry is free, so we went. Very bad idea. There was a long line outside and the gate keeper was very angry and unfriendly. He would only let 8 people in at the same time. He just shut the door in our faces without any explanation. He",
          "Visit here first to get a combination ticket for the Beaux Arts and the Musee de l'Hospice Comtesse.",
          "The tower is attached to the town hall offices. You need to ring the doorbell to have someone let you access stairs (100) up to the base of the lift. Having bought your ticket ( about \u00a35) you can use this to reach the viewing platforms. It is huge so gives a great view- though",
          "The best place to go to get a feel for the city of Lille. It is free the first Wednesday of every month. Or else 7 EURO.",
          "The door to the belfry is locked and you need to ring the bell and say you want to go up the belfry and then they'll let you in. There are 100 steps to the lift and then there's a small shop at the top.",
          "you have to climb the first 100 steps and its not easy so be warned then its a lift to the top where you then have more stairs to climb the view are really good but try to a pick a day when its not raining then the Young lady trys to encourage you to walk down as part of the",
          "Undoubtedly one of the things to do in Lille (eg if changing trains there - you can fit it in in an hour) and not too difficult to access. It is a short walk from the stations or Grand Place and you need to ring a bell then undergo a security check before going up several",
          "It's UNESCO world heritage along with another belfry towers, and it is really worth visiting for a splendid view of Lille.",
          "We were initially put off by the 7 Euros price tag but persevered and were glad we did. The view is terrific, including some of the larger battlefield monuments to the south, and helped us to get our bearings for the remainder of our stay in Lille. We also noticed a few local",
          "It was 7 Euros to get in but I've subsequently discovered that if you book 24 hours in advance online via the Tourist Information it's 5.5 Euros and it is free on the first Wednesday of every month. However I think the 7 Euros was worth it. I paid out another 2 Euros for an",
          "Tickets are a bit expensive but once you climb up the stairs, the view from the top is superb! Worth a visit!",
          "We went there but was closed for lunch went back next day and we were not disappointed Great building and a very impressive lift,lovely views over the city .there are no queues as it is not advertised",
          "Even though it was not clearly marked, you can enter this tower and walk or take elevator up (although there are 4 floors of stairs before you get to the stairs). It has nice view and can give you basic impression and orientation about city.",
          "Nice views of the city from the top, there are steps and lifts as well. It's cheap and well worth going up to get good panaromic views of the city.",
          "Good views of Lille from the tower, although I feel these sort of things should only be a Euro or two. Staff friendly enough. Quite a long walk up!",
          "We visited this tower on a Monday, despite the adverts stating that it would be closed. Very helpful and friendly staff. Really fantastic view of the city from all angles, with helpful description of the various buildings and landmarks that can be viewed. Take the lift up and",
          "we decided to take the plunge and climb up the Belfrey after a long day out walking. Huzzah though - after the first 110 steps there is a lift if you want it! phew. good 7 euros entry ticket and good views from this tall vantage point",
          "High and great. One of the best spots of this city. You will see it from different corners and each time you will get a different opinion and impression. One of the symbols of Lille, it will definetely be one of the best memories you will bring home from here.",
          "We went with friends and they, like everyone else, went to the top in the lift. We walked up the steps - all 300 odd!!!!! but this enabled me to enjoy my Moulles, Frites and vin rouge without guilt that evening!!!! The view from the top is amazing and you literally get a bird's",
          "The lovely old bell tower attached to the Hotel de Ville (town hall) in Lille offers excellent views over the city - and on a clear day to Brussels if your eyes are REALLY good. There are three or four floors of stairs to climb at first and then an elevator takes visitors to",
          "You have to walk up the first few flights of stairs before you get to the lift so may not be suitable for all. The lift takes you up to the top where you get a good 360 view of Lille. If you like views then make the trip.",
          "It's definitely worth taking the stairs to the top! Excellent vantage points on the way up. Make sure you get the audioguide and learn about some history, the giantsm and monuments around Lille.",
          "Unlike other reviews we approached via maison habitat gardens and easily found the closed wooden door, pressed accuel buzzer and were admitted, paid at the 4th floor shop, second group up in the lift, ascended from 6 to the terrace. Then down to 5 where we found English",
          "A very beautiful tower. Also the surroundings are nice to walk. Near to the city centre. Lovely restaurant in front.",
          "Whether in the old town, the Grande Place or on the shopping streets the Beffroi de Lille makes an excellent route marker allowing visitors to get their bearings and find their way back to the heart of the city.",
          "For those that need it there's a lift to get to the top. However taking the step challenge is worth it to see the city and beyond. Paying an entrance fee here also gets a discount when you visit the museums",
          "For those who like to survey all that lies beneath them then this is quite a bargain especially if you book to go on the first wednesday of the month when it is completely free! Otherwise if you book on line you can pay as little as 5\u20ac per person. There is no access for the",
          "After a bizarre process to obtain tickets we were eventually allowed to go up the belfry. Great news, there is a lift. At the top the view descriptions are in French but next to each one you will find a card in English. Well worth getting a view of the city.",
          "We had a clear day and visited on the free Wednesday early May. You have to wait your turn but after the first 100 easy steps you can wait for your lift ride by reading about the history. We also picked up from their information display a transport map of the wider area which we",
          "You should definitely consider this attraction and spend the money to go to the top and take in the nice view of Lille and its surroundings. Very fun.",
          "The staff at this tower were very friendly. The walk was only 109 steps as you could take an elevator after that. From the lofty heights was a good 369 degree view. A great activity.",
          "After climbing about 40 stairs you take the lift to the top where you will experience some amazing views of an architecturally rich Lille. Well layed out with photographs identifying what you are looking at.",
          "The tower dominates over the main square and is a very impressive building, I was told that the views are awesome but sadly on the two days I was in Lille, the tower was shut for renovation so I was unable to go to the top.I do not know how long it will be shut for but its a",
          "The tower gives you great panoramic views of the City. I suggest you take the lift up and stairs down to get best out of the place. I also recommend buying the Audio guide. Please note this attraction is free on the first Wednesday of the month. This an added bonus!",
          "Visited here on our last day and glad we did. Entrance was 7\u20ac each. The entrance has a buzzer and we had to wait in the lobby as there is a limit to the number of people allowed up (about 20 it seems). You have to walk up about 100 steps to the main lift and gift shop. A small",
          "There really is nothing better than a panoramic view of a city. I would have given this 5 stars but it wasn't the clearest of days when we went! There is a small fee for this attraction but it is well worth it! Steps to climb and then either a lift or more steps, with a mini",
          "yes the views are great especially on a clear sunny day, but it was difficult to find the entrance some others gave up! Wasn't very inspiring other than the view at the top!",
          "If your visiting Lille for a day or two I wouldn't go but if you live here of course you should make the piligrimage to the top. The view is....well i won't ruin it for you!",
          "once in you pay 6 euro each, you have to climb 109 steps to the paypoint, once there you have the option of climbing to many steps or going up by lift and the descend by the stairs, great views from the top with a multi-lingual person to assist with any questions, great place",
          "I think some people mistake the beffroi on place du theatre with the at townhall. The main part of the tower is accesible by elevator.",
          "The City Hall was built between 1924 and 1932 in the Flemish tradition, so therefore not old, but very impressive with its 104 metre high Belfry listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is advertised as being open for visits Tuesday to Sunday, but on the Tuesday we visited",
          "Nice to see up close. The area around is pretty nice for a wander, the ceremonial gate neaby is worth seing at the same time.",
          "Walk up 109 steps and then take the lift to the top for a panoramic view of the city. Well worth the \u20ac6.00 each for the view. Then take the stairs to the bottom for a view from each level of the tower.",
          "From the Porte de Paris, make a photo with the Beffroi behind. The photo will be more interesting because you are on it than the building itself. No charm, big, that's all. Even not old!",
          "Well worth the walk to see this and also, well worth the walk up the steps, great view of the city (there is a lift also).",
          "Would certainly recommend a trip up the Beffroi de Lille to get wonderful views over the city. Although a lift takes you most of the way up you do need to be able to walk up four or five flights of stairs to reach the lift and then walk back down stairs from the top. Admission",
          "It's outside of the main center and the charming old village. The beffroi is nice, but no need to go out of your way to find it.",
          "It may look a bit strange. While it is quite close to the city center and it would not take you more than twenty minutes by foot to get there. The guide says you can get to the top by a lift. If you have time, come closer or get to the top of the belfry. Otherwise, watch it from",
          "Free on the first Wednesday of each month and you have to be there for the 9:30 start from the Hotel de Ville (town hall) of which the belfry is a part. A guide takes you to the belfry. You have to climb 100 steps and then can either climb another 300 steps or take a lift.",
          "As I walked the neighborhood early this morning I spotted a giant Belfry and accompanying huge gothic building. Naively, I thought I was looking at a provincial government building. My inquiry discovered that this is the Mairie of Lille (town hall). No folks, I was not in Paris",
          "You can see for miles - and it builds up your leg muscles if you choose to walk up...but there is a lift! Only room for 10-20 people at the most.",
          "Nothing spectacular. You get great views over Lille on a clear day but that's about it really. If you do decide to go make sure to prebook online so it only costs \u20ac 4 pp instead of \u20ac 6 at the door.",
          "We were staying locally so decided to visit this tower. Because of security issues, you first need to visit the Town Hall reception desk. They then phone through and tell the doorkeeper to the Beffroi that you're on your way. It was cold and a little cloudy when we visited so we",
          "\u20ac6 to go to the top. Quite a few straight stairs and then there is a lift. Step out of the lift and there is a 360\u00ba view through rather dirty windows. Best to climb a few more steps to the terrace for clear views through a metal grid. It is very enclosed so you have no fear",
          "The title gives you one of the main reasons to visit the Belfry. The view is good but there aren't many interesting things to see. There is some interesting information on your walk down. I'd recommend going for the free visit but probably not paying.",
          "Nice 360\u00b0 view over the city, maybe a little bit expensive (\u20ac6). To you to decide if you want to spend this...",
          "After a couple a flights of stairs there was thankfully a lift up the other 100 metres or so; excellent all-round open and enclosed views. We walked down the 300 stairs; there are notice boards on the floors, worth reading.",
          "Great views over city. You can get to the top either by lift or climbing the steps. The guide speaks very good English.",
          "The first few floors are a bit difficult for us old-timers but there is a lift fthat takes you up to the viewing gallery and when you get there the effort seems worth it. There is a magnificent view for miles across the city and surrounding area. It's great to see the tops and",
          "Thought we had to walk all the way up, but luckily after 3 floors of stairs there was a lift to the top and the lift person was very knowledgeable about Lille's history. The view was amazing, especially as it was a lovely blue cloud day. not far from the hotel, either",
          "Simple and easy to make a comment. If You want to have the best view over lille yes this is the place to visit,make a visit and You Will enjoy it.fun to take the old style lift up",
          "We paid our Euro4 for a group visit. There is a lift to the top for those that need it. Otherwise a lot of repetitive concrete steps to the viewing gallery at the top. We did it only because there are so few attractions in Lille.",
          "There you can have a great view of the city. It's also free every first Wednesday of the month, so you can think about saving 6 euros",
          "A relatively recent construction, early 1920s, in concrete providing spectacular views over Lille and the surrounding areas. Really only worth going on a clear day.",
          "If the weather is on your side, this is the place to visit. Fantastic views for miles across Lille. Bad weather would not be a good time to go up the 300+ stairs (but there is a lift for 200 or so steps) but in the fine weather, you could not get a better place to go. The staff",
          "I never miss an opportunity to take in panoramic views and get a higher view of the cities I visit!! I truly enjoyed the views from the top of the Beffroi and recommend a visit here! The big advantage of the Beffroi is that should you want to avoid climbing so many stairs, there",

          "One of the few places open on a Sunday (shuts for a 2 hour lunch!!). Walked up and down the stairs (you go up some 300+ steps) but the view is well worth the effort. Reasonable entrance fee and you can see why it is so highly rated as a tourist attraction.",
          "There are lots of steps involved in seeing the Belfroi view, but they are worth it! 120 steps to get to the lift and 300 plus more on your way down as they encourage you to walk back down ands see various view points. The views are great but once you have seen it from the top",
          "We visited Lille bell tower as part of our travels around Europe. Although it's a 15 minutes walk from the Grand Place it is very easy to find as is down a straight road. There are also plenty of caf\u00e9s along the way but not directly around the bell tower itself. There was no",
          "Up over 500 steps,(Or a lift, With stairs you get developing view though), there are incredible views over the city, and you get a great view of all of the landmarks. And there are also interesting information boards on intermediate levels. And for \u20ac6/4 it is an absolute",
          "Part of the town hall, this is a cheap and worthwhile visit. 109 steps to entrance desk, then a choice of lift or another 380ish steps to top. Great views from top. I went up in lift then walked down with audio guide which gives a slightly jokey commentary at each level.",
          "For starters, this is located a bit out of the center, but if you have a map and eyes, you'll be able to find it. Just look up. Entrance is around the left side of the main building (a bit difficult to find), and tickets cost 4 euros reduced, 6 adult. You will probably have to",
          "Signage seems to direct you round the side of the building, ignore and enter through the big wooden door without a sign. Option of stairs or elevator, we followed other recommendations and took elevator up and stairs down. We didn't but likely worth getting the audio guide if",
          "We took quite a long walk to here, to be told at front desk, sorry it is full, there a another group already booked, they will take a long time and you can go up after that. Maybe 30-45 minutes. It is located in a strange empty environment with desolate buildings around, so if",
          "First let me say, buy your tickets online to save money. The view from the top is awesome on a clear day. Take the elevator up but make sure you take the stairs down. There are some interesting displays on the way down. Staff very friendly and they speak english.",
          "Before I went to Lille it was not clear to me when the tower was opened and if it was interesting. I am very happy I went there and climbed it (also the option to go with the elevator). The structure of the tower is very nice, it is made of reinforced concrete combined with nice",
          "The belfry or beffroi of the Lille city hall offers the best possible birds eye view of Lille from the top. The structure is somewhat modern, though beautiful and eye catching. It is located near the \"Port of Paris\" or \"La porte de Paris\" which is another lovely monument. Upto"

        "wiki": "The Lille M\u00e9tropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art (LaM), formerly known as Villeneuve d'Ascq Museum of Modern Art, is an art museum in Villeneuve d'Ascq, France.\nWith more than 4,500 artworks on a 4,000-square-metre (43,000 sq ft) exhibition area, the LaM is the only museum in Europe to present simultaneously the main components of the 20th and 21st centuries art : modern art, contemporary art and outsider art. LaM's holdings include some masterpieces of Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, Joan Mir\u00f3, Georges Braque, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Alexander Calder and the biggest outsider art collection in France. LaM possesses also a library and a rich park of sculptures.\nThe museum's collection offers an overview in modern and contemporary art, including drawings, painting, sculpture, photography, prints, illustrated books and artist's books, and electronic media.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Villeneuve d'Ascq Museum of Modern Art is opened in 1983 to house the collection of modern art donated by Genevi\u00e8ve and Jean Masurel to Lille conurbation. In 1999, the collections were enriched with a collection of outsider art, thanks to the donation made by the association L'Aracine. In 2002, Manuelle Gautrand was the winner of a competition for the restructuring and extension of the museum. The museum was closed in January, 2006 for restructuring. On September 25, 2010, the museum re-opened under a new name, Lille M\u00e9tropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art (LaM).\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe museum was built by Roland Simounet in 1983 in a green setting. The building is registered in French Inventaire suppl\u00e9mentaire des Monuments historiques in 2000.\nManuelle Gautrand designed an extension, covering 2700 m\u00b2, of which the construction ended in 2010.\n\n\n== Artworks ==\n\n\n=== In the park ===\n\n\n=== In the museum: Modern Art ===\n\n\n=== In the museum: Contemporary art ===\n\n\n=== In the museum: Outsider art ===\n\n\n== Library ==\nThe LaM possesses a library-research center with nearly 40,000 books.\n\n\n== Temporary exhibitions ==\n2010/09/25 - 2011/01/30 : The world as poem.

          "The Museum of Modern Art on the outskirts of Lille requires a bit of an effort to get to but is well worth the effort. The works of Modigliani, Braque and Picasso alone make a visit worthwhile.",

        "wiki": "Lille ( LEEL; French: [lil] (listen); Dutch: Rijsel [\u02c8r\u025bis\u0259l]; Picard: Lile; West Flemish: Rysel) is a city at the northern tip of France, in French Flanders. On the De\u00fble River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region, the prefecture of the Nord department, and the main city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille.\nAs of 2017, Lille had a population of 232,787 within its administrative limits, and Lille is the first city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille with a population of 1,146,320, making it the fourth-largest urban area in France after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nArcheological digs seem to show the area as inhabited by as early as 2000 BC, most notably in the modern quartiers of Fives, Wazemmes and Vieux Lille. The original inhabitants of the region were the Gauls, such as the Menapians, the Morins, the Atrebates and the Nervians, who were followed by Germanic peoples: the Saxons, the Frisians and the Franks.\nThe legend of \"Lyd\u00e9ric and Phinaert\" puts the foundation of the city of Lille at 640. In the 8th century, the language of Old Low Franconian was spoken, as attested by toponymic research. Lille's Dutch name is Rijsel, which comes from ter ijsel (at the island) from Middle Dutch ijssel (\u201csmall island, islet\u201d), calque of Old French l'Isle (\u201cthe Island\u201d), itself from Latin \u012ansula, from \u012bnsula (\u201cisland\u201d).\nFrom 830 to around 910, the Vikings invaded Flanders. After the destruction caused by Normans' and the Magyars' invasion, the eastern part of the region was ruled by various local princes.\nThe first mention of the town dates from 1066: apud Insulam (Latin for \"at the island\"). It was then controlled by the County of Flanders, as were the regional cities (the Roman cities Boulogne, Arras, Cambrai as well as the Carolingian cities Valenciennes, Saint-Omer, Ghent and Bruges). The County of Flanders thus extended to the left bank of the Scheldt, one of the richest and most prosperous regions of Europe.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe Carolingian duke \u00c9vrard lived in the city in the 9th century and participated in many of the day's political and military affairs. There was an important Battle of Lille in 1054.\nFrom the 12th century, the fame of the Lille cloth fair began to grow. In 1144 Saint-Sauveur parish was formed, which would give its name to the modern-day quartier Saint-Sauveur.\nThe counts of Flanders, Boulogne, and Hainaut came together with England and East Frankia and tried to regain territory taken by Philip II of France following Henry II of England's death, a war that ended with the French victory at Bouvines in 1214. Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders was imprisoned and the county fell into dispute: it would be his wife, Jeanne, Countess of Flanders and Constantinople, who ruled the city. She was said to be well loved by the residents of Lille, who by that time numbered 10,000.\nIn 1225, the street performer and juggler Bertrand Cordel, doubtlessly encouraged by local lords, tried to pass himself off as Baldwin I of Constantinople (the father of Jeanne of Flanders), who had disappeared at the battle of Adrianople. He pushed the counties of Flanders and Hainaut towards sedition against Jeanne in order to recover his land. She called her cousin, Louis VIII (\"The Lion\"). He unmasked the imposter, whom Countess Jeanne quickly had hanged. In 1226 the king agreed to free Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders. Count Ferrand died in 1233, and his daughter Marie soon after. In 1235, Jeanne granted a city charter by which city governors would be chosen each All Saint's Day by four commissioners chosen by the ruler. On 6 February 1236, she founded the Countess's Hospital (Hospice Comtesse), which remains one of the most beautiful buildings in Old Lille. It was in her honour that the hospital of the Regional Medical University of Lille was named \"Jeanne of Flanders Hospital\" in the 20th century.\nThe Countess died in 1244 in the Abbey of Marquette, leaving no heirs. The rule of Flanders and Hainaut thus fell to her sister, Margaret II, Countess of Flanders, then to Margaret's son, Guy of Dampierre. Lille fell under the rule of France from 1304 to 1369, after the Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305).\nThe county of Flanders fell to the Duchy of Burgundy next, after the 1369 marriage of Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, and Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Lille thus became one of the three capitals of said Duchy, along with Brussels and Dijon. By 1445, Lille counted some 25,000 residents. Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, was even more powerful than the King of France, and made Lille an administrative and financial capital.\nOn 17 February 1454, one year after the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, Philip the Good organised a Pantagruelian banquet at his Lille palace, the still-celebrated \"Feast of the Pheasant\". There the Duke and his court undertook an oath to Christianity.\nIn 1477, at the death of the last duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian of Austria, who thus became Count of Flanders.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\n\nThe 16th and the 17th centuries were marked by a boom in the regional textile industry, the Protestant revolts and outbreaks of the plague.\nLille came under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1519. The Low Countries fell to his eldest son, Philip II of Spain, in 1555. The city remained under Spanish Habsburg rule until 1668.\nCalvinism first appeared in the area in 1542, and by 1555, the authorities were taking steps to suppress that form of Protestantism. In 1566, the countryside around Lille was affected by the Iconoclastic Fury. In 1578, the Hurlus, a group of Protestant rebels, stormed the castle of the Counts of Mouscron. They were removed four months later by a Catholic Wallon regiment, and they tried several times between 1581 and 1582 to take the city of Lille, all in vain. The Hurlus were notably held back by the legendary Jeanne Maillotte. At the same time (1581), at the call of Elizabeth I of England, the north of the Seventeen Provinces, having gained a Protestant majority, successfully revolted and formed the Dutch Republic. The war brought or exacerbated periods of famine and plague (the last in 1667\u20131679).The first printer to set up shop in Lille was Antoine Tack in 1594. The 17th century saw the building of new institutions: an Irish College in 1610, a Jesuit college in 1611, an Augustinian college in 1622, almshouses or hospitals such as the Maison des Vieux hommes in 1624 and the Bonne et Forte Maison des Pauvres in 1661, and of a Mont-de-pi\u00e9t\u00e9 in 1626.Unsuccessful French attacks on the city were launched in 1641 and 1645. In 1667, Louis XIV of France (the Sun King) successfully laid siege to Lille, resulting in it becoming French in 1668 under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, provoking discontent among the citizens of the prosperous city. A number of important public works undertaken between 1667 and 1670, such as the Citadel (erected by Vauban), or the creation of the quartiers of Saint-Andr\u00e9 and la Madeleine, enabled the French king to gradually gain the confidence of his new subjects in Lille, some of whom continued to feel Flemish, but they had always spoken the Romance Picard language.\n\nFor five years, from 1708 to 1713, the city was occupied by the Dutch during the War of the Spanish Succession. Throughout the 18th century, Lille remained profoundly Catholic. It took little part in the French Revolution, but there were riots and the destruction of churches. In 1790, the city held its first municipal elections.\n\n\n=== Post-French Revolution ===\nIn 1792, in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the Austrians, then in the United Provinces, laid siege to Lille. The \"Column of the Goddess\", erected in 1842 in the \"Grand-Place\" (officially named Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle), is a tribute to the city's resistance, led by Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9-Bonte. Although Austrian artillery destroyed many houses and the main church of the city, the city did not surrender, and the Austrian Army left after eight days.\n\nThe city continued to grow and, by 1800, had some 53,000 residents, leading to Lille becoming the seat of the Nord d\u00e9partment in 1804. In 1846, a railway connecting Paris and Lille was built. In the early the 19th century, Napoleon I's continental blockade against the United Kingdom led to Lille's textile industry developing even more fully. The city was known for its cotton while the nearby towns of Roubaix and Tourcoing worked wool.  Leisure activities were thoroughly organised in 1858 for the 80,000 inhabitants.  Cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1,300, or one for every three houses. At that time the city counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations. Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets festivals and competitions. In 1853, Alexandre Desrousseaux composed his lullaby P'tit quinquin.\nIn 1858, Lille annexed the adjacent towns of Fives, Wazemmes, and Moulins. Lille's population was 158,000 in 1872, growing to over 200,000 by 1891. In 1896 Lille became the first city in France to be led by a socialist, Gustave Delory.\nBy 1912, Lille's population stood at 217,000. The city profited from the Industrial Revolution, particularly via coal and the steam engine. The entire region grew wealthy thanks to its mines and textile industry.\n\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nLille's occupation by the Germans began on 13 October 1914 after a ten-day siege and heavy shelling, which destroyed 882 apartment and office blocks and 1,500 houses, mostly around the railway station and in the centre. By the end of October, the city was being run by German authorities.\nBecause Lille was only 20 km from the battlefield, German troops passed through the city regularly on their way to and from the front. As a result, occupied Lille became a place for the hospitalisation and the treatment of wounded soldiers as well as a place for soldiers' relaxation and entertainment. Many buildings, homes and businesses were requisitioned to those ends.Lille was liberated by the Allies on 17 October 1918, when General Sir William Birdwood and his troops were welcomed by joyous crowds. The general was made an honorary citizen of the city of Lille on 28 October.\nThe only audio recording known to have been made during World War I was recorded near Lille in October 1918. The two-minute recording captured the Royal Garrison Artillery conducting a gas shell bombardment.Lille was also the hunting ground of the German World War I flying ace Max Immelmann, who was nicknamed \"the Eagle of Lille\".\n\n\n=== Ann\u00e9es Folles, Great Depression and Popular Front ===\n\nIn July 1921, at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin discovered the first anti-tuberculosis vaccine, known as BCG (\"Bacille de Calmette et Gu\u00e9rin\"). The Op\u00e9ra de Lille, designed by Lille architect Louis M. Cordonnier, was dedicated in 1923.\nFrom 1931, Lille felt the repercussions of the Great Depression, and by 1935, a third of the city's population lived in poverty. In 1936, the city's mayor, Roger Salengro, became Minister of the Interior of the Popular Front but eventually killed himself after right-wing groups led a slanderous campaign against him.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring the Battle of France, Lille was besieged by German forces for several days. When Belgium was invaded, the citizens of Lille, still haunted by the events of World War I, began to flee the city in large numbers. Lille was part of the zone under control of the German commander in Brussels, and was never controlled by the Vichy government in France. Lille was instead controlled under the military administration in Northern France. The d\u00e9partments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais (with the exception of the coast, notably Dunkirk) were for the most part liberated from 1 to 5 September 1944, by British, Canadian and Polish troops. On 3 September, German troops began to leave Lille out of fear of the British, who were on their way from Brussels. The city was liberated by a British force consisting largely of tanks.Rationing came to an end in 1947, and by 1948, normality had returned to Lille.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\n\nIn 1967, the Chambers of Commerce of Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing were joined, and in 1969< the Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Lille (Lille urban community) was created, linking 87 communes with Lille.\nThroughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the region was faced with some problems after the decline of the coal, mining and textile industries. From the early 1980s, the city began to turn itself more towards the service sector.\nIn 1983, the VAL, the world's first automated rapid transit underground network, opened. In 1993, a high-speed TGV train line was opened connecting Paris with Lille in one hour. This, with the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 and the arrival of the Eurostar train put Lille at the centre of a triangle connecting Paris, London and Brussels.\nWork on Euralille, an urban remodelling project, began in 1991. The Euralille Centre was opened in 1994, and the remodeled district is now full of parks and modern buildings containing offices, shops and apartments. In 1994 the \"Grand Palais\" was also opened for the general public, which is free for the public to enter on the first Sunday of every month.\nLille was chosen as European Capital of Culture in 2004, along with the Italian city of Genoa.\nLille and Roubaix were affected by the 2005 riots, like all of France's other urban centres.\nIn 2007 and again in 2010, Lille was awarded the label \"Internet City\".\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLille can be described as having a temperate oceanic climate; summers normally do not reach high average temperatures, but winters can fall below freezing temperatures, but with averages quite a bit above the freezing mark. Precipitation is plentiful year round.\nThe table below gives average temperatures and precipitation levels for the 1981-2010 reference period.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nLille is noted for its air pollution, with a 2018 study attributing 1,700 deaths per year in the agglomeration of Lille to pollution. In 2018, Lille held France's record pollution peaks.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nA former major mechanical, food industry and textile manufacturing centre as well as a retail and finance center, Lille is the largest city of a conurbation, built like a network of cities: Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing and Villeneuve d'Ascq. The conurbation forms the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille which is France's fourth-largest urban conglomeration with a 2016 population of over 1.15 million.\n\n\n=== Revenues and taxes ===\nFor centuries, Lille, a city of merchants, has displayed a wide range of incomes: great wealth and poverty have lived side by side, especially until the end of the 1800s. This contrast was noted by Victor Hugo in 1851 in his poem Les Ch\u00e2timents:  \u00ab Caves de Lille ! on meurt sous vos plafonds de pierre ! \u00bb (\"Cellars of Lille! We die under your stone ceilings!\")\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment in Lille has switched over half a century from a predominant industry to tertiary activities and services.\nServices account for 91% of employment in 2006.\n\nEmployment in Lille-Hellemmes-Lomme from 1968 to 2006\n\nEmployment per categories in 1968 and in 2006\n\nUnemployment in active population from 1968 to 2006\n\n\n=== Enterprises ===\nIn 2007, Lille hosts around 21,000 industry or service sites.\n\nEnterprises as per 31 December 2007\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nLille features an array of architectural styles with various amounts of Flemish influence, including the use of brown and red brick. In addition, many residential neighborhoods, especially in Greater Lille, consist of attached 2\u20133 story houses aligned in a row, with narrow gardens in the back. These architectural attributes, many uncommon in France, help make Lille a transition in France to neighboring Belgium, as well as nearby Netherlands and England, where the presence of brick, as well as row houses or the terraced house is much more prominent.\nPoints of interest include\n\nLille Cathedral (Basilique-cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame-de-la-Treille)\nCitadel of Lille\nPalais des Beaux-Arts de Lille\nJardin botanique de la Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie\nJardin botanique Nicolas Boulay\nJardin des Plantes de Lille\n\n\n=== La Braderie ===\n\nLille hosts an annual braderie on the first weekend in September. Its origins are thought to date back to the twelfth century and between two and three million visitors are drawn into the city. It is one of the largest gatherings of France and the largest flea market in Europe.\nMany of the roads in the inner city (including much of the old town) are closed and local shops, residents and traders set up stalls in the street.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille has a mixed mode public transport system, which is considered one of the most modern in the whole of France. It comprises buses, trams and a driverless light metro system, all of which are operated under the Transpole name. The Lille Metro is a VAL system (v\u00e9hicule automatique l\u00e9ger = light automated vehicle) that opened on 16 May 1983, becoming the first automatic light metro line in the world. The system has two lines, with a total length of 45 kilometres (28 miles) and 60 stations. The tram system consists of two interurban tram lines, connecting central Lille to the nearby communities of Roubaix and Tourcoing, and has 45 stops. 68 urban bus routes cover the metropolis, 8 of which reach into Belgium.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nLille is an important crossroads in the European high-speed rail network.

          "This church close to the Grand Place but one could quite easily walk past and not go in which would be a shame. The transept is huge and spacious and there are art works of different periods around the cathedral which are worth looking at. However for us the most interesting",

          "This is a very spectacular church, especially from the back which has many turrets making it look a little like a fairy-tale castle. This inside is just as amazing with the stained glass windows, especially on a sunny day. Worth a visit since it is also free to go inside.",
          "Whilst on a day trip to Lille visiting, what turned out to be a very disappointing Christmas Market, meant we stumbled across this church with the most amazing Windows. I am not a religious person at all but felt an overwhelming sense of peace and calm as we wandered through the",
          "This church is lovely and well worth a visit. It has the most beautiful windows We spend about 40 minutes admiring the statues and painting inside.",
          "From the outside, this is a very nice church, and one of the few that is open at times other than mass. The interior is not as nice as the outside, but still worth a stroll around. There are modern stained glass windows, as well as the 12 stations of the cross, also modern. But",
          "This church has a nice original shape and is even better when you go inside and look at the purple stained glass. Some interesting modern art inside.",

          "Gothic style church with a relatively simple interior. Beautiful art works around the church and the side chapels are a treat to my eyes. However, the main altar is just hideous, which ruins the beauty of this place. Nevertheless, it's a wonderful quick pit stop if you are",

          "Stumbled upon this place by chance and am glad I did. Full of arching gothic architecture and quite modern stained glass. Maybe it was just the moment (I'm not religious) but the place gives off such an aura of tranquillity. Worth a visit",
          "Situated a few minutes from the main train station and the same few minutes from La grande Place, St. Maurice is well worth your time. it is huge and imposing with gorgeous ornate columns, eaves and carvings. Imposing yes, but also homely and inviting. it is such a peaceful",
          "If you start at Gare Lille Flandres, this is on your way to go to rue de Bethune. It surprisingly loged behind a building and surrounded by restaurants. it's pretty enough to warant a quick stop.",

          "This is a large footprint of a church and has a lot of older items within. The stained glass is very nice although it is a little gloomy within if you want to take pictures as flash isn't permitted. Well worth a drop in when wandering around the city",
          "Our hotel was right next door to this church so we managed to study the exterior every day. It is a huge church and does not seem to be mentioned very much in the tourist information guide books although classed as an historic monument. We were greeted by a layperson, who gave",

          "It is a nice gothic style church with stained glass windows and some old statues and plaques to see. You can feel the history when visiting. Worth a 30 minute stop if you are in Lille.",

          "I quite like the building both inside and out. There is a plaque commemorating the men of the British Empire who died in the Great War which has a very simplistic but harrowing message. The only downside to the church are the beggars to hang out at all the doors and often leave",

          "More taxidermy based, the museum is by no means large but houses a decent collection. We visited on a weekend where all the government/town owned attractions were free. I think the normal price was around 5-7 Euros - worth it on a rainy day if you are into this kind of thing,",
          "Visited whilst in Lille at the weekend, wasn't really expecting to see hundreds (potentially into the thousands) of stuffed animals in display cabinets! A very small museum, a few skeletons, other exhibits but 90% stuffed animals... all a bit strange! Wouldn't go back, you",
          "Not a big museum by any means but very interesting. It has an extraordinary number of stuffed birds in numerous display cabinets. Not that I'm a fan of presenting animals in this way but these were done mostly in the 19th century when attitudes to conservationism was different.",
          "We came here for an afternoon trip before checking into our hotel! it was a lot bigger then first expected and very interesting! Was not expensive to visit and would recommend for everyone to visit if you have time! Staff spoke English which was a bonus!!",

          "This museum was good value at only 3.60 euros for adults and free for children. It only took about 2 hours for the visit, as it's not huge. The most interesting bits were all the different stick insects and the Ant Farm. There must be every single type of stuffed bird in this",

        "wiki": "Lille-Saint-Sauveur is a former goods station of Lille with some of the buildings has been converted into recreational areas and exhibition on the occasion of the events of Lille 3000 in 2009.\n\n\n== History ==\nTen years after the opening of the first railway station of Lille, Lille-Flandres station in 1848, the city annexed the neighboring towns of Moulins, Wazemmes, Fives, and Esquermes. That was when the idea of building a larger station in the south emerged. The new station was created in 1861 by imperial decree, and construction finished in 1864. Station Fives-Saint-Sauveur was initially supposed to become the main train station in Lille, but due to its location, which then seemed relatively far from the historical center, eventually led to a freight station.\nAfter entering into service of multimodal Dourges Delta 3, the station stopped its activities in 2001 and Sernam ceased to operate in December 2003. This raised the question of how to convert the 20 acres it occupies. The project is not yet finalized, but in 2008 the rehabilitation work of two of its halls have been undertaken as part of the organization of events in 2009 Lille 3000:\nHall A, with an area of 1,000 m2 (11,000 sq ft). The building, which dates from the nineteenth century, now houses a bar, a restaurant and a cinema.\nHall B, with an area of 5,000 m2 (54,000 sq ft). The building, constructed during the 1920s, was converted into an exhibition space and event planning.\nMartine Aubry, mayor of Lille, announced her candidacy for president in this former train station.",

It is more formally known as La Piscine-Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Industrie Andr\u00e9 Diligent or Le mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Industrie de la ville de Roubaix, but its common name derives from the fact that it is housed in a former indoor swimming pool, with a notable art deco interior.\n\n\n== History of the museum ==\n\nThe swimming pool was constructed between 1927 and 1932, by the Lille architect Albert Baert. It closed as a swimming pool in 1985, and was remodelled as a museum by the architect Jean-Paul Philippon, opening in 2000. A modern entrance building, special exhibition space and garden were constructed within the roof-less shell of an adjoining textile factory.The museum's permanent collection has its origins in 1835, when a collection of fabric samples from the many local textile factories was started. By 1898 the collection was housed in the National High School of Arts and Textile Industry (ENSAIT), and was seen as a way of cultivating the tastes of the town's workers, foremen and manufacturers. To this end the collection combined elements of literature, fine-arts, science and industrial products. The ENSAIT museum closed with the onset of World War II, and never reopened. From 1990 the collections were displayed in Roubaix's town hall, in preparation for the opening of La Piscine in 2000.La Piscine was reopened in 2018 after two-year restoration, that cost nine million euro.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuseum website",

          "The amazing collection of art works: sculpture, pottery, painting, textiles is housed in an equally amazing building. This former community swimming pool turned into a place of beauty features nooks and crannies chock-full of eye-catchers.",
          "Formerly an Art Deco style public swimming pool and now a large art museum. Many of the original features are intact including the pool and the building is of interest even to those not interested in the contents. A bit difficult to find but only a few minutes walk from Roubaix",
          "An unique aspect of La Piscine, in addition to its origins as the town swimming pool, is its extensive collection of fabric art. Roubaix was a post industrial revolution center of milling and weaving and the top floor contains 20th century designer originals crafted from local",
          "We had half a day spare; the Pool was top of the list - and really facinating. It is 20 minutes by metro line 2 to Roubaix station, then 10 minutes walk. An ex swimpool, converted brilliantly to an art gallery - focus on statues and lessknown 18/19th century art. Just the",
          "Of course we read the sections in the tourist guide, but once in the museum it becomes clear! What a stunning location, a former swimming pool built during the late twenties in the last century. Early 2000\u2019s the building has been transformed to its current purpose, a fine",
          "One of the best museums I've ever been. Take the Tram to Roubaix and enjoy. Just one truly bad thing - The water in the tank was really dirty , what a shame .",

          "By all means go and look at how the old municipal swimming pool has been put to a new use. The building itself with the huge coloured glass windows reflecting in the pool is worth the trip. On top of that you get what looks like thousands upon thousands of paintings, sculptures",
          "What a fantastic gallery. It is huge and beautifully displayed and set out. It has a great atmosphere and well worth a visit. We spent a couple of very happy hours there, and hope to go back as we certainly didn't see it all.",
          "La Piscine is one of the more interesting museums outside of a big city. Roubaix is an old industrial town which has benefitted from the rejunavation around the Art Deco La Piscine Museum. La Piscine used to be a swimming pool converted to a museum with primarily sculptures and",
          "A really interesting place if you like art. The works are set in an old swimming pool and everything has been restored really well. There are some true gems such as Picasso's ceramics. Worthwhile visit.",

          "very well restored and maintained; interesting example of Art Deco; parking available; nice exhibitions",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed visiting the museum which used to be a swimming pool.I personally did not enjoy all the statues but the conversion of the pool into a museum was interesting. If you go on a Saturday, you do not pay for entrance to the museum.",
          "I couldn't believe that Roubaix was on the tourist map. I lived in Lille 35 years ago, and it's really not somewhere you'd bother visiting back then. Things have changed a lot! The Piscine is a beautifully renovated building with some very interesting art (including Margaret",
          "Roubaix is under 30 mins by Metro from Lille and is a typical, smallish town much as you would find across France or England for that matter. But amongst the greyness is an oasis - the Musee La Piscine - which proved to be the highlight of our recent stay in Lille. It far",
          "The art inside was rather random but the building itself was stunning - worth a visit on a rainy day",
          "I had seen this museum featured on a Facebook page and it looked so fascinating that we simply had to visit (picking up some wine in Calais on the way back) We spent most of the afternoon here, it was varied, fascinating and visually stunning. It needs some research as there is",
          "Our hotel manager suggested we visit this place. It's gorgeous and you'll probably never see another museum like it. The first Sunday in the month has free museum entry everywhere so there were queues but worth it. Get off at Gare Jean-Lebas Roubaix and it's a short walk from",
          "The only letdown is parking But the museum itself it as good as we seen anywhere in the world Including London & New York",

          "When visiting Lille, please try and see this lovely museum located in Roubaix which is about 30 minute journey on the Metro (Red Line) to Roubaix-Grand Place. It is well worth the visit. I was completely staggered by the beauty of the pool and its unique surroundings.It was hard",
          "The Museum is housed largely in an Art Deco swimming pool and features beautifully arranged and displays sculpture and other artwork. The astonishing thing about the place is clearly the swimming pool used as an exhibition space which is sympathetic to its original design and",
          "This is a must visit museum if you are staying in Lille or the surroundings. It is only a 20 minute ride on the metro or bus and well worth the effort. The Art Deco swimming pool has been restored sympathetically and when the light is perfect it is a scene to behold. Furthermore",
          "We visited the afternoon of Tue 4 November, only ten days after the renovated museum reopened, having driven from Calais. The small museum parking area was completely full. Fortunately we found a metered street parking space nearby but, if you are travelling by car, it might be",
          "We felt so lucky to be able to see the museum with its recent renovations. The art is by less known artists (at least less known to these Americans) but was beautiful and interesting. The second floor had a wonderful selection of textiles to view. The building is genius. The",
          "The staff could smile a bit more and more clear signposting in the direction of the temporary exhibitions would be appreciated rather than just telling you you can't go a certain way. The art feels a little disjointed (it switches between styles) and, frankly, the building was",
          "This once a public pool from the Early 30\u2019s turned into a museum is so beautiful architecturally and so eclectic with its artworks. From sculptures, textile, to paintings, it offers varied artistic work for everyone to enjoy.",
          "The museum was generally constructed in an old abandomed public pool giving it an unconventional feel but the displays and exhibits will surprise you with their recent collection of Picasso\u2019s works.",
          "We went here on the metro but only to find that it has been closed for renovation since April and reopens on 20th October 2018. The restaurant/cafe was open but you could not see a lot.",

          "This is situated outside Lille, easy top get to on the metro. Had to use google maps once there from the station, so check out the route before you go, it's only about a 5-10 minute walk. The museum is unusual as it's based in an old swimming pool (hence the name). The stained",
          "Visited on recommendation from friends, easy 20 minute tram ride from Lille Flandres station. Amazing transformation of old swimming pool into very varied museum - paintings, ceramics and special exhibitions. Includes a Meert tea room. Closing for renovations on 01/04/18.",
          "To get to the Musee La Piscine you will need to get a train out to the Roubaix which from the old town is about 13 stops and will take a good 20minutes. Once there you need to walk a further 8-10mins to the museum which was an old art deco swimming pool and has now been turned",
          "Amazing space. The preserved 1930's swimming pool/bathing facility was every bit as interesting as the collection of 19th/20th century paintings & sculptures. Takes about 1.5-2 hours to see it all. There is a great caf\u00e9/restaurant on site when you need a break. I had lunch",
          "The swimming pool in art-deco style was stunning. The art collection was dissapointing. It was a mix of everything and nothing. There was not much to see and you could finish this museum in an hour. There are parking facilities nearby.",

          "A wide range of paintings and sculpture and in a very pleasant converted swimming pool. The sun streams in through the windows and the occasional taped noise of a pool adds to the authenticity. It's quite tiring seeing it all and good to have a cup of coffee in the restaurant.",
          "So, being in Lille for the weekend I was taken to Roubaix ( a seemly rundown suburb of Lille) to walk into a sculpture museum - no famous artists but who cares when this renovation of a swimming pool complex is absolutely spectacular- and to add to that it was free entry that",

          "While this is not one of the world's great art collections the array of paintings, ceramics, sculpture and textiles provide something for everybody. But of course the real reason to visit La Piscine (this is our second visit) is the building itself which is a triumph of",
          "some of these paintings look so real its as if they were photographed. Amazing how a painting captures a moment in time like what a picture does in todays world.. it is definitely a must see. Roubaix alone is worth the train ride.",
          "Took a trip to Roubaix especially to see this museum, and after a holiday of museums this one was a breath of fresh air! The usual paintings & sculptures but in an amazing new environment. The old swimming pool has been covered with a narrower length of water and beautiful",
          "Beautiful pieces (paintings and sculptures) in different rooms but the main room is the art d\u00e9co style swimming pool and that in itself is a must see. There are also more local exhibits with fabrics as historically there were lots of fabric manufacture in the area, if you are",
          "We travelled by Metro then walked to the museum only to find it was closed because it was the feast day for the assumption of the Virgin Mary. It did not say this on the website. We joined a queue of others outside the gates and only found out when we dialled them and listened",

          "One should visit this surprising museum. The main hall is beautiful with two lines of statues along the remains of what use to be a swimming pool. The collection is interesting, but not \"world class\". Donot forget to visit the restaurant!",

          "This is a fantastic museum housed in an old nineteenth century swimming bath (hence the name!). The art is largely from the same period as the date of the construction of the baths, covering the neo-Impressionism, Impressionism and moving into the turn of the century modern art",
          "A stunning museum, worth the visit for the layout alone. Very very miserable and unhelpful staff on the door, which is a shame - they seemed to hate working there.",

          "Besides being s beautiful museum, this shows how a historic building can be repurposed. Kudos to whoever proposed to use this magnificent building as a museum. Much to see and admire. Everyone should see this museum. Tremendous French artists that we had never heard of. Also",
          "Apart from the exhibits, the space itself - a swimming pool converted into an art museum - is uplifting.",
          "This is one of my favorite museums in the north of France. I don't know that the collection is all that impressive, but the building is simply beautiful and it is a sight to behold once you are inside. I would highly recommend seeing this if you're in Lille or the area around",
          "It's a shame that this wonderful museum isn't listed under Things to Do in Lille - so many visitors to Lille must be unaware that just a metro ride away in the suburb of Roubaix (still in Greater Lille) there is this absolute treasure. The swimming pool was built between 1927",

          "This is one of the best museums in northern France, not because of its collection but because of the architecture of the buidling: an old swimming pool in Art Deco style. There are a few famous artists in the collection (Rodin, Claudel...) but very few known works or only",

          "A former art deco swimming pool, it is now a sumptuous collection of art galleries, some of which have intriguing works. This includes A sculpture of \"Attila with a Horde of Huns\". The restaurant has some good menu options, too.",

          "Loved the stained glasses and the sculptures. There's a recording of the ambient moist from back in the day when this was still a swimming pool. So thoughtful! My favourite sculpture of the deadly sins was pride (in the 3rd photo)",
          "Very unique museum with a calming atmosphere",
          "Stunning place, I wish my house looked like that. There wasn't much information about the history of the swimming pool to find in the building itself. I bought a little book in the giftshop containing old pictures and drawings about the pool that satisfied my archeological interest.",

          "An interesting collection of sculptures and other art. Well worth a trip from Lille",
          "This is a beautiful must see museum, quirky lay out always more just around the corner. The reason I've not given a 5 star rating is because the notation on some exhibits was vague. Eg. 5 items in a cabinet, a list at the side but no \u2026",

          "Very interesting, lots of good art but some pretentious too.",
          "I had a quick tour of the museum, but the place alone is worth it.

          "An art gallery in a delightful converted 1930's swimming pool in Roubaix, Northern France. I have visited La Piscine numerous times over several years. It has an excellent eclectic permanent collection of fine art and applied art, as well \u2026",
          "Beautiful place!!!

        "wiki": "Lille ( LEEL; French: [lil] (listen); Dutch: Rijsel [\u02c8r\u025bis\u0259l]; Picard: Lile; West Flemish: Rysel) is a city at the northern tip of France, in French Flanders. On the De\u00fble River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region, the prefecture of the Nord department, and the main city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille.\nAs of 2017, Lille had a population of 232,787 within its administrative limits, and Lille is the first city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille with a population of 1,146,320, making it the fourth-largest urban area in France after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nArcheological digs seem to show the area as inhabited by as early as 2000 BC, most notably in the modern quartiers of Fives, Wazemmes and Vieux Lille. The original inhabitants of the region were the Gauls, such as the Menapians, the Morins, the Atrebates and the Nervians, who were followed by Germanic peoples: the Saxons, the Frisians and the Franks.\nThe legend of \"Lyd\u00e9ric and Phinaert\" puts the foundation of the city of Lille at 640. In the 8th century, the language of Old Low Franconian was spoken, as attested by toponymic research. Lille's Dutch name is Rijsel, which comes from ter ijsel (at the island) from Middle Dutch ijssel (\u201csmall island, islet\u201d), calque of Old French l'Isle (\u201cthe Island\u201d), itself from Latin \u012ansula, from \u012bnsula (\u201cisland\u201d).\nFrom 830 to around 910, the Vikings invaded Flanders. After the destruction caused by Normans' and the Magyars' invasion, the eastern part of the region was ruled by various local princes.\nThe first mention of the town dates from 1066: apud Insulam (Latin for \"at the island\"). It was then controlled by the County of Flanders, as were the regional cities (the Roman cities Boulogne, Arras, Cambrai as well as the Carolingian cities Valenciennes, Saint-Omer, Ghent and Bruges). The County of Flanders thus extended to the left bank of the Scheldt, one of the richest and most prosperous regions of Europe.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe Carolingian duke \u00c9vrard lived in the city in the 9th century and participated in many of the day's political and military affairs. There was an important Battle of Lille in 1054.\nFrom the 12th century, the fame of the Lille cloth fair began to grow. In 1144 Saint-Sauveur parish was formed, which would give its name to the modern-day quartier Saint-Sauveur.\nThe counts of Flanders, Boulogne, and Hainaut came together with England and East Frankia and tried to regain territory taken by Philip II of France following Henry II of England's death, a war that ended with the French victory at Bouvines in 1214. Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders was imprisoned and the county fell into dispute: it would be his wife, Jeanne, Countess of Flanders and Constantinople, who ruled the city. She was said to be well loved by the residents of Lille, who by that time numbered 10,000.\nIn 1225, the street performer and juggler Bertrand Cordel, doubtlessly encouraged by local lords, tried to pass himself off as Baldwin I of Constantinople (the father of Jeanne of Flanders), who had disappeared at the battle of Adrianople. He pushed the counties of Flanders and Hainaut towards sedition against Jeanne in order to recover his land. She called her cousin, Louis VIII (\"The Lion\"). He unmasked the imposter, whom Countess Jeanne quickly had hanged. In 1226 the king agreed to free Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders. Count Ferrand died in 1233, and his daughter Marie soon after. In 1235, Jeanne granted a city charter by which city governors would be chosen each All Saint's Day by four commissioners chosen by the ruler. On 6 February 1236, she founded the Countess's Hospital (Hospice Comtesse), which remains one of the most beautiful buildings in Old Lille. It was in her honour that the hospital of the Regional Medical University of Lille was named \"Jeanne of Flanders Hospital\" in the 20th century.\nThe Countess died in 1244 in the Abbey of Marquette, leaving no heirs. The rule of Flanders and Hainaut thus fell to her sister, Margaret II, Countess of Flanders, then to Margaret's son, Guy of Dampierre. Lille fell under the rule of France from 1304 to 1369, after the Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305).\nThe county of Flanders fell to the Duchy of Burgundy next, after the 1369 marriage of Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, and Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Lille thus became one of the three capitals of said Duchy, along with Brussels and Dijon. By 1445, Lille counted some 25,000 residents. Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, was even more powerful than the King of France, and made Lille an administrative and financial capital.\nOn 17 February 1454, one year after the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, Philip the Good organised a Pantagruelian banquet at his Lille palace, the still-celebrated \"Feast of the Pheasant\". There the Duke and his court undertook an oath to Christianity.\nIn 1477, at the death of the last duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian of Austria, who thus became Count of Flanders.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\n\nThe 16th and the 17th centuries were marked by a boom in the regional textile industry, the Protestant revolts and outbreaks of the plague.\nLille came under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1519. The Low Countries fell to his eldest son, Philip II of Spain, in 1555. The city remained under Spanish Habsburg rule until 1668.\nCalvinism first appeared in the area in 1542, and by 1555, the authorities were taking steps to suppress that form of Protestantism. In 1566, the countryside around Lille was affected by the Iconoclastic Fury. In 1578, the Hurlus, a group of Protestant rebels, stormed the castle of the Counts of Mouscron. They were removed four months later by a Catholic Wallon regiment, and they tried several times between 1581 and 1582 to take the city of Lille, all in vain. The Hurlus were notably held back by the legendary Jeanne Maillotte. At the same time (1581), at the call of Elizabeth I of England, the north of the Seventeen Provinces, having gained a Protestant majority, successfully revolted and formed the Dutch Republic. The war brought or exacerbated periods of famine and plague (the last in 1667\u20131679).The first printer to set up shop in Lille was Antoine Tack in 1594. The 17th century saw the building of new institutions: an Irish College in 1610, a Jesuit college in 1611, an Augustinian college in 1622, almshouses or hospitals such as the Maison des Vieux hommes in 1624 and the Bonne et Forte Maison des Pauvres in 1661, and of a Mont-de-pi\u00e9t\u00e9 in 1626.Unsuccessful French attacks on the city were launched in 1641 and 1645. In 1667, Louis XIV of France (the Sun King) successfully laid siege to Lille, resulting in it becoming French in 1668 under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, provoking discontent among the citizens of the prosperous city. A number of important public works undertaken between 1667 and 1670, such as the Citadel (erected by Vauban), or the creation of the quartiers of Saint-Andr\u00e9 and la Madeleine, enabled the French king to gradually gain the confidence of his new subjects in Lille, some of whom continued to feel Flemish, but they had always spoken the Romance Picard language.\n\nFor five years, from 1708 to 1713, the city was occupied by the Dutch during the War of the Spanish Succession. Throughout the 18th century, Lille remained profoundly Catholic. It took little part in the French Revolution, but there were riots and the destruction of churches. In 1790, the city held its first municipal elections.\n\n\n=== Post-French Revolution ===\nIn 1792, in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the Austrians, then in the United Provinces, laid siege to Lille. The \"Column of the Goddess\", erected in 1842 in the \"Grand-Place\" (officially named Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle), is a tribute to the city's resistance, led by Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9-Bonte. Although Austrian artillery destroyed many houses and the main church of the city, the city did not surrender, and the Austrian Army left after eight days.\n\nThe city continued to grow and, by 1800, had some 53,000 residents, leading to Lille becoming the seat of the Nord d\u00e9partment in 1804. In 1846, a railway connecting Paris and Lille was built. In the early the 19th century, Napoleon I's continental blockade against the United Kingdom led to Lille's textile industry developing even more fully. The city was known for its cotton while the nearby towns of Roubaix and Tourcoing worked wool.  Leisure activities were thoroughly organised in 1858 for the 80,000 inhabitants.  Cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1,300, or one for every three houses. At that time the city counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations. Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets festivals and competitions. In 1853, Alexandre Desrousseaux composed his lullaby P'tit quinquin.\nIn 1858, Lille annexed the adjacent towns of Fives, Wazemmes, and Moulins. Lille's population was 158,000 in 1872, growing to over 200,000 by 1891. In 1896 Lille became the first city in France to be led by a socialist, Gustave Delory.\nBy 1912, Lille's population stood at 217,000. The city profited from the Industrial Revolution, particularly via coal and the steam engine. The entire region grew wealthy thanks to its mines and textile industry.\n\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nLille's occupation by the Germans began on 13 October 1914 after a ten-day siege and heavy shelling, which destroyed 882 apartment and office blocks and 1,500 houses, mostly around the railway station and in the centre. By the end of October, the city was being run by German authorities.\nBecause Lille was only 20 km from the battlefield, German troops passed through the city regularly on their way to and from the front. As a result, occupied Lille became a place for the hospitalisation and the treatment of wounded soldiers as well as a place for soldiers' relaxation and entertainment. Many buildings, homes and businesses were requisitioned to those ends.Lille was liberated by the Allies on 17 October 1918, when General Sir William Birdwood and his troops were welcomed by joyous crowds. The general was made an honorary citizen of the city of Lille on 28 October.\nThe only audio recording known to have been made during World War I was recorded near Lille in October 1918. The two-minute recording captured the Royal Garrison Artillery conducting a gas shell bombardment.Lille was also the hunting ground of the German World War I flying ace Max Immelmann, who was nicknamed \"the Eagle of Lille\".\n\n\n=== Ann\u00e9es Folles, Great Depression and Popular Front ===\n\nIn July 1921, at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin discovered the first anti-tuberculosis vaccine, known as BCG (\"Bacille de Calmette et Gu\u00e9rin\"). The Op\u00e9ra de Lille, designed by Lille architect Louis M. Cordonnier, was dedicated in 1923.\nFrom 1931, Lille felt the repercussions of the Great Depression, and by 1935, a third of the city's population lived in poverty. In 1936, the city's mayor, Roger Salengro, became Minister of the Interior of the Popular Front but eventually killed himself after right-wing groups led a slanderous campaign against him.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring the Battle of France, Lille was besieged by German forces for several days. When Belgium was invaded, the citizens of Lille, still haunted by the events of World War I, began to flee the city in large numbers. Lille was part of the zone under control of the German commander in Brussels, and was never controlled by the Vichy government in France. Lille was instead controlled under the military administration in Northern France. The d\u00e9partments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais (with the exception of the coast, notably Dunkirk) were for the most part liberated from 1 to 5 September 1944, by British, Canadian and Polish troops. On 3 September, German troops began to leave Lille out of fear of the British, who were on their way from Brussels. The city was liberated by a British force consisting largely of tanks.Rationing came to an end in 1947, and by 1948, normality had returned to Lille.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\n\nIn 1967, the Chambers of Commerce of Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing were joined, and in 1969< the Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Lille (Lille urban community) was created, linking 87 communes with Lille.\nThroughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the region was faced with some problems after the decline of the coal, mining and textile industries. From the early 1980s, the city began to turn itself more towards the service sector.\nIn 1983, the VAL, the world's first automated rapid transit underground network, opened. In 1993, a high-speed TGV train line was opened connecting Paris with Lille in one hour. This, with the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 and the arrival of the Eurostar train put Lille at the centre of a triangle connecting Paris, London and Brussels.\nWork on Euralille, an urban remodelling project, began in 1991. The Euralille Centre was opened in 1994, and the remodeled district is now full of parks and modern buildings containing offices, shops and apartments. In 1994 the \"Grand Palais\" was also opened for the general public, which is free for the public to enter on the first Sunday of every month.\nLille was chosen as European Capital of Culture in 2004, along with the Italian city of Genoa.\nLille and Roubaix were affected by the 2005 riots, like all of France's other urban centres.\nIn 2007 and again in 2010, Lille was awarded the label \"Internet City\".\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLille can be described as having a temperate oceanic climate; summers normally do not reach high average temperatures, but winters can fall below freezing temperatures, but with averages quite a bit above the freezing mark. Precipitation is plentiful year round.\nThe table below gives average temperatures and precipitation levels for the 1981-2010 reference period.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nLille is noted for its air pollution, with a 2018 study attributing 1,700 deaths per year in the agglomeration of Lille to pollution. In 2018, Lille held France's record pollution peaks.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nA former major mechanical, food industry and textile manufacturing centre as well as a retail and finance center, Lille is the largest city of a conurbation, built like a network of cities: Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing and Villeneuve d'Ascq. The conurbation forms the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille which is France's fourth-largest urban conglomeration with a 2016 population of over 1.15 million.\n\n\n=== Revenues and taxes ===\nFor centuries, Lille, a city of merchants, has displayed a wide range of incomes: great wealth and poverty have lived side by side, especially until the end of the 1800s. This contrast was noted by Victor Hugo in 1851 in his poem Les Ch\u00e2timents:  \u00ab Caves de Lille ! on meurt sous vos plafonds de pierre ! \u00bb (\"Cellars of Lille! We die under your stone ceilings!\")\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment in Lille has switched over half a century from a predominant industry to tertiary activities and services.\nServices account for 91% of employment in 2006.\n\nEmployment in Lille-Hellemmes-Lomme from 1968 to 2006\n\nEmployment per categories in 1968 and in 2006\n\nUnemployment in active population from 1968 to 2006\n\n\n=== Enterprises ===\nIn 2007, Lille hosts around 21,000 industry or service sites.\n\nEnterprises as per 31 December 2007\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nLille features an array of architectural styles with various amounts of Flemish influence, including the use of brown and red brick. In addition, many residential neighborhoods, especially in Greater Lille, consist of attached 2\u20133 story houses aligned in a row, with narrow gardens in the back. These architectural attributes, many uncommon in France, help make Lille a transition in France to neighboring Belgium, as well as nearby Netherlands and England, where the presence of brick, as well as row houses or the terraced house is much more prominent.\nPoints of interest include\n\nLille Cathedral (Basilique-cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame-de-la-Treille)\nCitadel of Lille\nPalais des Beaux-Arts de Lille\nJardin botanique de la Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie\nJardin botanique Nicolas Boulay\nJardin des Plantes de Lille\n\n\n=== La Braderie ===\n\nLille hosts an annual braderie on the first weekend in September. Its origins are thought to date back to the twelfth century and between two and three million visitors are drawn into the city. It is one of the largest gatherings of France and the largest flea market in Europe.\nMany of the roads in the inner city (including much of the old town) are closed and local shops, residents and traders set up stalls in the street.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille has a mixed mode public transport system, which is considered one of the most modern in the whole of France. It comprises buses, trams and a driverless light metro system, all of which are operated under the Transpole name. The Lille Metro is a VAL system (v\u00e9hicule automatique l\u00e9ger = light automated vehicle) that opened on 16 May 1983, becoming the first automatic light metro line in the world. The system has two lines, with a total length of 45 kilometres (28 miles) and 60 stations. The tram system consists of two interurban tram lines, connecting central Lille to the nearby communities of Roubaix and Tourcoing, and has 45 stops. 68 urban bus routes cover the metropolis, 8 of which reach into Belgium.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nLille is an important crossroads in the European high-speed rail network. It lies on the Eurostar line to London (1:20 hour journey). The French TGV network also puts it only 1 hour from Paris, 38 minutes from Brussels, and connects to other major centres in France such as Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse. Lille has two railway stations, which stand next door to one another: Lille-Europe station (Gare de Lille-Europe), which primarily serves high-speed trains and international services (Eurostar), and Lille-Flandres station (Gare de Lille-Flandres), which primarily serves lower speed regional trains and regional Belgian trains.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nFive autoroutes pass by Lille, the densest confluence of highways in France after Paris:\n\nAutoroute A27 : Lille \u2013 Tournai \u2013 Brussels / Li\u00e8ge \u2013 Germany\nAutoroute A23 : Lille \u2013 Valenciennes\nAutoroute A1  : Lille \u2013 Arras \u2013 Paris / Reims \u2013 Lyon / Orl\u00e9ans / Le Havre\nAutoroute A25 : Lille \u2013 Dunkirk \u2013 Calais \u2013 England / North Belgium\nAutoroute A22 : Lille \u2013 Antwerp \u2013 NetherlandsA sixth one \u2013 the proposed A24 \u2013 will link Amiens to Lille if built, but there is opposition to its route.\n\n\n=== Air traffic ===\nLille Lesquin International Airport is 15 minutes from the city centre by car (11 km). In terms of shipping, it ranks fourth, with almost 38,000 tonnes of freight which pass through each year. Its passenger traffic, around 1.2 million in 2010, is modest due to the proximity to Brussels, Charleroi, and Paris-CDG airports. The airport mostly connects other French and European cities (some with low-cost airlines).\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\n\nLille is the third-largest French river port after Paris and Strasbourg. The river De\u00fble is connected to regional waterways with over 680 km (423 mi) of navigable waters. The De\u00fble connects to Northern Europe via the River Scarpe and the River Scheldt (towards Belgium and the Netherlands), and internationally via the Lys River (to Dunkerque and Calais).\nShipping statistics\n\n\n== Education ==\nWith over 110,000 students, the metropolitan area of Lille is one of France's top student cities.\n\nWith roots back from 1562 to 1793 as University of Douai, (then as Universit\u00e9 Imp\u00e9riale in 1808), the State University of Lille was established in Lille in 1854 with Louis Pasteur as the first dean of its Faculty of Sciences. A school of medicine and an engineering school were also established in Lille in 1854; and the University of Lille was united as the association of existing public Faculties in 1896. It was then split into three independent university campuses in 1970: Lille 1 University of Science and Technology, Lille 2 University of Law and Health, and Lille 3 Charles de Gaulle University of Humanities, Social sciences, Literature and Arts.At the beginning of 2018, Lille 1, Lille 2 and Lille 3 merged to form the new University of Lille (student enrollment: 70,000).\nIt is part of the Community of Universities and Institutions (COMUE) Lille Nord de France and the European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France.\n\nThe Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech, an engineering graduate school of industrial and mechanical engineering, settled in Lille in 1900. This campus is one of the eight Teaching and Research Center (CER) of the school. Its creation was decided by Pierre-Nicolas Legrand de L\u00e9rant.\nEcole Centrale de Lille is one of the five Centrale Graduate Schools of engineering in France; it was founded in Lille city in 1854, its graduate engineering education and research center was established as Institut industriel du Nord (IDN) in 1872, in 1968 it moved in a modern campus in Lille suburb.\n\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de chimie de Lille was established as Institut de chimie de Lille in 1894 supporting chemistry research as followers of Kuhlmann's breakthrough works in Lille.\n\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de journalisme de Lille, journalism school created in 1924.\nSkema Business School established in 1892 is ranked among the top business schools in France.\n\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies settled in Lille in 2009.\nESME-Sudria and E-Artsup settled in Lille in 2012.\nThe ESA \u2013 \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Affaires is a Business Management school established in Lille in 1990.\nIEP Sciences-Po Lille political studies institute was established in Lille in 1992.\nThe Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action is also located in Lille.\nThe Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group) established in Lille in 1988.\nThe European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France is headquartered in Lille Metropolis and includes 3,000 PhD Doctorate students supported by university research laboratories.\nThe Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Lille was founded in 1875. Today it has law, economics, medicine, physics faculties and schools. Among the most famous is Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers (ICAM) founded in 1898, ranked 20th among engineering schools, with the specificity of graduating polyvalent engineers, Ecole des Hautes \u00e9tudes d'ing\u00e9nieur (HEI) a school of engineering founded in 1885 and offering 10 fields of specialization, \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes commerciales du nord (EDHEC) founded in 1906, IESEG School of Management founded in 1964 (17th place in the latest Financial Times global ranking of the 90 best masters in management, published on Monday 12 September 2016).  and Skema Business School currently ranked within the top 5, the top 10 and top 15 business schools in France, respectively.

        "wiki": "Tournai ( toor-NAY, French: [tu\u0281n\u025b]; Picard: Tornai; Walloon: Torn\u00e8 [t\u0254\u0280n\u025b] (listen); Latin: Tornacum), known in Dutch as Doornik and historically as Dornick in English, is a Walloon municipality of Belgium, 85 kilometres (53 miles) southwest of Brussels on the river Scheldt. In the province of Hainaut, Tournai is part of Eurometropolis Lille\u2013Kortrijk\u2013Tournai, which had 2,155,161 residents in 2008.Tournai is one of the oldest cities in Belgium and has played an important role in the country's cultural history.  It was the first capital of the Frankish Empire, with Clovis I being born here.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTournai is located in the Wallonia Picarde (Picard language) and Romance Flanders region of Belgium, at the southern limit of the Flemish plain, in the basin of the River Scheldt (Escaut in French, Schelde in Dutch).  Administratively, the town is part of the Province of Hainaut, itself part of Wallonia. It is also a municipality that is part of the French-speaking Community of Belgium. Tournai has its own arrondissements, both administrative and judicial.\nIts area of 213.75 square kilometres (82.53 square miles) makes it the largest municipality in size in Belgium; it is also the largest in population in Western Hainaut. The municipality of Tournai consists of the former municipalities of \nEre, Saint-Maur, Orcq, Esplechin, Froyennes, Froidmont, Willemeau, Ramegnies-Chin, Templeuve, Chercq, Blandain, Hertain, Lamain, Marquain, Gaurain-Ramecroix, Havinnes, Beclers, Thimougies, Barry, Maulde, Vaulx, Vezon, Kain, Melles, Quartes, Rumillies, Mont-Saint-Aubert, Mourcourt and Warchin.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nRocks from the Tournai area date from the Carboniferous Period and have been used to define the Tournaisian Age, a subdivision of the Carboniferous lasting from 359 to 345 million years ago. Tournai stone is a dark limestone which takes a polish and was used particularly in the Romanesque period for sculpted items such as Tournai fonts. It is also hard enough to have been used locally for pavements and kerb-stones. It is sometimes called Tournai marble, though this is geologically inaccurate.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTournai, known as Tornacum, was a place of minor importance in Roman times, a stopping place where the Roman road from Cologne on the Rhine to Boulogne on the coast crossed the river Scheldt. It was fortified under Maximian in the 3rd century AD, when the Roman limes was withdrawn to the string of outposts along the road. It came into the possession of the Salian Franks in 432. Under king Childeric I, whose tomb was discovered there in 1653, Tournai was the capital of the Frankish empire. In 486, Clovis moved the center of power to Paris. In turn, a native son of Tournai, Eleutherius, became bishop of the newly created bishopric of Tournai, extending over most of the area west of the Scheldt. In 862 Charles the Bald, first king of Western Francia and still to become Holy Roman Emperor, would make Tournai the seat of the County of Flanders.\n\nAfter the partition of the Frankish empire by the Treaties of Verdun (843) and of Meerssen (870), Tournai remained in the western part of the empire, which in 987 became France. The city participated in 11th-century rise of towns in the Low Countries, with a woollen cloth industry based on English wool, which soon made it attractive to wealthy merchants. An ambitious rebuilding of the cathedral was initiated in 1030. The commune's drive for independence from the local counts succeeded in 1187, and the city was henceforth directly subordinated to the French Crown, as the seigneurie de Tournaisis, as the city's environs are called. The stone Pont des Trous over the Scheldt, with defensive towers at either end, was built in 1290, replacing an earlier wooden structure.\nDuring the 15th century, the city's textile trade boomed and it became an important supplier of tapestry. The art of painting flourished too: Jacques Daret, Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden all came from Tournai. It was captured in 1513 by Henry VIII of England, making it the only Belgian city ever to have been ruled by England. It was also represented in the 1515 Parliament of England. The city was handed back to French rule in 1519, following the Treaty of London (1518).\n\nIn 1521, Emperor Charles V added the city to his possessions in the Low Countries, leading to a period of religious strife and economic decline. During the 16th century, Tournai was a bulwark of Calvinism, but eventually it was conquered by the Spanish governor of the Low Countries, the Duke of Parma, following a prolonged siege in 1581. After the fall of the city, its Protestant inhabitants were given one year to sell their possessions and emigrate, a policy that was at the time considered relatively humane, since very often religious opponents were simply massacred.\nOne century later, in 1668, the city briefly returned to France under Louis XIV in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. After the end of the War of Spanish Succession in 1713, under terms of the Treaty of Utrecht the former Spanish Netherlands, including Tournai, came into possession of the Austrian Habsburgs. In 1794, France annexed the Austrian Netherlands during the French Revolutionary Wars and Tournai became part of the department of Jemmape. From 1815 on, following the Napoleonic Wars, Tournai formed part of the United Netherlands and after 1830 of newly independent Belgium. Badly damaged in 1940, Tournai has since been carefully restored.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nTournai is considered to be one of the most important cultural sites in Belgium. The mixed Romanesque- and Gothic-style cathedral of Notre Dame de Tournai and the belfry, considered the oldest in Belgium, have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.  Inside the cathedral,  the Ch\u00e2sse de Notre-Dame flamande, a beautifully ornate 12th-century reliquary, gives witness to Tournai's wealth in the Middle Ages.  Other places of interest are the 13th-century Scheldt bridge (Pont des Trous) and the main square (Grand Place), as well as several old city gates, historic warehouses, and a variety of museums.\nOn rue Barre-St-Brice are two of the oldest private houses in Europe, dating from between 1175 and 1200 and built in the Romanesque style, while the rue des J\u00e9suites includes a Gothic house from the 13th century.\nAs in many Belgian cities there are a number of caf\u00e9s and pubs in the Grand Place. In the middle of the Grand Place there are a series of water fountains while the circular staircase to the top of the belfry can be climbed.\nThere are several buildings in the art nouveau style.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== A French-speaking Walloon town ===\n\nTournai is a French-speaking town of Belgium. The local language is tournaisien, a Picard dialect similar to that of other communes of Hainaut and Northern France.\nTournai belongs to Romance Flanders, like Lille, Douai, Tourcoing, and Mouscron. The city of Tournai was one of the greatest cultural and economic centers of the County of Flanders.  Some traces can still be seen today:\n\nThe gothic choir of Our Lady's Cathedral is a precursory element of the Scaldian (meaning from the Scheldt area), typically Flemish, Gothic art.\nThe bishopric of Tournai was the religious capital of Flanders during more than a millennium (from 496 to 1559).\nThe tapestries and draperies of Tournai belong to the great Flemish school of tapestry and Tournai was part of the Flemish Hansa of London, which also included the draper towns of Flanders.\nThe Saint-Brice church of Tournai, dedicated to Saint Britius, is one of the first examples of the hallekerk style, so typical of the Flemish countryside.\nSome of the great Flemish Primitives are from Tournai: Robert Campin, Rogier van der Weyden, Jacques Daret.Although Tournai is in the Flemish cultural area (of the Scheldt), it also possesses some treasures of the Mosan style.  Indeed, the two most beautiful shrines of the Cathedral, commissioned by the Bishop of Tournai, were made in the region of Li\u00e8ge by the artist Nicholas of Verdun: the shrines of Saint-Eleutherius and of Our Lady of Flanders (13th century). Those shrines testify to the opulence of the towns of Tournai and Li\u00e8ge during the Middle-Ages.  The shrine of Our Lady of Flanders has been called one of the seven wonders of Belgium.\n\n\n=== Festivities ===\nThe \"Great Procession\" (in French: Grande Procession) is a procession initiated by the bishop Radbot II during a plague epidemic. It has taken place every year since 1092, with the single exception of the year 1566, when the iconoclasts considerably damaged the religious symbols of the city.  This historic procession unfolds in the streets every second Sunday of September.\nThe first Monday after January 6 is known as \"Lost Monday\" (in French: Lundi perdu) or \"Perjury Monday\" (Lundi parjur\u00e9).  This tradition dates from more than 700 years ago.  The wealthier city inhabitants used to prepare fastidious family dinners and elect a king.  Today, the family dinners have expanded to wider groups and a rabbit dish is often served.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe Faculty of architecture, architectural engineering and urban planning of the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) is located in Tournai.\n\n\n== People born in Tournai ==\nClovis I, first king of all Salian Franks\nGilles Li Muisis, French chronicler and poet (13th century)\nRogier van der Weyden, Flemish painter (15th century)\nJacques Daret, Flemish painter (15th century)\nPierre de La Rue, Franco-Flemish composer (15th century)\nPerkin Warbeck, impostor and pretender to the throne of England (15th century)\nMarbrianus de Orto, Franco-Flemish composer (15th-16th century)\nCharles Blount, 5th Baron Mountjoy, courtier and patron of learning (16th century)\nIsaac Le Maire, pioneering merchant of the VOC, the Dutch East India Company (16th century)\nLouise-Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon (1673\u20131743) illegitimate daughter of Louis XIV of France and his most famous mistress Madame de Montespan.\nDonat Casterman, publisher (18th century)\nPhilippe de la Motte, 1556-1617, Pastor at Tournai (1582/3) and of Walloon Church, Southampton (1586).\nPiat Sauvage, painter (19th century)\nLouis Gallait, painter (19th century)\nJean-Baptiste Mo\u00ebns, philatelist (19th century)\nJules Bara, statesman (19th century)\nGeorges Rodenbach, Symbolist poet and novelist (19th century)\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Dutrieu, cycle racer, stunt driver and aviator (19th and 20th centuries)\nMarc Quaghebeur, writer (20th century)\nXaveer De Geyter, architect (20th century)\nGabrielle Petit, spy for the British Secret Service during the First World War, executed in 1916 by the Germans (20th century)\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Twin towns ==\n Troyes, France\n Villeneuve-d'Ascq, France\n Bethlehem, Palestine\n Tarija, Bolivia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInternationale petitie tegen het bouwproject van een toren in de Unesco zone van de kathedraal van Doornik (Belgi\u00eb).\nUNESCO World Heritage Site Citation\nOfficial site \u2014 The city's site, available in French, English and Dutch.\nTournai City.net \u2014 Online directory for this city.\nJoan of Arc's letter to Tournai \u2014 English translation (by Allen Williamson) of this letter dictated by Joan of Arc on June 25, 1429.\nApis Tornacensis \u2014 database and bibliography about history.\nMedieval Tournai An Academic Resource Center\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale d'Histoire et d'Arch\u00e9ologie de Tournai, an exhaustive list of references on the history of the Tournai region, in French.",

          "The office is housed in the remainder of a Burgundian palace, which must have been very beautiful. The staff are friendly and helpful and there is a good little shop for souvenirs. It is well worth buying a Lille Pass to save money on attractions and fares. We took the bus",

          "Visited to book a City Tour. The Toursit office is housed in an old historic building and at first glance looked closed. Very dark entrance and it appears that lights don't show through the glass - so try the door. There are two desks: one that deals with general information",
          "This is definitely a place to visit inside, not only for its contents and helpful staff but because of its history.......it was the Chapel attached to a Palace which was built but destroyed by fire. The outside now acts as a War Memorial Guided tours of Lille start from inside",
          "We went here completely unaware of what to do during our stay. The staff spent time explaining all we could do in Lille as well as potential excursions to local areas. Clear instructions and honest opinions were most appreciated.",

          "Large outdoor museum dedicated to Norwegian life over the centuries. Lovely gardens to walk around and picnic. Favourite part was the area where they have a different house from each decade from 1910 through to 2001. Suggest allowing 3 hrs to get round the area. We visited",
          "Does as it says on the tin. In winter with the snow it was quite beautiful to walk around. Lots of different wooden cabins and building that represented classic style from days gone by. Set in beautiful surroundings with lakes and woodland. Nice to get out in fresh air after",
          "Nice big park with some 200 old to ancient buildings made of timbers and roof made of slate and grasses. All the buildings were unique in their own ways. There is a big pond which has many wild ducks swimming on crystal clear water. As we were walking out to the exit, we saw",
          "Great idea by a forward thinking man to establish this museum to ancestral treasures. We had a lovely guide share the background of the founder, site, and many of the buildings. During the tour, haunting melodies, played on recorder wafted to us from the pond area - wow. The",
          "Just pure Magic. Amazing village, you can spend 3-6 hours here. Bring a lunch, they have plenty of outdoor tables located all over the enormous property. Most beautiful grounds. Historically amazing, like walking into a time machine. Loved every minute spent here. Great",
          "This open-air museum is exceptional: it's huge, the landscapes are beautiful and history is alive there! There are dressed-up guides in the little houses, some farm animals and the antique furniture is very refined and beautifully carved. This place is bigger and has a wider",
          "Really nice and large museum about the history of Norway in the open air. With a lot of old buildings and nice surroundings you can spend quite a bit of time here. There are also a few activities such as fishing that kids can partake in. The post museum is just part of this",
          "These buildings are fantastic! Just walking in them gives you a feeling of almost being there when they were built.",
          "This is a wonderful way to see how Norwegians lived in the past. Particularly interesting are the farmhouses, which represented a large portion of the population in the country around Lillehammer.",
          "Opportunity to step back in time and see how the people of Norway lived years ago. Great tour guide and much to see. Worth a visit.",
          "Excelente place for expending a historic moment and learnt about how Norwegian people use to live in the old days. Use confortable shoes as there is a lot of walking. Do not miss the Town and visit the Post Museum",
          "This is a must if you are near Lillehammer! An impresdsng collection of norwegian history. Wonderful buildings and homes from 1600 - 1700 and till today. Funny to see homes from the 1950\u2019s 60 - 70 - 80 ... Rich norwegian history!",
          "Great outdoor museum. I love walking around in the various areas, and especially the more \u00abmodern\u00bb part.",
          "A impressive collection of historical log buildings from Norwegian farms. If you have been to the Folkemuseum in Oslo it is more of the same but with a better thematic and complete milieu. Most impressive was the collection of Norwegian house from the 1900\u2019s. very authentic",
          "This is a great place for families with a wide variety of activities. The collection of old buildings is impressive, but it could easily improve with more activity in the outdoor section. In july I did expect people in traditional clothing, doing activities that brought the",
          "This is rather confusing as on the map has a stave church but in actual it is three museums in one+the Postal Museum, Olympic Museum and the church. It is very expensive to see both 195 kroner and 135 kroner to see the church. The gate was open so I saw the church and buildings",
          "This was a guided tour. Fantastic young lady with terrific French and English took us on our walking tour. It included a beautiful old wooden church and a fantastic walk back in time into the school house. The old farmhouse was fascinating. Everyone would find something of",

          "Musium is representing small fishing village that you can visit in Lillehammer. All internal expostions was closed but we spend good time to expore everthing availble on open air. It is good place for about an hour walk where you can return back to old country life and imagine",
          "I have been here several times and it is absolutely a must visit place when you visit Lillehammer. Old re- stored buildings with people guiding you dressed in autentic clothes. Animals used as gardeners and popular attractions for the young ones. During high season craftsmen",
          "Well we were uncultured enough to visit this museum on a Monday, so it was closed BUT we walked around the farms nonetheless. A must-see if you're someone who likes old stuff, walking outdoors, or just lookin for a grand ol time",
          "My husband and I only had two days to spend in Lillehammer - Sunday and Monday. The museum is closed Mondays, so we had to try to fit in a visit to the museum on the Sunday afternoon we arrived. This meant we got to the museum an hour before it closed. Even with such limited",
          "Best open air museum we experienced in Norway. Over 200 structures but all are arranged in interesting and educational groupings. Highly recommend.",
          "Our guide was outstanding, and you could wander all over and see the varied buildings. Sometimes they were not open, which was a disappointment, but it was beautiful",

          "Very interesting place to visit and to learn about the Norwegian way of life in the past. I went with a group we went to church and school. At the school the guide did an act as the teacher and we had to play the roll of students it was total fun.",
          "We are on a group tour and we were shown parts of this museum by a guide. She was excellent and quite funny. I highly recommend having a guide to give you details. I enjoyed the schoolhouse, the wealthy farmers house compound and of course the Stave Church. The grass roofs",
          "Nice way to make to get soaked in Norwegian way of life. Wonderful grounds and houses for different decades.",
          "If you want to know all about how the Norwegians in the area lived thru the ages head on over. The best part is local members of the community staff all the buildings and are knowledgeable of the era they represent. Added bonus of it being in a lovely setting.",
          "5 in one stroke; history, old houses. Norwegian building techniques. Nostalgia to your own childhood, houses from the decades in the 1900s. A stroll in a beatiful park, can be an exercise because of the hilli paths. Meals of various sizes, prices and tastes, both sweet and",

          "The open air museum is amazing. It consists of the traditional Norwegian wooden huts and houses. There are actors dressed in the time periods through out the part to explain things to the visitors. The terrain is covered in grits and a bit hilly. Make sure to bring light",
          "We stayed in Lillehammer and this attraction looked like an obvious place to go. It\u2019s a 15 minute walk from the centre and the entry fee is good value; we didn\u2019t realise how much it covered. Staff are really helpful and explained everything on offer. As UK visitors we didn\u2019t",
          "Really cool way to see what old Norway looked like. We were able to see the church, school house, pond, and farm. Plan lots of time as it's a very large space to explore!",
          "This unique museum provides the opportunity to walk and experience old forggoten days. Hundreds of wooden homes,churches,farmhous rebuild here by a great man Don't miss the performance of young actors restoring past scenes of daily life Spend here two hours without paying",
          "Full Price for walking the grounds. I suggest a winter /spring discount rate as everything was closed but the indoor museum and cafe (coffee only).",
          "A beautiful historical meeting with Norway. From old days to modern times, The Norwegian Queen's childhood home is one of the newer historical buildings. Otherwise, stave churches and old farms will impress, in the summer there are both domestic animals and good people who live",
          "Clearly a premier open air museum and worth the round trip train from Oslo! Maihaugen has a comprehensive variety of Norwegian structures and buildings from farm houses to churches to modern homes that really give you a sense of the culture and history of Norway. Some",
          "Really wonderful and beautifully rendered historic site. Well worth the visit.We especially enjoyed the older parts of the museum village enhanced by the lovely landscape, layout and informative interpretive re-enactors. Spent 3 hours and could have been there longer.",
          "What a exciting way for kids (and adults) to learn about Norway\u2019s history. Very well done in a beautiful setting.",
          "Would have liked to see inside the building but the guide chose which buildings to show us and took so long that the indoor museum was closed on our return",
          "Thought we would spend an hour or so here,three hours later we left! What a great visit we had,so much to see and all so interesting. Live music events were excellent. Themed events were well worth following the programme of the day for.Well done for this worthwhile visit.",
          "Let's be honest, there is not really much to do in Lillehammer especially in May, but this place is great. We went first thing in the morning (11.00am) in May before the season and before the crowds. We did a combo ticket with the Olympic Museum which was also interesting. make",
          "Maihaugen is one of the largest open air museums in Norway with 200 buildings from the 1200s and up to today. In the summer season the museum offers activities, recreation and adventures for the whole family. Join us on a nostalgic journey back to the 20th century. ",
          "This is a nice place to visit if you are interested in history and traditions. The centuries old ways of life has been recreated and the pricing for the tickets are not too bad. As a bonus you get a good view from the top. Could have. Ade it more interesting with guides to know",
          "Great place to walk around in with young children. Lots of old buildings to go into and even fishing in the pond. Staff are friendly.",
          "We were super excited about this place, my wife especially. Unfortunately it did not meet expectations. Understandably as there was snow on the ground not a lot was open. That being said it was still a lot of fun. Great buildings on display, lovely landscape and a great walk.",
          "Unless you want to see inside every building, you can walk through this lovely park before it opens as an attraction for free.",
          "Disappointing Winter Visit- Full price admission for a winter visit. Basically walking on icy pathways to closed (look inside) buildings. Too little information on each to tell enough of the story. I enjoy the grounds but they should offer half price for the winter months. In",
          "Covered in snow this place looks really pretty but most buildings are not accessible in winter. There are some buildings with audio descriptions inside which is nice. Signage is not fantastic so you are walking but not really sure where too. The sights and surroundings are",
          "It is a very nice place to spend a few hours. The terrain is a bit steep at some points, and the map of the area could use some work, but overall it was a great experience.",
          "Skansen- open air museum- is located nearby centrum. You can see a lot of buildings from different times and different areas. You could go in to few of those, which is pretty exciting. But there is small tip: before you start with. open air museum you should see the exhibition",
          "I will recommend a visit to Maihaugen Christmas market in December. You really get the good Christmas feeling. People sell their own homemade food, clothing, candy, cookies, warm drinks and Santa Claus figure's in all kinds of stuff. A choir sings Christmas songs.",
          "Had a really nice day at Maihaugen today. Historical buildings to go in to, lot of activities like horseback riding, making gingerbread and some carpenter work. You could also buy traditional Norwegian food like cheese, rakfisk, smoked salomon etc.",
          "This is a great look into Norway's past and a way to understand what the country is today. Going in and out of Norwegian homes gives you a real feel of the country. The exhibition on Norway through time, too, helps you understand the changes the nation went through. Don't miss",
          "I'm not a museum kind of person but this was wonderful. We ended up with a guided tour so got to go into a few of the buildings and that was a real treat (Stav Kirke, Summer Farm House, Mountain Farm Cabin, etc). The tour was just the right length and felt like a hike through",
          "Maihaugen is well worth a visit. When you arrive at the museum you will notice rusty looking metal poles standing upright, a very strange work of art I thought, quite scruffy......... but wait until you are in the grounds of the museum. Take the path down to the right (the",
          "Great place to see but like all museums I prefer a guide. Our guide was great as we role played in a couple of buildings. We visited the Stave church, schoolhouse and farm. I especially liked seeing the inside of the main farm house.",
          "Great museum with many houses and ancient traditions. Here you can walk around studying old building traditions from Norway. In addition, it is also possible to see the exhibition of many different old crafts.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this lovely museum in Lillehammer. So much history in one place, from the beautiful old Stave Church, the old village, to the period homes so you could see how Norwegians lived through the decades. The setting is absolutely gorgeous and well maintained.",

          "What a great Museum to visit while in Lillehammer. We had a guide to show us around and she was very informative. Great to learn about the early days in Norway. They also have a inside section to go through too. In all a very nice place to visit.",
          "We went there on a day where there was a Christmas market aswell so that was an added bonus. Lots of information about Norways history and easy to look around.",
          "Lovely place to spend a day. Nostalgic to look around the houses from the 50s, 60s, etc and very interesting looking how the Norwegian people lived in years gone by. The site itself is very attractive & you soon forget that you're in the middle of lillehammer. The visitor",
          "Beautiful outdoor museum worth the visit to see. Homes dating back to the 1400's and how the people lived and survived. A lovely place to see.",
          "Maihaugen Open Air Museum is an mazing and unique experience of Norwegian heritage, culture and lifestyle. Perfect for kids as well as adults! Let the kids explore and run around in the fantastic surroundings. Lots of room for play and curiosity amongst the old buildings, and",
          "We enjoyed a lot this museum. There are a lot of different things to see and when the weather is good it's very pleasant to be outside. The entrance is a little bit expensive (175Nok)",
          "Free after 5pm (although various parts locked you still get a great overview). Lovely to walk round on a sunny evening. Well presented and kept. Very picturesque.",
          "I think this is a good way to understand how the Norwegians lived and what their occupations were back in those days. The museum is situated in a park so it is nice to have a walk. There you can also see goats, sheep, pigs and a beautiful and friendly horse. I would recommend a",
          "I'm not one for folk museums but the Malhaugen was surprisingly interesting. I particularly liked walking through the huts with dirt floors and wondering what it would be like to live there. Moving up through history we sat down in an old school classroom and one of the",
          "An interesting visit all year round as long as the weather is nice. Beautiful when covered in snow. Lots of interesting buildings explaining the Norwegian history. A must-see!",
          "300 years ago to 40 years ago, you can see and hear the history of the Norwegian farming families. Kids will love this place as there is a lot for them to check out, peek into windows, run around the outdoors area, etc. The church was busy on the Saturday we were there hosting",
          "There is so much at this museum, it is impossible to see everything even in a full day. The buildings are well preserved and placed in realistic settings for time. The site is clean and well taken care of by staff that were available throughout the park. The guides located in",
          "This is a huge place with lots to see. Very spread-out over a hilltop, don't think you're going to a museum! Not unreasonably so but for anyone with limited mobility it could be a problem. Some have said the Stave church is not the best, but when compared to the remot locations",
          "There are two parts to this museum- Indoor and couple of smaller exhibits, and outdoor the historical buildings. Although we did some of both we enjoyed our time in the outdoor area the most. It was great to stroll on a nice day and look in the Norwegian houses, churches,",
          "It's my first time to visit the country and this was a great introduction to the culture of the country. Kudos to the guides of the museum -- very knowledgeable and friendly.",
          "A lovely small Village which takes you back a few hundred years. Each area is well-explained by the tour guide lady, and very picturesque. walking is easy. One can relax and have a bite near a small pond. I think its open to local during certain times. must see this place.",
          "Visited with my sister on our way out of Lillehammer. We really enjoyed the museum and the variety of houses there. The actors in some of the houses were excellent and it was weird feeling like you were walking around someone's home. The more traditional buildings were really",
          "We were fortunate to have a guide who gave us a tour of the historic rural buildings, describing the lifestyle and conditions of the times. We then wandered around having a peek into many of the dwellings and the pretty Garmo stave church. The setting is lovely, set around a",
          "If you love historic homes, this is a very nice collection of old buildings including a stave church and school. This museum progresses in time, so you have farms, etc.from the middle ages, then progress to town main street with village shops, post office band train station.",
          "The title is rather misleading like the tree climbing goats in Morocco. It has multiple cottages used for different purposes. We didn't notice any major things to brag about it. But, the indoor museum was ver nice.",
          "What a wonderful place to visit!! To see so many different types of building in one place was fantastic. The church was beautiful and the railway/postal exhibition was very interesting. Allow a good 3 to 4 hours!",
          "I would not want to go here on a day with rainy or even gloomy weather. It is an outdoor experience for the most part. I wish there was more information available around the place, I know they really want us to join the guided tours, but that isn't for everyone. It is very",
          "Even though the museum wasn't open when we visited, we found the walk through the \"community\" very interesting and historic. In our opinion, it is a must see while visiting Lillehammer.",

          "Maihaugen is an amazing collection of historic buildings. We went off season and so could not look inside them, but still enjoyed visiting this site. I took many photographs of old doors with their interesting hinges.",
          "We went in April and there weren't any people running the museum, but it was open to walk around and some of the buildings had signs inviting you to look inside. These had artifacts and information inside to look at. It was possible to peek in the windows of other buildings that",
          "The Maiahugen Open-Air museum is an extensive collection of the finest buildings through time. It was a fascinating look at the history of the place.",
          "The Maiahugen Open-Air Museum is a unique experience. We went on an icy, wintry day, and although the pathways were difficult to maneuver, it was a beautiful walk that let us experience life in a Norwegian village of the past. It was a memorable day. In addition, we had a",
          "I finished skiing early and checked out Maihaugen. Fascinating look at the history of Norwegian lifestyle ( it was winter so it made you realise how tough it must have been!). To escape the chill I visited the Olympic museum which was fabulous. Lots of local memories but a heap",
          "we enjoyed walking around even on a cold day, being able to walk around and go in to the buildings gave you a real ideav of what life was like. the exhibits are well done and interactive and it is a nice park to walk around. they also had an exhitbit of the Birkebiener ski race",
          "We visited on a cold, sunny day in February with snow on the ground. Whilst many of the buildings were closed because of the time of year, there was still plenty to see. We started with rural Norway; a range of historical buildings from farm and fishing areas. You could peer",
          "A very nice place to visit for everyone who is interested in history and historical roots, and the way of living in previous centuries. Full of real historical buildings, tradition and workmanship. Nice exhibitions and no stress. Absolutely worth visiting when in this region.",
          "This museum showcases the architectural and cultural history in a large park area. Ideal for families, it is a great way to spend a day in any season. Some of the buildings are over one thousand years old. The new Winter Olympic Museum is excellent and innovative.",
          "it is a big area, it's nice for a walk. Same time it is very educational as well. Winter is nice there, but it\u00b4s even greater in a summer time. Good place to go with a kids.",
          "Although it was terribly cold when I visited, it was well worth our time in the cold to see Norway's progression through history. The tour guide was so knowledgable and entertaining and our group learned quite a bit about Norway's history. The views were beautiful and I was so",
          "I've been here four times (at least), one time I went with a good friend, and we had a blast together. A second time I went with my international students, and we got a guided tour, also a blast, and the guide was quite skilled and informative. I'll just put a random month in,",
          "We truly enjoyed the winter walk through the site. Seeing all the old buildings covered in snow was a beautiful site. On the day we visited, they even had small animals available for viewing (Sheet, goats, pigs, rabbits). Our children who are half Norwegian now understand more",

          "Went for the winter fair lots for the whole family to do. Children loved the animals and cooking ginger bread . There is a lot of local craft stalls and local foods to discover. If you are in Lillehammer this weekend it is well worth a visit.",

          "Maihaugen might be the reason why I like these old timber buildings so much, coming here for the first time when I was just a tiny tot. Haven't been here for ten years, much hasn't changed but some things are new. Came here with the family for the annual \"children's Sunday\" and",
          "This is the Place to og if you are in the Lillehammer area on a sunny day, and want a bit of nature, quietness and to see how the rural Norwegian lived some hundred years ago.",
          "This is a great open-air folk museum, with many examples of historic Norwegian buildings. The grounds are extensive, so be prepared to spend several hours if you want to cover the whole thing. We were there in late August, so there weren't as many demonstrations or costumed",
          "We visited the Maihaugen Museum during a stay near Lillehammer. The museum has moved and restored buildings from the nearby Lillehammer from the Middle Ages to near present. The museum has done an excellent job of placing the buildings in a manner that makes it easy to take in",

          "Unfortunately I found there wasn't much to see or do here. It was more enjoyable to see the actual Norwegian countryside where many buildings like the ones in this museum are still standing.",
          "Great place but wear you walking shoes. Peer Gynts house was there although I thought it would have been in a more prominent place. Buy the combined ticket for the Olympic museum.",

          "Maihaugen is a must see for people who love history and wood built structures...these open air set buildings were moved to this site from many locations. They date back in time to very far back ... One of the oldest is the Stave Church with painted walls, carved ornamental work",

          "This beautiful open air museum has buildings from almost every decade of the 20th century, which means also my child from the 80's is now on display. Great fun to revisit the 80's, and also feed the ducks, pet the sheep, etc. Explaining to the children the concept of a telephone",

          "Spent an afternoon here but so much to see could easily have spent a whole day. A variety of exhibits from very old houses coming right up to much more recent homes. Unfortunately these more recent homes were not open the day of our visit. A great insight into how people lived.",
          "Two parts.. Old mediaeval settlement with different house types from all over Norway. Second part a small town and a house from each decade. Very cool to see how they have changed.",
          "The Open-Air Museum is a great way to learn about Norwegian history, from the first log cabins to present day. It is a nice walk through the ages to explore how the culture developed. Inside the main building there are some interesting displays that bring the historical story",
          "Grateful there are people like the dentist who collected old homes and reassembled them so people like me could have a peek into the way Norwegians have lived and continue to live. I'm afraid we came at a time where we were unable to totally experience all this museum could",

          "Just finished our visit...the outdoor buildings were locked up but interesting to see (would be much better if unlocked, even if not staffed, with more information posted about each building). The exhibit inside was very good, though it had some audio/video difficulties that had",
          "We had a couple of hours to spend in Lillehammer and since the Olympic park was closed we went for Maihaugen. And it was definitely a good idea! The park is much bigger than we expected and the area generally is much more interesting than one would expect. We knew this concept",
          "Maihaugen is a nice activity to do with family and friends who are visiting from out of town. I really like the \"old village\" section with the beautifully preserved traditional houses. The inside museum is also very interesting and provides an interesting historical look at life",
          "Norwegians have a yen for sports (in particular when we are winning) and the new museum celebrating Norwegian achievement is loaded with nostalgia and patriotism on steroids. My favorite display (well, challenge) was the biathlon test range, where you shoot 5 shots, whereupon",

          "Nice reconstruction of Norway's past from late middle ages until today covering many aspects of life in the country. There is a big exhibit on the mail service which was interesting. In high season there are more actors playing the roles of past people and it should be even more",

          "I am not especially interested in houses, but this collection is something really special. And if you have the opportunity a visit to the houses from the 1900 is really entertaining with live \"population\" in the houses! The area is huge and its a beautiful place to spend the",
          "We went to Maihaugen this morning on our second day of Norway vacation trip. Our kid like the museum. Since he learned about some Europe history during his school year. This one is more focus on norwaygian history which gave him more detail regional story. The wooden house and",

          "A sense of this region of old Norway. Maihaugen lets you wander around structures depicting both rural and city environments, and in many cases retains furniture and accessories to give you a more detailed sense of what life was like. Costumed staff is on hand to answer",
          "Wonderful open air museum taking you through Norwegian settlements from 1300 to 2000. Includes a stavechurch - absolutely a great possibility to see how Norwegians have lived.",
          "Unfortunately I did not have enough time to spend here, as I would have needed an entire day to enjoy every little place. Seeing a part of this history brought me to the times I imagined in Mark Twain's books :)",
          "I am told that there are setups like this in oslo too, however, we took a two hours trains from oslo to visit the place and were not disappointed except that we wish we had more time. Very well kept and pleasing landscape and of course the acedemic value is immense. I wish they",
          "While Maihagen is beautiful and interesting, the price is a bit too high for the experience it offers. I found the outside area a bit bland, to be honest. I felt like similar experiences could be found at a better price elsewhere. The informational signs were often a bit too",
          "just a nice summary of typical norwegian life and history on a huge areal and definitely to be visited. nice to see local people acting as multi-langual guides",
          "The open-air museum has a very interesting exhibition of traditional buildings, exhibiting day-to-day life in previous times. Interesting as it may be, we were disappointed from two things: 1. The place is not sufficiently mapped, direction signs and guidance are insufficient,",
          "Maihaugen in Lillehammer is a excellent place to visit if you want to see how norwegians used to live before and until now. You can also see old shops, farms, bakeries, a church and more. In the summer time all the shops are open, so you can buy different stuff. In houses from",
          "Great museum for both traditional Norwegian houses and more modern houses. Personally I loved the collection of houses from the 20th century - it was a good trip down memory lane. The scenery is also great - the whole museum feels like a big park",

          "We liked the church in wood, the typical norwegian houses from various century, the surrounding nature and also the exhibition around norway history with nice film and animations. Worth to see while in Lillehamer",

          "Maihaugen is a fascinating look into life in Norway in the 'olden days'. Some of my ancestors emigrated from this area and here it was possible to imagine how they used to live. The museum is lovingly kept up, and there is lots to see.",

          "We loved the autumn walk through the open air museum. The trees, leaves and traditional buildings were beautiful as was the pond. Even when closed, it was a treat to walk through with lovely views across the valley. The conservationists at work were an inspiration.",
          "It was kept up nicely and the grounds were authentic..the actors played the part & we even went to school... we were on a tour and maybe it was because we didn't spend enough time there...it just seemed that we were rushed. The inside museum is Definitely worth seeing ...check",

          "This is a very well laid out and maintained place where they have quite effectively re-created life in 17th, 18th and 19th century Norway. Multilingual (English for us) guide made it even more life-like with great anecdotes and good sense of humour. I wouldn't go without a guide",

Soon she joined Ballets Russes which ventured to success in Paris. She later met war-time difficulties in Petrograd and in turbulent Kiev. In France again, public acclaim for her works came quickly, cresting in the 1920s. She then enjoyed continuing successes in Europe and the Americas.\nNijinska played a pioneering role in the broad movement that diverged from 19th-century classical ballet. Her introduction of modern forms, steps, and motion, and a minimalist narrative, prepared the way for future neoclassical works.After serious home learning, she began at nine her lengthy formal training in Saint Petersburg, then the Russian capital. She graduated in 1908 as an 'Artist of the Imperial Theatres'. An early breakthrough came in 1910 in Paris when a member of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. For her dance solo Nijinska created the role of Papillon in Carnaval, a ballet written and designed by Fokine.She assisted her famous brother Vaslav Nijinsky as he worked up his controversial choreography for L'Apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune, which Ballets Russes premiered in Paris in 1912. Similarly, she aided him in his creation of the 1913 ballet Le Sacre du Printemps.\nShe developed her art in Petrograd and Kiev during the great war, revolution and civil war. While herself in theaters performing, she worked independently to design and stage her first choreographies. Nijinska started a ballet school on progressive lines in Kiev, and published her writing on the art of movement.In 1921 she fled Russian authorities. She rejoined the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev appointed her choreographer of this influential company based in France. Nijinska thrived, creating several popular, cutting-edge ballets to contemporary music. In 1923, with a score by Stravinsky she choreographed her iconic work Les Noces [The Wedding].Starting in 1925, with a variety of companies and venues she designed and mounted ballets in Europe and the Americas. Among them: Teatro Col\u00f3n, Ida Rubinstein, Op\u00e9ra Russe \u00e0 Paris, Wassily de Basil, Max Reinhardt, Markova-Dolin, Ballet Polonaise, Ballet Theatre, the Hollywood Bowl, Jacob's Pillow, Serge Denham, Marquis de Cuevas, as well as her own companies.\nDue to war in 1939 she relocated from Paris to Los Angeles. Nijinska continued working in choreography and as an artistic director. She taught at her studio. In the 1960s for The Royal Ballet in London, she staged revivals of her Ballets Russes-era creations. Her Early Memoirs, translated into English, was published posthumously.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBronislava Nijinska was the third child of the Polish dancers Tomasz [Foma] Nijinsky and Eleonora Nijinska (maiden name Bereda), who were then traveling performers in provincial Russia. Bronislava was born in Minsk, but all three children were baptized in Warsaw. She was the younger sister of Vaslav Nijinsky, a ballet star of world renown.\n\n\n=== A family of dancers ===\nEach of their parents had begun dancing careers in Warsaw at the Teatr Wielki (the Grand Theater). When they later met each was already a ballet professional with the Setov troupe based in Kiev. With the troupe they performed in provincial capitals of the then Russian Empire. They were married in Baku. Tomasz [Foma in Russian] Nijinsky, five years younger, had risen to be premier danseur and ballet master. His wife Eleonora Bareda, orphaned at seven, had followed her elder sister into ballet, and was then dancing as a first soloist.The father Tomasz [Foma] Nijinsky, using his abilities as a ballet master, came to manage his own small troupe of a dozen dancers, plus students. In 1896 he staged the Fountain of Bakhchisarai, from an 1823 poem by Pushkin. He created a ballet pantomime, performed in circus-theaters, using Polish and Russian music. Her mother Eleonora danced the role of the captured princess. Tomasz choreographed \"two very successful ballets\", the other being Zaporozbeskaya Tcharovnitza. Nijinska implies that their small troupe prospered, but that has been questioned. In addition to renting theaters for his shows, Tomasz contracted with Caf\u00e9 Chantants, popular nightspots where patrons dined while being entertained with music and dance. Family life was surrounded by artists at work and at home. Her father \"loved to be with painters, writers, actors, and musicians.\" Two touring African-American tap dancers, Jackson and Johnson, visited their home, and gave Nijinska her first lessons.\n\nIn the past Tomasz had forgone opportunities, turning down dance offers because of his family obligations. In 1897 near Saint Petersburg, Eleonora and Thomasz danced on stage together for the last time. He then continued on the road alone as a dancer. On a prior trip to Finland, he had become involved with a fellow dancer. Eventually this led to a permanent separation from his wife. His relationships with his children accordingly suffered; he then saw infrequently.Alone Eleonora soon established permanent residence in Saint Petersburg, after years of continual travel with her three children. She rented a large flat and opened a pension. Bronislava records that her brother Vaslav (or Vatsa) became bitter and years later turned against his father for the pain his mother endured.\n\n\n=== Her brother Vatsa ===\n\"By nature Vaslav [Vatsa] was a very lively and adventurous boy.\" In her book Early Memoirs Nijinska writes about the adventures of young Vatsa, older than her by 22 months. Living with a mother and father who danced on stage and were regularly traveling on tour, the children acquired an intrepid attitude and a physical prowess in everyday life. The two parents encouraged their children's athletic development and, while scolding misbehavior, were not punitive. Curiosity drove Vatsa to explore his frequently-new neighborhoods, sometimes crossing parental lines. His bravery and daring on rooftops impressed Broni.\n\nHow Vatsa loved to climb! Whenever he was at the top of a tree, on a high post, on the swing, or on the roof of our house, I noticed a rapturous delight on his face, a delight to feel his body high above the ground, suspended in midair.\nVatsa investigated the strange streets of different towns and cities where the family's theatrical life took them. Along the way he was training his body. It became an instrument of extraordinary strength and balance. Seemingly without fear he relished his freedom. His mind took innovative turns, which his body followed, or vice versa. Often Broni was invited along. From Vatsa's adventures she, too, acquired a body unusually trained for dance.\n\n\n=== Childhood dance skills ===\n\nHer parents not only were dancing on stage, they also taught ballroom dancing to adults and had special dance classes for children. Early on they instructed their daughter in folk dances: Polish, Hungarian, Italian, and Russian. She learned ballet, together with all kinds of different dance steps. She picked up some acrobatic techniques from her father, who would 'talk shop' and trade skills with circus performers. Later she was able to draw on this rich experience in her choreographic works.Broni Nijinska was not quite four when she made her theatrical debut in a Christmas pageant with her brothers in Nizhny Novgorod. She seemed always familiar with being on stage, in children's skits or to make brief appearances on the adult stage. Her aunt Stepha, her mother's elder sister, had retired from performance but was teaching dance in Vilno; she helped Broni. Dancers with her parents would give her lessons or tips. After their parents' separation, her brother Vaslav Nijinsky entered the Imperial Theatrical School. When about nine years old, Broni began ballet lessons with the famous Enrico Cecchetti. He quickly recognized her skills.\n\n\n=== Imperial Theatrical School ===\nIn 1900, Bronislava Nijinska was accepted into the same state-sponsored school for performing arts. Her brother Vaslav had entered it two years before. Located in Sankt Peterburg, it offered a program of many years duration. As with Vaslav's acceptance, her mother enlisted support from various people connected to ballet, including Stanilas Gillert and Cecchetti. Present at the entrance examination were 214 candidates ready to demonstrate their dance abilities. Legendary ballet master Marius Petipa participated in the trials, as did Cecchetti and Legat. Twelve girls were accepted.Bronislava graduated in 1908, taking 'First Award' for achievement both in dance and in academic subjects. Seven women graduated that year. In addition to her diploma she was enlisted as an 'Artist of the Imperial Theatre'. It was a government formality which assured her of financial security and the privileged life of a professional dancer.\n\n\n== Of Vaslav Nijinsky, her brother ==\n\n\n=== His influence while at Ballets Russes ===\nPerhaps her brother Vaslav Nijinsky had the greatest influence on Bronislava Nijinska and her career. In Nijinska's memoir several times she describes that Vaslav from a young age followed his overwhelming curiosity. Although his dancing skill was praised in school and he learned several musical instruments, she notes his low academic performance; she attributes it to his disinterest and impatience. Instead he'd set off with daring to explore the neighborhoods and test his physical limits. This contributed to his becoming an incredible dancer. At Mariinsky Theater he quickly rose and at Ballets Russes he became famous almost overnight. Soon Vaslav was performing as a star principal dancer.\n\nAs his pupil she became the first person to know and be influenced by his radically new ideas regarding dance and his desire to substitute a rigorously stylized form of movement for the classical ballet tradition.\nShe describes his innovations in creating a new Blue Bird role for the ballet The Sleeping Princess in 1907: how he changed the restrictive costume and energized the movements. When Nijinsky created L'Apr\u00e8s-midi d'un Faune [Afternoon of the Faun] in 1912 he used Nijinska to rehearse it in secret, to follow with her body his description of the steps one by one.She similarly assisted him in creating Le Sacre du Printemps [Rite of Spring]. Yet due to her pregnancy, Nijinska withdrew from the role of the Chosen Maiden. Prof. Garafola, however, characterizes it as her brother 'evicting' her from the maiden role in Rite. Nonetheless, Baer writes:\n\nAlthough Bronislave Nijinska is often identified as the sister of the celebrated Vaslav Nijinsky, she was a major artist in her own right and a key figure in the development of twentieth-century ballet. ... As one of twentieth-century's ballet's great innovators, she transformed the art.\nHer 1913 break with DiaghilevWhen her brother suddenly married, Diaghilev terminated his position at Ballets Russes. Bronislava Nijinska left the company in solidarity with him.\nDuring a 1913 Ballets Russes tour in South American, Vaslav Nijinsky married Romola de Pulszky. It created controversy in the company and in ballet stories from the tour. As Nijinska explains in her memoirs, Vaslav was very reserved and, other than herself, had few confidants or even close colleagues in the dance world. He was a young man alone on the tour when he wed. He was alone because her pregnancy had kept her in Europe.Nijinska speculated that, behind the scenes, business decisions had motivated events. By getting rid of Nijinsky, Diaghilev managed to secure financing and the return of the choreographer Fokine to the company. The break left emotional scars, and a sense of betrayal. Diaghilev dismissed Vaslav for reasons other than his September marriage: artistic quarrels over ballet design, his military draft status, and his demand for payments in arrears.\n\n\n=== 'Saison Nijinsky' 1914, and later ===\n\nIn early 1914 Vaslav Nijinsky on his own started a new ballet company in London: Saison Nijinsky. Bronislava offered her assistance, yet learned there was only a short time to prepare for its premiere performance. Vaslav had signed a contract to open at a dance hall, the London Palace Theatre, in four and a half weeks (March 2). Nijinska quickly decided to return to Russia to recruit the cast, but Warsaw was where the experienced dancers were found. She with others explained her brother's innovative choreographies. She directed rehearsals, as musicians and scores, sets and costumes were arranged.Nijinska herself was to perform, e.g., with Vaslav in Le Spectre de la rose. Its anticipated premiere was well received. Vaslav's brilliant dancing drew prolonged applause. After performing for two weeks, however, a business dispute developed. It arose when Nijinsky became sick and unable to perform for a few days. It led the theater owner Alfred Butt to cancel the company's season. Nijinsky managed to pay his dancers. Some attributed the company's downfall to Vaslav's erratic emotional tendencies, which had intensified after his recent marriage and his dismissal from Ballets Russes.\nReunited in 1921Brother and sister became separated for seven years, first by World War I, then by the Russian Revolution, followed by the Russian Civil War. There was little chance for communication as mail service first became irregular and then was discontinued. In 1921 they met again in Vienna, where they remained together for a short time.\n\n\n== Career as a dancer ==\n\n\n=== Imperial Ballet in Saint Petersburg: 1908\u20131911 ===\nIn 1908, Nijinska was admitted to the Imperial Ballet (then also known as the Mariinsky Ballet and later known as the Kirov Ballet). She followed in her brother's footsteps. In the corps de ballet her first year, she performed in Michel Fokine's Les Sylphides. Under his gaze and leadership, she was able to directly experience Fokine's choreographic vision of this master on the cutting-edge. Both she and her brother Nijinsky, however, left Russia during the summers of 1909 and 1910 to perform for Diaghilev's company in Paris.Nijinska danced with the Mariinsky Ballet for three years. Yet the growth and insights acquired at Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, which was then unexpectedly revolutionizing the ballet world, clearly exceeded that at Mariinsky Theater. Then, suddenly, she felt compelled to resign after the Theater's dismissal of her brother Vaslav, chiefly because his star performances in Paris were making ballet-world headlines. As a result, Nijinska was deprived of her rights respecting the title 'Artist of the Imperial Theaters' and its associated income.\n\n\n=== Diaghilev & Ballets Russes in Paris: 1909\u20131913 ===\n\nNijinska appeared in the Sergei Pavlovitch Diaghilev's first two Paris seasons, 1909 and 1910. After leaving the Mariinsky, she became a permanent member of his newly formed company, Ballets Russes. In 1912 she had married fellow dancer Aleksander Kochetowsky, and gave birth to their daughter Irina in 1913.\n\nHere initially Nijinska danced in the corps de ballet, e.g., in Swan Lake (the Czardas), in Les Sylphides (the Mazurka), and in Le Spectre de la Rose. As she developed on the professional stage she was promoted, and eventually given significant parts. Her brother coached her for the role of Papillon [the butterfly] in Fokine's Carnaval (1909). In part danced with feet and hands fluttering in a coordinated rhythm at an accelerated prestissimo tempo, she eluded Pierrot, played in pantomime by Vsevolod Meyerhold. The role of the Ballerina Doll in Petruchka (1912) was also transformed. By changing the doll's demeanor from theatrical in a tutu to realistic in street clothes, Nijinska modernized the role. She also continually kept in character rather than slipping back into the default look of classical ballet. Among others, the pseudo-Hindu dance of the Bayadere Enivree in Le Dieu bleu she did, but did not care for. She struggled and grew as an Odalisque in the popular ballet Scheherazade.In the 1912 production of Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre, she at first danced the Bacchanale (replacing Vera Fokine). Then she switched roles, being awarded Karsavina's role of Ta-Hor. \"Karsavina danced the role on toe, but I would dance it in my bare feet.\" She used a liquid body make-up. For Ta-Hor she received treasured compliments from other artists, both for her dance art and for her dramatic interpretation. The next year she performed in her brother's Jeux (Games). Nijinska assisted her brother Vaslav in his creation of the ballet Le Sacre du printemps (Rite of Spring) which premiered in 1913. Particularly for the Chosen Maiden role, she carefully follow Nijinsky's instructions as to movement and pose, as the ballet choreography slowly developed. Yet when she became aware of her pregnancy, she told him she'd have to withdraw and miss its opening performance, angering her brother.In 1914 she danced for Saison Nijinsky (see section above).\n\n\n=== In Petrograd with Sasha & in Kiev: 1915\u20131921 ===\nAfter Saison Nijinsky, Bronislava returned to Russia. She continued her ballet career as danseuse, with Sasha her husband as the danseur. During the war and then the revolution, she went on stage in experimental works as well as in classics. In Petrograd the 1915 theatre program listed \"ballet by the prima ballerina-artist of the State Ballet Bronislava Nijinska\". The program included music by Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and Borodin. She performed in her own choreographed solos, Le Poupee or Tabatierr, and Autumn Song. Her dance savvy was lauded.In Kiev in addition to dancing, she established her ballet school and began to choreograph programs. She danced in solos while costumed in tunics, e.g., Etudes (Liszt), Mephisto Valse (Liszt), Nocturnes (Chopin), Preludes (Chopin), Fear or Horror (in silence, costume by Exter), and in company performances, e.g., Twelfth Rhapsody (Liszt), Demons (Tcherepnine), March Funebre (Chopin). In 1921 she left Russia, never to return.\n\n\n=== Diaghilev's Ballets Russes: 1921\u20131925, and 1926 ===\nRejoining Ballets Russes in Paris, Nijinska first worked in Diaghilev's ill-starred 1921 London revival of the Petipa's classic The Sleeping Princess. Although a money loser, it was popular, and well designed and danced. Nijinska performed the roles of the Hummingbird Fairy and Pierette, for which she received \"high critical praise\".In 1922, following a personal request by Diaghilev, she performed the title role in Nijinsky's L'Apr\u00e8s-midi d'un Faune during its Paris revival. She had helped her brother with its choreography for its 1912 premier. \"Vaslav is creating his Faune by using me as his model. I am like a piece of clay that he is molding ...\" Yet these appearance became clearly auxiliary to her new, 'second career' working as the choreographer.From 1921 to 1924, 1926 with Ballets Russes, Nijinska nonetheless took prominent roles in many of her own dance designs. Accordingly, she performed as the Lilac Fairy in The Sleeping Beauty (1921), the Fox in Le Renard (1922), as the Hostess in Les Biches (1924), as Lysandre in Les F\u00e2cheux (1924), and as the Tennis Player in Le Train Bleu (1924).\n\n\n=== In Europe & the Americas: 1925\u20131934 ===\nSubsequently, for her own ballet companies and for others, she danced in roles of her own inventions: in Holy Etudes, Touring, Le Guignol, and Night on Bald Mountain (all 1925); for Teatro Col\u00f3n in Estudios religiosos (1926); in her Capricio Espagnole per Rimsky-Korsakoff in 1931; and in the 1934 ballet based on Hamlet per Liszt: the title role. She performed into the 1930s, at venues in Europe and the Americas.\nAs Nijinska reached her forties, her performance career neared its end. What caused her trouble, and hastened the close of her performance art, was an injury to her Achilles tendon suffered in 1933 while at Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires.\n\n\n=== Appraisals, critiques ===\n\nHer qualities as a dancer, of course, are distinct from her more celebrated choreography. Comments by several professional colleagues were collected by the New York ballet critic and author Lynn Garafola:\n\"She was a very strong dancer, and danced very athletically for a lady, and had a big jump,\" commented Frederic Franklin, a dancer and ballet master. \"She had incredible endurance, and seemed never to be tired,\" recalled Anatole Vilzak, who was a principal dancer in many of her mature choreographies. English dancer Lydia Sokolova, noting her lack of makeup, thought she appeared \"a most unfeminine woman, though there was nothing particularly masculine about her character. Thin but immensely strong, she had iron muscles in her arms and legs, and her highly developed calf muscles resembled Vaslav's; she had the same way of jumping and pausing in the air.\" Alicia Markova, a prima ballerina absoluta of Britain, concluded that Nijinska \"was a strange combination, this terrific strength, and yet there was a softness.\"The composer Igor Stravinsky, to whose music she created several fine choreographic works, wrote that \"Bronislava Nijinska, sister of the famous dancer [is] herself an execellent dancer endowed with a profoundly artistic nature.\" After helping her brother Vaslav for many months in his laborious design of the 1913 ballet Le Sacre du Printemps (music by Stravinsky), she found she'd become pregnant. She could not then take to the stage to perform the star role as the sacrificial maiden. Frustrated, Vaslav then screamed at her, \"There is no one to replace you. You are the only one who can perform this dance, only you, Bronia, and no one else!\"Nancy Van Norman Baer in her book on Nijinska writes, \"Between 1911 and 1913, while [her brother] Nijinsky's fame continued to soar, Nijinska emerged as a strong and talented dancer.\" Author and critic Robert Greskovic describes a common understanding of her gifts, \"Nowhere near the beauty and exemplar of her art that Pavlova and Spessivtseva were, Bronislava Nijinska (1891\u20131972) instead began to make her mark as a choreographer.\"Nonetheless Nijinska must have truly excelled as a dancer. When only a young student, her prowess on the dance floor had been recognized by top professionals. \"If Marius Petipa patted her approvingly on the head and Enrico Cecchetti placed her, at age eight, front and center in his class between two prima ballerinas, she must have been good.\" Yet before the Great War of 1914 her brother's legendary dance skills had overshadowed her own. Years later, however, the editor of The Dancing Times wrote of her at a 1921 Ballets Russes performance of The Sleeping Princess:\n\nNijinska ... appeals to me as the most versatile dancer of the entire company. Her technique in her classical numbers is beyond reproach ... and her mime and personality in the demi-charact\u00e8re dances are most convincing.\nAn early signature of hers was a tough \"virility\". \"Her own roles were packed with jumps and beats.\" Much later, in her prime, Nijinska crafted to combine her strength with an emotional touch \"unexpectedly poignant\". She liked the flow of movement on the stage.\n\n\n== As a choreographer ==\n\"In her lifetime Nijinska choreographed over seventy ballets, as well as dance sequences for numerous films, operas, and other stage productions.\" An annotated, chronological catalogue of her choreographies is presented by Nancy Van Norman Baer in her book on Nijinska. Her early experiences in choreographic arts involved the assistance given her brother Vaslav Nijinsky in his choreographic works for Ballets Russes. She had then tried out the initial stages of various steps created by him.\n\n\n=== In 'the Russias' during war and revolution ===\nAt the start of World War I, Nijinska and her husband and daughter, and her mother, were caught on the eastern side of the Eastern Front. Her brother Vaslav was on its western side, eventually in Austria. Here 'the Russias' include the Ukraine and its capital Kiev.The Russian art world in the early twentieth century was often innovative and experimental. \"Russian art before the October Revolution had held aloof from revolutionary Marxism.\" Thus the composer Igor Stravinsky distinguished clearly between the pre-war conservative fetters on art and the subsequent straitjacket eventually imposed by the Communist Party. For a few years following the war-born 1917 revolution, Russia was in chaos, and many artists managed to operate somewhat independently of Soviet politicians and their totalitarian ideals.\n\n\n==== Petrograd, her first choreographies 1914\u20131915 ====\nAt the start of World War I, Nijinska, her husband Aleksandr Kochtovsky ('Sasha', married in 1912), and their infant daughter Nina returned to Petrograd (then the Russian capital's new name). Nijinska had long considered the city her home; it was her last time living there. She found work teaching ballet to Cecchetti's students. Newspaper accounts report that Bronislava and Aleksandr met their former colleagues from Ballets Russes, and danced alongside them. Included were Michel Fokine and Tamara Karsavina, and as well the Bolshoi's Mikhail Mordkin.Both became leading dancers at the Petrograd Private Opera Theatre. In 1915 Nijinska produced her first choreographies: Le Poup\u00e9e [The Doll] (or La Tabati\u00e8re), and Autumn Song. These creations were for her solo performances at the Narodny Dom Theatre.She was twenty-five. The 1915 program described her as \"the celebrated prima ballerina-artist of the State Ballet\". The music for her dance creation Autumn Song was by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and for The Doll by Anatoly Liadov. On that program, performed at the Narodny Dom [People's House], were also ballets choreographed by Michel Fokine of Ballets Russes, to be danced by Nijinska and her husband. Her choreography for Autumn Song, \"the more important\" of her two solos, \"owed a debt to Fokine\".\n\n\n==== Kiev 1915\u20131921, her 'Ecole de Mouvement' ====\nIn August 1915, the family moved to Kiev. Nijinska's husband 'Sasha' Kochtovsky became ballet master at the State Opera Theater. There they both worked on ballet scenes for the operas, and on staging dance divertissements and ballets. In 1917 Nijinska began teaching at several institutions: the State Conservatory of Music, the Central State Ballet Studio, the Yiddish Cultural Center Drama Studio, and the Ukrainian Drama School. In 1919, after their son Leon was born, after her School of Movement was opened, her husband Sasha left the family and traveled alone to Odessa.\n\n\n===== Treatise on choreography =====\nNijinska's \"theoretical speculations\" about modern ballet apparently began to crystallize. During a short stay in Moscow after the 1917 October Revolution, Nijinska started her treatise: The School of Movement (Theory of Choreography). It was published in 1920 but has become lost to posterity, like much of the dance materials she created in Kiev. The only remnant of it apparently is a 100-page 'manuscript' found \"scrawled\" in one of her exercise books.In a short essay published in 1930, however, she apparently recapitulated her key ideas: \"On movement and the school of movement\". Nijinska writes:\nJust as 1. Sound is the material of music; and 2. Colour is the material of painting; so 3. Movement constitutes the material of dance. ... The action of movement should be continuous, otherwise its life is interrupted. ... In choreography, transition should be movement. ... [T]he position of the body [a] result created by movement. ... [C]horeographic movement must have its own organic being (different in each composition), its own breathe and rhythm. ...\n[The artist] sings the movement of his dance [so that] the spectator ... hears with his eyes the melody of [its] movement ... The artist [of dance] must perfectly see and know movement in its entire nature, must work the movement as the material of his art. ... [C]lassical dance teaches only separate pas--movements. The secret of thinking and acting between positions [is] Movement  ...\nN. V. N. Baer observes an imbedded neoclassical implication within Nijinska's then radical theory of dance, 'the school of movement', i.e., not the overthrow of balletic tradition leading to modern dance, but the incorporation nonetheless of entirely new modes of movement. \"It is in this essay that she documents her search for a new means of expression based on the extension of the classical vocabulary of dance steps.\"\n\n\n===== Collaboration with designer Exter =====\n\nIn 1917 Nijinska met the visual artist Alexandra Exter (1882-1949) in Moskva. Exter's cutting-edge designs employed constructivist ideas. The two traded their views on modern art and the theater. So began a long and fruitful collaboration on various dance projects, with Exter designing sets and costumes. The working relationship that formed endured into the 1920s, after each had independently left Russia, to move to Paris.Before the war Exter had lived in Western Europe, where she joined \"cubist and futurist circles\" that were generating popular innovations. Returning to Russia at war's start, Exter first settled in Moscow. With Alexander Tairov at his Kamerny [Chamber] Theater, she had \"aspired to create a dynamic fusion of drama, movement, and design known as 'synthetic theater'.\" In 1918, having relocated to Kiev, Exter opened an art studio, which doubled as a salon for many of Kiev's rising artists.Art discussions were also held evenings at Nijinska's dance school, where Exter joined in. Their ideas were compatible and mutually reinforcing. Curator/author Nancy Van Norman Baer writes that they became \"close artistic associates\" and \"fast friends\".In addition to Exter, Les Kurbas (1887-1937) worked with Nijinska. As a Ukrainian theater producer and film director, Kurbas was a leading arts figure in Kyiv and a promoter of local performance. They entered into a \"complementary and deep\" collaboration, sharing studio space, movement classes, dancer-actors, and theatrical discussions.\n\n\n===== Her ballet school and its productions =====\nIn February 1919 in Kiev, she opened her dance school called L'Ecole de Mouvement [School of Movement]. This was shortly after giving birth to her son L\u00e9on. Her school's philosophy was to focus on preparing dancers to work with innovative choreographers. Among ideas she taught her students: flowing movement, free use of the torso, and a quickness in linking steps. She wanted her students ready for cutting-edge ballets, like those she had assisted her brother in designing, e.g., Le Sacre and Faune. As she stated in her Kiev-era treatise/essay \"On Movement and the school of movement\":\n\n\"Today's ballet schools do not give the dancer the necessary training to work with choreographic innovators. Even the Ballet Russes ... did not create a school to parallel its innovations in the theater.\" [86/87] Yet historically, regarding Vigano, Noverre, Vestris, Didelot, Taglioni, Coralli, Petipa: \"the danse d'ecole absorbed all the achievements of these choreographers. ... [They] did not destroy the school with their innovations, but only enriched it.\" [87]\nUnder the aegis of this school she staged concerts with her own choreographed solo dances. Included were \"her first plotless ballet compositions\": Mephisto Valse (1919), and Twelfth Rhapsody (1920) music by Liszt, and Nocturne (1919) and Marche Fun\u00e8bre (1920), music by Chopin. These solo dances may be \"the first abstract ballets\" of the 20th century.In many of her productions her students danced for the public, among whom Serge Lifar was the most outstanding. Accordingly, she began to receive broad recognition as a choreographer. Then, invited by the Ministry of Arts, Nijinska mounted a full theatrical production of the Tchaikovsky ballet Swan Lake. She adapted the classic Petipa and Ivanov choreography of 1895. Her success involved trimming the ballet's difficulty to fit the level of her weaker students. The performance was held at Kiev's State Opera Theater.\n\n\n===== Reasons for leaving Kiev =====\n\nIt had been reported in the literature that Nijinska and family left Kiev in 1921 in order to visit her brother Vaslav Nijinsky in Vienna, after learning of his deteriorating health. Yet she learned about her brother in 1920, when the Russian civil war prevented travel.Based on recent research, however, Prof. Garafola describes a different and suppressed reason. The Cheka, as the notorious Soviet security police was then called, in early 1921 stepped up its harassment of her and her students. Her artistic independence was confronted and by April L'Ecole de Mouvement had been closed.\nThe school \"had given her a new life and an identity of her own as a modern artist. It was her child, the home of her imagination, a community of friends and devoted followers, the catalyst and expression of her creativity. In the weeks that followed [its closing] she quietly made plans to leave.\nShe traveled west out of Kiev under false pretenses, assisted by other dancers. She'd taken her two children, Irina aged seven and Leon aged two, and her mother of sixty-four years. After she bribed the Soviet border guards, they waded across the Bug River into Poland, arriving in early May, 1921.Several weeks later in Vienna the four travelers visited her brother Vaslav, his wife Romola and their children Kyra and Tamara. His health, however, had deteriorated since 1914, their last meeting. Once widely-celebrated as the \"god of dance\" he had not performed since 1917. Despite such sadness, the family was reunited. Broni found income by working at a cabaret in Vienna. At this point Diaghilev sent her an invitation; he included train fare. Her two children she entrusted to her mother's care. Nijinska then departed for Paris to rejoin Ballets Russes.\n\n\n=== Diaghilev's 'Ballets Russes' in Paris and Monte Carlo 1921\u20131925 ===\nThe company staged ballets for twenty years, starting with its 1909 opening of La Saison Russe in Paris, and ending in 1929 when its founder Sergei Diaghilev died. He had directed the company's operations: both the business and the theatrical (music, choreography, dance, decor and costumes). He chiefly worked with five choreographers, more or less in sequence: Fokine (1909-1912, 1914), Nijinsky (1912-1913, 1917), Massine (1915\u20131920, 1925-1928), Nijinska (1921-1925, 1926), Balanchine (1925-1929). Diaghilev's \"successive phases\" are described as: \"reform (Fokine), modernism (Nijinsky and Massine), and ... constructivism and neoclassicism (Nijinska and Balanchine).\" The early twenties were Nijinska's time at the helm.Originally started in Russia by an arts impresario to function as an \"exporter of Imperial culture\" (initially the ballet productions in Paris), it happened that the company never performed in Russia. By 1918 less than half its dancers were Russian, 18 out of 39. 12 were Polish. The rest were four Italians, two Spaniards, two English women, and a Belgian. The company's ambivalent and attenuated connection to Russia had not survived the 1914\u20131918 war, the 1917 revolutions, and the civil war. In 1922 for financial reasons it relocated its base of operations from Paris to Monte Carlo.\n\n\n==== Her initial coreographic work, and derivations ====\n\nIn 1921 Diaghilev asked Nijinska to return to Ballet Russes, chiefly for her choreography. He had become aware of her recent work in Kiev, especially that she had staged the Petipa-Ivanov classic Swan Lake, to music by Tchaikovsky. He had re-engaged her \"because\" of this demonstration of her abilities. As well as ballet mistress and a principal dancer, she was in line to be the Company's first and only female choreographer. Yet Diaghilev as ever was also cautious. Partly to test the quality of her work, and partly because of his company's financial condition, he first gave Nijinska major tasks in his on-going ballet productions.\n\n\n===== The Sleeping Princess, originally La Belle au bois dormant (1921) =====\n\nAs theatrical events unfolded in late 1921, Ballets Russes was confronted with a severe financial crisis. The immediate cause was its lavish London production of the celebrated classic The Sleeping Beauty originally staged in 1890 in Saint Petersburg. Its 1921 version had been renamed The Sleeping Princess apparently because, as Diaghilev wryly observed, following the war the role of titled princess had become a rarity.The ballet was \"one of the great Petipa classics from the old Imperial Russian repertory\". La Belle au bois dormant [The beauty in woods asleep] was taken from a French fairy tale of that name by Charles Perrault. Music was specially composed for it by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Diaghilev extravagantly revived the entire production of Petipa's three-act ballet. Leon Bakst designed the sets which \"were of surpassing grandeur and magnificence and no expense was spared ...\"Although the main choreographic credit remained with Petipa, the \"Additional choreography by Bronislava Nijinska\" was recognized. Her most memorable contribution: to the grand divertissement in Act III she added the rousing hopak for the 'Three Ivans' (Les trois Ivans); it \"became one of the most popular numbers\". Nijinska designed a half-dozen other, well-crafted choreographic pieces (e.g., \"The Marquises\", \"Blue Beard\", \"Sch\u00e9h\u00e9razade\", \"Variations of Prince Charming\"). She made other alterations to the ballet, and led its rehearsals. As a principal dancer, she took roles as the Hummingbird Fairy, the Lilac Fairy, and Pierrette.  She choreographed a new version of the so-called \"finger\" variation for herself as the Hummingbird Fairy.\nIn 1921 in London the key for Diaghilev at Ballets Russes was her mastery of dance, staging and design. The Sleeping Princess production \"became a proving ground of Nijinska's choreographic talent. She acquitted herself admirably.\"Diaghilev's earlier had, post-war, committed the company to revive the 1890 Russian classic. It was a bold decision which incurred a large financial risk. He aimed for excellence, a show of the tradition's high production values whatever the expense. After viewing The Sleeping Princess many theater critics were skeptical, disappointed by the apparent retreat from an experimental approach previously associated with Ballets Russes. Diaghilev's traditional classic, however, did prove very popular with London's growing audience for ballet, for whom it became an artistic learning experience that boded well for future London dance performances. Yet in late 1921 the London aficionados still small numbers meant that they could not purchase enough tickets to cover its great expense. After a run of several months, attendance began to fall. By early 1922 the truly brilliant production had become a colossal, money-losing disaster.Nijinska arrived in mid-1921 at the Ballets Russes company. She had come from the harsh realities and creative ferment of 'Russia in revolution'. Her own artistic tastes then clearly favored the experimental Ballets Russes of pre-war days, when Diaghilev was \"searching for the creation of a new ballet ...\" Yet in 1921 The Sleeping Princess was the focus at Ballets Russes, and her first assignment. She wrote later that Diaghilev's extravagant revival then \"seemed to me an absurdity, a dropping into the past\". No doubt Nijinska felt the stress resulting from the cultural-artistic dissonance: \"I started my first work full of protest against myself.\"Over the course of her career, however, Nijinska neither remained a radical champion of rebel experiments, nor did she ever accept as timeless perfection the inherited balletic tradition. While strongly favoring new ideas about the art of movement, eventually she chose to take a middle path: traditional art reconciled with radical innovation, and vice versa.\n\n\n===== Aurora's Wedding, or Le Marriage de la Belle au bois dormant (1922) =====\nAfter a run of several months, mounting financial pressures had forced the closure of the lavish London production of The Sleeping Princess. In an attempt to recoup his investment Diaghilev then asked Stravinsky and Nijinsky to collaborate in creating from its three acts a shorter version. Together they reworked the dance and music to salvage \"a one-act ballet, which he called Aurora's Wedding.\" It proved very popular and became an enduring commercial success, remaining in the repertory of Ballet Russes companies for decades.Aurora's Wedding premiered in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National de l'Op\u00e9ra in May 1922. Since the costumes and decor for the London production had been impounded by creditors, those used were by Benoit from a 1909 production of another ballet, as well as new by Gontcharova. The principal dancers were Vera Trefilova as Princess Aurora and Pierre Vladimirov as Prince Charming. With Petipa Nijinska shared the choreographic credit.\n\n\n====== La F\u00eate Merveilleuse [The Marvelous Festival] (1923) ======\nItself largely excerpted from her Aurora's Wedding, the \"gala benefit pageant\" La F\u00eate was performed by Ballets Russes in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. The gala played to the post-war French taste for theatrical revivals from the 18th-century Ancient r\u00e9gime. The well-heeled audience of aristocrats and art patrons came from all over Europe and from America. Staged by Nijinska, Tchaikovsky's music was reorchestrated by Stravinsky, and the costumes were by Juan Gris.\n\n\n====== Les Contes de F\u00e9es [Stories of the fairies] (1925) ======\nLes Contes de F\u00e9es was another spin-off from The Sleeping Princess, drawn from fairy tales in Aurora's Wedding (originally in Act III of La Belle au bois dormant). It premiered at Monte Carlo in February 1925. That winter Diaghilev produced Le Contes de F\u00e9es and other ballets in \"full dress\" even though scenery was not used.\n\n\n==== Her own ballet creations ====\nNijinska earned her credits as the sole choreographer for nine works at Ballets Russes during the 1920s. All but one were set to modern musical compositions: three by Igor Stravinsky (two ballets, Renard, Noces,  and an opera, Mavra); three by contemporary French composers, Francis Poulenc (Biches), Georges Auric (F\u00e2cheux), and Darius Milhaus (Train Bleu); one by a contemporary English composer, Constant Lambert (from the Shakespeare play); and, one by Modest Mussorgsky (Nuit, an opera). One work employed baroque music (Tentations).\n\n\n===== Le Renard [The Fox] [Baika] (1922) =====\n\nNijinska's first ballet in her tentative new position as choreographer for Ballets Russes was Le Renard, described as a \"burlesque ballet with song\". Igor Stravinsky composed the music, which was for small orchestra and four singers. Stravinsky also wrote the libretto, i.e., the lyrics. Originally commissioned by a friend of Diaghilev in 1915, it was not publicly performed until 1922.The principal dancers were: Nijinska (as the Fox), Stanislas Idzikowski (as the Cock), Jean Jazvinsky and Micel Federov (as the Cat, and the Goat). Costumes and sets by Michel Larionov were in a type of radical, modernist style with a \"primitive quality\".The plot comes from \"Russian preliterary theater\" sourced in \"a tradition of itinerant folk entertainers\" impersonating buffoons and animals. Across Europe, late medieval tales of Reynard the Fox were popular. Here, the Fox (a con-artist) works to trick the Cock (a wealthy peasant) in order to literally eat him, but the Cock is saved by the Cat and Goat. \"Disguised first as a nun, then as a beggar, the fox embodies criticism of both social and clerical orders.\" Baika was the original Russian title of Le Renard.Nijinska's choreography tended modern. She \"juxtaposed movements of animal grace with odd gestures and grotesque postures.\" The ballet was narrated by singers off stage. Larionov's visual design included simple animal masks for the dancers; the name of each character, e.g., \"Goat\", was written in large letters on the dance costume.In her memoirs, Nijinska discusses Fokine's innovative \"Dance of the Fauns\" (1905). There in the background the many \"fauns looked like animals\". The young boys who danced them once \"tumbled head over heels\" which was not in keeping with 'classical ballet' techniques. Yet Fokine claimed the result conformed to the \"animal characteristics of the dance.\" Nijinska then comments:\n\nI, who always spoke against the use of acrobatics in the ballet, made use of somersaults in my very first ballet, Stravinsky's Le Renard (1922). But there was no contradiction. I did not use those steps as a trick but to achieve an artistic aim.\nAlthough Le Renard was ill-received and seldom performed, Stravinsky's harsh music and the childlike costumes were suspected. Yet the ballet had \"impeccable avant-garde credentials.\" \"Diaghilev was pleased with Nijinska's work and engaged her as the permanent choreographer for his company.\" Stravinsky, too, was pleased. He wrote in his 1936 Chronicles of my life:\n\nI still deeply regret that the production [Le Renard] which gave me the greatest satisfaction ... has never been revived. Nijinska had admirably seized the spirit of mountebank buffoonery. She displayed such a wealth of ingenuity, so many fine points, so much satirical verve, that the effect was irresistible.\nThe premiere of this burlesque ballet also inspired an interesting social event. It was \"a first night supper party for Le Renard\", planned by Sydney Schiff as a kind of \"modernist summit\". Invited were \"Proust and Joyce in literature, Stravinsky in music, Picasso in painting.\" Garafola comments that only in these years of Diaghilev \"would ballet stand so close to the avant-garde.\"\n\n\n===== Mavra (1922) =====\nAn \"op\u00e9ra bouffe\" with music by Stravinsky, it was first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National de l'Op\u00e9ra in Paris, June 1922. The lyric book by Boris Kochno followed a poem by Pushkin, 'A small house in Kolomna'. \"The one-act opera did not require any dances, but Diaghilev asked Nijinska to stage the movement of the four singers.\"\n\n\n===== Les Noces [The Wedding] [Svadebka] (1923) =====\nNijinska created the ballet Les Noces ['The Wedding' [original title Les Noces Villageoise,  in Russian Svadebka]) from the music and libretto by Igor Stravinsky, music commissioned ten years earlier by Diaghilev. In four tableaux, the 24-minute ballet depicts in abstract fashion events surrounding a peasant marriage: the blessing of the Bride, the blessing of the Groom, the Bride's departure from her parental home, and the wedding celebration. Dancers first learning the steps often meet some difficulty with the intense group movements of the choreography. \"When you are truly moving together your individuality is really evident.\" The light-hearted sense of folk dance was abandoned. A realism of revolution has seasoned Nijinska's sober observations of tradition and society, yet there slumbers a vision. The collective mood of predestination is countered by hints at a peasant's wit of survival. After first seeing it, H. G. Wells wrote:\n\nThe ballet Les Noces is \"a rendering in sound and vision of the peasant soul, in its gravity, in its deliberate and simple-minded intricacy, in its subtly varied rhythms, in its deep undercurrents of excitement ...\"\nStravinsky's idea for the score evolved during war, revolution, and exile. His libretto conveys ancient and set patterns, yet his music uses staccato rhythms and a vocal overlay of upheaval. Left little expressed is the wedding as a reassuring joy. The tone of the work is darker, more anxious, conjuring a \"deeply moving evocation\" of the ceremony. Nijinska translated it to dance, enbodying in the ballet a tragic sense, the fate of both tradition and revolution. Although his lyrics were taken from a collection of Russian folk songs (the Sobranniye Piesni of Kireievsky), the text is arranged in an unorthodox manner. \nThe composer told Robert Craft the conductor that the text for Les Noces \"might be compared to one of those scenes in Ulysses in which the reader seems to be overhearing scraps of conversation without the connecting thread of discourse.\" The voices of the singers are disconnected from the characters they represent; and Stravinsky claims to have selected phrases for their \"typicality\" or commonality. \"Stravinsky's composition, while fluid and layered, at times becomes overtly jarring. In form it is a cantata, the \"music accompanying his choral and solo singers came from an orchestra of percussion, dominated by four pianos.\"Dance writer Robert Johnson claimedthat Stravinsky's text for Les Noces manifests his interest in psychology and a collective unconscious of the type posited by Carl Jung. Accordingly, the contrast between a musical \"cell\" and its elaboration in the score for Les Noces represents a dialog between profane time (chronos) and sacred time (kairos), as defined by Mircea Eliade. Nevertheless, Stravinsky described his conception of the ballet's mise-en-sc\u00e8ne as a \"masquerade\" or \"divertissement.,\" whose effect would be comic. Nijinska rejected this concept, and it is her somber vision of the ballet that ultimately prevailed.The minimalist visual designs, both the costumes and the sets, were by Natalia Goncharova, the color scheme being \"earthen gold, blue-grey, and black.\"Yet \"the fanciful, colorful costumes she first proposed struck Nijinska as wrong\". Then Goncharova modified her designs to resemble the style of clothes worn by dancers to rehearsals. Balanchine's practical dance clothes for performances \"can trace precedents back to Noces.\" In the end, Goncharova's sparse sets and costume design are now \"inseparable from the ballet's musical and movement elements.\" When Nijinska worked on Les Noces:\n\nI was still breathing the air of Russia, a Russia throbbing with excitement and intense feeling. All the vivid images of the harsh realities of the Revolution were still part of me and filled my whole being.\nNijinska researched ethnological studies of peasant customs in Russia. Yet in boldly translating to the ballet stage, she seems mostly to follow Stravinsky's modern score. She directed the women to dance en pointe, in order to elongate their silhouettes and resemble Russian icons. The beating sounds of the pointes jabbing the board demonstrates strength (not the ethereal effect previously associated with en pointe). Nijinska's groupings of women move largely in unison. The corps often faces square to the audience, a departure from the \"epaulement\" found in classical works, which softens the look by angling the shoulders. Toward the end of scene one, the women handle extremely long braids of the bride's hair, greatly exaggerated in thickness, as if the women were \"sailors taking up the mooring lines of a boat.\" The whole piece, tethered to an ancient folk tradition, has an overwhelming sense of a controlled conformity.Her choreography reflected Nijinska's interest in modernist abstraction. Corporeal forms like the \"cart\" that takes the Bride from her parental home, and the \"cathedral\" grouping at the ballet's end, have been abstracted, as also such gestures as the braiding of hair, and the sobbing. The appearance of pyramidal and triangular structures that represent \"spiritual striving\" furthers this interest in abstraction. It may show the influence of painter Wassily Kandinsky. He had presented the so-called \"Program for the Institute of Artistic Culture,\" his proposed master plan for the arts, including dance, in Moscow in June of 1920.An iconic pose from Les Noces has the heads of the women dancers, i.e., the bridesmaids, as if stacked up. Author Jennifer Homans, in defining the ballet's tragedy, comments:\n\nIn one of the ballet's most poignant and telling images, the women dutifully pile their faces like bricks on top of one another, forming an abstract, pyramid structure ... The bride sets her face on the top and rests her head despondently in her hands. We see both the individuals (those faces) and their submission to authority and the group ...\nDance critic Janice Berman writes that Nijinska viewed the wedding celebration from her perspective as a woman: \"Nijinska was obviously a feminist; the solemnity of the nuptials derives not only from the sanctity of married love, but from its downside---a loss of freedom, particularly for the bride. She loses not only her long, long braids, but also her privacy, her right to dream. The bride's last reverie, after all, comes before the ceremony; she leans her head on her hands, atop a table formed by eight of her friends. After the nuptials,another dreamer takes the bride's place.\"  Also, the critic Johnson points out that Les Noces is filled with images of dreamers.\"Les Noces was Nijinska's answer to Sacre,\" a creative continuation of her brother's work, here \"a reenactment of a Russian peasant wedding.\" The ballet movement of the ceremony reflected \"not a joyous occasion but a foreboding social ritual.\" Dance critic Andr\u00e9 Levinson in his harsh 1923 review called her choreography \"Marxist\" in which the individual was swallowed up by the masses. Nijinska, however, escaped from her brother's nihilism by following Stravinsky's lead \"through the formal beauty and discipline of the Orthodox liturgy.\" Nonetheless the ballet remained \"a modern tragedy, a complicated and very Russian drama that celebrated authority\" yet showed its \"brutal effect on the lives of individuals.\"Dance academic and critic Lynn Garafola, in discussing the ballet scene in the early 1920s, identifies a major competitor to Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. She characterizes Ballets su\u00e9dois (Swedish ballet) led by Rolf de Mar\u00e9 as a company that had \"largely succeeded in edging Diaghilev to the sidelines of avant-garde Paris.\" Yet Garafola mentions her admiration for the 1922 ballet Le Renard (see above) created by Nijinska for Ballets Russes. She continues:\n\n[I]t was only in 1923 that Diaghilev staged a modernist masterpiece that transcended the best of his rival's offerings. Les Noces, probably the greatest dance work of the decade, teamed three of his closest Russian collaborators: Stravinsky, his 'first son', as composer; Natalia Goncharova, as designer; and Bronislava Nijinska, as choreographer.\n\"Bronislava Nijinska's Les noces [grew] out of boldness of conception without regard for precedent or consequences,\" wrote John Martin, dance critic for The New York Times. Nijinska herself wrote about Noces: \"I was informed as a choreographer [by my brother's ballets] Jeux and Le Sacre du Printemps. The unconscious art of those ballets inspired my initial work.\"\n\n\n===== Les Tentations de la Berg\u00e8re [Temptations of the shepherdess] (1924) =====\nThis one-act ballet featured baroque music composed by Michel de Mont\u00e9clair (1667\u20131737), which was recently orchestrated by Henri Casadesus. The sets, costumes, and curtain were by Juan Gris. An alternative title is L'Amour Vainqueur [Love Victorious]. It opened in Monte Carlo.\nIn the mid-1920s \"a significant part of the Ballet Russes repertory turned away from modernism and themes of contemporary life.\" This included Les Tentations de la Berg\u00e8re and the ballet Les F\u00e2cheux, also choreographed by Nijinska. These were \"two works produced by the Ballets Russes during the 1920s that focused on themes related to eighteenth-century France. These productions were rooted in France's post-World War I fascination with bygone monarchies and court life.\"\n\n\n===== Les Biches [The Does (or 'the girls')] (1924), also called The House Party =====\n\nA one-act ballet Les Biches ['Les Demoiselles' was once a proposed alternate title] depicts a contemporary house party for singles, with music to 'entertain' by Francis Poulenc. 'Fashionable' scenery and costumes were by cubist painter Marie Laurencin, also French. Poulenc's commissioned music for ballet, which originally included sung lyrics, was a \"wonderful chameleon of a score\", that was \"mischievous, mysterious, now sentimental, now jazzy, now Mozartian ...\"Dance writer Robert Johnson comments that beneath this ballet's sun-washed, Riviera setting lie \"shadowy scenes painted by Watteau: the Parc des Biches where Louis XIV trysted, and the forest where voluptuous courtiers rediscovered Cythera, the isle of love... . From the opening notes of Poulenc's overture, significantly scored for flutes and woodwinds, we find ourselves in this bois of ancient gallantry.\" Poulence described the section titled \"Jeux\" as, \"a kind of hunting game, very Louis Quatorze.\"Its January 1924 opening at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Monte Carlo featured \"La Nijinska herself\" in the cast and, among others, a minor role for Ninette de Valois (she later became director at Sadler's Wells). The French title Les Biches signifies \"the girls\" or female deer (the plural of doe), which was \"1920s terminology for young women; [it] celebrates ballet women as chic young ladies.\" Several English-speaking ballet companies changed the title, e.g., The House Party or The Gazelles.\"Although Diaghilev to Poulenc praised Nijinska to the heavens ... [he] feared she might be unresponsive to the Latin charm of the Poulenc score.\" Her first three choreographies for Ballet Russe had been composed by Stravinsky (Renard, Mavra, Noces). Yet \"Poulenc and Nijinska had taken to each other enormously ...\" During rehearsals, Poulenc remarked that \"Nijinska is really a genius\" and her choreography's \"pas de deux is so beautiful that all the dancers insist on watching it. I am enchanted.\" Diaghilev concluded:\n\nPoulenc is enthusiastic about Bronya's (Nijinska's) choreography, and they get along excellently together. The choreography has delighted and astonished me. But then, this good woman, intemperate and antisocial as she is, does belong to the Nijinsky family.\nThe ballet's plot is unspecified. According to Poulenc, an atmosphere of \"wantoness\" prevails. Apropos of the ballet's ambiguity, Richard Buckle asks, \"Have the three athletes who enter this whispering world of women just dropped in from the beach, or are they customers?...It is so delightful not to know.\" Les Biches was intended to be a modern \"f\u00eate galante,\" and in some ways a commentary on Michel Fokine's ballet Les Sylphides.Nijinska took the role of the hostess of the house party. The hostess is \"a lady no longer young, but very wealthy and elegant.\" Her guests are younger: twelve women in pink and three men dressed as athletes wearing ribbon-like sashes. Additional featured characters include La Gar\u00e7onne, aka La dame en bleu, an androgynous figure sometimes described as a \"page-boy\"; and two women in gray dresses who appear to be a couple. The ballet has eight parts, each with a different dance music. The young guests flirt, appear to take no notice, or play dance games in a setting filled with social satire and ambiguous sexuality. The hostess, dressed in yellow, brandishes a cigarette holder as if posing for an advertisement. Balanchine comments that she seems driven to remain in motion, her hands, her desperate dance: she is unable to image herself alone and still. Nijinska \"was 'powerful' and 'strange,' a dancer 'intoxicated with rhythm, ... racing against the most breathless 'prestos' of the orchestra.\" In this role of the yellow-clad hostess, Nijinska\n\nflew round the stage, performing amazing contortions of her body, beating her feet, sliding backwards and forwards, screwing her face into an abandoned attitude on the sofa. She danced as the mood took her and was brilliant.\n\nDance writer Richard Shead appraised Les Biches as \"a perfect synthesis of music, dance, and design ...\" He situated it in the aftermath of the radical experimentalism of her brother Vaslav Nijinsky, whose innovations had challenged the classical ballet canons:\n\nThe great strength of Nijinska's choreography was its inventiveness, together with the fact that it remained essentially classical. It is easier to see now than it can have been in the 1920s that the future of choreography lay in classicism but in a classicism which was capable of being extended, varied, distorted even, without departing in any fundamental sense from the mainstream vocabulary of classical dance. Nijinska achieved this in Les Biches; Balanchine was to do so latter ...\nFollowing World War I, Diaghilev found it advisable to produce a French-themed work neo-classical in style. Yet the Nijinska's dance vocabulary of Les Biches is not entirely academic; it blends virtuosic classroom steps, exposed lines and pointe work with body building poses, sporting images and references to popular dance forms. In this regard, Les Biches is \"the fountainhead of neoclassicism in dance.\" According to Irina Nijinska, the choreographer's daughter, the famous gesture of La Gar\u00e7onne upon entering, with one hand held flattened to the side of her face, and the gesture of the female corps de ballet, with one hand raised while resting on an elbow, are both military salutes that Nijinska has abstracted through a technique like Cubism.In Les Biches, writes Lynn Garafola, Nijinska's choreography \"cracked open the gender codes of classical style, transforming a piece of twenties chic into a critique of sexual mores.\" According to Robert Johnson, \"loves of various kinds are portrayed and accepted here seeingly without prejudice.\" Nijinska has turned the tables, making the ballet's three male athletes the object of a libidinous female gaze. \"Nijinska has seized the power to frame the discussion about sex.\"Marie Laurencin's decor, according to Garafola, had \"the same ambiguous blend of innocence and corruption\" as the ballet. It opens in a flood of pink light that is \"voluptuously feminine\". A host of taboos are explored: \"narcissism, voyeurism, female sexual power, castration, sapphism\". Garafola a few pages earlier mentions the career importance of her years in Kiev \"fired by the Revolution's brave new art\". On one level Les Biches appears to creatively conflate the sexual experimentation of post-war Paris and Kiev. Yet Nijinska herself apparently remained somewhat of a skeptic.Garafola comments that Diaghilev disapproved of the ballet's pessimism, its sour look at gender relations. Portrayed was a femininity \"only skin-deep, a subterfuge applied like make-up, a construction elaborated over time by men, not an innate female property.\" The customary \"male bravura dance\" is here exposed as pretentious. The ballet \"divorces the appearance of love from its reality.\" Les Biches, surmises Garafola, may be interpreted as disclosing Nijinska's \"unease with traditional representations of femininity.\"Balanchine, Nijinska's successor as choreographer at Ballets Russes, complimented her for Les Biches describing it as a \"popular ballet of the Diaghilev era\". It was revived several times, he continued, and met with \"critical and popular approval\". \"Monte Carlo and Paris audiences ... loved it.\" \"Les Biches was very much liked.\" \"[W]e all knew long before the curtin went down on the first night that Les Biches was a smash hit.\"\n\n\n===== Les F\u00e2cheux [The Mad, or The Bores] (1924) =====\n\nfr:Les F\u00e2cheux was originally a three-act ballet comedy, written by the French playwright, librettist, and actor, known by his stage name Moli\u00e8re (1622\u20131673). It opened in 1661, with baroque music by Pierre Beauchamp and Jean-Baptiste Lully. Without a plot, characters appear, do a monologue, then exit never to return. \"Moli\u00e8re's hero \u00c9raste [is] continually hindered by well-meaning bores while on his way to visit his lady love.\" Adopted for Ballets Russes, the music was by Georges Auric, with scenery designed by Georges Braque, libretto by Jean Cocteau after Moli\u00e8re, choreography by Nijinska.Nijinska danced the male role of Lysandre, wearing a wig and clothes of the seventeenth-century. Anton Dolin as L'El\u00e9gant danced on point to approximate the baroque era and his performance created a sensation. \"Her choreography incorporates mannerisms and poses from the period that she modernized by stylization.\" Braque's costumes were 'Louis XIV'. The original music, however, had been lost, so that Auric was free to evoke the past with a modern composition.Georges Auric was associated with fellow French composers Francis Poulenc, Darius Milhaud, and Arthur Honegger, part of a group called Les Six. French writer Jean Cocteau courted the group as representing a new approach to the arts, including poetry and painting. Ballets su\u00e9dois in the early 1920s commissioned members of Les Six to compose music for its dance productions. Ballets Russes followed suit. Some 1920s music critics dismissed Les Six compositions as musiquette. But current critic Lynn Garafola sees in ballet revivals like Les F\u00e2cheux that employ their music a \"gaiety and freshness\" in their \"unpretentious tunes and depiction of everyday life\". Garafola appreciates \"the independence of the music in relation to the choreography.\"Ballets Russes dancer Lydia Lopokova, however, about Nijinska's ballet Les F\u00e2cheux and similar works, commented that it was smooth and professional, but nothing or no one moved her. She longed for very old-fashioned ballets without abstract ideas, with simplicity and poetry. \"Massine and Nijinska choreography clever as it is have too much intellect,\" she felt.\n\n\n===== La Nuit sur le Mont chauve [Night on Bald Mountain] (1924) =====\n\nThe ballet premiered in April, 1924, in Monte Carlo, with principal dancers Lydia Sokolova and Michel Fedorov. Nijinska's choreography was set to the music of Modest Mussorgsky. Some designs for ballet then experimented \"with costumes that 'reconstructed' the body, transforming its natural shape.\" For Night on Bald Mountain, Nijinska's sketches \"show elongated, arc-like forms.\" The costumes designed by Alexandra Exter \"played with shape\" and \"played with gender\".Nijinska emphasized the ensemble rather than the individual dancer. Here it was \"her inventive use of the corps de ballet as the central figure\" rather than a soloist as was the norm. The total effect allowed the \"movement of the dancers to blend ... they became a sculpted entity capable of expressing the whole ballet action.\" Exter also \"depersonalized the dancers, clothing them in identical gray costumes.\" Yet it was \"the architectural poses of Nijinska's choreography that gave the costumes their distinctive shape\".For his 1867 'symphonic poem' La Nuit sur le Mont chauve Mussorgsky was inspired by the witches sabbath as told by Nikolai Gogol in his St. John's Eve story. The composer, however, repeatedly revised and eventually incorporated the music into Act III of his unfinished opera, Sorochintsy yarmarka [The Fair at Sorochintsy]. He labored on it for years prior to his death in 1881. Mussorgsky himself wrote the opera's libretto, based on a Gogol story of the same name. Its ballet scenes thus expressed the 'night on bald mountain'. The music was re-orchestrated by Rimsky-Korsakov.\n\n\n===== Le Train Bleu [The Blue Train] (1924) =====\n\nThe ballet Le train blue has been called a 'danced operetta'. Darius Milhaud composed the music, with the ballet libretto by Jean Cocteau, poet and filmmaker. The dancers' wardrobe were designed by 'Coco' Chanel; it included \"bathing costumes of the period\". The scenery was by sculptor Henri Laurens. The cast of players: a handsome kid (Anton Dolin), a bathing belle (Lydia Sokolova), a golfer (Leon Woizikowski), and a tennis player (Nijinska).The Cocteau libretto has a thin plot.  Its title refers to the actual Train Bleu, whose destination was C\u00f4te d'Azur, a fashionable resort area, specifically Monte Carlo. \"The Blue Train used to bring the beau monde down to the south from Paris ...\" Diaghilev remarked, \"The first point about Le train bleu is that there is no Blue Train in it.\" The scenario \"took place on a beach, where pleasure-seekers disported themselves.\" Inspired in part by youth \"showing off\" with \"acrobatic stunts\", the ballet \"was a smart piece about a fashionable plage\" [beach].\nNijinska created a special ambiance through the language of dance, she introduced angular and geometrical movements and organized dancers on stage as interactive groups, that alluded to images of sports activities, such as golf, tennis and recreational games on a beach.\n\nPopular passion for sport caused Cocteau to first conceive of a 'beach ballet'. The work also provided a prize role for the athletic Anton Dolin, whose \"acrobatics astonished and delighted the audience.\" When he left the company, however, no one as capable could be found for the role, causing the ballet to be dropped.Probably the ballet suffered when collaboration between Nijinska and librettist Cocteau collapsed. Garafola writes that contested issues included: (a) gender, Cocteau was said to entertain a \"dim view of women\" versus Nijinska's unease with traditional femininity; (b) Cocteau's story and gesture approach verses 'abstract ballet' (Cocteau favored substituting out dance for pantomime, but Nijinska was satisfied with a plotless ballet); and, (c) the changing aesthetics of dance (Cocteau's wholesale preference for acrobatics over dance, but which for Nijinska constituted a series of delicate judgments). Last minute changes were made. Nijinska's choreography managed to present for the audience a sophisticated view of the beach ballet. Garafola suggests that here \"Only Nijinska had the technical wherewithal ... to wrest irony from the language and traditions of [classical dance].\"Le train bleu anticipated the 1933 ballet Beach. \"Massine's choreography, like Nijinska's, was a stylization of sport motifs and different dance idioms within a structured balletic framework.\" The athletic dance scenes in both incorporated jazz movements. A half-century later, Nijinska's 1924 choreography was reconstructed and revived.\n\n\n=== 'Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Chor\u00e9graphiques Nijinska', England & Paris 1925 ===\n\n\n==== Leaving Diaghilev, start of her dance company ====\nJanuary 1925 marked Nijinska's departure from Ballet Russes. In part she left because of the grief she experienced when in the end Diaghilev had sided with Cocteau over Le Train Bleu. She wanted to lead her own company. Another reason was the 1924 arrival of the dynamic George Balanchine (1904-1983), with an experimental dance troupe from the Soviet Union. Diaghilev recognized his demonstrated talent and recruited him for Ballets Russes. Balanchine filled the choreographer position vacated by Nijinska.In 1925 Nijinska found sufficient financing to form her ballet company: Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Chor\u00e9graphiques Nijinska. It was a chamber ensemble that employed eleven dancers. The Russian avant-garde visual artist Alexandra Exter designed the costumes and sets. Nijinska had first met Exter in Kiev during war and revolution. It was a professional relationship that had continued as Nijinska choreographed for Ballets Russes. Nancy Van Doren Baer highly praised their collaboration, \"a most dramatic synthesis of the visual and the kinetic\".For her company, Nijinska choreographed six short ballets, and danced in five. She also staged four divertissements, dancing one solo.\nFor the 1925 summer season (August\u2013October), her ballet company toured fifteen English resort towns and provincial cities. It then performed selections in Paris, at an international exhibition and for a gala program. \"Judged by any standard, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Chor\u00e9graphiques offered dancing, choreography, music, and costume design of the highest order.\"\n\n\n==== Holy Etudes, an abstract ballet [Bach] ====\n\nHer first abstract ballet seen outside Russia, to J. S. Bach's First and Fifth Brandenberg Concertos, was also the first ballet mounted to his music. The dancers wore identical tunics and capes made of silk, with halo-like headgear. \"Exter's 'uni-sex' costumes were revolutionary in their day.\"  Yet, according to accounts, their simple and severe design \"added immeasurably to the broad flowing movement and stately rhythms of the choreography, suggesting androgynous beings moving in heavenly harmony.\"\nSilk \"enhanced the ethereal quality of the ballet. The brilliant pink and bright orange capes hung straight from bamboo rods placed across the dancers' shoulders ... .\" Baer further observes, \"By varying the levels, groupings, and facings of the dancers, Nijinska created a pictorial composition made up of moving and intersecting planes of color.\" As in Les Noces, Nijinska called for dancing en pointe \"to elongate and stylize the line of the body\".Her short, abstract Bach ballet was one of those creations \"she cared most about.\" She continued to rework its choreography, and presented it in varying forms and under different titles: for Teatro Col\u00f3n in 1926; for Ballets Nijinska in 1931, which continued to be staged throughout the 1930s; and in 1940 at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\n\n==== Five short modern pieces, four divertissements ====\ni. Touring (or The Sports and Touring Ballet Revue).Nijinska \"took contemporary forms of locomotion as her theme\", with music by Francis Poulenc, costumes and set by Exter. \"Cycling, flying, horse-riding, carriage driving ... were all reduced to dancing.\" It further illustrated ballet's reach to modern life, following her brother Vaslav Nijinsky's Jeux of 1913, and her Les Biches and Le Train Bleu of 1924.\nii. Jazz.The music was Igor Stravinsky's 1918 composition Ragtime. The composer writes it \"was indicative of the passion I felt at that time for jazz ... enchanting me by its truly popular appeal, its freshness, and the novel rhythm ...\" Exter's costumes followed an 1897 Russian performance of L'Africaine. In 1921 Exter had written about her fascination with \"interrelationship, co-intensity, rhythmization, and the transition to color construction ...\" Nininska's choreography, however, is lost. When children, she and her brother Vaslav had developed a friendship with two traveling African-American dance performers, house guests of their parents.\niii. On the Road. A Japanese pantomime.Based on a Kabuki story, with music by Leighton Lucas, and costumes by Exter. Nancy Van Norman Baer conjectures that it developed from a solo called Fear designed and danced by Nijinsky in Kiev in 1919, and inspired by the dynamic movements of a Samurai warrior. In discussion, Nijinska mentions a Japanese influence on her early choreographic works, one source being a collection of prints purchased in 1911.\n\niv. Le GuignolThe title role is a character in a French puppet show, which became also a name for all puppet shows. Music by Joseph Lanner. It was later performed in 1926 at the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires.\nv. Night on Bald Mountain.An abbreviated version of her 1924 work for Ballets Russes. \"As in Holy Etudes and Les Noces, Nijinska relied on the ensemble instead of using individual dancers to express the ballet-action.\"\nFour divertissements.The Musical Snuff Box was a restating of the solo La Poup\u00e9e first danced by Nijinska in Kiev. Trepak was her The Three Ivans that she had choreographed for Diaghilev's The Sleeping Princess in London. The Mazurka to Chopin was from Les Sylphides. Polovetsian Dances was an ensemble for the entire company.\n\n\n=== Ballet companies and exemplary ballets 1926\u20131930 ===\nNijinska continued to choreograph, dance, and direct, working for ballet companies and institutions in Europe, South America, and the United States.\n\n\n==== 'Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Op\u00e9ra' in Paris: Bien Aim\u00e9e [or Beloved] ====\nA one-act ballet staged in 1928, music by Schubert and Liszt, libretto and decor by Benois. Ida Rubinstein and Vilzak danced in this Nijinska choreography. Its thin plot features a poet at the piano who reminisces about his departed Muse, and his youth. The ballet was revived by the Markova-Dolan company in 1937. Ballet Theatre in New York City arranged for Nijinska to stage its American premier in 1941/1942.Also at the Paris Opera, in 1924 Nijinska choreographed the ballet La Rencontres [The Encounters], libretto by Kochno, music by Sauguet. Oedipus meets the Sphinx at the circus.\n\n\n==== Diaghilev's 'Ballets Russes' in Monte Carlo: Romeo and Juliet ====\nA new version of Romeo and Juliet with music by Constant Lambert premiered in 1926. The ballet impressed Massine, who saw it later in London. \"Nijinska's choreography was an admirable attempt to express the poignancy of Shakespeare's play in the most modern terms.\" At the end, the leading dancers Karsavina and Lifar, lovers in real life, \"eloped in an aeroplane\". Max Ernst did design work, Balanchine an entr'acte. \"It seemed to me that this ballet was far in advance of its time,\" Massine later wrote.\n\n\n==== 'Teatro Col\u00f3n' in Buenos Aires: Estudio Religioso, choreographies for opera ====\n\nIn 1926 Nijinska became choreographic director and principal dancer with Teatro Col\u00f3n (Columbus Theater). Her active association with the Buenos Aires company would endure until 1946. Over a decade before, in 1913 the Ballets Russes had toured Buenos Aires, Montevideo, and Rio de Janeiro, but Nijinska then with child did not go. Nijinsky her brother did. In 1926 she found in Argentina \"an inexperienced but enthusiastic group of dancers,\" thirty in number, in a ballet organization newly founded by Adolph Bolm.Nijinska staged Un Estudio Religioso to music by Bach in 1926, which she developed from her choreography Holy Etudes of 1925. At Teatro Col\u00f3n she was able to expand the work into a presentation by a full company. She drew on innovative ideas she'd first developed in Kiev during the war and the revolution. In both these Bach ballets, there was no libretto, no plot.\n\nThis abstract ballet, inspired by the spirituality of the music, was choreographed to an arrangement of the six Brandenburg Concertos and was the first ballet to be mounted to the music of J. S. Bach.\nIn 1926 and 1927 for the Buenos Aires theater, Nijinska created dance scenes for fifteen operas, including Bizet's Carmen,  Wagner's Tannh\u00e4user, Verdi's A\u00efda and La Traviata, Stravinsky's Le Rossignol, Rimsky-Korsakov's Tsar Saltan, Massenet's Tha\u00efs, and Gounod's Faust.  In 1927 for Teatro Col\u00f3n, Nijinska directed ballet choreography created by Fokine for Ballets Russes: Ravel's Daphnis et Chlo\u00eb, and Stravinsky's Petrouchka.\n\n\n==== 'Ida Rubinstein Ballet' in Paris: Bol\u00e9ro, La Valse, Le Baiser de la F\u00e9e ====\n\nThe dancer Ida Rubinstein formed a ballet company in 1928, with Bronislava Nijinska named as its choreographer. Rubinstein quickly arranged for Maurice Ravel to compose music for her new dance enterprise. By luck or genius, one of Ravel's pieces became popular immediately and famous. It has remained so to this day: his Bol\u00e9ro.For Rubinstein, Nijinska choreographed the original Bol\u00e9ro ballet. In it she created an ambient scene around a large circular platform, surrounded by various individual dancers, who by turns hold the gaze. At times to the side several begin to dance and draw notice. Yet the ballet-action always returns to the center. Dramatic movements inspired by Spanish dance are yet abbreviated, understated, stylized.Rubinstein herself had danced for Diaghilev in the early years of his company Ballets Russes. In the 1910 ballet Scheherazade (not to be confused with the music by Ravel) she and Vaslav Nijinsky (Nijinska's brother) both had leading roles. They danced together in a scene Nijinska called \"breathtaking\". Rubinstein and Nijinsky also had partnered in the ballet Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre a year before in Paris for Ballets Russes. Rubinstein played the title role. The ballet was \"the runaway success of the 1909 season that made her an overnight star\".Rubinstein, now resident in Paris, directed her company to perform another ballet choreographed by Nijinska, the music being Maurice Ravel's La valse. It opened in Monte Carlo in 1929.A version of the ballet Le Baiser de la F\u00e9e [Kiss of the Fairy] originated when Ida Rubinstein asked Igor Stravinsky to compose music to be choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska. It would be staged in 1928. \"The idea was that I should compose something inspired by the music of Tchaikovsky,\" wrote Stravinsky. For a theme he chose Hans Christian Andersen's 'eerie' tale of The Ice-Maiden, to which he put a positive spin: \"A fairy imprints her magic kiss on a child at birth ... Twenty years later ... she repeats the fatal kiss and carries him off to live in supreme happiness with her ...\" Stravinsky understood the story's fairy to be the Muse whose kiss branded Tchaikovsky with a 'magic imprint' inspiring his music. Nijinska created the choreography.The composer Stravinsky conducted the orchestra for the ballet's first performance at the Op\u00e9ra in Paris in 1928. Le Baiser de la F\u00e9e played at other European capitals, and in 1933 at the Colon Theatre in Buenos Aires. In 1935 Ashton choreographed a new version that played in London, and in 1937 Balanchine did so for a version that played in New York.\n\n\n==== 'Op\u00e9ra Russe \u00e0 Paris': Capriccio Espagnol [Rimsky-Korsakov] ====\nThis ballet company 'Op\u00e9ra Russe \u00e0 Paris' was founded in 1925 by a Russian singer and her husband, a nephew of French composer Massenet. A company director and major figure was Wassily de Basil (the former Vassily Voskresensky, a Russian entrepreneur, and perhaps once a Cossack officer). Since Sergei Diaghilev's death in 1929, followed by the collapse of his 'Ballets Russes', a discomforting void inhabited the world of European ballet.\n\nNijinska in 1930 joined 'Op\u00e8ra Russe \u00e0 Paris' run by de Basil. She was \"to choreograph the ballet sequences\" in several well-known operas. She was also \"to create works for the all-ballet evenings that alternated with evenings of opera.\" Consequently, she created the ballet for Capriccio Espagnol by Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. She also staged several of her previous ballet creations (Les Noces and Les Biches) and other Ballets Russes fare of the Diaghilev era.\nIn 1931 she turned down an \"unusually generous\" offer from de Basil in order to start the company, 'Ballets Nijinska'. She wanted to pursue projects independently, although she maintained her former working situation for a time longer. Latter in 1934 and 1935 she would again work with de Basil's company.\nRen\u00e9 Blum (brother of the French politician L\u00e9on Blum) was then \"organizing the ballet seasons at the Casino de Monte Carlo.\" In 1931 he began talks with de Basil about combining ballet operations, hence the naissant company 'Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo'. From de Basil would come \"dancers, repertory, scenery, and costumes\" and from Blum \"the theater and its facilities and financial support\". A contract was signed in January 1932. \"From the beginning de Basil acted as impresario.\" Soon, however, Blum and de Basil fell out and in 1936 split, each forming his own company. Later in the 1940s Nijinska staged works for a successor to Blum's half, then run by Sergei Denham.\n\n\n=== Her dance companies 1931\u20131932, 1932\u20131934 ===\nDuring the early thirties, Nijinska formed and directed several ballet companies of her own. In 1934, however, misfortune involving her innocent entanglement in another's civil law dispute caused the loss of essential trade property. This setback led her to accept offers from other dance companies. Her work in choreography continued, but with a variety of other companies and theaters, sometimes in a 'freelance' capacity.\n\n\n==== 'Ballets Nijinska' in Paris: Etude-Bach, choreographies for Op\u00e9ra-Comique ====\nIn 1931 while also staging dance productions for 'Opera Russe \u00e0 Paris' (see above), Nijinska operated independently under her own name: 'Ballets Nijinska'. Here she choreographed ballet pieces for operas performed at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique of Paris, or at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-Elys\u00e9es, where she operated under the auspices of the 'Opera Russe' yet autonomously as 'Ballets Nijinska'.In 1931 her company staged Etude-Bach with Boris Belinsky's decor and costumes, after Alexandra Exter. This was a new version of her 1925 Holy Etudes and her 1926 Un Estudio Religioso.\n\n\n==== 'Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Danse Nijinska' in Paris: Variations [Beethoven], Hamlet [Liszt] ====\n\nFrom 1932 to 1934 Nijinska directed her own Paris-based company, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Danse. A new ballet Variations was staged in 1932, inspired by the music by Ludwig van Beethoven (a selection of his compositions). The dancers followed a difficult theme: the flux in the fate of nations (classical Greece, Russia under Alexander I, France during the early Second Empire). The choreography was primarily ensemble dances and pantomime, with costume and decor by Georges Annenkov.In 1934 she choreographed Hamlet, based on Shakespeare's play, performed to music by Hungarian composer Franz Liszt. Nijinska played the title role. \"Her choreography, however, instead of retelling Shakespeare's plot, emphasized the feelings of the tragedy's tormented characters.\" Nijinska conceived \"three aspects for each of the protagonists\". In addition to \"the real character\" there were \"characters representing his soul and his fate\" played \"by separate groups of dancers\" like \"a Greek chorus\".  Eight years later another Hamlet ballet, created by Robert Helpmann to music by Tchaikovsky, was staged in London, also not following the original plot.There were also performances of two of her remarkable ballets from the mid-1920s, Les Biches (a.k.a. The House Party) in 1932 and in 1933 Les Noces [The Wedding]. Nijinska's Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Danse spent ballet seasons in Paris and Barcelona, and toured France and Italy.  The company's 1934 season at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet featured the ballets Etude-Bach, La Princesse Cygne, Les Biches, Bolero, Les Comediens Jaloux, and Le Baiser de la F\u00e9e.\nIn 1934 Nijinska joined her dance company to Wassily de Basil's company Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. For the 1934 Opera and Ballet seasons, she directed the Monte Carlo productions of the combined companies in performances of her repertoire. Later in 1934 her 'Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Danse' company lost its costumes and sets when, for the benefit of unpaid artists of the 'Opera Russe \u00e0 Paris', they were mistakenly seized in this legal dispute. Not until 1937 was Nijinska able to recover them.\n\n\n=== Ballet companies and exemplary ballets 1935\u20131938 ===\n\n\n==== de Basil's 'Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo': Les Cent Baisers ====\nNijinska choreographed Les Cent Baisers [The hundred kisses] in 1935 for de Basil's company. This one-act ballet was set to music by Anglo-French composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alfred d'Erlanger. It opened in London at Covent Garden.The libretto by Boris Kochno followed the literary fairy tale \"The swineherd and the princess\" created by Hans Christian Andersen. Here a disguised prince woos an arrogant princess. Nijinska's choreography is considered one of her more classical. Yet she incorporated subtle variations from the usual academic steps, according to Irina Baronova who danced the role of the princess. It gave the piece a special feeling of the East. The prince was played by David Lichine.\n\n\n==== Max Reinhardt's Hollywood film: A Midsummer Night's Dream ====\n\nIn 1934 Max Reinhardt requested Nijinska to travel to Los Angeles and choreograph the dance scenes for his 1935 film A Midsummer Night's Dream. It was a Hollywood recreation of the William Shakespeare comedy, with music by Felix Mendelssohn. Much of the music was taken from his two compositions about this Shakespeare play. The first was Mendelssohn's 1826 concert overture, the second his 1842 incidental music, which incorporated the overture. Apparently Los Angeles agreed with Nijinska, for she would make it her permanent residence a few years later. In 1934 she designed the dances.\n\nNijinska's incidental choreography for A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935) was as imaginative and magical as everything else in that sumptuously produced film.\"\nAs a one-act ballet in Saint Petersburg A Midsummer Night's Dream had been \"first choreographed by Marius Petipa in 1876\" and in 1902 by Mikhail Fokine, to Mendelssohn's 1842 music. Other versions were later staged by Terpis (Berlin 1927), Balanchine (New York 1962), Ashton (London 1964), and Spoerli (Basle 1975). A staging of Fokine's choreography, however, at the Imperial Theatrical School on March 26, 1906, was especially memorable for Nijinska. Not only did she dance in it, but the date marked a visit by her father after a long absence.The 1935 film was not Nijinska's first time in the employ of Max Reinhardt. The well-known impresario's practice was to stage a variety of performance arts in theaters across Europe. In 1931, for a Reinhardt production in Berlin, Nijinska had created the ballet scenes for Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.\n\n\n==== Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires: Le Baiser de la F\u00e9e, Opera choreographies ====\nNijinska had presented at Teatro Col\u00f3n in 1933 her ballet Le Baiser de la F\u00e9e [Kiss of the fairy], which she had first staged for Ida Rubinstein's Company in 1928. It was based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Ice-Maiden. Yet, in recreating the tale, music composer Igor Stravinsky had changed the eerie maiden into a fruitful Muse, inverting Andersen's original story in which the ice-maiden, disguised as a beautiful woman, attracts young men who are led to their death. In 1937 Nijinska returned to Buenos Aires for a reprise performance of Le Baiser de la F\u00e9e at the Stravinsky Festival.Ballet choreography she created for dance scenes in operatic works that played at Teatro Col\u00f3n. Accordingly, Nijinska worked with the music of various composers, e.g., Mussorgsky, Verdi, de Falla, and Wagner.\n\n\n==== 'Markova-Dolin Ballet' in London, & Jamaica; (Markova later: Autumn Song) ====\n\nNijinska reprised her 1924 Les Biches for a performance by the Markova-Dolin troupe in 1937. \"For six months during 1937 the troupe was creatively bolstered by the presence of Nijinska, who took charge of rehearsals and classes in addition to staging Les Biches and La Bien-Aim\u00e9e.\"Alicia Markova was a leading English ballerina. In 1935 she left the Vic-Wells ballet company of Ninette de Valois, where she had excelled in classical roles. She left to \"form the Markova-Dolin Company (1935\u20131938), with Bronislava Nijinsky as chief choreographer.\" Irish dancer Anton Dolin in 1921 was with Ballets Russes, and later was the 'handsome swimmer' in Nijinska's 1924 Le Train Bleu. During the 1930s he became a frequent dance partner of Markova. In 1940 he joined American Ballet Theatre.After the war, for the Markova-Dolin company Nijinska choreographed Fantasia, music by Schubert and Liszt. A one-act ballet it opened in 1947 at the Ward Theatre, Kingston, Jamaica. Costumes and decor were by Rose Schogel, principal dancers: Bettina Rosay and Anton Dolin.In the 1930s Nijinska gave Alicia Markova 'creative sessions' in ballet, including instructions in her choreographed dances. In particular she taught Markova an early work of hers from Kiev: Autumn Song to music by Tchaikovsky. Nijinska had originally danced it barefoot wearing a tunic of her own design. In 1953 Markova performed this solo ballet for a variety show on NBC television.\n\n\n==== 'Ballet Polonais' in Warsaw: Concerto de Chopin, La L\u00e9gende de Cracovie ====\nIn 1937 Nijinska was asked to become the artistic director and the choreographer for the newly recreated Balet Polski, aka Les Ballets Polonais and The Polish Ballet. In the revival of this national ballet, among its chief aims: to advance the Polish dance heritage, to train new ballet professionals, and to perform internationally. She signed a 3-year contract. For the company's 1937-1938 debut season, she created five new ballets, including Concerto de Chopin, Le Chant de la Terre, Apollon et la Belle, Le Rappel, and La L\u00e9gende de Cracovie.The five opened in November 1937, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Mogador in Paris, as part of the Exposition Internationale. Well received, the Exposition awarded Ballet Polonais the Grand Prix for performance and Nijinska the Grand Prix for choreography. The company then performed their ballet program in London, Berlin, and Warsaw, and toured many other cities in Germany and in Poland.Nijinska attended a folk festival in Vilna, Poland to study the national dances upon which she drew in Le Chant de la Terre (Pie\u015b\u0144 o ziemi naszej). She also took inspiration from the drawings of Polish artist Zofja Stryjenska.. \"The first scene, 'Little Saturday,' depicted the spring rituals of sun and fire worship...The customs of the Slavic wedding were represented in the second scene when the celebrants danced 'wild Mazurkas and [steps] of the vital earth-stamping kind with complicated rhythms and...leaps in the air.'...The final scene, 'Harvest,' had powerful choreographic images of the ceremonies surrounding the season's harvest.\" In this powerful climax \"a wedge of dancers, wielding curved scythes in great arcing movements, carved their way diagonally across the stage.\"\nIn her ballet Apollon et la Belle (Apolo i dziewczyna),  \"Nijinska ingeniously traced the incarnation of Apollo through five epochs of civilization.In each age, Nijinska's Apollo encounters his counterpart, the Dionysian earth element, in the form of a woman.\" \"Program notes describe the incarnations of Apollo ranging from god of ancient Greece to athlete on a modern beach. In the first scene, Apollo is the celestial charioteer who must descend to earth to receive strength and purpose from the earth-mother feminine character. In successive scenes of inventive and sometimes humorous incarnations Apollo reappears in the guise of a medieval monk, Louis the XIV, a nineteenth-century poet, and finally as a modern-day champion of athleticism.\"Le Rappel (Wezwanie) \"begins in a Viennese ballroom of the eighteenth century, where a denationalized young Pole is enjoying the sophisticated society in which he finds himself. But the young woman whom he catches in a game of blind man's buff is Polish and patriotic, and she recalls him to the simpler manners and the more demonstrative dances of their native countryside.,,,A large corps de ballet supports the principals in producing the contrast of the two types of dance, the Viennese and the Polish.\"\n\nThe Concerto de Chopin \"follows no plot but tries to reflect the shifting moods of the music.\" Baer suggests that the ballet shows Nijinska's \"feeling of longing, farewell, and sorrow that she had experienced on leaving Russia\" in 1921. About the Chopin Concerto (as later performed in 1944), dance critic Edward Denby wrote of it as \"oddly beautiful ... because it is clear and classic to the eye but tense and romantic in its emotion.\"\nThe structure of the piece\u2014like that of much of Mme Nijinska's work\u2014is based on a formal contrast: in the background, rigid impersonal groups or clusters of dancers, which seem to have the weight of statues; in the foreground, rapid arrowy flights performed by individual soloists. One appreciates their flashes of lightness and freedom because of the weight they seem to rise over, as if the constraints of the group were the springboard for the soloist's release.\nNijinska also staged La L\u00e9gend de Cracovie, \"a new ballet of high merit\" to music by Michal Kondracki. In plot it is \"a medieval Polish variation of the Faust story\". In choreography she employed her \"celebrated group architecture\" but also fashioned roles open to character dance development. As described by French critic Pierre Michaut, \"Les h\u00e9ros et ses compagnons composaient leurs danses avec des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de folklore et avec des danses traditionelles polonaises, telles que la Cracovienne. Mais pas et figures \u00e9taient d\u00e9form\u00e9s, outr\u00e9s, fortement accentu\u00e9s en burlesque, et ils devenaient une sorte de gesticulation fr\u00e9n\u00e9tique et d'ailleurs expressive.\"After its Grand Prix-winning tour to Paris, Nijinska was \"abruptly released\" from its leadership. Most likely the cause of her dismissal was \"her insistence upon a full disclosure of the troupe's financial records.\" Due to the increasing danger of military attack by neighboring countries, the Polish government apparently was seeking to covertly route some of its funds to America. \"Characteristically, Nijinska would have refused to become involved with politics or intrigue.\" She was replaced by L\u00e9on W\u00f3jcikowski.\nWith Ballets Russes since 1916 Leon Woizikovsky (1899-1975) had enjoyed prominent roles in Nijinska's Les Noces, Les Biches, and Le Train Bleu (as the Golfer). In 1939 he led the Ballet Polonais to the World's Fair in New York. \"The company returned to Warsaw one day before the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, and was never heard from again.\"Woizikovsky himself found work in the Americas during the war. Much later he helped in reconstructing Nijinska's choreography for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Yet for Nijinska in pre-invasion Poland, the \"shock of her dismissal\" and \"the impending war caused a profound depression.\"\n\n\n=== Ballet companies and exemplary ballets 1939\u20131950s ===\nNijinska and her family were in London when World War II started with the combined Nazi and Soviet invasion of Poland (September 1939). She had a contract to \"co-direct the dance sequences on a new film, Bullet in the Ballet,\" but it was cancelled due to war. Fortunately, an offer from promoter de Basil allowed them to make their way back to the United States. She eventually established a new residence in Los Angeles.\n\n\n==== 'Ballet Theatre' in New York: La Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e of Dauberval ====\nNijinska in 1939 began to choreograph a \"rustic and comic\" two-act ballet of the 18th century, Jean Dauberval's La fille mal gard\u00e9e ['The ill-watched Daughter' or 'Useless Precautions']. For the inaugural season of Ballet Theatre (now ABT), it opened in January 1940 in New York City at the old Center Theatre in Rockefeller Plaza.\n\nLa Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e is perhaps \"the oldest ballet in the contemporary repertory\" whose \"comic situations are no doubt responsible for its survival.\"  Jean Dauberval wrote the libretto and first choreography, the original music being a mix of popular French songs. Premiering at Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux in 1789, the comedy \"quickly made the circuit of European stages.\" Later in 1864 Taglioni's production in Berlin first adopted composite music scored by Hertel, which in 1885 was adopted by Petipa and Ivanov for the Maryinski Theater in Saint Petersburg.Dauberval's plot follows a lively rural romance, the lovers being \"the mind-of-her-own Lise and the hard-to-resist Colas\". They are challenged by Lise's mother the widow Simone, who prefers Allain, a wealthy but dull suitor.\"In America the most important production was Nijinska's for Ballet Theatre in 1940.\" Lucia Chase had invited her to mount her own version, which incorporated decor from Mordkin (his company had merged with Ballet Theatre). Nijinska took to revising Petipa's Russian version of La Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e and staged the ballet with Irina Baronova and Dimitri Romanoff. This 1940 staging was soon revived, once as The Wayward Daughter, with later versions by Romanoff, and in 1946 by Alexandra Balashova. Eventually it entered the repertory of the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas.Twenty years later in London, Nijinska's former student Frederick Ashton of The Royal Ballet staged it. He refashioned the Dauberval libretto, wrote his choreography to Hertel's music as modified by Lanchbery, and provided a revised decor. The result was a popular, and declared a \"substantial work\".Also for Ballet Theatre, in 1951 Nijinska choreographed and staged the Schumann Concerto, music by Robert Schumann, with Alicia Alonso and Igor Youskevitch as principal dancers. The music's romantic mood frames the abstract ballet in three movements. The couple is joined by a corps de ballet of boys and girls. In 1945 Nijinska had choreographed Rendezvous with music by Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873-1943), with principal dancers Lucia Chase and Dimitri Romanoff. Both were staged for Ballet Theatre at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City.\n\n\n==== 'Hollywood Bowl': Bol\u00e9ro, Chopin Concerto, Etude-Bach; and Jacob's Pillow ====\n\nLater in 1940 she staged three short ballets for a performance at the Hollywood Bowl. For the program with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra she selected favorites from among her prior choreographies: Ravel's Bol\u00e9ro (premiered with Rubinstein in 1932, revised), the Chopin Concerto (from 1937 with the Polish Ballet), and Etude-Bach (originally 'Holy Etudes' done for her own company in 1925, revisions). The event drew an audience of 22,000, and featured dancers Maria Tallchief and Cyd Charisse. \nNijinska revived Etude-Bach and Chopin Concerto again, in 1942, at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the Berkshires. There the cast included dancers Nina Youshkevitch, Marina Svetlova, and Nikita Tallin; while Ann Hutchinson Guest danced in the corps.\n\n\n==== 'Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo' under Denham in New York: Snow Maiden. ====\nNijinska choreographed Snow Maiden in 1942 with music by Glazunov, for 'Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo' under Serge Denham as Artistic Director. Snow Maiden drew on Russian folklore. The maiden, the Frost King's daughter, would melt in the sun's heat if she fell in love with a mortal man. The choreography \"did not open any new avenues of artistic exploration.\" Yet critic Edwin Denby notes that \"by preserving just enough independence of rhythm in relation to the sugary Glazounoff score [her groupings and dance phrases] keep a certain acid edge.\"A revision of the Chopin Concerto was staged by Nijinska also in 1942. Originally written in 1937 for the award-winning Polish Ballet, the influential New York Times dance critic John Martin ranked it highly. Yet he considered Chopin (and Tchaikovsky) as no longer current. In 1943 Nijinska choreographed the Ancient Russia ballet, music by Tchaikovsky, with memorable visual designs by her theater colleague Nathalie Gontcharova.For Denham's company Nijinska and Balanchine \"were well-known choreographers on whom he could call.\" It was, however, \"not Nijinska but another woman-an American-who revitalized the Ballets Russes in 1942. Agnes de Mille [did it with her] Rodeo ...\"\n\n\n==== 'Ballet International' in New York: Pictures at an Exhibition ====\nDuring the 1940s and into the 1950s, Nijinska served as the ballet mistress for the International Ballet, later known variously, e.g., the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas. The company played chiefly in Europe and the Mediterranean until 1961.In 1944 for an opening at the International Theater in New York she choreographed Pictures at an Exhibition, an 1874 suite of piano pieces by Modest Mussorgsky, later orchestrated by Maurice Ravel, and by Ivan Boutnikov. Mussorgsky wrote no ballet music, but two of his compositions inspired Nijinska: Night on Bald Mountain (Ballets Russes 1924), and here Pictures.Costumes and decor were by Boris Aronson. Aronson was an apprentice of Aleksandra Ekster, Nijinska's designer in Kiev and Paris. Evidently Nijinska was the first to choreograph Pictures. The next ballet to this music was staged by Erika Hanka at the Vienna State Opera (1947), and then by Lopokov at the Bolshoi in Moscow (1963).In 1952 also for Marquis de Cuevas' Grand Ballet de Monte Carlo, Nijinska choreographed Rondo Capriccioso. Composed in 1863 by Saint-Sa\u00ebns, it was originally crafted for the virtuoso violinist Pablo de Sarasate. The 1952 ballet by Nijinska opened in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Empire, with principal dancers Rosella Hightower and George Skibine.\n\n\n=== Ballet companies: revivals of her early choreographies 1960\u20131971 ===\n\n\n==== 'Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas' in New York: The Sleeping Beauty ====\nIn 1960 the Cuevas Ballet produced a revision of The Sleeping Beauty, which was to have been staged by Nijinska. She was familiar with the ballet from Diaghilev's production of 1921. For it she had created several popular dances. In 1922 she and Stravinsky abbreviated it into the successful one-act ballet Aurora's Wedding.Long associated with the Cuevas company as ballet mistress, Nijinska began to craft her choreographic revision. A conflict, however, developed over the ballet which involved artistic issues. In discussions she declined to compromise. Nijinska withdrew from the company. Robert Helpmann then came into the process. A dancer, he had also staged ballets, and had long partnered with Fonteyn, namely in The Royal Ballet's post-war The Sleeping Beauty. In the end the Cuevas company gave its choreographic credit to both, as Nijinska-Helpmann.\n\n\n==== 'The Royal Ballet' of London: Les Biches and Les Noces ====\n\nIn 1964 Frederick Ashton of The Royal Ballet asked Nijinska to stage a revival of her ballet Les Biches (1924) at Covent Gardens. Ashton had been resident choreographer for The Royal Ballet since 1935. Then becoming also an associate director in 1952, he was appointed the Royal Ballet's director in 1963.Nijinska first mentored Ashton's career from when he was a young ballet student. In 1928 in Paris she'd been the choreographer for Ida Rubenstein, where he'd become a dancer in the company. He performed in several of choreographed works by Nijinska under her guidance. Ashton consider her a beneficial influence in the development of ballet. More specifically, her choreography had informed his own progress in that art. The staging of the revived Les Biches went well. Two years later, Ashton asked her to return to London and stage her Les Noces (1923) on his company.These 1964 London productions, according to dance critic Horst Koegler, \"confirmed her reputation as one of the formative choreographers of the 20th century.\" In 1934 Ashton had expressed his own opinion:\n\nHer achievements have proved to me time and again that through the medium of classical ballet any emotion may be expressed. She might be called the architect of dancing, building her work brick by brick into the amazing structures that result in masterpieces like Les Noces.\n\n\n==== Other stagings: Brahms Variations, Le Marriage d'Aurore, Chopin Concerto ====\nFollowing these London events, Nijinska \"was repeatedly invited to revive several of her ballets\". She staged Les Biches in Rome in 1969, and in Florence and Washington in 1970. Also Les Biches, and a revised version of Chopin Concerto and Brahms Variations, for the Center Ballet of Buffalo in 1969.Les Noces was staged in 1971 in Venice, where during a rehearsal at the Teatro Fenice, she celebrated her eightieth birthday onstage. \"Between 1968 and 1972, Nijinska saw performances of Les Biches, Les Noces, Brahms Variations, Le Marriage d'Aurore, and Chopin Concerto for ballet companies in the United States and in Europe.\"\n\n\n==== Irina Nijinska's further revivals, and others ====\n\nAfter her death in 1972, her daughter Irina Nijinska (1913-1991) continued this work. A growing number of performances of her mother's early ballets were performed. Several entered into the current repertoire of dance companies. Included were works first produced by Ballets Russes.\nIrina, a dancer in her own right, had been helping her mother for many years, at her ballet school and as her rehearsal assistant. During the 1970s and 1980s, Irina advanced her legacy. She edited and translated Early Memoirs and saw it to publication. In the theatrical world Irina Nijinska associated with ballet companies to facilitate revivals of the choreographies. Les Noces and Les Biches increasingly appeared on stage.Among others, Irina brought Les Noces to The Paris Opera Ballet, and \"Rondo Capriccioso\" to the Dance Theater of Harlem. In collaboration with a dance historian, the French Riviera comedy \"Le Train Bleu\" was reconstructed; then it was staged by the Oakland Ballet. In 1981 the Dance Theatre of Harlem under Arthur Mitchell \"produced an entire Nijinska evening\". After Irina's passing in 1991, the Nijinska revivals continued.Ballerina Nina Youshkevitch, a Nijinska dancer (e.g., at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1942), revived Bolero for the Oakland Ballet in 1995. She also staged Chopin Concerto for students at Goucher College in Maryland that same year.\n\n\n=== Commentary by critics, academics, herself ===\nInstead, she preferred the pre-war Diaghilev who had been \"searching for the creation of a new ballet ...\" Hence regarding The Sleeping Princess Nijinska recalled the paradox that \"I started my first work full of protest against myself.\" \"Because she stemmed from the academic ballet tradition, Bronislava Nijinska is often called a Neo-Classicist. But her choreography also has an affinity to such styles of modern art as Cubism, Constructivism and Expressionism.\" Over the course of her career Nijinska, in her effort to augment classical ballet with new ideas about the art of movement, neither crossed over to champion a newly fashioned modernity, nor did she accept as timelessly classic the inherited ballet tradition. She declined her brother Nijinsky's turn to modern dance. Instead, following the new insights into movement, she initiated \"what would be called neoclassical choreography\". She eventually came to admire Petipa's work, while pruning its \"nondance elements\". A \"renewable legacy was at the heart of Nijinska's classicism\". As \"one of the twentieth-century ballet's great innovators ... her repertoire introduced a new classicism that made dance a medium of modern art expression.\" Her Les Noces (1923) bridged the contemporary tensions \"between primitivism and mechanization, exoticism and neoclassicism, Russianess and cosmopolitanism, Soviet and \u00e9migr\u00e9. ... The ability of Les Noces to negotiate so many different boundaries ... accounts in no small measure for its timely, as well as timeless success.\"\n\n\n== Based in Los Angeles, from 1940 ==\nAfter the start in 1939 of World War II in Europe, Nijinska and her family moved to New York in that October, then to Los Angeles in 1940. \"Bronislava Nijinska did not understand Americans, or they her. She was almost deaf by the time she reached the United States, and life (exile, her brother's madness, her son's death) had let her down badly.\"Yet she continued as a ballet mistress and guest choreographer, work that continued into the 1960s (see section above). In Los Angeles she began to teach ballet in a private studio, and she opened her own school in 1941. Her daughter Irina Nijinska would run the school in her absence. Bronislava became a citizen of the United States in 1949.\n\n\n=== Teaching dance ===\nThroughout her career, starting earlier than her 1919 'L'Ecol\u00e9 de Mouvement' in Kiev, Nijinska had taught dance. A ballet role to her colleagues she'd demonstrate, or to the cast her newly created choreographies. In 1922 she had started teaching at Ballets Russes, taking over from Enrico Cecchetti. Among her earlier students: Serge Lifar in revolutionary Kiev; Anton Dolin, Lydia Sokolova, Frederick Ashton, Alicia Markova, Irina Baronova, David Lichine in interwar Europe; Lucia Chase in New York. Her auditions in the 1930s were conducted in the form of a short class.In 1935 rehearsals for Les Cent Baisers, choreographer Nijinska coached the youthful Irina Baronova in her leading role as the Princess. Already relatively widely experienced in ballet performance, Baronova was developing rapidly into a modern classical ballerina. According to author Vicente Garc\u00eda-M\u00e1rquez, however, Nijinska was key.\n\nWorking with Nijinska was a turning point in her artistic growth. Before she had never had the opportunity for careful dissection of her roles. Nijinska's approach ... gave the sixteen-year-old Baronova the self-awareness she needed to probe into herself and bring forth her full potential.\nIn New York Nijinska was invited to come teach in Hollywood. She eventually opened her own ballet studio there in 1941. Required to travel afar to pursue her choreographic work, she frequently left her daughter Irina Nijinska in charge. At her Hollywood studio (soon relocated to Beverly Hills), students included the prima ballerinas Maria Tallchief and Marjorie Tallchief (sisters), as well as Cyd Charisse, and later Allegra Kent.\n\nMaria Tallchief (1925-2013) studied with Nijinska, \"all through my high school years\". Everyone, recalled Tallchief, was in awe of her. \"She jumped and flashed around the studio. I was under her spell.\" Despite \"luminous green eyes\" she dressed very plainly. Her husband translated. \"Madame say when you sleep, sleep like a ballerina. Even on street waiting for bus, stand like a ballerina.\" Yet \"Madame Nijinska rarely spoke. She didn't have to. She had incredible personal magnetism\". From her \"I first learned that the dancer's soul is in the middle of the body\". When Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo came to perform in Los Angeles, the ballet dancers came to Madame to take lessons. \"And the biggest star of all, Alexandra Danilova, gave Nijinska roses when she entered the studio\".Allegra Kent (born 1937) recalls starting ballet lessons in 1949 when she was twelve. Madame Nijinska was a \"nice-looking woman in black lounge pajamas with a long cigarette holder\". She counted time \"ras, va, tri\" in Russian. \"Her husband was simultaneously translating everything she said into English.\" Because of her commanding presence in classes, \"The world began and ended right there in that moment.\" After a year with her daughter Irina Nijinska, Kent studied with 'Madame' herself. She learned \"not to fear competing with men\" and that \"the light look of dance was merely the surface of a sculpture-there was a mixture of steel and quicksilver at the heart.\"\n\n\n=== Work on her Memoirs ===\nThe last year of her life Nijinska devoted to finishing memoirs about her early life. She had notebooks of her writings and had kept theatrical programs throughout her career. A manuscript of 180,000 words was left completed. Following her death in early 1972, Bronislava Nijinska's daughter Irina Nijinska was named her literary executor. Then she and Jean Rawlingson edited and translated the Russian manuscript into English. They edited the text, and saw it through to publication. The book Early Memoirs appeared in 1981. These writings describe in detail her early years traveling in provincial Russia with her dancer parents, her brother Vaslav's development as a dancer, her schooling and first years as a professional in the Diaghilev era of Russian ballet, and her work assisting her brother in his choreography. During her life, she had published a book and several articles on ballet.\"The full autobiographical story of her own career, however, is contained in another set of her memoirs, continuing from the 1914 close of [her Early Memoirs].\" She also left a set of notebooks on ballet and other writings, which remain unpublished. Dance historian and critic Lynn Garafola is said to be currently working on a biography of Bronislava Nijinska.\n\n\n== As described by others ==\nMargaret Severn, a dancer who did both vaudeville and classical, was for a time in 1931 a leading dancer in Nijinska's Paris-based company. Sometimes she'd abbreviate Nijinska as \"Nij\". Later she wrote an article from her notes at the time:\n\n\"I was very favorably impressed with [Nijinska] personality. She is somewhat crazy, of course, but really a great artist. I could tell from the little she showed, and she had a marvelous technique herself. So I would simply adore to be in the company ...\" \"Nij arranged a very short but very snappy little dance for me in the 'Variations'. ... [T]his half minute is quite likely to bring the house down. ... The dance is one of the most brilliant and most difficult concoctions I have ever seen.\"\n\nLydia Sokolova, an English ballerina, performed in Ballets Russes from 1913 to 1929. Circa 1920 she married Leon Woizikovsky, also a dancer in the company. Her memoirs were edited by Richard Buckle and published in London in 1960.\n\n\"Bronislava Nijinska, known as Bronia, was very like her brother Vaslav Nijinsky. She was blonde and wore her straight hair screwed into a tight little roll. She had pale eyes and pouting lips, wore no makeup at all and had not shaved off her eyebrows as most of us had in those days. ... Bronia was obstinate and once she had made up her mind nothing in the world would move her. She was brilliantly clever and inventive. No music seemed to present any difficulties for her, but her style of movement was even more pronounced and idiosyncratic than that of Massine, and she was not an easy person to work for in class or at rehearsal ... Her system of training seemed to depend more on improvisation than on traditional methods of technique ... [T]o watch her devise a sequence of steps and movements for one of her ballets was most interesting. I liked her, in spite of her moodiness and lack of humor.\" \"There were two of us in the company whom Diaghilev could always make cry whenever he wished, Nijinska and myself.\"\nAs one of the three Russian baby ballerinas the teenager Irina Baronova worked with Nijinska the choreographer in the mid-1930s. She later described the experience.\n\nThe ideas were clear from the very beginning; and even though there was obviously a prearranged structure, once she was in the studio she involved the dancers in the creative process. ... Her choreography seemed to flow spontaneously. Even when she was improvising, she always projected the conviction that she knew her ultimate goals, for she was precise and direct in her explanations.\n\n\n== Personal, family life ==\n\n\n=== Mother and father ===\nAfter her parents separated, Vaslav had turned against his father Tomasz [Foma] Nijinsky, because of his infidelity. Bronislava, however, remained attached to her absent father, who visited from time to time. She followed his career, championing his times of subsequent success in ballet. With Tomasz her mother eventually reached some understanding. In 1912 her father died in Russia. Her oldest brother Stanislav (Stassik), by a doctor's instructions placed in a sanitariums since 1902, died in Russia in 1918.In 1921 Nijinska with her mother Eleanora Bereda Nijinska and her two children left Russia, a perilous undertaking. They made their way to Austria, to meet her brother, his wife, and children. Nijinska then rejoined Ballets Russes, chiefly in Paris and Monte Carlo, until 1925. Thereafter she worked independently, often on tour. Throughout Bronislava remained close to her mother the retired dancer whom she called \"Mamusia\". She wrote her when away and shared her thoughts when near. She cared for her when ill, until she died in 1932.\n\n\n=== Her brother Vaslav ===\n\nDuring her early years and into her mid-twenties, Bronislava Nijinsky was under the strong influence of her older brother Vaslav Nijinsky, whose brilliance became widely celebrated. Both Vatsa and Broni were trained from the start by their dancer parents. She learned from her brother's example, as he preceded her in their childhood adventures, in ballet school, and then on the stage. When Nijinsky came to design his first choreographies, Nijinska as a ballet dancer assisted, following his detailed instructions as he tried out new steps and innovative poses. Her 1912 marriage, however, shook the artistic \"bond between the brother and sister\". Bronia nonetheless continued her sibling loyalty. She showed her support for Vaslav's career, especially during his 1914 production of Season Nijinsky in London.In 1913 Vaslav married Romola de Pulszky suddenly while in Argentina. It was a confounding surprise to his mother and sister. In 1917 his ballet career ended in confusion and controversy. Thereafter he lived with Romola and their children in Switzerland for many years. He died in Sussex, UK, in 1950. Vaslav was survived by his wife and by Kyra and Tamara, their two daughters; and by Tamara's daughter, and by Kyra's son Vaslav Markevitch. In 1931 Kyra had danced in her aunt Bronia's company 'Ballets Nijinska'.\n\n\n=== Marriages, children ===\nNijinska married twice. Her first husband, Alexandre Kochetovsky, was a fellow dancer for Ballet Russes. She calls him 'Sasha' in her Early Memoirs. Married in London in 1912, they soon left for Russia. She gave birth to two children: their daughter Irina Nijinska in 1913 in Saint Petersburg (called 'Irushka'), and Leon Kochetovsky, their son in 1919 in Kiev (called 'Levushka'). Their marriage had entered difficult times, first during war and then in revolution. They continuously had worked together in dance productions. After Leon was born, Bronia and Sasha separated. He moved to Odessa. In 1921 Nijinska left Soviet Russia with her children and her mother. After meeting again briefly in 1921 in London, they were divorced in 1924. Their son Leon was killed in a traffic accident in 1935. Their daughter Irina, who'd become a ballet dancer, was seriously injured in that 1935 traffic collision. In 1946 Irina married Gibbs S. Raetz, and they had two children, Natalie and George. After her mother's death in 1972, she edited her Memoirs and managed revivals of her ballets. Irina died in 1991.A love of her life, but whom she did not marry, was also a theatrical personality, the Russian opera singer and renowned basso, Feodor Chaliapin (1873\u20131938). Their career paths had crossed several times, but for a romance to blossom their circumstances worked against them. Yet their strong artistic link and mutual admiration continued. He remained a treasured source of her musical and theatrical inspiration.Nijinska's second marriage in 1924 was to Nicholas Singaevsky (called 'Kolya'). A few years her junior, he'd been a former student and dancer at the 'Ecole de Mouvement' she had founded in Kiev following the Russian revolution. He, too, had left Russia. They met again as exiles in Monte Carlo. He became associated with Ballets Russes as a dancer. They were married in 1924. During their four decades together, he often worked in production and management, acting as her business partner in staging her various ballet productions and other projects. In America he also translated for her, especially when she taught at the ballet studio. He died in Los Angeles, California, in 1968, four years before her.Bronislava Nijinska died on February 21, 1972, in Pacific Palisades, California, after suffering a heart attack. She was 81. She was survived by her daughter, son-in-law, and two grandchildren.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCategory:Ballets by Bronislava Nijinska\nList of Russian ballet dancers\nPolish National Ballet\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Primary ===\nBronislava Nijinska, \"On Movement and the School of Movement\" from her choreographic notebooks 1919-1925, as translated from Russian original by Anya Lem and Thelwall Proctor, edited by Joan Ross Acocella and Lynn Garafola, text in Baer (1986), pp. 85\u201387 [cf. p. 88,nn1+3], , and apparently in Ballet Review, 13/4 (Winter 1986), [cited by Garafola (1989), p. 203,n10].

        "wiki": "The Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay (UK:  MEW-zay dor-SAY, US:  mew-ZAY -\u2060, French: [myze d\u0254\u0281s\u025b]) is a museum in Paris, France, on the Left Bank of the Seine.  It is housed in the former Gare d'Orsay, a Beaux-Arts railway station built between 1898 and 1900. The museum holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1914, including paintings, sculptures, furniture, and photography. It houses the largest collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist masterpieces in the world, by painters including Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, Seurat, Sisley, Gauguin, and Van Gogh.  Many of these works were held at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume prior to the museum's opening in 1986. It is one of the largest art museums in Europe. Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay had more than 3.6 million visitors in 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe museum building was originally a railway station, Gare d'Orsay, constructed for the Chemin de Fer de Paris \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans and finished in time for the 1900 Exposition Universelle to the design of three architects: Lucien Magne, \u00c9mile B\u00e9nard and Victor Laloux. It was the terminus for the railways of southwestern France until 1939.\nBy 1939 the station's short platforms had become unsuitable for the longer trains that had come to be used for mainline services. After 1939 it was used for suburban services and part of it became a mailing centre during World War II. It was then used as a set for several films, such as Kafka's The Trial adapted by Orson Welles, and as a haven for the Renaud\u2013Barrault Theatre Company and for auctioneers, while the H\u00f4tel Drouot was being rebuilt.\nIn 1970, permission was granted to demolish the station but Jacques Duhamel, Minister for Cultural Affairs, ruled against plans to build a new hotel in its stead. The station was put on the supplementary list of Historic Monuments and finally listed in 1978. The suggestion to turn the station into a museum came from the Directorate of the Museum of France. The idea was to build a museum that would bridge the gap between the Louvre and the National Museum of Modern Art at the Georges Pompidou Centre. The plan was accepted by Georges Pompidou and a study was commissioned in 1974. In 1978, a competition was organized to design the new museum.  ACT Architecture, a team of three young architects (Pierre Colboc, Renaud Bardon and Jean-Paul Philippon), were awarded the contract which involved creating 20,000 square metres (220,000 sq ft) of new floorspace on four floors. The construction work was carried out by Bouygues. In 1981, the Italian architect Gae Aulenti was chosen to design the interior including the internal arrangement, decoration, furniture and fittings of the museum. Finally in July 1986, the museum was ready to receive its exhibits. It took 6 months to install the 2000 or so paintings, 600 sculptures and other works. The museum officially opened in December 1986 by then-president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand.\nFrom 2020 on, the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay is scheduled to undergo a radical transformation over the next decade, funded in part by an anonymous US patron who donated \u20ac20 million to a building project known as Orsay Grand Ouvert (Orsay Wide Open). The gift was made via the American Friends of the Mus\u00e9es d\u2019Orsay et de l\u2019Orangerie.\n\nThe square next to the museum displays six bronze allegorical sculptural groups in a row, originally produced for the Exposition Universelle:\n\nSouth America by Aim\u00e9 Millet\nAsia by Alexandre Falgui\u00e8re\nOceania by Mathurin Moreau\nEurope by Alexandre Schoenewerk\nNorth America by Ernest-Eug\u00e8ne Hiolle\nAfrica by Eug\u00e8ne Delaplanche\n\n\n== Collection ==\n\n\n=== Paintings: major painters and works represented ===\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille \u2013 6 paintings including The Family Reunion,  The Improvised Field Hospital, The Pink Dress, Studio in Rue de La Condamine\nCecilia Beaux \u2013 Sita and Sarita (Jeune Fille au Chat)\nRosa Bonheur - Ploughing in the Nivernais\nPierre Bonnard \u2013 60 paintings including The Chequered Blouse\nEug\u00e8ne Boudin \u2013 33 paintings including Trouville Beach\nWilliam-Adolphe Bouguereau \u2013 12 paintings including The Birth of Venus, La Danse, Dante and Virgil\nLouise Catherine Breslau - 4 paintings including Portrait of Henry Davison\nAlexandre Cabanel \u2013 The Birth of Venus, The Death of Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta\nGustave Caillebotte \u2013 7 paintings including The Floor Scrapers, Vue de toits (Effet de neige)\nEug\u00e8ne Carri\u00e8re \u2013 86 paintings including The Painting Family, The Sick Child, Intimacy\nMary Cassatt \u2013 1 painting\nPaul C\u00e9zanne \u2013 56 paintings including Apples and Oranges, The Hanged Man's House, The Card Players, Portrait of Gustave Geffroy\nTh\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau  \u2013 5 paintings (the main collection of his paintings is in the Louvre)\nPierre Puvis de Chavannes \u2013 Young Girls by the Seaside, The Young Mother also known as Charity, View on the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles and the Orangerie\nGustave Courbet \u2013 48 paintings including The Artist's Studio, A Burial at Ornans, Young Man Sitting, L'Origine du monde, Le ruisseau noir, Still-Life with Fruit, The Wave, The Wounded Man\nJean-Baptiste-Camille Corot \u2013 32 paintings (the main collection of his paintings is in the Louvre) including A Morning.

        "wiki": "Furet du Nord is a chain of bookstores in the Nord department of France. Its origins date back to 1936 when a fur store located on Rue de la Vieille-Com\u00e9die in Lille was transformed into a bookstore. It retained its name, referring to a local tradition: rabbit hunting with ferrets.\nToday, the flagship store is located in Lille on the Grand Place. It was established in 1959 and was the largest bookstore in the world from 1992 to 1999. It is still the largest bookshop in Europe today.\n\n\n== History ==\nFuret du Nord was originally a fur shop located on Rue de la Vieille-Com\u00e9die in Lille. High school principal Georges Poulard transformed the 750 sq ft fur shop into a bookstore in 1936. Despite the nature of the business changing, the new owner decided to keep the original name, Furet du Nord.In 1947, Paul Callens began working at Furet du Nord. He had a passion for books despite coming from a family where his father, a butcher in Tourcoing, did not understand or indulge in his passion. Dissatisfied with his position as a salesman and the shop's size, Callens wanted to purchase the shop despite not having enough money. Later in 1950, he told his dreams of buying the bookshop to his dairymaid friend, Florence, who took a tin box from the cellar wrapped in a newspaper containing her savings. Callens bought the bookstore with the savings the next day. While at a caf\u00e9, Callens heard that Galleries Barb\u00e8s was closing their furniture store on the Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle in Lille, and he had the idea of moving Furet there. There were other contenders for the location such as the Renault company, so Callens made his first trip to Paris to plead his case with the management of Galleries Barb\u00e8s. He convinced the management with plans for his bookstore and it opened on 1 August 1959. It initially had a space of 20 m2 which later expanded to 600 m2. Its grand opening was in 1960. Furet du Nord became the first self-service bookstore and was also the first bookstore in France to open a department of pocketbooks in the basement in 1963; a youth department was built in the basement in 1970.In 1982, Paul Callens' family business became a public company and began to open other stores in the area. Furet du Nord's area expanded from 500 m2 to 7,000 m2 between the years of 1982 to 1992. Today, it hosts an average of 12,000 daily visitors. In 1996, Furet du Nord opened its first online bookstore. The site now offers 350,000 French language references. Furet du Nord is now owned by Extrapole, a chain of multimedia cultural stores, and its shareholder Lagard\u00e8re Services, acquired in July 1999.In the summer of 2001, Lagard\u00e8re (formerly Hachette Distribution Services) acquired the French network of Virgin Megastores and became the second-largest French group that specialized in distributing cultural products (ahead of the French group Pinault Printemps Redoute). Due to regional fame, Furet du Nord retained its name. At the beginning of November 2007, Lagard\u00e8re announced that it was in exclusive negotiations with the French investment fund Butler Capital Partners (BCP). At the end of November, the works council unanimously accepted the change of the main shareholding, with the acquisition of a stake of about 80% in the Virgin/Furet investment fund. The same month, the group announced that the bookstore located in Boulogne-sur-Mer since 1990 was to close at the end of January 2008. In the summer of 2008, two subsidiaries of the regional bank of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole in Nord de France, Vauban Partners (Paris) and Participex Gestion (Lille) took control of the capital. This operation made it possible to repay the debt (\u20ac15 million) and contributed \u20ac10 million in equity.Starting with the separation from Virgin Megastores, Furet du Nord changed its commercial strategy. On 15 October 2009, Furet launched furet.com and began distributing more than a million books on the Web. In mid-September 2010, the eleventh bookstore opened in the Englos-les-G\u00e9ants shopping centre. In June 2011, a new boutique opened in Cit\u00e9 Europe in Coquelles, near Calais. At the end of October 2011, the first Furet du Nord bookstore outside the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region opened; it was in the La Vache-Noire shopping centre, in Arcueil, south of Paris. The brand continued its expansion in the shopping centres of \u00cele-de-France by settling in that of Le Kremlin-Bic\u00eatre, named Okab\u00e9, 16 October 2012. In 2013, the brand returned to Dunkerque, after having left in 2000. It replaced the Virgin Megastore after it went into liquidation.\nFuret du Nord made an offer to purchase the Sauramps bookstore in Montpellier, but on 19 July 2017, the Montpellier tribunal de commerce chose a different offer by Fran\u00e7ois Font\u00e8s, head of Am\u00e9tis, a real estate group specializing in social housing. In 2018, Furet du Nord expanded outside of France with the purchase of Chapitre.be (formerly Agora) which has two stores in Belgium.In November and December 2018, Furet du Nord announced the acquisition of Decitre, which opened up access to the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, in addition to an increased presence on the Internet. This acquisition was formalized on 18 January 2019, making Furet du Nord the fourth largest bookseller in France. The group achieved a turnover of \u20ac82 million in 2018, of which \u20ac52 million is in the book market.\n\n\n== Location of Furet du Nord stores ==\nAs of March 2018, the company owns twenty stores, including thirteen in Hauts-de-France, five in \u00cele-de-France and two in Belgium.\n\n\n=== Shop on the Place de la G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle in Lille ===\n\nSince 1 August 1959, Furet du Nord has been located on the Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle, also called Grand'Place, in the city of Lille.In 1969, the fa\u00e7ade was modified to remove 19th-century additions in order to restore it in its original style of the 18th century. The fa\u00e7ade is inspired by the painting of Fran\u00e7ois Watteau, La Procession de Lille en 1789.Over the years, the store has grown from 200 m2 to 8,000 m2. When the company first moved to the Grand'Place at the location of Galeries Barb\u00e8s, the sales area was 200 m2. At the end of the year, it increased to 600 m2 when the old workshops of the Galeries Barb\u00e8s were removed. At that time the Lille store occupied only the ground floor. In 1976, Furet du Nord moved to the place of the Cinema Le Bellevue and expanded to 4,500 m2, then in 1991 instead of the Hotel Strasbourg and passes to 8,000 m2.In 1974 and 1998, the store received 10,000 daily visits. It is serviced by the Rihour Metro station.\n\n\n=== Open stores ===\n\n\n=== Old stores ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFeller, Jean (1974). \"Rendez-vous au Furet\u2026\".

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Stade Pierre-Mauroy is a multi-use retractable roof stadium in Villeneuve-d'Ascq (M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille), France, that opened in August 2012. It has a seating capacity of 50,186 and is the home stadium of LOSC Lille. Initially named Grand Stade Lille M\u00e9tropole, the stadium was renamed on 21 June 2013, just after the death of the former Mayor of Lille and former Prime Minister of France Pierre Mauroy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before the Grand Stade ===\nIn 1975, LOSC Lille began playing at the Stade Grimonprez-Jooris, a 21,128-seat facility. When the club began to play European Competitions, the venue did not match UEFA standards, prompting the club to play its UEFA Champions League games at the Stade F\u00e9lix-Bollaert, home of rival RC Lens, in 2001. Plans were soon made to build a new stadium which would match UEFA demands, but the project was postponed and finally cancelled due to struggle with preservationists who stated that the location chosen for the new stadium was too close to the 17th Century Citadel.\nThe club, left without a place to play, moved to the Stadium Nord which was smaller than Grimonprez-Jooris (18,154 seats) and did not fulfill UEFA demands. This situation forced the team, who had qualified for 2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League, to play at the Stade de France for its European matches. This solution was abandoned after two young LOSC fans lost their lives when they got hit by an incoming train after a game against Olympique Lyonnais.\n\n\n=== New administration, new project ===\nWhile LOSC was struggling with its stadium problems, the administrative landscape of the Lille area changed. The city was now included in a vast association with its enclosed neighbours, forming the Urban Community of Lille M\u00e9tropole. The new administration, now in charge of the whole area, decided to launch a new stadium project. On 5 December 2006, an industrial bid for a 50,000-seat multi-purpose stadium, able to receive sport competitions, cultural shows and hold seminars, was launched.  The following January, three worldwide construction companies answered the call, each one with ambitious projects:\n\nEiffage: a 50,000-seat capacity multi-purpose stadium, Meeting HQE standards with a retractable roof. The stadium has also a particularity: it can become a fully functional arena of 30,000 seats in only one hour: the Boite \u00e0 spectacle.\nBouygues: The project proposed by the company was highly effective in energy saving. The structure was geothermic and most of its power was produced by Renewable energy. The stadium would have a 50,127-seat capacity.\nVinci: The project proposed by Vinci was the largest of the competition with a 50,921-seat capacity and a retractable roof. It would have been powered by 8000 m\u00b2 of Solar panelsOn February 2008, Eiffage was selected during a general meeting to build the stadium. The contract was officially signed between the two parties on October of the same year. Eiffage was given 45 months to complete the project\n\n\n=== Stadium construction ===\nOn 10 July 2009, Eiffage received the building permit and authorisation to start preparatory works for the construction at the Borne de l'Espoir location in Villeneuve-d'Ascq. In December 2009, the final two cities of the Lille M\u00e9tropole who had yet to sign the building permit joined the project and gave their authorisation. In February 2010, France officially became a candidate to organize the UEFA Euro 2016. The Grand Stade become the symbol of the candidature, boosting its public support. In March 2010, construction of access infrastructure (Subway, Highway, parking lots) began followed one week after by the beginning of the construction of the arena itself. On 28 May 2010, France was officially chosen to organize the Euro 2016. Martine Aubry, who succeeded Pierre Mauroy at the head of LCMU and a big supporter of LOSC and the Grand Stade, expressed her wish to see the Grand Stade given a prominent amount of competition for the upcoming competition. Construction accelerated, with the first brick laid by the Eiffage CEO in September 2010. In 2011, the structure supporting the roof was put in place and constructions of the northern stand was completed by the end of that year. In 2012, the retractable roof, constructed in one piece, was successfully put in place in one day. Despite some legal delays, the stadium was delivered on schedule during the summer of 2012, in time for the 2012\u201313 LOSC season.\n\n\n== The stadium ==\n\n\n=== Cost and financing ===\nThe total cost of the Eiffage project was \u20ac618 million, including \u20ac282 million for the stadium, \u20ac42 million for additional development such as parking, hotels, and restaurants, and \u20ac96 million to ensure seismic standards were met.  This latter requirement was introduced in 2011, following a new law passed in the wake of the massive Japan earthquake and tsunami.  The cost was spread between the city of Lille (\u20ac24.7 million annually for 31 years), the LOSC (\u20ac7.5 million annually) and the Nord-Pas-de-Calais regional council (\u20ac45 million).\nThe cost of the project spurred considerable controversy. On one hand, Martine Aubry and her First Deputy Pierre de Saintignon, in charge of the project, highlighted the Grand Stade as \"a splendid ambassador of the technologies of our region, and a great tool of attractivity\".  On the other hand, opponents pointed to a lack of long term viability, since part of the public investments were bound to sporting events, whose results are of random nature. This could lead to some new kind of toxic loans.\n\n\n=== Multiple floor features ===\n\nStade Pierre-Mauroy has two floors or main levels. The full stadium level or Grand Stade reaches a height of 31 m (101 feet) and has a total capacity of 50,186 seats including 4,965 business seats, 1,842 luxury-box seats, 448 protocol seats and 326 reserved for the press.\nThe stadium has also a peculiarity: half of the Grand Stade field is situated on hydraulics lift and massive tracks that raise and slide it above the other half of the field in three hours. This creates a second lower level floor plan and surrounding seats called Bo\u00eete \u00e0 Spectacles, where basketball, tennis or music shows can take place. The Bo\u00eete \u00e0 Spectacles can be configured to have a variable capacity, from 6,900 to 30,000 seats. In November 2014, it hosted the 2014 Davis Cup finals between France and Switzerland, where an attendance record was broken for the highest-ever officially sanctioned competition tennis match. In 2017 it hosted the Davis Cup final again.\n\nIn addition, Stade Pierre-Mauroy has a retractable roof which opens and shuts in 15 minutes. The stadium is also recognised as a HQE Building with solar panels and two windmills to provide as electrical supply. The stadium is fully accessible by metro stations and road and includes 7,000 parking spaces.\n\n\n=== Tenants ===\nThe Grand Stade received a five-star UEFA ranking. It is expected to significantly increase the revenue streams of Lille OSC, its tenant club.\nThe stadium hosted its first rugby union Test match on 17 November 2012 during the 2012 Autumn Internationals, when France defeated Argentina 39\u201322.\n\n\n== EuroBasket 2015 matches ==\nThe knock-out phase of EuroBasket 2015 was held at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy from 12\u201320 September 2015, including the Final. The indoor configuration of the stadium has a capacity of 27,000.\n\n\n== UEFA Euro 2016 matches ==\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the UEFA Euro 2016, and held the following matches:\n\n\n== Concerts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStade Pierre-Mauroy",

          "Great stadium and great occasion, but chronic parking. Booked car into official stadium car park (building B1). After returneing to the car, it was an hour and a half before it was worth turning on the engine. As we were on the top floor, all the other floors had to empty first",

          "There are a number of reasons to be impressed with this stadium. First of all access in and out is far quicker than any other stadium of its size I've visited. I pre-booked parking and it was easy to park and only took 10 minutes to get out of the car park. There were no traffic",

          "We were treated to an amazing game for our Euro 2016 experience. Despite being high up within the stadium the views were exceptional. The stadium is modern and looks great. The only minor issue was that we were ushered out of the stadium and had to walk a particular way out",

          "Had to go 3 times during Euro 2016. It is a brand new stadium with comfortable seats and good viewing. The retractable roof is very useful. However, pitch was in bad condition, access far too linited due to security which meant we struggled to enter the stadium. Finally, i had",
          "I took my son here to see Germany play the Ukraine in the Euros. What a great stadium and atmosphere. Although quite away from the town it is easily reached by the Metro. You then have to walk to the stadium which is about 10 minutes. The stadium is impressive from the outside,",
          "Great place to watch football. Not that easy to get to as quite a way out of Lille. Metro provides good and regular service however. Getting into stadium was a shambles but that is because UEFA were in charge of security etc.",
          "Overall a good experience however getting into the stadium was a bit slow due to the extra security in place for the competition. Once inside the stadium, it was easy and quick to get to our seats. Not much of a queue at the refreshment stands. During the game, sellers come",

          "We went to see Germany v Ukraine in Euro 2016. The stadium is miles from the town but well worth the trip. Architecturally it's impressive from the outside, and the inside is very good. Our seats had good views of the match, I could see no seats that had restrictive views.",
          "Difficult to believe the capacity was 50,000 as one felt pretty close to the pitch and part of the action. Did not see sliding roof in operation, but all round throughly impressed. Travelled by Metro from city centre and would recommend this option.",
          "OK, all over I am glad because Germany won 2:0 ;-) BUT , safety checks have been at a seriously low level. Next to this, food was of terrible quality at high price. These high prices are fully normal at these events, but you are really disappointed paying high prices for that",
          "Really impressive stadium. Fantastic architecture and design has gone in to it, making the outside of the stadium absolutely amazing. The inside is just as good, with not a single restricted view seat. Everywhere you seat gives you a great view. Hence why it has been chosen for",
          "Avid Lille fan and stadium goer, I can tell you this is an amazing stadium. Security has been reinforced following the terrorist attacks and you can only expect it's gonna get worse for the Euro. I suggest to get there at least 1.30 hour earlier for big games. Of course you can",
          "nice view from everywhere, whichever sport you're watching - soccer, tennis, basketball or concerts - it's easy to get to and well organized - down sides: it's always windy and cold in there and food is expensive and of low quality",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Louvre-Lens is an art museum located in Lens, France, approximately 200 kilometers north of Paris. It displays objects from the collections of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre that are lent to the gallery on a medium- or long-term basis. The Louvre-Lens annex is part of an effort to provide access to French cultural institutions for people who live outside of Paris. Though the museum maintains close institutional links with the Louvre, it is primarily funded by the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Ministry of Culture and the Louvre Directorate launched a plan, in 2003, to build a Louvre satellite museum in one of the 22 Regions of France. Only the Nord pas de Calais applied for the museum and proposed six cities: Lille, Lens, Valenciennes, Calais, B\u00e9thune and Boulogne-sur-Mer. In 2004, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, then French Prime Minister, announced Lens as the recipient city.The museum site was chosen in hopes of reversing the fortunes of the depressed Lens mining community, which was devastated by both World Wars and the Nazi occupation, and suffered multiple mining catastrophes including the Courri\u00e8res mine disaster, the worst in European history, and a 1974 tragedy killing 42 miners. The last mine in Lens closed in 1986, which caused the unemployment rate to rise well above the French national average. \"France abandoned us when the coal stopped, and we became a ghost town\", said Pas-de-Calais president Daniel Percheron.Officials took inspiration from the economic transformation of the Spanish industrial city of Bilbao, which was caused, in part, by the construction of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao satellite (dubbed the \"Bilbao effect\", though some cautioned that the comparison is limited due to the much smaller population of Lens, and its lack of other tourist attractions.) Some Lens locals were critical of the project; they felt that the project to bring culture to their city was \"patronizing\". Other critics pointed out that the museum makes no attempt to address Lens's turbulent history or its current economic difficulties.A worldwide design contest was won by Japanese architectural firm SANAA in collaboration with New York firm Imrey Culbert, French landscape architect Catherine Mosbach, and museographer Studio Adrien Gard\u00e8re. The Louvre-Lens Museum, SANAA + Imrey Culbert's first building in France, was awarded the Prix d'architecture de l'Equerre d'Argent for 2013.The Louvre-Lens is near several World War memorials, including the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in Vimy, approximately 15 minutes from the Louvre-Lens.\n\n\n== Museum ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe museum is built on a 20-hectare (49-acre) mining site that closed in the 1960s. The area is slightly elevated due to filling in of the mine. To make the building blend into the surrounding area, the architects designed a string of five low-profile structures; the central one is square with glass walls and the others are rectangular with polished, aluminum facades that gave a blurry reflection of the surroundings. Altogether, the museum is 360 m (1,180 ft) long and contains 28,000 m2 (300,000 sq ft) of exhibition space.\nThe design of a central building flanked by two wings mimics the Paris Louvre. The square, central building is the main reception area. It contains several curved glass rooms that contain a cafeteria, bookstore and museum boutique. To the east of the entry hall is the 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) Galerie du Temps which houses approximately 200 items from the Paris Louvre collection. The items in the large, open hall are arranged chronologically, from 3,500 BC to the mid-19th century, regardless of style or country of origin. Beyond the Galerie du Temps is the Pavillon de Verre which exhibits works from neighboring museums. The building to the west of the entry hall is a gallery for temporary exhibits (the Exhibitions Temporaires) and, beyond that, an auditorium. \n\n\n=== Temporary exhibits ===\nThe Exhibitions Temporaires is dedicated to exhibits which last 3 months. The first exhibition, titled Renaissance, included Leonardo da Vinci's recently restored The Virgin and Child with St. Anne. The second exhibit was dedicated to Rubens and included 170 of his works.\n\n\n== Inauguration, opening and visitors ==\nOn Dec 4, 2012, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, alongside first lady Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, the Minister of Culture Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti, the director of Le Louvre Henri Loyrette, the mayor of Lens Guy Delcourt, and former prime ministers Lionel Jospin and Pierre Mauroy officially opened the Louvre-Lens. The following weekend, the museum welcomed its first visitors; three weeks after the opening, the museum welcomed its 100,000th visitor. In May 2013, during Long Night of Museums 2013, 500,000 visitors viewed the masterpieces displayed in the Louvre-Lens Museum. While 700,000 visitors were anticipated for the first year (while admission was free), the year's final tally was approximately 900,000.On Feb 7 2013, a woman vandalized a major masterpiece of the museum, Liberty Guiding the People, writing \"AE911\" on it with a black marker, possibly a reference to a group calling itself \"Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth\". The painting has been fully restored.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nImages and profile at Specifier Magazine\nTravel article about the museum",

          "I have wanted to stop here for some time, and am happy that I did. The main Galerie du Temps is a really clever concept. You walk through time starting in 4000bc and ending in about 1800. They have picked really interesting Eurasian art across the eras (and fascinating that",
          "This may be an off shoot of the Louvre in Paris but it's completely unique. The main gallery is breath taking and the artefacts beautifully displayed, allowing you to wander through time from one end of the hall to the other. There was an additional Polish art and photography",
          "What a great place! Bits of the Louvre in Paris have been transported here to a vast hangar-like building. Admission is free, there is a good little cafe, parking is also free with a bit of a walk. The 2 euro programme walks the visitor through from ancient Egypt to modern",
          "Oh my, what a wonderful museum this is and what a total surprise. Modern, daring, spacious with a good and very well thought of collection that gives a good impression of (a whopping) 5000 years of civilisation and it's art. You can stroll around in the one large hall and see",
          "Been here for the third year in a row, specially for the Homer exhibition. Still every time new experiences. Very unique items. And glass house has talented promissing artists.",
          "Very friendly staff helping out in this very modern museum. A timeline is showing where the different pieces belong in different cultures. Multi-language audio-guides at disposal. Shame that at our visit the museum was invaded by a few buses of children, at the same time",
          "Fantastic! Perfect size for kids. Great collection and well thought out displays. Cafe great too and had picnic area indoors and outdoors.",
          "We had a very entertaining afternoon here, I loved the sculptures in particular. The layout is chronological, spanning over 5000 years so there is a wide variety of art, artefacts and sculptural works, plus some multi-media installations such as video films. There is also a",
          "What a spectacular museum! The exhibits themselves - art and sculpture through the millennia, the way they are displayed and the building they are displayed in are all spectacular. And its free - donation optional!! Easy access from the Autoroute des Anglais - follow the signs -",
          "Yes, it is not like the Louvre in Paris and yes, it is quite compact, but the actual concept and approach are great. Rather than being overwhelmed by miles and miles of galleries, here you can easily complete the permanent exhibition in a couple of hours. Though there may not be",
          "A fun annex to the Louvre off the beaten path. Great and interesting architecture with very cool interactive stuff in the basement. The audio guided tour of the special exhibit \"Amour\" was fascinating and the art was great. The shop is great. One caveat, the cafe seems to",

          "Not only was it impossible to find the car park (the sign pointed in the wrong direction) but matters worsened when we arrived at the caf\u00e9 at 13.15 only to find there was NO food. We purchased some already sliced baguette and 4 hot drinks for EUR19.10 (rip off), had to go back",
          "The main permanent exhibit is awesome. It is a trip through the history of art from ancient times to about the 1800\u2019s with the most beautiful examples of art from the relevant periods and regions. It is a great opportunity to learn and see. I highly recommend it to anyone with",
          "The set-up of the main room in the museum is a travel through time and cultures from archaeological objects thousands of years old to paintings made near the French revolution. The room, or rather hall, is fairly large, but in all this is a rather small museum. On the plus side,",
          "The architect and landscapers have done their best to make the Louvre Lens impressive from the outside. You may (like me) see it and think \"it's huge, this is going to take ages\". Do not fear, you will be out in under an hour as there isn't much to see of any interest. To be",

          "Lovely museum which has permanent and temporary exhibitions. I paid 5 euros (ticket for student) to visit both exhibitions. However, it was not very easy to find the museum because signs were not very accurate. Besides, the road is not very attractive when you pass the stadium.",

          "My friend & I travelled from Lille to visit the Lens Louvre. We walk from the station & easily followed the signage. It is however longer than the signage outlines. The museum is located on a large area of parklands & I think the signage probably only reflects the time it takes",
          "What an awful visitor experience, this is a terrible way to receive visitors and tourists, it looks like they want to stop people reaching the museum. I arrived at the train station (good and easy train from Lille), couldn\u2019t find a sign showing how to get to the museum, there",

          "If you can\u2019t make it to Paris to see the original, this small museum in northern France is well worth a visit. The permanent collection features a variety of pieces spanning different cultures and different eras. Kids will love the audio guide that has them participating in a",
          "Went to visit the Loyvre-Lens museum after hearing many local people speak highly of it. I can understand that if you live locally and do not have access to other museums this must be a great place to visit. However... It really isn't worth the visit unless you're stuck",
          "The Louvre - Lens is a must visit for the extraordinary setting, the fabulous architecture and the museum organisation based on the time line. We were a group of architects, culture tourists and engineers from the US, France, China and loved the experience. We also benefitted",
          "Wasnt sure what to expect, the parking appeared to be for the restaurant so i just parked on the street, entry was free but you still need a ticket, most exhibits are Roman and Egyptian with the rest being European Medieval. I felt the museum needs that one special exhibit to",
          "We visited the Louvre Lens this Sunday morning and enjoyed it. Directions to the museum are easy however the roads and villages leading to it do not do it justice. The parking is big enough and limited to cars under 2m in height. You will then need to walk for about 10-15",
          "We had wanted to visit this for some years and we were not disappointed. The building is amazing, very grand and spacious and there is a good collection of items available to view, everything from Egyptian artifacts to paintings.",

          "We had high expectations, as it is called Petit Louvre. There were several nice pieces of art (El Greco, Raphael, etc). But somehow it was eclectic. Music and instruments in art looked it was set up for experts in this field. Fro outside the building looked quite nice, but",
          "Tried to visit, but arriving at the parking site we saw that it is limited to 2m. There is no information about alternatives posted at that location. On the website (that is not usable for mobile!) there is also no information about campervan parking. After fruitlessly searching",
          "Paid a visit one afternoon to Louvre-Lens, an initiative of arts displaced from Paris to this once-dying city. Lens was once a thriving mining town which went through rough times I read, since unemployment rose and the mines had closed. This is an outstanding example of how city",

          "There's a lot that could be said about this amazing little off-shoot of the Louvre. First some practicalities. It's not hard to find;9 Rue Paul Bert will get you to the main entrance, but I can imagine parking might be difficult at times as there doesn't seem to be the large",
          "How fantastic to find a treasure trove of art and culture tucked away in a small French town. Set in an old mine, it was also a good opportunity to learn about the culture of the industry and the lives of the miners as we walked the long path to the museum. What a beautifully",
          "Most people know that the Louvre, perhaps the World's best known museum, is in Paris, but judging by the lack of numbers when we visited the Louvre at Lens in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, it was clear that this museum has yet to be discovered. Opened in 2012 the museum stands on the",
          "Very disappointing to see the name Louvre associated with this heteroclyte 'collection'. A few nice pieces (the Mithras), and a couple of 7th class Rubens (no doubt painted by his janitor or so when his apprentices were off to the pub)...but this is not a museum, it is a",
          "To start with, the architecture is just great (Japanese architects Cabinet SANAA), allowing to the superb light of the north to flow in generously even on lesser sunny days. The museum offers both: 1) an intelligent 2 to 3 hours walk across time and civilisation back to",
          "Inside this stunning piece of modern architecture is a very informative museum which is laid out in chronological order. It takes some time to wander round the museum, but we found the way it laid out the passage of time and what was happening in the various areas of the world,",
          "Have driven across northern France many times and never managed to stop, so at last we took a day, stopped in Arras and went to visit the museum. I thought I was going to be disappointed but was definitely not. Not only was it free, there were hardly any people. It was",
          "Situated on a former mining site, this museum gives you a strange twist of how to handle industrial heritage, but there is abundant left around in the city of Lens.The whole town breathes charcoal. So it is interesting to see a clean and formalistic complex of metal and glass",
          "Well signposted from the edge of Lens, superb car parking and attractive gardens to walk through for 5 minutes up to the museum. The building is all glass - incredible. Inside it's ultra-modern and free (except for some special exhibitions). The whole experience is equal to the",
          "This was the midpoint for a classic car rally so we really had no choice about stopping here. Unfortunately the cafe was not sufficiently staffed to cope with the influx of people but we all queued patiently for about 30 minutes and the food was very fresh. The exhibition was",
          "Call me naive, but from reading all the guidebooks I expected a glass pyramid. Nope. That said, it was a great art gallery and museum with audio guides in several languages for four euros. We biked there, following signs from Lens centre and ended up taking a circuitous route",
          "Absolutely outstanding. You have 2 parts, when we went there was a painting exposition and a part with antiques from The Louvre. All is well explained and detailed. There is a lot of space and this is good as you can you around each antique without being in a crowd. The price is",
          "This is a wonderful museum made all the more remarkable by its position in a vast grim landscape where slag heaps dominate the horizon. I will never hforget some of the exhibits I saw in the gallery demonstrating objets d'art throughout history. A great overview in a highly",
          "mmmm .... what to say about a shiny museum surrounded by coal-terrils ... Amidst a genuine urban fabric of workman-houses ... Sanaa did a fine job ... the \"gallery of time\" is a marvelous experience .. did a few times now ... feels fresh every time ... the space is fantastic ..",

          "There were many objects and varied art pieces to see and enjoy, with lots of space, as it was a quiet day. I liked the history of humanity from about 4000 bc to almost the present day - very unique and how it was displayed as a timeline. The shop is also lovely with a variety of",

          "Wonderful: building and setting are amazing, collection is minimalistic but spot on and the approach is educationally top. One comment: it is hard to find by car and even harder to find the right parking entrance.",
          "Every part just the same as the home museum in Louvre, Paris. Parking dreadful. But it's well worth the long walk if you can't park nearby.",
          "Unique. Inspiring. Architecturally a must see. Free! But make a donation, it's worth it. Easy parking.",
          "Though this museum lacked a lot of big names like larger museums have, but we enjoyed having the variety of items in a compact area. Sometimes big museums feel completely overwhelming; at the Louvre-Lens, we got to see a lot of variety but not have the mass of 100 items from",
          "Interesting changing collection well displayed in a chronological time line. One big main hall displays everything so rather than walk through rooms, you can wind and weave your way from side to side. Good lighting. Most objects displayed in the round. Predominantly sculpture",
          "Ample free parking in the proximity of the museum. Very quiet on a Monday morning. The building is an interesting low-rise, more of a glamourous warehouse. The intention of the architects looks obvious, some nice features in glass and shiny metals, but it lacks soul and spirit.",
          "Very modern equipped museum! It is not huge but very useful especially for the children who start to learn about history. Amazing guides and not to forget - free admission! plenty of free parking sports around this museum. Very much recommended.",
          "I can't recommend this gallery enough. Was there last week on a visit from Lille and it was one of the most important art gallery experiences of my life. It was incredibly well designed. Loads of space between the exhibits. Explanations in three languages - (note to most of the",

          "This fabulous new architect-designed gallery goes back to first principles of museum design. Each exhibit has its own space and you can walk around them to appreciate them from every angle. The space is flooded with light, and there is a Timeline on the wall so that you can",
          "A kind of bright UFO in the suburb of gloomy Lens. Building itself is very nice, neat design.. Permanent collections, from Louvre in Paris, are showed in pure chronological order in one great room, very interesting. Nice pieces of art, not too much. No temporary exhibition",
          "Use an audioguide or a smartphone, you will understand a lot on art history. In the Galerie du Temps, you are going to meet 200 masterpieces of mankind from the begining to the XX\u00b0century. You will be closer to these splendid paintings and sculptures you've never been and you",
          "A modern steel and glass edifice which did not impress me- and I like modern architecture. It's surrounded by a vast open space with a few trees and scrubby plants in them. Not a pleasant site. Car parks are outside its perimeter, unless you visit the restaurant within the",

          "Really worthwhile overview of (mainly European) art with a marvellous temporary expedition bout Charles le Brun.",
          "Today we drove over to Lens to see the Charles Le Bron exhibition at the museum. This is a wonderfully modern building and it is extremely user-friendly. There are several hundred paintings in this exhibition. The painter was the main court artist of Louis XIV. We decided to",
          "Louvre Lens is an interesting piece of architecture in itself, built on top of an old quarry and contrasting with the woodlands surrounding it, most probably putting many people off. We liked it, though, and our only reservations concerned the landscaping around the building",

          "It was our first visit to Louvre Lens. An amazing place - so much wonderful artifacts from a spans of more than 4000 years! Placed in a beautiful, new park. All built on a former, large coal works. Now on Unesco's world heritage list. Lens itself is not very interesting, but",

          "I had a very pleasant, sunny walk from Lens railway station to the Louvre-Lens and was pleased to discover when I arrived that it was free of charge in the most part. A very modern building but not too imposing on the landscape. There are plenty of antiquities on display, which",
          "Visited there on the occasion of Euro 2016. No regrets. The time hall, meaning the main gallery, is astonishing. Gems from the Louvre in Paris taking another dimension and life in this huge, long, and airy modern gallery that gives each piece additional value. A pleasure for the",
          "Really interesting museum in enormous modern building. Only downside was long walk to get there. Signs said 5 mins - more like 20. Free to get in. Well worth a visit.",
          "A worthy regeneration project, and the permanent gallery is a masterpiece, as is the building itself. But, sad to say - more staff there than visitors, unable to get the campervan into the car park despite the fact there are dedicated parking bays for campers inside, and a",
          "I had a few hours to myself whilst my daughter watched the Euro 2016 match. I had a lovely walk up a country style lane full of flowers on my way to the museum. It was very modern with very polite and friendly staff. I looked at the free exhibitions which were very interesting,",
          "Louvre Lens is a beautiful museum where you can experience objects from about 3500 year BC until 1850. A beautiful building with architectural highlights. Buildings with feng shui experience. Every Januari 25% of the objects are changed. At the moment there is a temporary",
          "Really good museum. The main (semi-permanent) exhibit was really well thought out. It is laid out according to time, meaning that you start with the Egyptian and Mesopotamian art and travel through time until you get to Napoleon. The room is beautiful, and we had a fantastic",
          "This outpost of the Louvre is excellent. The way the exhibits are arranged in date order makes it easily accessible for young people learning about the devopment of art. There re some very interesting pieces. The audio and visual guide is well worth the 3 euro cost. The museum",
          "Lens, within striking distance of Calais, is a city once rich from coal-mining but badly damaged in both World Wars. Louvre-Lens opened in 2012 on the outskirts of the city, and it is well worth visiting. The museum is a striking glass pavilion, set on the rise of a former",

          "Simple-looking building from the outside. The collection was reasonably various. Paintings, artifacts, sculptures are there to enjoy. History lover, this is the place for you.",
          "The design of the Louvre-Lens building is spectacular and we couldn't believe that the entrance fee was free. The layout of the large exhibit hall is amazing as you begin with early artefacts from Egypt to the 19th century. Artefacts, sculptures, paintings, ceramics, etc. are",
          "We were a little pushed for time so only saw the special exhibition of the art of the era of Madame du Pompadour, but the museum is fabulous. The design itself is light and airy and there are excellent facilities. I would definitely like to visit again.",
          "Easy to go - by shuttle bus. Great experience, with audio guide even better. Beautiful pieces of artworks that will blow your mind.",
          "Walking through this gallery reminds us of the human need for artistic impression, however poorly documented this might be through the medium of writing. This is the history of man's commitment to visual beauty, strength and fear set out in readily comprehensible form. Well",

          "Lens is such an unprepossessing town, the Louvre-Lens comes as quite a surprise. It is a 20-25 minute walk from the town centre and is a modern building of concrete and glass, which is stark and uninviting from the outside, but spacious and easy once you are inside. The",
          "A lot smaller than the 'real' Louvre but possibly the better for it! Instead of being set out geographically eg all Egyptian exhibits togethor, it is set up more on a timeline. Really interesting to see what different cultures were producing at different times. On a rolling",

          "We decided to go to the Louvre-Lens from Paris because we wanted to see the building, and we also did not want to join the crowds at the Louvre with young children. The permanent collection was displayed in an impressive way, and the volume was just right for our visit. Our",

          "A brilliant exhibition and great use of space, not only within the main gallery, but also the reuse of an otherwise former industrial site. The exhibits exceptionally well chosen to represent different aspects from the main collection in Paris. What I was personally more",
          "The 'Galerie de Temps' displays artefacts from 3000 BC to the 19th century in a continuous timeline in one huge room. It provides a superb insight into the development of the various 'civilisations' over that time. If you can understand french, the 'Behind the Scenes' tour at",
          "The building is a modern contemporary design and displays are well placed, well lit and are varied. As you walk through, you start with very early art and then progress in time into more modern art. They tell a story of art design development.",
          "One thing is for sure : yes, the museum is very nice with a very nice collection of art. But the food of the restaurant that is located on the premise of the museum is art as well. Make sure you go have lunch there!! Not cheap but very high quality food absolutely great! I love",
          "This was a disappointment. Very difficult to find (badly signposted) but reached thanks to a pair of satnavs, the carpark is quite a long way from the main building. Luckily it was not raining, as there is absolutely no cover. The building is functional, modern and rather",
          "First the place is hard to find -we parked near a modern building we thought was the museum-it was the stadium! Ten minutes walk (go straight, do not yield to the temptation of turning left at any point...) and we reached the place. From the outside it has no volumes -nothing",
          "This is a stunning collection, brilliantly displayed in a wonderful new building - with an excellent restaurant on the same site. Go for lunch, park at the restaurant, walk 100m to the gallery and have the afternoon of your life! Well worth a special trip.",

          "The basic is that you walk through the history of five cultures. I personally missed the Chinese history. But it is a real other than books encounter of history. You can not have this experience on your computer. I already visited the Louvre Lens Twice and I still want to go.",
          "The first reason to visit the museum was of because of its architecture and the urban planning. the building is indeed very nice and excellent for a museum. The entrance building is art on itself whereby the galleries have perfect lighting but allow you to focus on the art",
          "Louvre lens is a good free museum (at least it was free when I visit it). It's layout is a big plus, you see the \"permanent collection\" in one huge room and it is organized chronologically, so, it becomes clear the change of style through time. If you are visiting Lille, it is",
          "We were not allowed to bring our 2 year old into the Louvre in a child carrying back pack. Pushchairs and forward facing child carriers are permitted. So we checked the back pack into the (free!) cloak room and sallied forth with our tired 2 year old.... She was (honestly)",
          "This museum was designed by reknowned Japanese architect SANAA, and plays with the concept of inside v.s. outside. The experience begins at the train station - Lens is 1hr north from Paris - and winds through a lovely wooded park to the museum. The architect's touch is present",
          "We decided to visit en route to Calais from Burgundy as it seemed a short detour from the motorway - or should have been! Unfortunately, the few signs there are lead you to a car park some 10-15 minutes walk from the museum. In a triumph of style over practicality, the path to",
          "The choice of Lens by the French cultural authorities to open a Louvre annexe may appear odd: the town is a rather drab coal mining town near Lille in the north of France. To get there requires a little effort (especially without GPS) but the museum is well worth the effort.",
          "Four of us were having a short break in Pas de Calais and found out about this Louvre satellite. We spend a very interesting, informative and pleasing 2 to 3 hours here, coming away impressed. I've long been aware that the French do some things extraordinarily well, and",
          "This is a fascinating exhibition that in effect presents the evolution of art from the beginning of history to the present day by exhibiting selected items from the Louvre collection. Entrance is free, but strangely you have to queue up at the ticket office for your free",
          "Do not let the outside of this building put you off. It is amazing inside. Part of the exhibition is free to view during 2015 and this is the best bit of the exhibition. The staff are very friendly and helpful and speak good English. There is car parking but is a good 5-10",
          "I could easily have spent 3 hours in the Louvre of Lens. The chronological way all objects were displayed in a time line makes a visit very educational and efficient. I loved the audio - all galleries should have these.",
          "I can't say I was hugely excited by the art element (which makes me sound like a philistine) because there wasn't a great deal of rhyme and reason to what's there - this is, after all, an overflow of the Paris museum - but despite being packed full of ancient artifacts, this is",

          "The Louvre have regenerated this old mining town, bringing an exhibition of the utmost beauty to the Nor pas de Calais. The glass building floats as if on air and inside the exhibition takes you through air from 3500 BCE to about 1930. And what is more it is FREE",
          "An inspiring gallery that is organised by time rather than object. They had a good range of ceramics. I loved seeing a Bernard Pallissey up close and personal. The reduced lustre was also a real treat. Well designed. Easy to navigate and great information. A Must see -",
          "Miles from the station, this ugly long tin can with weeds out front, a restaurant that closes at 2 30 and an over priced cafe with one woman serving a mile of hungry tourists, and who takes forever, this dump for the Louvre's unwanted rubbish is one to keep well away from. Lens",
          "We stopped on a whim, en route from Calais to further south and are glad we did. The exhibits are arranged intelligently and with lots of information...the staff at the desk are very helpful and the building itself is architecturally stunning. Next time we will eat in the cafe,",

          "Definitely one of the best museums we have visited. Location is great and the internal organisation and itinerary permits an easy flow of the visitors. The museum has an incredible selection of pieces which are very well displayed and explained. Some exhibits are inter-active.",
          "Louvre Lens is a hypermodern small museum built on a coal mine in the formerly well-off but now rather dilapidated city of Lens. The construction is a little like an airport with a central hall completely in glass and two wings, one for special expositions and one permanent",

          "2500 BC to the modern times in an airy, modern layout. Art works from Bronze Age Egypt, classical Roman, Gothic and modern Europe in a stunning modernist setting. This is not a stuffy art gallery - it is an example of how archaeology, architecture and art can be combined to",
          "Louvre Lens is a new way of wandering through history. In a huge, modern hall one starts on 3500 bc and every step you make, the visitor makes a leap in history until 1900. At every era, different cultures are set together. An excellent way of seeing how art influenced art.",
          "As a seasoned gallery visitor, it was with embarrassment that this gem had passed me by. Sitting next to the football stadium it is a stunning building that is incongruous with the drive through town. On entry, it's a bit confusing as you have to get a ticket even though entry",
          "This gallery is glorious - a shiningly beautiful piece of architecture (the light and space inside is luminous) in a sad and depressed area of Northern France. And the layout of the gallery is so imaginative and original. The idea of a timeline - so you look in 'bands' at art",
          "It is nice to see art from the Louvre in the north. some permanent exhibitions and some changing. all of them inspiring and impressive. If you have 2-4 hours free do not miss this museum",
          "Great place to spend an afternoon if you like checking out museums . Added bonus its free until december 2014.",
          "It is a very interesting and original approach by the Japanese architects. The shiny metal constantly provides different reflections both outside and inside the museum. The items that are exhibited per time period rather that by style make fora better historic understanding.",
          "It's interesting enough to build a gallery over a pit head where the mine underneath would have been arranged in, well, galleries. In one respect it's an enormous long shiny metal shed, in another it's a way to lay out art in a time line that compares what was going on in the",

          "We went last Sept 1st. There was not much people and we took our time. Although in a much smaller scale than that of Paris, it's still worth the visit. Highly recommended for those coming to Nord/Pas de Calais. The carpark is not in the museum grounds, I suggest that visitors",

          "One large space complete with 'tate' style ramp containing a range of artefacts from the pharaohs to 18th century, with the theme of 'France' dominating. The whole site is unfinished and appears to have run out of money. A museum in the traditional sense. The modern art museum",
          "Since the opening of this museum was announced in December 2012, i was looking for an opportunity to visit it, as i previoulsy went to see its parent museum in Paris. making quick calculations, i decided that is worth a day trip across the Channel so i got a good return day rate",
          "Entry to this superb new museum is free till December 2013. It's been built on the site of one of Lens' huge coal slagheaps and is a wonderful inspiring building, packed with treasures of art. Beautifully designed and easy to walk around in, the lobby area has inner glass rooms",
          "We really enjoyed our visit, the exhibits are so well layed out and displayed. It is all in date order, starting with ancient Egyptian and finishing with Renaissance. Not too big a collection - we didn't come out feeling overwhelmed as we did when visiting the Louvre in Paris",
          "Although the surroundings of the museum are not yet ready it is a must to visit it if you can in 2013. You don't have to pay for the permanent collection in 2013. What I liked is that subscriptions are translated in not only in english and german but also in flemish.",

          "Definitely worth the trip from Paris. If you love art, architecture and are looking for a day of big ideas and deep thoughts, this is your place. The way the building was constructed does everything possible to distance itself from the secretive nature of it's sister, the Louvre",

          "This museum is soooo worth the trip! The permanent collection (free access till end 2013) is superb. Judging from the quality of Egyptian art (which I am most familiar with), this gallery is a collection of master pieces. Altough there were a LOT of people at once visiting, you",

          "Lens is frankly not the most attractive place to visit, but I suspect that the entire city will be gradually transformed now that the lovely Louvre-Lens is open. The grounds - a former coal mine - are still under construction, but are already full of interest, and the building",
          "I went on 12 December 2012, the first day the Louvre Lens was open to the public. The permanent exhibition (free until the end of 2013) is beautifully laid out in a huge, wide and light hall. Instead of bombarding visitors the exhibition concentrates on quality and theme."

          "Great way to spend you Sunday morning, while exploring this interesting market where you can find, and taste, all sorts of local stuff. Try croissaints in the main hall, they are amazing.",
          "The Wazemmes neighbourhood feels a bit Berlin-meets-Camden. Rough and raw. The marketplace was closed when I was there. But I can imagine it being lively.",
          "We visited on a Thursday, when the outside market is open as well as the indoor market. We got the metro to Gambetta, then it is only a two minute walk to the market itself. The streets surrounding the market are full of bars, cafes and local shops. The area has a completely",
          "What a cultural experience ..... a sea of colours and smells, local produce and ethnic foods. Great experience, some bargains to be had. Be aware it gets very very busy. We got the metro from central Lille to Wazemmes and walked back.",
          "I wasn't looking out for it. It was just something I stumbled upon when walking aimlessly in Lille, slightly further away from the usual trail. It's full of everyday ethnic wares- including some tat. Nothing in particular that is spectacular there but I always enjoy just seeing",
          "Reading through earlier reviews by some others, I\u2019m at a loss as to what they expected to find at a real city market. To draw comparison with the foodie stalls at \u2018concert\u2019 in old Lille is somewhat unhelpful, as they are two distinctly different types of market. I have visited",
          "I've posted reviews for this market already but want to add more. Mostly because I am totally mystified by comments here that it is unsafe, full of immigrants, dangerous, and a place no woman should go alone. Balderdash! I am 72 years old, travel by myself and need to use a",
          "The market was crowded. Everything is cheaper than in the supermarket. That goes the same about their quality. For sure it was not a typical French market as it was full mostly by immigrants",
          "Half the hall was empty.Agree with all other disappointed reviewers. Stale Spring Rolls and the like. Depressed economically poor atmosphere. Not like a Paris Market. Unusual for France. A long walk to get to and a waste of time. Grubby poor immigrant area.",

          "We went on a Sunday morning. There were many stalls and it was very busy. Nothing spectacular just worth a quick walk around.",
          "Not worth a visit at all, there are nicer markets in Lille. The french authenticity is not seen here and the market is full of immigrants etc. We visited the market for approximately 5 minutes. Not worth a visit.",
          "I would safely say that this market is not worth the time or effort myself and my boyfriend took to visit. The tourist office may boast of it as a landmark market. But we visited the market in the old town, which was delight. Full of amazing food stalls, beautiful restaurants",
          "The Lille office of Tourism called this 'the best and largest market of north France.' Well, guess they where boasting a bit. The market was okay, but not amazing or something. Lot of locals. Virtually no tourists. Unknown to us, the marker building was closed. Take the metro",
          "Worthless tat, crazy hordes of people, nothing special or unique. Literally packs of batteries, random sweets and deodorant. We left after walking through as fast as we could out the other side.",

          "We went there on Sunday morning. This place is really huge and you can find different stalls selling so many things. We went to the covered place and were happy to find local cheeses and persons who were able to explain all about the products they were selling. Does not stop at",
          "We visited the market on a Sunday morning. Its enormous with stalls all along the streets & a covered market hall. Thousands of people fill the streets which is a little stressful but I always felt safe. Easy to get to on the Metro from 4 Canton in Lille, free parking at the",
          "Just avoid this market especially if you have kids you don't have a man with you. The atmosphere is terrifying, beggars asking for money that physically grab your arm. You need to take your wallet off your trousers if you are a gentlemen and keep it in the safest place you",

          "Went on a Thursday where it claimed to be open 8am to 8pm but teh outside was all closing down at 2pm. Easy to get to on Metro but in a bit of a dodgy area of the city, drug sellers apparent on street corners, also very bog standard market, stalls outside selling veg and cheap",
          "Wazemmes market is fun. Good for food (meat - lots of chicken being roasted around the edge of the market, cheese, seafood and fresh fruit and vegetables etc.), cheap essentials and clothing. Lots of repetitive stalls selling exactly the same things, but this is normal. Stay",
          "A lovely market for fresh produce. The indoor part has excellent cheese, meat, fish and fruit plus some great street food stalls. Outside is more like a flea market. We never felt threatened at all but like most towns and cities in France has its fair share of beggars. Take",
          "I visited the market on Saturday so there was no outdoor market, only indoor. This is a small but very nice market to get local food product.",
          "Well worth a visit. Inside is great for foodies with excellent stalls for meat, seafood, fish, cheese, etc. as well as outside street food. The market spills out onto neighbouring streets and you can buy fresh fruit vegetables and herbs as well as clothing, shoes and",
          "The Marche de Wazemmes is a log of fun - people shopping for new second-hand goods or clothes, bric a brac, having coffee or a beer with friends, buying bunches of fresh flowers, or fresh meats and cheese in the covered market.",
          "A local took us here on a Sunday morning to experience the atmosphere and choice on offer. A huge range of products on offer - fresh and street market food, clothes, fabrics, household linens, antiques, toys etc etc - and much with an Arabic/north African theme. The central",
          "full of rubbish, pickpokets and with the occasional salafiste, its perfect for the burka brigade but if you are looking for a French market ie no pickpockets no salafist value judgements (this market is unsafe for for white women) and no of packs vieled creatures haggling over",
          "A word or two in reply to the reviewers who felt unsafe or rated this market as tatty or sub par.

          "Ticking all the boxes this place is a gold mine for bargain food hunters. most of the French Born stall owners here are the ones to buy from as their produce is just incredible and lasts a lot longer than their competitors who are slowly taking over with their bottom of the",
          "After spending the weekend in Lille we were unsure what to do on the Sunday because everywhere is closed. We found this market listed in our guide book and decided to give it a try. We had a half an hour walk from the town square to this market but it was well worth it. A",
          "Went here last Sunday. Interesting couple of hours spent wondering around the market. Was a bit cautious at first after reading some reviews and also seeing the area is ethnically very mixed!!!! However, once we were wondering around it was fine. Nice to see the fresh fruit,",
          "Visit on Sunday, mix with the locals and join in the bargain hunt. We have bought many things for a great price! Clothes, housewares, toiletries, fresh fruit and veg and a lot more. Mouthwatering smell of grilled chicken, olives etc. everywhere. Not a place for snobs though.",
          "An interesting market, the indoor is good and the outside is a typical French market... not quite Borough Market standards but good enough for a wander and the odd cheese purchase :-)",
          "Living in France, find Sundays bit dull. Certainly not the case here. Might be a bit scruffy and dodgy. As others have said good for food and other market type items. As with any crowded space, anywhere, just be careful with your belongings.",
          "We followed a large portion of the Lille population out to this market on a Sunday morning, wandered around for 30mins looking at stall after stall of tat, crap food and flowers and left, mystified about how it gets such good ratings. The atmosphere was quite threatening,",

          "Wazemmes is a cool neighbourhood in Lille, packed with quirky pubs, home to the annual Wazemmes Accordion Festival, and most famously location of the Market. We went on a Sunday morning and there was a really nice atmosphere, wide selection of anything you may like to buy -",
          "We walked easily to Wazzemes Market from our hotel in the centre of Lille. It's not a large as other French city markets but it's still a good size with lots of food/flower and produce stalls and there is an undercover part as well. The undercover part is small compared to",
          "This market is huge! In the indoor market one finds the more high-end delicacies, and outside you will find everything else. The food sold outside and the people walking over the market reflect the international connections of France quite nicely. You can have a coffee at one of",
          "I found this market very initimdating in sections - to the point of having to tuck away my long dark blonde hair after being given LOTS of filthy looks. When people describe this as a market for locals, I did not expect this to include radical types preaching on every corner",
          "I get why this is a great destination for a local - the food looked excellent. However, the indoor market (where most of the food is) is fine but not particularly attractive (I've seen far better elsewhere in France). But the outside market was just awful - (cheap clothing,",
          "Huge market which was absolutely packed with stalls and locals! A large variety of stalls including fresh fruit and veg, bread, cheeses, meat, olives, clothes and shoes! Seeing as the main centre of town was almost deserted, visiting the market explained where all the locals",
          "Sunday morning it was all happening. The flea market, alongside food and produce. It was ace. Spent a few hours collecting up supplies to take back to the UK. Cheese, meats, bread, and we even got a bunch of fresh fruit and veg it was so good. Super super value. A bag of olives",
          "We kind of stumbled across these markets and there was plenty to see. A great little bakery at the entrance of the markets we came into (almond croissant was to die for). Inside there was a mixture of clothes, fresh food & cooked food stalls. We didn't buy anything but it",
          "We moved to Lille two months ago and I was looking forward to go to this Market on a sunday morning.... finally yesterday we had an opportunity to go! I was so disappointed! There were a few places selling antiques the rest is a big clothes market....a mess!!! The food market is",
          "In south Louisiana, we have boudin but it's basically one type of boudin. Cajun. It all looks and tastes pretty much the same. This market has such a variety of foods, from produce, to meat, to seafood, bakery items, and cheeses. You'll want to buy more than you can eat. The",
          "Most crowded in Sunday morning, the market will be a good experience. Here you can buy almost everything, but nothing really special. If you are a fan of bio-products, you can find here also many local farmers who sell their own products.",
          "For those who are interested in things like exotic foods and clothes it worth a visit. I went to see some books and objects, but I did't find too many options. I think it's a good option for a Sunday morning.",

        "wiki": "Ypres ( EE-pr\u0259, French: [ip\u0281]; Dutch: Ieper [\u02c8ip\u0259r]) is a Belgian municipality in the province of West Flanders. Though the Dutch Ieper is the official name, the city's French name Ypres is most commonly used in English. The municipality comprises the city of Ypres and the villages of Boezinge, Brielen, Dikkebus, Elverdinge, Hollebeke, Sint-Jan, Vlamertinge, Voormezele, Zillebeke, and Zuidschote. Together, they are home to about 34,900 inhabitants.\nDuring the First World War, Ypres (or \"Wipers\" as it was commonly known by the British troops) was the centre of the Battles of Ypres between German and Allied forces.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins to First World War ===\n\nYpres is an ancient town, known to have been raided by the Romans in the first century BC. It is first mentioned by name in 1066 and is probably named after the river Ieperlee on the banks of which it was founded.During the Middle Ages, Ypres was a prosperous Flemish city with a population of 40,000 in 1200 AD, renowned for its linen trade with England, which was mentioned in the Canterbury Tales.\nAs the third largest city in the County of Flanders (after Ghent and Bruges) Ypres played an important role in the history of the textile industry. Textiles from Ypres could be found in the markets of Novgorod in Kievan Rus' in the early 12th century. In 1241, a major fire ruined much of the old city. The powerful city was involved in important treaties and battles, including the Battle of the Golden Spurs, the Battle at Mons-en-P\u00e9v\u00e8le, the Peace of Melun, and the Battle of Cassel.\nThe famous Cloth Hall was built in the 13th century. Also during this time cats, then the symbol of the devil and witchcraft, were thrown off Cloth Hall, possibly because of the belief that this would get rid of evil demons. Today, this act is commemorated with a triennial Cat Parade through town.\nDuring the Norwich Crusade, led by the English bishop Henry le Despenser, Ypres was besieged from May to August 1383, until French relief forces arrived. After the destruction of Th\u00e9rouanne, Ypres became the seat of the new Diocese of Ypres in 1561, and Saint Martin's Church was elevated to cathedral.\nOn 25 March 1678 Ypres was conquered by the forces of Louis XIV of France. It remained French under the Treaty of Nijmegen, and Vauban constructed his typical fortifications that can still be seen today. In 1697, after the Treaty of Ryswick, Ypres was returned to the Spanish Crown.\nDuring the War of the Spanish Succession, the Duke of Marlborough in 1709 intended to capture Ypres, at the time a major French fortress, but changed his mind owing to the long time and effort it had taken him to capture Tournai and apprehension of disease spreading in his army in the poorly drained land around Ypres (see Battle of Malplaquet). In 1713 it was handed over to the Habsburgs, and became part of the Austrian Netherlands.\nIn 1782 the Habsburg Emperor Joseph II ordered parts of the walls torn down. This destruction, which was only partly repaired, made it easier for the French to capture the city in the 1794 Siege of Ypres during the War of the First Coalition.In 1850 the Ypresian Age of the Eocene Epoch was named on the basis of geology in the region by Belgian geologist Andr\u00e9 Hubert Dumont.\nYpres had long been fortified to keep out invaders. Parts of the early ramparts, dating from 1385, still survive near the Rijselpoort (Lille Gate). Over time, the earthworks were replaced by sturdier masonry and earth structures and a partial moat. Ypres was further fortified in the 17th and 18th centuries while under the occupation of the Habsburgs and the French. Major works were completed at the end of the 17th century by the French military engineer S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban.\n\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nYpres occupied a strategic position during the First World War because it stood in the path of Germany's planned sweep across the rest of Belgium and into France from the north (the Schlieffen Plan). The neutrality of Belgium, established by the First Treaty of London,\nwas guaranteed by Britain; Germany's invasion of Belgium brought the British Empire into the war. The German army surrounded the city on three sides, bombarding it throughout much of the war. To counterattack, British, French, and allied forces made costly advances from the Ypres Salient into the German lines on the surrounding hills.\nIn the First Battle of Ypres (19 October to 22 November 1914), the Allies captured the town from the Germans. The Germans had used tear gas at the Battle of Bolimov on 3 January 1915. Their use of poison gas for the first time on 22 April 1915 marked the beginning of the Second Battle of Ypres, which continued until 25 May 1915. They captured high ground east of the town. The first gas attack occurred against Canadian, British, and French soldiers, including both metropolitan French soldiers as well as Senegalese and Algerian tirailleurs (light infantry) from French Africa. The gas used was chlorine. Mustard gas, also called Yperite from the name of this town, was also used for the first time near Ypres, in the autumn of 1917.\n\nOf the battles, the largest, best-known, and most costly in human suffering was the Third Battle of Ypres (31 July to 6 November 1917, also known as the Battle of Passchendaele), in which the British, Canadian, ANZAC, and French forces recaptured the Passchendaele Ridge east of the city at a terrible cost of lives. After months of fighting, this battle resulted in nearly half a million casualties to all sides, and only a few miles of ground won by Allied forces. During the course of the war the town was all but obliterated by the artillery fire.\nEnglish-speaking soldiers often referred to Ieper/Ypres by the deliberate mispronunciation \"Wipers\". British soldiers even published a wartime newspaper called The Wipers Times. The same style of deliberate mispronunciation was applied to other Flemish place names in the Ypres area for the benefit of British troops, such as Wytschaete becoming \"White Sheet\" and Ploegsteert becoming \"Plug Street\".\nYpres was one of the sites that hosted an unofficial Christmas Truce in 1914 between German and British soldiers.\nDuring World War Two, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) would fight the Germans in a delaying action at the Ypres-Comines Canal, one of the actions that allowed the Allied retreat to Dunkirk. Adolf Hitler fought at Ypres in the First World War and later visited the town during the Battle of France.\n\n\n=== War memory and memorial ===\nOn 12 February 1920 King George V awarded the Military Cross to the City of Ypres, one of only two awards of this decoration to a municipality during World War I, the other being to Verdun. In May 1920 Field Marshal French presented the Cross in a special ceremony in the city, and in 1925 it was added to the city's coat of arms, along with the French Croix de Guerre.Historian Mark Connelly states that in the 1920s, British veterans set up the Ypres League and made the city the symbol of all that they believed Britain was fighting for and gave it a holy aura in their minds. The Ypres League sought to transform the horrors of trench warfare into a spiritual quest in which British and imperial troops were purified by their sacrifice. In 1920 Lieutenant-Colonel Beckles Willson's guide book, The Holy Ground of British Arms captured the mood of the Ypres League:\n\nThere is not a single half-acre in Ypres that is not sacred. There is not a single stone which has not sheltered scores of loyal young hearts, whose one impulse and desire was to fight and, if need be, to die for England. Their blood has drenched its cloisters and its cellars, but if never a drop had been spilt, if never a life had been lost in defence of Ypres still would Ypres have been hallowed, if only for the hopes and the courage it has inspired and the scenes of valour and sacrifice it has witnessed.\nYpres became a pilgrimage destination for Britons to imagine and share the sufferings of their men and gain a spiritual benefit.In the 100th anniversary period more attempts are being made to preserve the First World War heritage in and around Ypres.\n\n\n=== Ypres today ===\n\nAfter the war the town was extensively rebuilt using money paid by Germany in reparations, with the main square, including the Cloth Hall and town hall, being rebuilt as close to the original designs as possible (the rest of the rebuilt town is more modern in appearance). The Cloth Hall today is home to In Flanders Fields Museum, dedicated to Ypres's role in the First World War and named for the poem by John McCrae.\nToday, Ypres is a small city in the very western part of Belgium, the so-called Westhoek. Ypres these days has the title of \"city of peace\" and maintains a close friendship with another town on which war had a profound impact: Hiroshima. Both towns witnessed warfare at its worst: Ypres was one of the first places where chemical warfare was employed, while Hiroshima suffered the debut of nuclear warfare. The city governments of Ypres and Hiroshima advocate that cities should never be targets again and campaign for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Ypres hosts the international campaign secretariat of Mayors for Peace, an international Mayoral organization mobilizing cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\n\n=== Town centre ===\n\nThe imposing Cloth Hall was built in the 13th century and was one of the largest commercial buildings of the Middle Ages. The structure which stands today is the exact copy of the original medieval building, rebuilt after the war. The belfry that surmounts the hall houses a 49-bell carillon. The whole complex was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999.\nThe Gothic-style Saint Martin's Cathedral, built in 1221, was also completely reconstructed after the war, but now with a higher spire. It houses the tombs of Jansenius, bishop of Ypres and father of the religious movement known as Jansenism, and of Robert of Bethune, nicknamed \"The Lion of Flanders\", who was Count of Nevers (1273\u20131322) and Count of Flanders (1305\u20131322).\n\n\n=== Menin Gate ===\n\nThe Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing commemorates those soldiers of the British Commonwealth \u2013 with the exception of Newfoundland and New Zealand \u2013 who fell in the Ypres Salient during the First World War before 16 August 1917 and who have no known grave. United Kingdom and New Zealand servicemen who died after that date are named on the memorial at Tyne Cot, a site which marks the furthest point reached by Commonwealth forces in Belgium until nearly the end of the war. Other New Zealand casualties are commemorated on memorials at Buttes New British Cemetery and Messines Ridge British Cemetery. The Menin Gate records only soldiers for whom there is no known grave. As graves are identified, the names of those buried in them are removed from the Gate.The memorial, designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield with sculpture by Sir William Reid Dick, was unveiled by Lord Plumer on 24 July 1927. It was built and is maintained by The Commonwealth War Graves Commission.The memorial's location is especially poignant, as it lies on the eastward route from the town, which Entente soldiers would have taken towards the fighting \u2013 many never to return. Every evening since 1929 (except for a period during the Second World War when Ypres was occupied by Germany), at precisely eight o'clock, traffic around the imposing arches of the Menin Gate Memorial has been stopped while the \"Last Post\" is sounded beneath the gate by the buglers of the Last Post Association in honour of the memory of British Empire soldiers who fought and died there.\nThe ceremony was prohibited by occupying German forces during the Second World War, but it was resumed on the very evening of liberation \u2013 6 September 1944 \u2013 notwithstanding the heavy fighting that still went on in other parts of the town. The Last Post ceremony was hosted during the German occupation of Belgium in WWII, at Brookwood Military Cemetery in England. The lions that marked the original gate were given to Australia by the people of Belgium and can be found at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.\n\n\"Who will remember, passing through this Gate,\nThe unheroic Dead who fed the guns?\"-- Siegfried Sassoon, On Passing the Menin Gate\n\n\n=== War graves ===\nWar graves, both of the Allied side and the Central Powers, cover the landscape around Ypres. The largest number of dead are at Langemark German war cemetery and Tyne Cot Commonwealth war cemetery. The countryside around Ypres is featured in the famous poem by John McCrae, In Flanders Fields.\n\nSaint George's Memorial Church commemorates the British and Commonwealth soldiers who died in the five battles fought for Ypres during First World War.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\nThe Cat Parade (\"Kattenstoet\") takes place every three years on the second Sunday of May. It involves the throwing of stuffed toy cats from the belfry and a colourful parade of cats and witches. The latest Cat Parade took place on 13 May 2018.\nYpres is also the home of the Belgium Ypres Westhoek Rally since its creation in 1965. It is organized by the Auto Club Targa Florio. Some of the drivers to have taken part are among the best-known names in rallying, such as Juha Kankkunen, Bruno Thiry, Henri Toivonen, Colin McRae, Jimmy McRae, Marc Duez, Fran\u00e7ois Duval, Craig Breen and Freddy Loix among others.\nYpres holds an annual canoe polo tournament in which teams come from all over Europe to play.\nOn 9 July 2014, the 101st Tour de France started stage 5 in Ypres.\nDuring the last weekend of August each year, Ypres hosts the Ieperfest, one of the biggest European festivals in the hardcore metal subculture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThough Ypres is an historic city, and generates significant income from tourism, it also has a number of industrial areas. The biggest one is along the Ieperlee canal, which hosts room for around 120 companies and a wind farm in the north of Ypres.The office area known as Ieper Business Park is connected to the industrial area. That office area started as the site of speech recognition company Lernout & Hauspie, and was named \"Flanders Language Valley\" (mimicking Silicon Valley), until the company went bankrupt. Since then, the office area had many difficult years, where a big share of the offices were unused. However, those years are mostly over, and currently, the area offers about 1000 employees a job.\nThen there are also various other, smaller industrial areas like the area around Picanol in the south of Ypres.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nIeper railway station run by NMBS has hourly trains to Kortrijk.\nIt can also be accessed from Brussels, linking to Eurostar, and takes about 75 minutes with two stops.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nWilliam of Ypres, a commander of Flemish mercenaries in England who was reckoned among the more able of the military commanders fighting for King Stephen of England in his 19-year civil war with the Empress Matilda.\nJacob Clemens non Papa (c. 1510\u20131556), Renaissance composer\nGeorg Robin (1522-1595), architect\nCornelius Jansen (1585\u20131638), bishop of Ypres and father of the Jansenism movement\nJules Malou (1810\u20131886), politician, Prime Minister of Belgium from 1871 to 1878 and in 1884\nAlphonse Vandenpeereboom (1812\u20131884), politician, minister\nAlbert Nyssens (1855\u20131901) Minister of Industry and Labour, Lawyer, University Professor,\nJulien Nyssens (1859\u20131910) engineer, builder of Zeebrugge harbour.\nAlbert Dev\u00e8ze (1881\u20131959), politician, minister\nCamille Durutte (1803\u20131881), music theorist\nEdward Phillips (1883\u20131915), cricketer\nPaul Sobry (1895\u20131954), university professor\nSimona Noorenbergh (1907\u20131990), nun, social worker, co-founder of Fane, Papua New Guinea\nJohn French, 1st Earl of Ypres\nAntoon Verschoot (1925-2017), from 1954 to 2015 chief bugler at the Menin Gate for the daily Last Post ceremony.\nWalter Fiers (born 1931), molecular biologist\nMarc Vervenne (born 1949), emeritus dean Leuven university\nJo Lernout and Pol Hauspie, founders of the speech technology company Lernout & Hauspie\nHenk Lauwers (born 1956), classical baritone singer\nCatherine Verfaillie (born, 1957), MD and stem cell pioneer\nNicholas Lens (born 1957), opera composer\nEdouard Vermeulen (born 1957), fashion designer\nRenaat Landuyt (born 1959), politician, Belgian minister\nErik Vermeulen (born 1959), jazz pianist\nYves Leterme (born 1960), politician, former prime minister of Belgium\nIsaac Delahaye (born 1982), lead guitarist of Epica\n\n\n== Twin cities ==\n Kazakhstan: Semey (since 2012)\n Japan: Hiroshima\n United Kingdom: Sittingbourne, Kent (since 1964)\n Germany: Siegen, Westphalia (since 1967)\n France: Saint-Omer, Pas-de-Calais (since 1969)\n Ghana: Wa, Upper West Region\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAssociation for World War Archaeology; information about World War I excavations near Ypres\nIn Flanders Fields Museum\nLast Post Association\nPilgrimage to Ypres and Sanctuary Wood\nThe Second Battle of Ypres in Oral Histories of the First World War: Veterans 1914\u20131918 at Library and Archives Canada\nMayors For Peace International Secretariat Ypres\nWebpage about the fortifications\nCoat of arms of Ieper (Ypres)\nIeper official website \u2013 Information available in Dutch and limited information available in English\nYpres Travel Guide - A comprehensive English language guide to Ypres (Ieper); includes history, sightseeing and Belgian beer culture.",

          "Been to last post ceremony several times and always amazed at how many people turn up. It takes place every evening rain or shine and lasts up to 30 minutes. Always a dignified turnout and well worth a visit. The gate itself is a reminder of those who died in the great war.",

On the De\u00fble River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region, the prefecture of the Nord department, and the main city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille.\nAs of 2017, Lille had a population of 232,787 within its administrative limits, and Lille is the first city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille with a population of 1,146,320, making it the fourth-largest urban area in France after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nArcheological digs seem to show the area as inhabited by as early as 2000 BC, most notably in the modern quartiers of Fives, Wazemmes and Vieux Lille. The original inhabitants of the region were the Gauls, such as the Menapians, the Morins, the Atrebates and the Nervians, who were followed by Germanic peoples: the Saxons, the Frisians and the Franks.\nThe legend of \"Lyd\u00e9ric and Phinaert\" puts the foundation of the city of Lille at 640. In the 8th century, the language of Old Low Franconian was spoken, as attested by toponymic research. Lille's Dutch name is Rijsel, which comes from ter ijsel (at the island) from Middle Dutch ijssel (\u201csmall island, islet\u201d), calque of Old French l'Isle (\u201cthe Island\u201d), itself from Latin \u012ansula, from \u012bnsula (\u201cisland\u201d).\nFrom 830 to around 910, the Vikings invaded Flanders. After the destruction caused by Normans' and the Magyars' invasion, the eastern part of the region was ruled by various local princes.\nThe first mention of the town dates from 1066: apud Insulam (Latin for \"at the island\"). It was then controlled by the County of Flanders, as were the regional cities (the Roman cities Boulogne, Arras, Cambrai as well as the Carolingian cities Valenciennes, Saint-Omer, Ghent and Bruges). The County of Flanders thus extended to the left bank of the Scheldt, one of the richest and most prosperous regions of Europe.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe Carolingian duke \u00c9vrard lived in the city in the 9th century and participated in many of the day's political and military affairs. There was an important Battle of Lille in 1054.\nFrom the 12th century, the fame of the Lille cloth fair began to grow. In 1144 Saint-Sauveur parish was formed, which would give its name to the modern-day quartier Saint-Sauveur.\nThe counts of Flanders, Boulogne, and Hainaut came together with England and East Frankia and tried to regain territory taken by Philip II of France following Henry II of England's death, a war that ended with the French victory at Bouvines in 1214. Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders was imprisoned and the county fell into dispute: it would be his wife, Jeanne, Countess of Flanders and Constantinople, who ruled the city. She was said to be well loved by the residents of Lille, who by that time numbered 10,000.\nIn 1225, the street performer and juggler Bertrand Cordel, doubtlessly encouraged by local lords, tried to pass himself off as Baldwin I of Constantinople (the father of Jeanne of Flanders), who had disappeared at the battle of Adrianople. He pushed the counties of Flanders and Hainaut towards sedition against Jeanne in order to recover his land. She called her cousin, Louis VIII (\"The Lion\"). He unmasked the imposter, whom Countess Jeanne quickly had hanged. In 1226 the king agreed to free Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders. Count Ferrand died in 1233, and his daughter Marie soon after. In 1235, Jeanne granted a city charter by which city governors would be chosen each All Saint's Day by four commissioners chosen by the ruler. On 6 February 1236, she founded the Countess's Hospital (Hospice Comtesse), which remains one of the most beautiful buildings in Old Lille. It was in her honour that the hospital of the Regional Medical University of Lille was named \"Jeanne of Flanders Hospital\" in the 20th century.\nThe Countess died in 1244 in the Abbey of Marquette, leaving no heirs. The rule of Flanders and Hainaut thus fell to her sister, Margaret II, Countess of Flanders, then to Margaret's son, Guy of Dampierre. Lille fell under the rule of France from 1304 to 1369, after the Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305).\nThe county of Flanders fell to the Duchy of Burgundy next, after the 1369 marriage of Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, and Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Lille thus became one of the three capitals of said Duchy, along with Brussels and Dijon. By 1445, Lille counted some 25,000 residents. Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, was even more powerful than the King of France, and made Lille an administrative and financial capital.\nOn 17 February 1454, one year after the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, Philip the Good organised a Pantagruelian banquet at his Lille palace, the still-celebrated \"Feast of the Pheasant\". There the Duke and his court undertook an oath to Christianity.\nIn 1477, at the death of the last duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian of Austria, who thus became Count of Flanders.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\n\nThe 16th and the 17th centuries were marked by a boom in the regional textile industry, the Protestant revolts and outbreaks of the plague.\nLille came under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1519. The Low Countries fell to his eldest son, Philip II of Spain, in 1555. The city remained under Spanish Habsburg rule until 1668.\nCalvinism first appeared in the area in 1542, and by 1555, the authorities were taking steps to suppress that form of Protestantism. In 1566, the countryside around Lille was affected by the Iconoclastic Fury. In 1578, the Hurlus, a group of Protestant rebels, stormed the castle of the Counts of Mouscron. They were removed four months later by a Catholic Wallon regiment, and they tried several times between 1581 and 1582 to take the city of Lille, all in vain. The Hurlus were notably held back by the legendary Jeanne Maillotte. At the same time (1581), at the call of Elizabeth I of England, the north of the Seventeen Provinces, having gained a Protestant majority, successfully revolted and formed the Dutch Republic. The war brought or exacerbated periods of famine and plague (the last in 1667\u20131679).The first printer to set up shop in Lille was Antoine Tack in 1594. The 17th century saw the building of new institutions: an Irish College in 1610, a Jesuit college in 1611, an Augustinian college in 1622, almshouses or hospitals such as the Maison des Vieux hommes in 1624 and the Bonne et Forte Maison des Pauvres in 1661, and of a Mont-de-pi\u00e9t\u00e9 in 1626.Unsuccessful French attacks on the city were launched in 1641 and 1645. In 1667, Louis XIV of France (the Sun King) successfully laid siege to Lille, resulting in it becoming French in 1668 under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, provoking discontent among the citizens of the prosperous city. A number of important public works undertaken between 1667 and 1670, such as the Citadel (erected by Vauban), or the creation of the quartiers of Saint-Andr\u00e9 and la Madeleine, enabled the French king to gradually gain the confidence of his new subjects in Lille, some of whom continued to feel Flemish, but they had always spoken the Romance Picard language.\n\nFor five years, from 1708 to 1713, the city was occupied by the Dutch during the War of the Spanish Succession. Throughout the 18th century, Lille remained profoundly Catholic. It took little part in the French Revolution, but there were riots and the destruction of churches. In 1790, the city held its first municipal elections.\n\n\n=== Post-French Revolution ===\nIn 1792, in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the Austrians, then in the United Provinces, laid siege to Lille. The \"Column of the Goddess\", erected in 1842 in the \"Grand-Place\" (officially named Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle), is a tribute to the city's resistance, led by Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9-Bonte. Although Austrian artillery destroyed many houses and the main church of the city, the city did not surrender, and the Austrian Army left after eight days.\n\nThe city continued to grow and, by 1800, had some 53,000 residents, leading to Lille becoming the seat of the Nord d\u00e9partment in 1804. In 1846, a railway connecting Paris and Lille was built. In the early the 19th century, Napoleon I's continental blockade against the United Kingdom led to Lille's textile industry developing even more fully. The city was known for its cotton while the nearby towns of Roubaix and Tourcoing worked wool.  Leisure activities were thoroughly organised in 1858 for the 80,000 inhabitants.  Cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1,300, or one for every three houses. At that time the city counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations. Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets festivals and competitions. In 1853, Alexandre Desrousseaux composed his lullaby P'tit quinquin.\nIn 1858, Lille annexed the adjacent towns of Fives, Wazemmes, and Moulins. Lille's population was 158,000 in 1872, growing to over 200,000 by 1891. In 1896 Lille became the first city in France to be led by a socialist, Gustave Delory.\nBy 1912, Lille's population stood at 217,000. The city profited from the Industrial Revolution, particularly via coal and the steam engine. The entire region grew wealthy thanks to its mines and textile industry.\n\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nLille's occupation by the Germans began on 13 October 1914 after a ten-day siege and heavy shelling, which destroyed 882 apartment and office blocks and 1,500 houses, mostly around the railway station and in the centre. By the end of October, the city was being run by German authorities.\nBecause Lille was only 20 km from the battlefield, German troops passed through the city regularly on their way to and from the front. As a result, occupied Lille became a place for the hospitalisation and the treatment of wounded soldiers as well as a place for soldiers' relaxation and entertainment. Many buildings, homes and businesses were requisitioned to those ends.Lille was liberated by the Allies on 17 October 1918, when General Sir William Birdwood and his troops were welcomed by joyous crowds. The general was made an honorary citizen of the city of Lille on 28 October.\nThe only audio recording known to have been made during World War I was recorded near Lille in October 1918. The two-minute recording captured the Royal Garrison Artillery conducting a gas shell bombardment.Lille was also the hunting ground of the German World War I flying ace Max Immelmann, who was nicknamed \"the Eagle of Lille\".\n\n\n=== Ann\u00e9es Folles, Great Depression and Popular Front ===\n\nIn July 1921, at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin discovered the first anti-tuberculosis vaccine, known as BCG (\"Bacille de Calmette et Gu\u00e9rin\"). The Op\u00e9ra de Lille, designed by Lille architect Louis M. Cordonnier, was dedicated in 1923.\nFrom 1931, Lille felt the repercussions of the Great Depression, and by 1935, a third of the city's population lived in poverty. In 1936, the city's mayor, Roger Salengro, became Minister of the Interior of the Popular Front but eventually killed himself after right-wing groups led a slanderous campaign against him.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring the Battle of France, Lille was besieged by German forces for several days. When Belgium was invaded, the citizens of Lille, still haunted by the events of World War I, began to flee the city in large numbers. Lille was part of the zone under control of the German commander in Brussels, and was never controlled by the Vichy government in France. Lille was instead controlled under the military administration in Northern France. The d\u00e9partments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais (with the exception of the coast, notably Dunkirk) were for the most part liberated from 1 to 5 September 1944, by British, Canadian and Polish troops. On 3 September, German troops began to leave Lille out of fear of the British, who were on their way from Brussels. The city was liberated by a British force consisting largely of tanks.Rationing came to an end in 1947, and by 1948, normality had returned to Lille.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\n\nIn 1967, the Chambers of Commerce of Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing were joined, and in 1969< the Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Lille (Lille urban community) was created, linking 87 communes with Lille.\nThroughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the region was faced with some problems after the decline of the coal, mining and textile industries. From the early 1980s, the city began to turn itself more towards the service sector.\nIn 1983, the VAL, the world's first automated rapid transit underground network, opened. In 1993, a high-speed TGV train line was opened connecting Paris with Lille in one hour. This, with the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 and the arrival of the Eurostar train put Lille at the centre of a triangle connecting Paris, London and Brussels.\nWork on Euralille, an urban remodelling project, began in 1991. The Euralille Centre was opened in 1994, and the remodeled district is now full of parks and modern buildings containing offices, shops and apartments. In 1994 the \"Grand Palais\" was also opened for the general public, which is free for the public to enter on the first Sunday of every month.\nLille was chosen as European Capital of Culture in 2004, along with the Italian city of Genoa.\nLille and Roubaix were affected by the 2005 riots, like all of France's other urban centres.\nIn 2007 and again in 2010, Lille was awarded the label \"Internet City\".\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLille can be described as having a temperate oceanic climate; summers normally do not reach high average temperatures, but winters can fall below freezing temperatures, but with averages quite a bit above the freezing mark. Precipitation is plentiful year round.\nThe table below gives average temperatures and precipitation levels for the 1981-2010 reference period.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nLille is noted for its air pollution, with a 2018 study attributing 1,700 deaths per year in the agglomeration of Lille to pollution. In 2018, Lille held France's record pollution peaks.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nA former major mechanical, food industry and textile manufacturing centre as well as a retail and finance center, Lille is the largest city of a conurbation, built like a network of cities: Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing and Villeneuve d'Ascq. The conurbation forms the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille which is France's fourth-largest urban conglomeration with a 2016 population of over 1.15 million.\n\n\n=== Revenues and taxes ===\nFor centuries, Lille, a city of merchants, has displayed a wide range of incomes: great wealth and poverty have lived side by side, especially until the end of the 1800s. This contrast was noted by Victor Hugo in 1851 in his poem Les Ch\u00e2timents:  \u00ab Caves de Lille ! on meurt sous vos plafonds de pierre ! \u00bb (\"Cellars of Lille! We die under your stone ceilings!\")\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment in Lille has switched over half a century from a predominant industry to tertiary activities and services.\nServices account for 91% of employment in 2006.\n\nEmployment in Lille-Hellemmes-Lomme from 1968 to 2006\n\nEmployment per categories in 1968 and in 2006\n\nUnemployment in active population from 1968 to 2006\n\n\n=== Enterprises ===\nIn 2007, Lille hosts around 21,000 industry or service sites.\n\nEnterprises as per 31 December 2007\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nLille features an array of architectural styles with various amounts of Flemish influence, including the use of brown and red brick. In addition, many residential neighborhoods, especially in Greater Lille, consist of attached 2\u20133 story houses aligned in a row, with narrow gardens in the back. These architectural attributes, many uncommon in France, help make Lille a transition in France to neighboring Belgium, as well as nearby Netherlands and England, where the presence of brick, as well as row houses or the terraced house is much more prominent.\nPoints of interest include\n\nLille Cathedral (Basilique-cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame-de-la-Treille)\nCitadel of Lille\nPalais des Beaux-Arts de Lille\nJardin botanique de la Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie\nJardin botanique Nicolas Boulay\nJardin des Plantes de Lille\n\n\n=== La Braderie ===\n\nLille hosts an annual braderie on the first weekend in September. Its origins are thought to date back to the twelfth century and between two and three million visitors are drawn into the city. It is one of the largest gatherings of France and the largest flea market in Europe.\nMany of the roads in the inner city (including much of the old town) are closed and local shops, residents and traders set up stalls in the street.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille has a mixed mode public transport system, which is considered one of the most modern in the whole of France. It comprises buses, trams and a driverless light metro system, all of which are operated under the Transpole name. The Lille Metro is a VAL system (v\u00e9hicule automatique l\u00e9ger = light automated vehicle) that opened on 16 May 1983, becoming the first automatic light metro line in the world. The system has two lines, with a total length of 45 kilometres (28 miles) and 60 stations. The tram system consists of two interurban tram lines, connecting central Lille to the nearby communities of Roubaix and Tourcoing, and has 45 stops. 68 urban bus routes cover the metropolis, 8 of which reach into Belgium.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nLille is an important crossroads in the European high-speed rail network. It lies on the Eurostar line to London (1:20 hour journey). The French TGV network also puts it only 1 hour from Paris, 38 minutes from Brussels, and connects to other major centres in France such as Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse. Lille has two railway stations, which stand next door to one another: Lille-Europe station (Gare de Lille-Europe), which primarily serves high-speed trains and international services (Eurostar), and Lille-Flandres station (Gare de Lille-Flandres), which primarily serves lower speed regional trains and regional Belgian trains.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nFive autoroutes pass by Lille, the densest confluence of highways in France after Paris:\n\nAutoroute A27 : Lille \u2013 Tournai \u2013 Brussels / Li\u00e8ge \u2013 Germany\nAutoroute A23 : Lille \u2013 Valenciennes\nAutoroute A1  : Lille \u2013 Arras \u2013 Paris / Reims \u2013 Lyon / Orl\u00e9ans / Le Havre\nAutoroute A25 : Lille \u2013 Dunkirk \u2013 Calais \u2013 England / North Belgium\nAutoroute A22 : Lille \u2013 Antwerp \u2013 NetherlandsA sixth one \u2013 the proposed A24 \u2013 will link Amiens to Lille if built, but there is opposition to its route.\n\n\n=== Air traffic ===\nLille Lesquin International Airport is 15 minutes from the city centre by car (11 km). In terms of shipping, it ranks fourth, with almost 38,000 tonnes of freight which pass through each year. Its passenger traffic, around 1.2 million in 2010, is modest due to the proximity to Brussels, Charleroi, and Paris-CDG airports. The airport mostly connects other French and European cities (some with low-cost airlines).\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\n\nLille is the third-largest French river port after Paris and Strasbourg. The river De\u00fble is connected to regional waterways with over 680 km (423 mi) of navigable waters. The De\u00fble connects to Northern Europe via the River Scarpe and the River Scheldt (towards Belgium and the Netherlands), and internationally via the Lys River (to Dunkerque and Calais).\nShipping statistics\n\n\n== Education ==\nWith over 110,000 students, the metropolitan area of Lille is one of France's top student cities.\n\nWith roots back from 1562 to 1793 as University of Douai, (then as Universit\u00e9 Imp\u00e9riale in 1808), the State University of Lille was established in Lille in 1854 with Louis Pasteur as the first dean of its Faculty of Sciences. A school of medicine and an engineering school were also established in Lille in 1854; and the University of Lille was united as the association of existing public Faculties in 1896. It was then split into three independent university campuses in 1970: Lille 1 University of Science and Technology, Lille 2 University of Law and Health, and Lille 3 Charles de Gaulle University of Humanities, Social sciences, Literature and Arts.At the beginning of 2018, Lille 1, Lille 2 and Lille 3 merged to form the new University of Lille (student enrollment: 70,000).\nIt is part of the Community of Universities and Institutions (COMUE) Lille Nord de France and the European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France.\n\nThe Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech, an engineering graduate school of industrial and mechanical engineering, settled in Lille in 1900. This campus is one of the eight Teaching and Research Center (CER) of the school. Its creation was decided by Pierre-Nicolas Legrand de L\u00e9rant.\nEcole Centrale de Lille is one of the five Centrale Graduate Schools of engineering in France; it was founded in Lille city in 1854, its graduate engineering education and research center was established as Institut industriel du Nord (IDN) in 1872, in 1968 it moved in a modern campus in Lille suburb.\n\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de chimie de Lille was established as Institut de chimie de Lille in 1894 supporting chemistry research as followers of Kuhlmann's breakthrough works in Lille.\n\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de journalisme de Lille, journalism school created in 1924.\nSkema Business School established in 1892 is ranked among the top business schools in France.\n\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies settled in Lille in 2009.\nESME-Sudria and E-Artsup settled in Lille in 2012.\nThe ESA \u2013 \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Affaires is a Business Management school established in Lille in 1990.\nIEP Sciences-Po Lille political studies institute was established in Lille in 1992.\nThe Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action is also located in Lille.\nThe Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group) established in Lille in 1988.\nThe European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France is headquartered in Lille Metropolis and includes 3,000 PhD Doctorate students supported by university research laboratories.\nThe Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Lille was founded in 1875. Today it has law, economics, medicine, physics faculties and schools. Among the most famous is Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers (ICAM) founded in 1898, ranked 20th among engineering schools, with the specificity of graduating polyvalent engineers, Ecole des Hautes \u00e9tudes d'ing\u00e9nieur (HEI) a school of engineering founded in 1885 and offering 10 fields of specialization, \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes commerciales du nord (EDHEC) founded in 1906, IESEG School of Management founded in 1964 (17th place in the latest Financial Times global ranking of the 90 best masters in management, published on Monday 12 September 2016).  and Skema Business School currently ranked within the top 5, the top 10 and top 15 business schools in France, respectively. In 1924 ESJ \u2013 a leading journalism school \u2013 was established.\n\n\n== Notable people from Lille ==\n\n\n=== Writers ===\nJacquemart Gi\u00e9l\u00e9e (13th century), poet\nYvonne Chauffin (1905\u20131995), writer, winner of the 1970 edition of the Prix Breizh\nJean Prieur (1914\u20132008), writer and professor\n\n\n=== Scientists and mathematicians ===\n\n\n=== Artists ===\n\n\n=== Politicians, professionals and military ===\n\n\n=== Sportspeople ===\n\n\n== Media and sports ==\nLocal newspapers include Nord \u00e9clair and La Voix du Nord.\nFrance's national public television network has a channel that focuses on the local area: France 3 Nord-Pas-de-Calais\nThe city's most major association football club, Lille OSC, currently plays in Ligue 1, the highest level of football in France.

        "wiki": "Kortrijk ( KORT-ryke, Dutch: [\u02c8k\u0254rtr\u025bik] (listen); West Flemish: Kortryk or Kortrik; French: Courtrai [ku\u0281t\u0281\u025b]; Latin: Cortoriacum), also known in English as Courtrai or Courtray ( koor-TRAY), is a Belgian city and municipality in the Flemish province of West Flanders.\nIt is the capital and largest city of the judicial and administrative arrondissement of Kortrijk. The wider municipality comprises the city of Kortrijk proper and the villages of Aalbeke, Bellegem, Bissegem, Heule, Kooigem, Marke, and Rollegem.  Kortrijk is also part of the cross-border Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai metropolitan area.The city is on the river Leie, 42 km (26 mi) southwest of Ghent and 25 km (16 mi) northeast of Lille. Mouscron in Wallonia is just south of Kortrijk.\n\nKortrijk originated from a Gallo-Roman town, Cortoriacum, at a crossroads near the Leie river and two Roman roads. In the Middle Ages, Kortrijk grew significantly thanks to the flax and wool industry with France and England and became one of the biggest and richest cities in Flanders. The city is often referred to as City of Groeninge or City of the Golden Spurs, referring to the Battle of Courtrai or the Battle of the Golden Spurs which took place on 11 July 1302 on the Fields of Groeninge in Kortrijk. In 1820 the Treaty of Kortrijk was signed, laying out the still-current borders between France and Belgium. Throughout the 19th and 20th century, the flax industry flourished and remains important within the Belgian textile industry today.\nKortrijk is the largest city in southern West Flanders, with several hospitals, colleges and a university. Kortrijk was the first city in Belgium with a pedestrian shopping street, the Korte Steenstraat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\nThe Roman name Cortoriacum meant in Latin, the settlement near the curb in the river. There is also mention of 'Cortoracum' in some literature. Its name later evolved to 'Cortrycke', 'Cortryck' and 'Kortrijk' (19th Century). The French call it Courtrai.\n\n\n=== Origins Roman times ===\nFindings from an archeological dig in 1950 in which remains of three Roman funeral pyres were found suggest that the vicus was used as an encampment by the Romans during their invasion of Britain in 43 CE.\nCortoriacum was a larger Gallo-Roman vicus of civitas Menapiorum at an important crossroads near the Lys river of the Roman roads linking Tongeren and Cassel and Tournai and Oudenburg. It was first mentioned in a document from the 4th or 5th century called Notitia Dignitatum where the Cortoriacenses (Cavalry)Troops were mentioned. In the 9th century, Baldwin II, Count of Flanders established fortifications against the Vikings.  The town gained its city charter in 1190 from Philip, Count of Flanders.  The population growth required new defensive walls, part of which can still be seen today (the Broeltorens, Armory, Kortrijk). Several local places still refer to physical parts of the defensive structures around Kortrijk (Walle, Waterpoort, Menenpoort, Gentsepoort, Brugsepoort, Kasteelkaai); Most of the physical parts have been overbuilt or destroyed.\n\nIn the 13th century, the battles between Fernando of Portugal, Count of Flanders and his first cousin, King Louis VIII of France, led to the destruction of the city.  The Counts of Flanders had it rebuilt soon after. To promote industry and weaving in the town, Joan, Countess of Flanders exempted settlers in Kortrijk from property tax. From that time, Kortrijk gained great importance as a center of linen production.\n\n\n=== Battle of the Golden Spurs ===\n\nIn 1302, the population of Bruges started a successful uprising against the French, who had annexed Flanders a couple of years earlier.  On 18 May the French population in that city was massacred, an event that could not go unpunished.  The famous ensuing Battle of Courtrai in 1302, also known as the Battle of the Golden Spurs (Dutch: Guldensporenslag), between the Flemish people, mostly commoners and farmers, and Philip the Fair\u2019s knights took place near Kortrijk on 11 July, resulting in a victory for Flanders; the date is now commemorated as a national holiday by the whole Flemish community.\nFollowing a new uprising by the Flemish in 1323, this time against their own Count Louis I, the French invaded again.  These Flemish acquisitions were consolidated by the French at the Battle of Cassel (1328).\nLouis I\u2019s son Louis II lost the city to a Flemish uprising led by Philip van Artevelde in 1381, but the Flemish were later decisively defeated at the 1382 Battle of Roosebeke by Louis II with French support, resulting in a new wave of plundering and destruction.\n\n\n=== 15th century to modern times ===\nMost of the 15th century was prosperous under the Dukes of Burgundy, until the death of the Burgundian heiress, Mary of Burgundy, in 1482, which ushered in renewed fighting with France.\nThe 16th century was marked by the confrontations engendered by the Reformation and the uprising of the Netherlands against Spain.\nLouis XIV\u2019s reign saw Kortrijk occupied by the French five times in sixty years and its former fortifications razed. The Treaty of Utrecht finally assigned the whole area to Austria.\nAfter the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era, the textile industry, based on flax, and the general economy of the city could finally prosper again.\nKortrijk was heavily bombed in the summer of 1917, but was liberated by the British Army the following year. During World War II the city was an important railway hub for the German army, and for this reason was the target of several allied air-strikes. On 21 July 1944 (the Belgian National Day) around 300 Avro Lancasters dropped over 5,000 bombs on the city center. Many historical buildings on the central square, as well as the old railway station, were destroyed.\n\n\n=== Battle of Courtrai ===\nBattles fought there in 1302, 1580, 1793, 1794, 1814, 1815, and 1918 have each been called Battle of Courtrai\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\nAfter the 1977 fusion the city is made up of:\n\nI Kortrijk\nII Heule\nIII Bissegem\nIV Marke\nV Aalbeke\nVI Rollegem\nVII Bellegem\nVIII Kooigem\n\n\n=== Neighboring municipalities ===\nThe metropolitan area, including the outer commuter zone, also consists of Kuurne, Wevelgem, Zwevegem and Harelbeke. Although these municipalities have strong morphologic ties with Kortrijk, they aren't officially part of the city.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nKortrijk has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfb).\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nMuch of the city's medieval architecture remains intact and is remarkably well preserved and restored. The city centre is one of the largest car-free areas in Belgium. The b\u00e9guinage, as well as the belfry, were recognized by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites in 1998 and 1999.\nInteresting highlights are:\n\n\n==== Civil ====\nMedieval City Hall (on the main square, the Grote Markt).

It now houses a 48-bell carillon. Its 83-meter (272 feet) tower remains the highest building in the city.\nThe beguinage is one of the quaintest sites in the city.  It too, was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\nThe church of Our Lady (Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk) is former collegiate church. Here the golden spurs taken from the battlefield in 1302 were hung. It houses a rich interior with an altar piece of van Dyck.\nthe Count\u2019s chapel (Gravenkapel), built after the example of la Sainte Chapelle in Paris as shrine for Louis II of Flanders.\nSaint-Michaelschurch; a church of the Society of Jesus\nSaint-Johnschurch in the St.-Johnsquarter; a Neo-Gothic basilica\nGroeninge Abbey\nSaint Eligiuschurch\nSaint-Pius X-church\nSaint-Rochchurch\nSaint-Elisabethchurch\nSaint-Anthonychurch or Toontjes kerk with the pilgrimage of Isidore of Saint Joseph\nSaint-Annechurch\nSaint-Theresiachurch\nFather Damienchurch\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMuseums in Kortrijk include:\n\nKortrijk 1302: seven centuries in one day, a historic museum about the famous Battle of the Golden Spurs, which gave Flanders its official holiday (11 July)\nBroelmuseum (Museum of Fine Arts and archaeological museum), with paintings by Roelant Savery and international Ceramic.\nNational Flax Museum in honour of the plant that once was the main driver of Kortrijk\u2019s economy.

The station also offers a direct connection to Brussels Airport.\nBissegem Station: a regional railway station in the village of Bissegem with connections to Ypres.\n\n\n=== Public city transport ===\nKortrijk has an extensive web of public transport lines, operated by De Lijn, providing access to the city centre and the suburbs (city lines, Dutch: stadslijnen) and to many towns and villages in the region around the city (regional lines, Dutch: streeklijnen).\n\nCity buses:\nLine 1: Station \u2013 Kortrijk Xpo \u2013 Kinepolis \u2013 Leiedal\nLine 2: Station \u2013 Lange Munte\nLine 4: Station \u2013 Bissegem Station \u2013 Heule Kransvijver\nLine 50: Station \u2013 Kuurne Seizoenswijk\nLine 51: Station \u2013 Kuurne Sint-Pieter\nLine 6: Station \u2013 Shopping Center (\u2013 Industriezone) \u2013 Heule Markt\nLine 9: Station \u2013 Cederlaan\nLine 12: Station \u2013 Kinepolis \u2013 Bellegem \u2013 Rollegem (\u2013 Aalbeke)\nLine 13: Station \u2013 Hoog Kortrijk\nLine 80/81: Station \u2013 Marke\nLine 91/92/93: Station \u2013 Zwevegem\nRegional busesAt Kortrijk main railway station, there is a bus station where regional buses stop as well.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nThe city has an airport known as Kortrijk-Wevelgem International Airport, which is mainly used for business travel and medical flights. Kortrijk Airport is located northwest of the citycentre, next to the R8 ringroad.\nThe national Brussels Airport, one hour away by train or car, offers the best international connectivity.\nThe Lille Lesquin International Airport is located 35 kilometres from Kortrijk.\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\n\nThe river Lys (Leie) is an important way of transporting goods through inland navigation. The Bossuit-Kortrijk Canal enables in the city centre a direct connection with the river Scheldt.\nWithin the City, the river briefly splits in two, to re-join about a mile further. \n\nOude Leie (Old Lys) original southernmost riverbed where the Broel towers still stand.\nNieuwe Leie (New Lys) New bed that was dug around 1585 by Humans to accommodate water powered equipmentFrom the 1970s on, the planning and later the execution of the so-called Leiewerken (Leieworks) started. These construction works comprised the deepening and widening of the river. This would enable ships with 4400 tons to navigate from France to the Scheldt. At the same time, this project included a thorough urban renewal of the riversides in the city. Seven new bridges were to give a new architectural impulse to the river quarters as well as the construction of several new parks along the river.\nThe following bridges were built during the period of 1997 and 2012:\n\nDambrug\nGroeningebrug near the AlbertPark\nRonde van Vlaanderenbrug near the new Nelson Mandelapark\nCollegebrug referring to the St Amands college\nNoordbrug (2010)\nBudabrug\nReepbrug (to be constructed)More recently (2018), the banks in front of the Broel Towers were lowered to allow the public to enjoy the historic river banks along both sides of the River Lys (Leie). This area is now known as the Leieboorden (or Banks of the River Lys), a place for pedestrians with bars and restaurants.\n\n\n==== Other Smaller Waterways with Historic and Geological value ====\nSeveral small streams or Beken in and around Courtrai were of significant topological, historical and Geological value.\nLange Mere Mentioned in the Town accounts of 1412-13 as Langhe Meere.\nMosscher (High Mossher and Low Mosscher) ending in the Southern Moat (Sanderus Map mentions only the 'Mosscher as a single toponym.

The KULAK, a campus of the Catholic University of Leuven, is located in on the south edge of the city, in the Hoog Kortrijk quarter. Other institutes of higher education include the Katholieke Hogeschool Zuid-West-Vlaanderen (KATHO) and Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen (HOWEST) university colleges. There is also a campus of Ghent University.\n\n\n== European cooperation ==\nEven though Kortrijk is a Dutch-speaking town, it borders Wallonia, and is only 9 km (5.6 mi) away from the border with France. This has created an urban area that extends across linguistic and national borders. The mayors of Lille, Kortrijk and Tournai met in Kortrijk on 28 January 2008 to sign a document creating the first European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation within the EU. The purpose of this organisation is to facilitate the movement of people within this area of nearly 2 million people.\n\nKortrijk is a member of the Eurotowns network\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Theatres and concert venues ===\n\nKortrijk has several cultural centres, each comprising different locations:\nCultural Centre Kortrijk\nCity Theatre (De Schouwburg, see picture), a neo-Renaissance architecture theatre known for its glass ceiling, an artwork of the French-Algerian artist Alberola\nArenatheatre\nAntigone Theatre\nBuda Kunstencentrum (Buda Arts Centre), comprising the cinema Budascoop, the artist residence Tacktower and the artist creation space Budafactory\nThe Concertstudio\nMusic Centre Track*\nConcert venue De Kreun\nCinemas\nKinepolis, a modern cinema multiplex with 10 screens.\nBudascoop, a 5 screen cinema, specialised in European movies.\n\n\n=== Festivals and events ===\nThe city is host to some sizable cultural events such as:\n\nDay of the Flemish Community (11 July)\nGolden River City Jazz Festival (first weekend of September)\nHumorologie: cabaret festival\nNext: arts festival in the Eurodistrict Kortrijk-Lille-Tournai\nHappy New Ears: festival of experimental modern music\nBudafest: theatre festival\nThe Internationaal Festival van Vlaanderen (April\u2013May): several concerts of classical and modern music.\nNovarock: rock festival in Kortrijk Xpo\nEaster Carnival (Paasfoor): during the weeks after Easter\nSinxenfestival: one of the most vivid festivals downtown with street artists, concerts and flea markets all over town\nKortrijk Cong\u00e9 (July)\nAlcatraz Hard Rock & Metal Festival (August)\nSummer Carnival (weekend in August)\nStudent Welcome Concert: rock festival to celebrate the start of the new academic year at the Kortrijk University and the Kortrijk Colleges.Also, trade shows and events such as the international Design Fair Interieur, Busworld and the Eurodogshow take place in the Kortrijk Xpo event center.

        "wiki": "Hill 60 is a World War I battlefield memorial site and park in the Zwarteleen area of Zillebeke south of Ypres, Belgium. It is located about 4.6 kilometres (2.9 mi) from the centre of Ypres and directly on the railway line to Comines. Before World War I the hill was known locally as C\u00f4te des Amants (French for Lover's Knoll). The site comprises two areas of raised land separated by the railway line; the northern area was known by soldiers as Hill 60 while the southern part was known as The Caterpillar.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\n\nThe high ground of Hill 60, south of Zillebeke, was created in the 1850s by spoil dumped from the cutting for the railway line between Ypres and Comines. The line opened in March 1854 and formed part of the La Madeleine\u2013Comines railway from the French Nord-Pas-de-Calais region into Belgian Flanders.The earth excavated during the building of the railway was dumped on either side of the embankment and formed hillocks. On the west side, a long irregular mound atop the ridge was called The Caterpillar and a smaller mound 300 yards (270 m) down the slope towards Zillebeke, was known as The Dump. On the east side of the cutting, at the highest point of the ridge, was a third mound known as Hill 60, about 60 feet (18 m) above sea level, from which First World War artillery observers had an excellent view of the ground around Zillebeke and Ypres. Artillery-fire and mine explosions during the war changed the shape of the hill and flattened it considerably. Today the peak of Hill 60 is only about 4 metres (13 ft) higher than the vicinity.The ground south of Zillebeke rises for about 2,000 yards (1,800 m) to a ridge between Zwarteleen and Zandvoorde. Roads run north-west to south-east through the area, from Ypres to Verbrandenmoelen and Hollebeke as well as from Zillebeke to Zwartelen and Zandvoorde. The Ypres\u2013Comines railway ran roughly parallel to the roads from Ypres and 600 yards (550 m) outside Zillebeke, was a cutting 15\u201320 feet (4.6\u20136.1 m) deep, which extended beyond the crest of the ridge, the earth from which had formed Hill 60. Some 1.2 kilometres (0.75 mi) further south is The Bluff and some 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi) south-west is St. Eloi.\n\n\n== World War I ==\n\n\n=== 1914 ===\n\n\n==== November ====\n\nDuring the First World War, Hill 60 was a small promontory on the edge of the Ypres Salient, with good views for the Germans across the British lines into Ypres, which gave it great tactical significance. During the First Battle of Ypres in late 1914, Hill 60 was held by the Moussy Detachment (General Vidal), which had been depleted by the transfer of three battalions to Langemarck. On 11 November, during the Battle of Nonne Bosschen, the detachment repulsed German attacks until noon, when the left flank units of the German 30th Division forced the French back to Hill 60 and Verbrandenmolen. No French or British reserves or reinforcements were available until the French 7th Hussars dismounted at Zillebeke and counter-attacked, carrying the remaining infantry of the detachment along in the rush. The French line was re-established from a bridge near Voormezeele to Verbrandenmolen and Zwarteleen, which was still only 3,000 yards (2,700 m) from Ypres. The German account recorded that Hill 60 had been captured but Lieutenant-General Dubois (the 9e Corps d'Arm\u00e9e commander) and other witnesses denied this. When British troops relieved the French in the area on the night of 1/2 February 1915, the hill was certainly held by the Germans.\n\n\n=== 1915 ===\n\n\n==== Second Battle of Ypres ====\n\nOn 17 February 1915, British sappers blew a small mine at Hill 60 which they had taken over from the French, but without great effect. The Germans retaliated with a small mine at Zwarteleen, but were driven out of the British positions. On 21 February, however, they blew a large mine nearby, killing forty-seven men and ten officers of the 16th Lancers. In mid-March the Germans blew another large mine at Zwarteleen, creating a 9.1-metre (30 ft)  deep crater and damaging their own lines in the process. In the spring of 1915, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, St Eloi and The Bluff which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers.After the Battle of Gravenstafel Ridge (22\u201323 April 1915) the British planned a local withdrawal to less exposed positions roughly 3 miles (4.8 km) distant from Ypres. The new line was to run from Hill 60 northwards to Hooge on the Ypres\u2013Menin road, thence to Frezenberg Ridge, Mouse Trap Farm and then back to the Ypres\u2013Yser canal. Large working parties from the 28th Division and the 50th (Northumbrian) Division began to dig the new line under cover of darkness and the retirement from the eastern side of the salient took place on the night of 1/2 May, during the Battle of St. Julien (24 April \u2013 5 May). The 27th Division took over the area from just west of Hill 60, to about 0.5-mile (0.80 km) short of the Ypres\u2013Roulers railway. The Germans followed up their success by attacking again at the Battle of Frezenberg Ridge (8\u201313 May), which gained Frezenberg, Verlorenhoek and the vicinity but attacks south of the Menin road gained very little ground.\n\n\n==== Capture of Hill 60 ====\n\nIn spring 1915, earlier French preparations to raid the hill were continued by the British 28th Division, which took over the line in February 1915 and then by the 5th Division (Major-General Thomas Morland). The Allied plan to attack Hill 60 was expanded into an ambitious attempt to capture the hill, despite advice that Hill 60 could not be held unless The Caterpillar nearby was also occupied. A French 3 by 2 feet (0.91 m \u00d7 0.61 m) mine gallery under the hill was extended by experienced miners from Northumberland and Wales, after it was found that Hill 60 was the only place in the area not waterlogged.In the first attack of the newly formed Royal Engineer tunnelling companies in the Ypres Salient, the 173rd Tunnelling Company laid six mines by 10 April 1915, an operation planned by Major-General Edward Bulfin, commander of the 28th Division and continued by the 5th Division after the 28th Division was relieved. The 173rd Tunnelling Company began work early in March and three tunnels were begun towards the German line about 50 yards (46 m) away, a pit first having been dug some 16 feet (4.9 m) deep; the tunnels were more than 100 yards (91 m) long. Two more mines in the north were charged with 2,000 pounds (910 kg) of explosives each, two mines in the centre had 2,700 pounds (1,200 kg) charges and in the south, one mine was packed with 500 pounds (230 kg) of guncotton, although work on it had been stopped when it ran close to a German tunnel. The attack began on 17 April and the 5th Division captured the area quickly with only seven casualties but found that the new salient made permanent occupation of the hill very costly.\n\n\n==== Loss of Hill 60 ====\n\nOn 1 May, after a bombardment by heavy artillery, the Germans released chlorine gas at 7:00 p.m., from positions fewer than 100 yards (91 m) away from Hill 60, on a front of 0.25-mile (0.40 km). The gas arrived so quickly that most of the British were unable to put on their improvised respirators. As soon the gas arrived, the Germans attacked from the flanks with bombing parties and artillery laid a barrage on the British approaches to the hill. Some of the British returned fire and reinforcements arrived by rushing through the gas cloud and bombing parties forced the Germans back. The original garrison lost many casualties in standing their ground, including many gas casualties.The 5th Division held the hill on a 1.25 miles (2.01 km) front with the 15th Brigade on 5 May, when the Germans discharged gas from two places opposite the hill at 8:45 a.m. The wind blew the gas along, rather than across, the British defences and only one sentry was able to sound the gas alarm. The British defence plan required troops under gas attack to move to the flanks but the course of the gas cloud made this impossible. The gas hung so thick that it was impossible to remain in the trenches and troops who stood their ground were overcome. The German 30th Division advanced fifteen minutes after the gas cloud and occupied nearly all of the front line on the lower slope of the hill. British reinforcements bombed up a communication trench and two more battalions were sent forward but before they arrived, the Germans released another gas cloud at 11:00 a.m. to the north-east of the hill.\n\nThe right flank of the Zwarteleen Salient was overrun, which increased the gap left by the first discharge; a few men on the left delayed the German infantry until 12:30 p.m., when a battalion advanced through the gas cloud and an artillery barrage. Constant counter-attacks forced some of the Germans back and regained several lost trenches. The Germans held on to the crest and released more gas at 7:00 p.m., which had little effect and an infantry attack which followed was repulsed by rifle-fire. At 9:00 p.m., the 13th Brigade arrived and attacked at 10:00 p.m. after a short bombardment the darkness, state of the ground and alert German infantry repulsed the attack, except for a party which reached the top of the hill, then withdrew at 1:00 a.m. under enfilade-fire from the Caterpillar and Zwarteleen, which made the hill untenable. Both sides were exhausted and spent the next day digging-in. At dawn on 7 May, the British attacked with two companies of infantry and attached \"bombers\" using hand grenades, all of whom were killed or captured.  From 22 April \u2013 31 May 1915, the British had 59,275 casualties in the Second Battle of Ypres and the fighting for Hill 60.\n\n\n==== December ====\n\nOn 19 December 1915, the 50th Division was due to relieve the 9th (Scottish) Division from Hill 60 to near the Menin Road, an area where skirmishing, raiding and mining by both sides never stopped. At 5:00 a.m., a German artillery and gas bombardment began on the north side of the Ypres salient and the gas reached the 50th Division positions behind the 9th Division, which forced the men to don their eye protectors but not gas helmets. German artillery-fire fell all round the salient and at noon the 50th Division received an order to stand down, as the attack had been limited to the areas of the 6th Division and 49th Division further north. The German bombardment continued all day but the relief took place in the evening, with the 149th Brigade taking over on the right, just west of Hill 60 with the 5th and 6th battalions, Northumberland Fusiliers, in positions only a few feet from German advanced posts; Christmas Day was spent in cold, mud and under showers of rain.\n\n\n=== 1916 ===\n\n\n==== February\u2013March ====\n\nMaintaining field fortifications in the Ypres Salient over the winter of 1915\u20131916 was an endless task, as trenches flooded and collapsed, dugouts were swamped and communications were cut. Immediate repairs were necessary but had to be done at night, under constant harassing fire. Artillery and snipers from both sides were always active and patrols went out each night. Mining and counter-mining was constant, which kept trench garrisons under permanent strain, in fear of explosions which could occur anywhere without warning. Aircraft of both sides were overhead, except in the foulest weather, flying contact-patrol, photographic reconnaissance and artillery-observation sorties. On 12 February, two German raids were made on the 50th Division north of Hill 60 and on 14 February, the Germans attacked at Hooge against the 24th Division, on the left flank, which included a bombardment of trenches 37, 38 and 39 opposite Hill 60.Late in the afternoon the Germans sprung two mines near Trench 49 and Trench A1 which left two craters, one 15 feet (4.6 m) deep and 60 feet (18 m) wide but with no effect. An explosion at 6:00 p.m., near the end of Trench 41, blew up a bombing sap, killed 13 Green Howards and wounded another four; small raiding parties appeared but were shot down in no man's land. In the area of the 17th (Northern) Division on the right flank at The Bluff, the Germans took the front line held by the 51st Brigade, which fell back to the support line and made a counter-attack 15 February, which failed. For the rest of February the area around Hill 60 returned to \"normal\" siege warfare but preparations were made secretly to recapture The Bluff. The 50th Division participated in artillery-bombardments, grenade attacks and trench mortaring to convince the Germans that an attack was being prepared against Hill 60, demonstrations which continued into March.\n\n\n==== April ====\nAfter a month in reserve, the 23rd Division returned to the front line at Hill 60 to relieve the 47th (1/2nd London) Division and part of the 39th Division between 1 and 9 April, from Henry Street to the railway cutting south-east of Verbrandenmolen, along the west slope of Hill 60 just below the crest, for 500 yards (460 m) to the north before turning east to Mount Sorrel and then north-east to St. Peter's Street on Observatory Ridge, a frontage of about 2,500 yards (2,300 m). At 9:00 a.m. on 9 April, German artillery began a bombardment until 5:45 p.m., obliterated most of the front line, isolated the right flank battalions and blew in the entrances to the tunnel leading to the British mining system.At 6:43 p.m. the German artillery opened fire again and the British infantry sent up SOS flares for artillery support, which began immediately but not swiftly enough to prevent German troops dashing forward and getting into the trenches of the left-hand company of the 8th Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment (8th York and Lancs), which had been reduced from 152\u201347 men by the bombardment. The survivors counter-attacked and then chased the raiding party into no man's land assisted by the right-hand company. Other German troops broke into the positions of the 11th Battalion Sherwood Foresters and reached the Deep Support Line 100 yards (91 m) further back. In the m\u00eal\u00e9e one of the tunnel entrances was cleared but troops posted to guard it were killed by a shell and German troops threw gas bombs into the gallery until some of the troops inside burst out and drove the Germans back with hand grenades. On the right flank raiders ran up Marshall Lane, parallel to the railway, bombed the entrances to subways and got close to the main mine shafts, just as reinforcements arrived from Battersea Farm and recaptured the lane.\n\n\n==== May ====\nFrom 24\u201328 May, the 50th Division returned to the front line from reserve and resumed the struggle for fire supremacy. The British gradually suppressed the German artillery but found that German trench mortar crews were much harder to defeat, particularly those manning a trench howitzer who fired 3\u20134 round bursts, which were unusually destructive and then took cover. The divisional artillery retaliated immediately but never managed to destroy the gun. By frequent night patrols and raids the division gained control of no man's land but German mining continued with intermittent success and a gas attack was carried out by the Germans on the night of 16/17 June.\n\n\n=== 1917 ===\n\n\n==== April\u2013May ====\nAt the end of April the 19th (Western) Division received orders for the 57th Brigade to relieve the 70th Brigade of the 23rd Division at Hill 60 and for the 58th Brigade to take over at Hooge. On the night of 2/3 May, the 57th Brigade took over with the 10th Royal Warwicks (10th Warwicks) on the right, 10th Worcesters in the centre, 8th North Staffs on the left and the 8th Gloucesters in reserve at the Railway Dugouts. The night of 8/9 May was quiet but in the morning a German trench mortar bombardment fell on the 10th Warwicks and in the afternoon observers reported that preparations for a raid could be seen. The Warwicks reported that much movement was seen in the German lines and that two officers on the Caterpillar with maps and sheets of paper, were thought to be sketching the British lines at 1:50 p.m., 2:55 p.m. and 5:10 p.m. In front of the Caterpillar, sandbags and two trees with white painted blobs could be seen facing the British lines. British units on the flanks were alerted and at 9:30 p.m. a German artillery and machine-gun bombardment began.No raiders appeared and at 11:10 p.m. the British stood down. At 3:30 p.m. on 10 May another bombardment fell on the 10th Warwicks and telephone communication with the battalion was lost. Scouts went forward and saw that the supporting positions were secure and the divisional artillery responded promptly to an SOS flare as rifle and machine-gun fire was opened by the British infantry. After the end of the German bombardment, the six man Lewis-gun squad in number 2 post of D Company, were found to be missing. The rest of the D Company posts were badly damaged and those of C Company were found undamaged. The C Company support line had been blown in, with several casualties. The British concluded that the vigilance of the 57th Brigade had prevented a big raid on the 8th Gloucesters who had taken over from the 10th Worcesters in the centre on the night of 6/7 May.\n\n\n==== June: Battle of Messines ====\n\nAfter the Battle of Hill 60 (April\u2013May 1915), Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers (RE) took up mining operations under the hill and the neighbouring ground on a much more ambitious scale. Deep mining under the German galleries beneath Hill 60 began in late August 1915, with the 175th Tunnelling Company, which began a gallery 220 yards (200 m) behind the British front line and passed 90 feet (27 m) beneath the German positions. The British underground works consisted of an access gallery (Berlin Tunnel) leading to two mine chambers, Hill 60 A (beneath Hill 60) and Hill 60 B (beneath The Caterpillar), to be loaded with explosives and detonated at the appointed time. The 3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company took over in April 1916 and completed the galleries, the Hill 60 mine being charged with explosives in July 1916 and the branch gallery under The Caterpillar in October.By October 1916, the mine under Hill 60 held 53,300 pounds (24,200 kg) of explosives and that under The Caterpillar 70,000 pounds (32,000 kg), despite water-logging and the demolition by a camouflet of 200 feet (61 m) of a German gallery above the British diggings, which endangered the British deep galleries. The 1st Australian Tunnelling Company took over in November 1916 and maintained the mines beneath Hill 60 and The Caterpillar over the winter and months of underground fighting until June 1917, when they were fired along with the rest of the mines under Messines Ridge at the beginning of the Battle of Messines (7\u201314 June 1917). When the mines were detonated at 3:10 a.m. on 7 June 1917, 990,000 pounds (450,000 kg) of explosives went off under the German positions, demolishing a large part of Hill 60 and killing c.\u200910,000 German soldiers between Ypres and Ploegsteert.\nSuddenly at dawn, as a signal for all of our guns to open fire, there rose out of the dark ridge of Messines and 'Whitesheet' and that ill-famed Hill 60, enormous volumes of scarlet flame [...] throwing up high towers of earth and smoke all lighted by the flame, spilling over into fountains of fierce colour, so that many of our soldiers waiting for the assault were thrown to the ground. The German troops were stunned, dazed and horror-stricken if there  [sic] were not killed outright. Many of them lay dead in the great craters opened by the mines.\nThe Battle of Messines was conducted by the British Second Army (General Herbert Plumer) and forced the German army to move reserves to Flanders from the Arras and Aisne fronts, which relieved pressure on the French. The objective of the attack was to capture the German defences on the ridge, which ran from Ploegsteert Wood in the south through Messines and Wytschaete to Mount Sorrel and deprive the 4th Army of the high ground south of Ypres. The ridge commanded the British defences and back areas further north, from which the British intended to conduct the \"Northern Operation\", an advance to Passchendaele Ridge, then capture the Belgian coast up to the Dutch frontier.\n\n\n=== 1918 ===\n\n\n==== Battle of the Lys ====\n\nDuring the German Spring Offensive, the 9th (Scottish) Division lost 50 percent of its infantry and was transferred to Flanders,  to hold a quiet front while recovering from its losses and incorporating fresh drafts from Britain. The South African Brigade was down to about 1,300 men with few replacements and went into reserve around Ridge Wood. The division came under the command of IX Corps (Lieutenant-General Alexander Hamilton-Gordon) of the Second Army and began to relieve part of the 1st Australian Division on the night of 3/4 April, on a 3,000 yards (2,700 m) front, from Hollebeke, over the Ypres\u2013Comines Canal, to Bulgar Wood. (Hill 60 was well behind the front line, having been captured during the Battle of Messines in June 1917.)The ground north of the canal was considered the most vulnerable to attack, since it was the southern flank of the Passchendaele Salient and Zandvoorde Ridge provided cover for troops concentrating to attack Klein Zillibeke Spur and Hill 60. South of the canal was a reserve line of well-wired posts towards The Stables to the south-west, backed by the White Ch\u00e2teau on a commanding rise, which had been fortified. From The Stables, two thick belts of barbed wire ran south-east and south-west, behind which were some posts with scratch garrisons, due to the need adequately to garrison Hill 60, The Bluff and White Ch\u00e2teau.\n\n\n==== Fifth Battle of Ypres ====\n\nThe 35th Division came into line opposite the hill in early September and commenced patrols and raids into the German lines opposite on 4 September. On 13 September, there was an increase in German artillery-fire and on 15 September, the division advanced 600\u20131,000 yards (550\u2013910 m) closer to the hill in a night attack, against variable opposition from the 40th Saxon Division On 28 September, the Second Army attacked with the Belgian Army to the north and the 35th Division met little opposition from the Germans opposite, 650 of whom surrendered. The 104th Brigade advanced in the centre of the division and met only slight opposition in its advance east of Hill 60 and The Caterpillar. By 8:30 a.m. the Brigade had reached a line from Klein Zillebeke to Canada Tunnels. Patrols pushed on and captured Jehovah Trench, then three field guns about 1,000 yards (910 m) east of Klein Zillebeke.\n\n\n== Post-war ==\nIn 1920, Hill 60 was bought by Lieutenant-Colonel Cawston who later sold a half share in it to J. Calder. In 1930, Calder donated his share of Hill 60 to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission), which maintains it as a battlefield memorial park.\n\n\n== World War II ==\n\n\n=== 1940 ===\nTwenty-two years after the end of World War I, the area at Hill 60 was fought over again when the 17th Brigade of the British 5th Infantry Division stopped the advance of three German divisions from 27\u201328 May 1940, which saved the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) during the Second World War. On 27 May 1940, part of A Company of the 2nd Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers (2nd RSF) were dug in  on the hill. The hill was subjected to a tremendous mortar and artillery barrage (Coy HQ in and around the concrete bunker near the top of the hill) and there was hand-to-hand fighting on the nearby Zwarteleen crossroads, when a fighting patrol from 2nd RSF set off to destroy German machine gun and mortar positions there. The patrol enabled the evacuation of the defences on the railway, a withdrawal to the canal line and a general withdrawal towards St Eloi, Kemmel and Dikkebus. Other companies of the 2nd RSF held the railway line between Hill 60 and the canal bridge. The 2nd Inniskillings were to their right and rear, on the main road, D Company of the 2nd RSF was in reserve and the 6th Seaforths held \"the Dump\". Constant attacks by three German divisions were repulsed during 28 May, which reduced the two 5th Division brigades to c.\u2009600 men each and exhausted the artillery ammunition of I Corps. The division held the \"Dunkirk corridor\" open for another day, which saved II Corps and the rest of the BEF. Thousands more troops were able to withdraw into the Dunkirk perimeter and the 5th Division then moved to the Yser with the 42nd Division, to fill the gap left when the Belgian army capitulated.\nDuring this action the large WW1 constructed observation bunker was also badly damaged by German PAK anti tank gun munitions and the Queen Victoria's Rifles Memorial was so badly damaged it later required reconstruction.\n\n\n=== 1944 ===\nPierre Marchant and Lucien Olivier, members of the French resistance from La Madeleine (now a suburb of Lille), were shot by German soldiers near Hill 60 on 2 September 1944, after trying to escape from a prisoner transport by train. Marchant and Olivier had been driving a lorry loaded with munitions for the Resistance in their home town when they were arrested by the SS and put on a train to Belgium. When their train stopped between Zillebeke and Hollebeke, to await the arrival of an extra engine from Ypres, to haul the train over the incline, Marchant and Olivier were killed by the Germans and their bodies thrown off the train. The mortal remains were found by locals about 200 metres (220 yd) from Hill 60. Marchant and Olivier were buried temporarily at Zillebeke and repatriated to France after the war. A memorial was erected near the railway line at Hill 60 in 1969, which was refurbished and rededicated in the presence of their family members in 2004.\n\n\n== Later history ==\n\nHill 60 and The Caterpillar are designated a battlefield memorial site and open to the public. The area was merged into the municipality of Zillebeke in 1970 and into the city of Ypres in 1976. In spring 2015, extensive repairs were carried out at the memorial park.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\n\nThere are several memorials on Hill 60, that to the Australian Tunnelling Companies, that to Queen Victoria's Rifles, that to the 14th (Light) Division, and to French resistance fighters killed here during the Second World War. It is also known that at least one veteran of World War I, Mr P. G. Arnold from Birmingham, had asked his widow to scatter his ashes here after his death in 1931.\n\n\n=== Hill 60 Battlefield Memorial Park ===\nIn the collapsed tunnels beneath Hill 60, many British and German dead are buried. The Belgian government made the hill and the surrounding enclosure a battlefield memorial site and to preserve it, far as nature permits, in the state in which it was left after World War I. The park at the memorial site is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC). The memorial park also has the remains of several bunkers and craters from the fighting from 1915\u20131917. A large concrete bunker in the centre of the site is preserved almost as it was found at the end of the war. This bunker was originally German, but modified by the Australians in 1918.Also on Hill 60 is a stone plaque which gives the following summary,\n\nHill 60, the scene of bitter fighting, was held by German troops from the 16th December 1914 to the 17th April 1915, when it was captured (after the explosion of five mines) by the British 5th Division. on the following 5th May it was recaptured by the German XV Corps. it remained in German hands until the battle of Messines (7th June 1917) when, after many months of underground fighting, two mines were exploded here; and at the end of April 1918, after the battles of the Lys, it passed into German hands again. it was finally retaken by British troops under the command of H. M. King of the Belgians on the 28th September 1918. In the broken tunnels beneath this enclosure many British and German dead were buried, and the hill is therefore preserved, so far as nature will permit, in the state in which it was left after the great war.\n\n\n=== Queen Victoria's Rifles Memorial ===\nThe memorial to the Queen Victoria's Rifles (9th Battalion The London Regiment) is located within the Hill 60 Battlefield Memorial Park. It was replaced after the original was damaged during the Second World War. On the night of 20\u201321 April 1915, Second Lieutenant Geoffrey Harold Woolley and a handful of men were the only defenders on the hill and continually repelled attacks on their position. He encouraged the men to hold the line against heavy enemy machine gun fire and shellfire. For a time he was the only officer on the hill. When he and his men were relieved on the morning of 21 April only 14 out of a company of 150 had survived. For his gallantry he was awarded the Victoria Cross, the first to be awarded to a Territorial Force officer.The Queen Victoria's Rifles (QVR) had arrived in Le Havre on 5 November 1914 and were one of the first Territorial battalions to serve in France; they were attached to the 5th Division. On 17 April 1915, an attack was mounted on Hill 60 by the 13th Infantry Brigade which included the 2nd King\u2019s Own Scottish Borderers, the 2nd Duke of Wellington\u2019s West Riding Regiment, the 1st Queen\u2019s Own Royal West Kent Regiment, the 2nd King\u2019s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and the Queen Victoria's Rifles (9th London Regiment). Prior to the attack, the hill had been undermined with five galleries being driven under the German positions. The plan was to detonate the mines under the hill to destroy the enemy and their positions, after which the 13th Infantry Brigade would occupy the area. Hill 60 was captured on 17 April 1915 and on 20 April, two and a half companies of the QVRs were ordered up to the front line as the enemy made a counter-attack. At dawn on 21 April 1915, the Germans began bombarding the QVRs with hand grenades. Casualties were heavy, including two officers, Major Lees and Lieutenant Summerhays, who were killed. It was then that Woolley left a position of safety to take command of the soldiers on Hill 60. The QVRs remained in France for the rest of the war and their losses are remembered at Hill 60 by the QVR memorial and at the nearby QVR caf\u00e9 and museum.\n\n\n=== 1st Australian Tunnelling Company Memorial ===\nThis memorial commemorates the men of the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company who gave their lives in the tunnelling and defensive operations in this area from 1915\u20131918. The memorial is located next to the entrance gate of the Hill 60 Battlefield Memorial Park. The inscription reads\n\nIn memoriam of officers and men of the 1st Australian Tunnelling Coy who gave their lives in the mining and defensive operations of Hill 60 1915\u20131918 / this monument replaces that originally erected in April 1919 by their comrades in arms / 1923\n\n\n=== 14th (Light) Division Memorial ===\nThis memorial commemorates the men of the 14th (Light) Division who gave their lives in fighting in this area from 1915\u20131918. The memorial is located outside the Hill 60 Battlefield Memorial Park, between the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company Memorial and the French Resistance Memorial.\n\n\n=== French Resistance Memorial ===\nThis memorial commemorates Pierre Marchant and Lucien Olivier, two members of the French resistance from La Madeleine (now a suburb of Lille) who were killed here by Germans on 2 September 1944. A memorial to Marchant and Olivier was erected in 1969. It was refurbished and rededicated in the presence of their family members in 2004. The memorial is located outside the Hill 60 Battlefield Memorial Park, in between the 14th (Light) Division Memorial and the bridge over the railway tracks between Hill 60 and The Caterpillar.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nBeneath Hill 60: a 2010 Australian war film, directed by Jeremy Sims and written by David Roach, tells the story of the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company. The screenplay is based on an account written by Captain Oliver Woodward, who is portrayed by Brendan Cowell.\nThe standing area on the railway end of Croke Park, Dublin, Ireland was formerly a mound of earth known as \"Hill 60.\" It was later decided inappropriate to have a stand named after a British Army battleground, so it was renamed \"Hill 16\" after the 1916 Rising.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== Landscape ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Fortifications ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMines in the Battle of Messines (1917)\nList of World War I memorials and cemeteries in Flanders\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto essay\nHill 60 Memorial and its History\nIntroduction to Hill 60\nTunnels at Hill 60\nNew York Times, 21 April 1915\nIeper: The Second Battle of Ypres April 1915 Account of events at Hill 60\nFirst World War.com \u2013 Feature Articles \u2013 The Capture of Hill 60 in 1915\nBeneath Hill 60, film\nUpclose: The man that went Beneath Hill 60\nAustralian Official History, Appendix No. 1, The Mines at Hill 60\nDuffy, M.

The station is primarily used for international Eurostar and long-distance SNCF TGV services, although some high-speed regional trains also call at the station.\nThe station was built in 1993 to be used as a through station for trains between the UK, Belgium, and the Netherlands, as well as French TGV services, except those coming from Paris which normally terminate at Lille-Flandres. There is a 400 m (1,300 ft) walking distance between the two stations, which are also adjacent stops on the Lille Metro.\n\n\n== Connections ==\nFor travellers from the United Kingdom to destinations not served directly by Eurostar, connections are available here on trains towards Disneyland Paris, Charles de Gaulle International Airport, Lyon, Valence, then Avignon, Aix-en-Provence, Marseille St. Charles (and also on to Cannes and Nice); and N\u00eemes, Montpellier and Perpignan.\nAfter the 'Additional Protocol to the Sangatte Protocol' was signed by France and the United Kingdom on 29 May 2000, juxtaposed controls were set up in the station. Eurostar passengers travelling to the UK clear exit checks from the Schengen Area (carried out by the French Border Police) as well as UK entry checks (conducted by the UK Border Force) in the station before boarding their train.\n\n\n== Train services ==\nThe following services call at Lille Europe:\n\nInternational high-speed services (Eurostar) London - Lille - Brussels\nInternational high-speed services (Eurostar) London - Lille - Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e (Disneyland Paris)\nInternational high-speed services (Thalys) Amsterdam - Rotterdam -Antwerp - Brussels - Lille\nHigh-speed services (TGV) Calais - Lille - Paris\nHigh-speed services (TGV) (Rang-du-Fliers -) Boulogne - Calais - Lille - Paris\nHigh-speed services (TGV) Dunkerque - Lille - Paris\nHigh-speed services (TGV) Lille - A\u00e9roport CDG - Lyon - Marseille - Cannes - Nice\nHigh-speed services (TGV) Lille - A\u00e9roport CDG - Lyon - N\u00eemes - Montpellier\nHigh-speed services (TGV) Lille - A\u00e9roport CDG - Tours - Bordeaux\nHigh-speed services (TGV) Lille - A\u00e9roport CDG - Le Mans - Rennes\nHigh-speed services (TGV) Lille - A\u00e9roport CDG - Le Mans - Angers - Nantes\nHigh-speed services (TGV) Lille - Arras - A\u00e9roport CDG - Lyon - N\u00eemes - Montpellier\nHigh-speed services (TGV) Lille - Arras - A\u00e9roport CDG - Lyon - Marseille\nInternational high-speed services (TGV) Brussels - Lille - A\u00e9roport CDG - Lyon - Marseille - Nice\nInternational high-speed services (TGV) Brussels - Lille - A\u00e9roport CDG - Lyon - N\u00eemes - Montpellier - Perpignan\nHigh-speed regional services (TER GV) Dunkirk - Lille\nHigh-speed regional services (TER GV) Rang-du-Fliers - Boulogne - Calais - Lille\n\n\n== Ouibus ==\nSince 23 July 2012, SNCF's international coach network, Ouibus, serves Lille Europe.\nCoach services from Lille are:\n\nParis - Lille\nParis - Lille - Brussels\nParis - Lille - Amsterdam\nParis - Lille - London\n\n\n== See also ==\nLille-Flandres station\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLille-Europe station at \"Gares & Connexions\", the official website of SNCF (in French)\nTimetables TER Nord-Pas-de-Calais (in French)",

        "wiki": "The Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (Latin: Institutum Christi Regis Summi Sacerdotis, French: Institut du Christ Roi Souverain Pr\u00eatre) is a Roman Catholic society of apostolic life of pontifical right in communion with the Holy See of the Catholic Church. The institute has the stated goal of honoring God and the sanctification of priests in the service of the Catholic Church and souls. An integral part of the institute\u2019s charism is the use of the traditional Latin liturgy of 1962 for Mass and the other sacraments. It has undertaken the restoration of a number of historic church buildings.\nThe institute's rule of life is based generally on that of the secular canons. Its stated mission is the defense and propagation of the reign of Christ in all areas of human life, both private and social.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nThe institute was canonically erected on 1 September 1990 by Gilles Wach and Philippe Mora in Gabon, Africa, where the institute still has missions, notably in the capital Libreville. Its canonical status was of diocesan right until 7 October 2008. On that date it was granted the status of pontifical right by decree, titled \"Saeculorum Rex\", of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, on the occasion of the visit of Camille Perl, vice-president of the commission. Deacons and priests are incardinated into the institute, whose prior general has the right to call to orders. The institute is currently based in Gricigliano, Italy, in the Archdiocese of Florence. The international seminary of St. Philip Neri is also located there.Wach currently serves as prior general and Mora as rector of the seminary. Both received their priestly formation under Cardinal Giuseppe Siri of Genoa. As of 2018 the institute numbered 114 priests. The Institute also includes clerical oblates, who go through formation but are not ordained as priests, and who help in the several apostolates of the Institute.The charism of the institute is based on the example of its three patron saints:\n\nSaint Francis de Sales, who emphasized teaching the Catholic faith with patience and charity, and encouraging all Catholics to seek a life of holiness through the ordinary means of the church, such as devout attendance at Mass and frequent confession.\nSaint Benedict, with his love for the solemn celebration of the liturgy, his emphasis on work and prayer, his \"Benedictine hospitality\", and his role in laying the groundwork for an integral Christian civilization in medieval Europe.\nSaint Thomas Aquinas, with his emphasis on the harmony between faith and reason.The institute also honors as its primary patroness the Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception. St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus is the patroness of its African missions.\n\n\n== Apostolates ==\nIn the United States, the institute is located in Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, with its national headquarters in Chicago. In Chicago, the institute is restoring the historic St. Clara/St. Gelasius Church on Carmelite Way. Upon completion it will become the Shrine of Christ the King.Its oldest United States apostolate is St. Mary Oratory in Rockford, Illinois, and its newest is Most Precious Blood of Jesus parish in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In Kansas City, Missouri, in 2005, Bishop Robert Finn established an oratory (a public church where the Mass and other rites may be administered) for the institute at a historic church otherwise in danger of being closed. The superior for the United States is Canon Matthew Talarico.\n\nThe institute is active in the dioceses of  Liverpool, Lancaster, Shrewsbury and East Anglia in Great Britain; in 2011 the Bishop of Shrewsbury invited the institute to re-open the church of Saints Peter, Paul and Philomena in New Brighton. \nSince St. Patrick's Day, 17 March 2006, the institute has had a presence in the Diocese of Limerick in the Republic of Ireland. In Limerick they purchased Sacred Heart Church, Since May 2010, the institute in Ireland has expanded into the diocese of Galway where weekly Mass is offered at St Mary on the Hill, Claddagh. Monthly Masses are offered by priests of the Institute in Ennis every first Sunday of the month and in Belfast every second Sunday of the month. The Institute is closely involved in the annual Catholic Voice conference held in Limerick which features amongst its regular speakers Cardinal Burke and Fr. John Hunwicke.\nIn addition to its oratories in the United States and missions in Africa, the institute also has apostolates in France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The institute is especially active in the domain of education, running schools in France (Montpellier, Lille and Versailles), Belgium (Brussels International Catholic School), and Africa.\nDuring its yearly ordinations week in Italy, the institute has had visits by Cardinals Raymond Leo Burke, Antonio Ca\u00f1izares Llovera, Dar\u00edo Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos, Giuseppe Siri and Archbishop Camille Perl.\n\n\n== Sisters Adorers of the Royal Heart of Jesus ==\n\nThe Adorers of the Royal Heart of Jesus Christ Sovereign Priest are a women's community (founded in 2001) associated with the institute. They are also based in Gricigliano. The sisters are non-cloistered contemplatives, and their way of life is based on the Benedictine tradition. The community celebrates Mass and the Divine Office using the traditional Roman Rite. When the number of sisters has increased sufficiently, the community plans to locate convents near the institute's churches, where the sisters will perform apostolic work such as teaching. As of 2017, the sisters numbered 42. The sisters have established a presence in Germany.Mass and the Divine Office celebrated in the pre-Vatican II Roman form, form the rhythm of each day. Needlework and embroidery projects form an important part of their daily \"Ora et Labora\" (\"pray and work\").\n\n\n== Society of the Sacred Heart ==\nThe Society of the Sacred Heart is a lay society associated with the Institute of Christ the King. The lay members of the society pledge to live according to a modified Benedictine rule, within their vocation. Through membership in the society, lay faithful participate in the spiritual and social missions of the institute through prayer, devotions, spiritual direction, and study of the spiritual writings of St. Francis de Sales. \n\n\n== Superiors ==\nGilles Wach is the founder and prior general. \nPhilippe Mora is the co-founder and rector of the international St. Philip Neri seminary in Gricigliano.\nRudolf Michael Schmitz is the vicar general of the institute and provincial of the German-speaking countries.\n\n\n== Choir dress ==\nThe institute has its own choir dress, adopted in 2006, which it received from Cardinal Ennio Antonelli, Archbishop of Florence.\n\nCanons, superiors, and the prior general\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nConsecrated life\nInstitutes of consecrated life\nReligious institute (Catholic)\nSecular institute\nVocational Discernment in the Catholic Church\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInstitute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest\nSisters Adorers of the Royal Heart of Jesus\nSociety of the Sacred HeartInternational linksItalian\nFrench\nGerman\nSpanish\nIrish",

        "wiki": "Tournai ( toor-NAY, French: [tu\u0281n\u025b]; Picard: Tornai; Walloon: Torn\u00e8 [t\u0254\u0280n\u025b] (listen); Latin: Tornacum), known in Dutch as Doornik and historically as Dornick in English, is a Walloon municipality of Belgium, 85 kilometres (53 miles) southwest of Brussels on the river Scheldt. In the province of Hainaut, Tournai is part of Eurometropolis Lille\u2013Kortrijk\u2013Tournai, which had 2,155,161 residents in 2008.Tournai is one of the oldest cities in Belgium and has played an important role in the country's cultural history.  It was the first capital of the Frankish Empire, with Clovis I being born here.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTournai is located in the Wallonia Picarde (Picard language) and Romance Flanders region of Belgium, at the southern limit of the Flemish plain, in the basin of the River Scheldt (Escaut in French, Schelde in Dutch).  Administratively, the town is part of the Province of Hainaut, itself part of Wallonia. It is also a municipality that is part of the French-speaking Community of Belgium. Tournai has its own arrondissements, both administrative and judicial.\nIts area of 213.75 square kilometres (82.53 square miles) makes it the largest municipality in size in Belgium; it is also the largest in population in Western Hainaut. The municipality of Tournai consists of the former municipalities of \nEre, Saint-Maur, Orcq, Esplechin, Froyennes, Froidmont, Willemeau, Ramegnies-Chin, Templeuve, Chercq, Blandain, Hertain, Lamain, Marquain, Gaurain-Ramecroix, Havinnes, Beclers, Thimougies, Barry, Maulde, Vaulx, Vezon, Kain, Melles, Quartes, Rumillies, Mont-Saint-Aubert, Mourcourt and Warchin.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nRocks from the Tournai area date from the Carboniferous Period and have been used to define the Tournaisian Age, a subdivision of the Carboniferous lasting from 359 to 345 million years ago. Tournai stone is a dark limestone which takes a polish and was used particularly in the Romanesque period for sculpted items such as Tournai fonts. It is also hard enough to have been used locally for pavements and kerb-stones. It is sometimes called Tournai marble, though this is geologically inaccurate.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTournai, known as Tornacum, was a place of minor importance in Roman times, a stopping place where the Roman road from Cologne on the Rhine to Boulogne on the coast crossed the river Scheldt. It was fortified under Maximian in the 3rd century AD, when the Roman limes was withdrawn to the string of outposts along the road. It came into the possession of the Salian Franks in 432. Under king Childeric I, whose tomb was discovered there in 1653, Tournai was the capital of the Frankish empire. In 486, Clovis moved the center of power to Paris. In turn, a native son of Tournai, Eleutherius, became bishop of the newly created bishopric of Tournai, extending over most of the area west of the Scheldt. In 862 Charles the Bald, first king of Western Francia and still to become Holy Roman Emperor, would make Tournai the seat of the County of Flanders.\n\nAfter the partition of the Frankish empire by the Treaties of Verdun (843) and of Meerssen (870), Tournai remained in the western part of the empire, which in 987 became France. The city participated in 11th-century rise of towns in the Low Countries, with a woollen cloth industry based on English wool, which soon made it attractive to wealthy merchants. An ambitious rebuilding of the cathedral was initiated in 1030. The commune's drive for independence from the local counts succeeded in 1187, and the city was henceforth directly subordinated to the French Crown, as the seigneurie de Tournaisis, as the city's environs are called. The stone Pont des Trous over the Scheldt, with defensive towers at either end, was built in 1290, replacing an earlier wooden structure.\nDuring the 15th century, the city's textile trade boomed and it became an important supplier of tapestry. The art of painting flourished too: Jacques Daret, Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden all came from Tournai. It was captured in 1513 by Henry VIII of England, making it the only Belgian city ever to have been ruled by England. It was also represented in the 1515 Parliament of England. The city was handed back to French rule in 1519, following the Treaty of London (1518).\n\nIn 1521, Emperor Charles V added the city to his possessions in the Low Countries, leading to a period of religious strife and economic decline. During the 16th century, Tournai was a bulwark of Calvinism, but eventually it was conquered by the Spanish governor of the Low Countries, the Duke of Parma, following a prolonged siege in 1581. After the fall of the city, its Protestant inhabitants were given one year to sell their possessions and emigrate, a policy that was at the time considered relatively humane, since very often religious opponents were simply massacred.\nOne century later, in 1668, the city briefly returned to France under Louis XIV in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. After the end of the War of Spanish Succession in 1713, under terms of the Treaty of Utrecht the former Spanish Netherlands, including Tournai, came into possession of the Austrian Habsburgs. In 1794, France annexed the Austrian Netherlands during the French Revolutionary Wars and Tournai became part of the department of Jemmape. From 1815 on, following the Napoleonic Wars, Tournai formed part of the United Netherlands and after 1830 of newly independent Belgium. Badly damaged in 1940, Tournai has since been carefully restored.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nTournai is considered to be one of the most important cultural sites in Belgium. The mixed Romanesque- and Gothic-style cathedral of Notre Dame de Tournai and the belfry, considered the oldest in Belgium, have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.  Inside the cathedral,  the Ch\u00e2sse de Notre-Dame flamande, a beautifully ornate 12th-century reliquary, gives witness to Tournai's wealth in the Middle Ages.  Other places of interest are the 13th-century Scheldt bridge (Pont des Trous) and the main square (Grand Place), as well as several old city gates, historic warehouses, and a variety of museums.\nOn rue Barre-St-Brice are two of the oldest private houses in Europe, dating from between 1175 and 1200 and built in the Romanesque style, while the rue des J\u00e9suites includes a Gothic house from the 13th century.\nAs in many Belgian cities there are a number of caf\u00e9s and pubs in the Grand Place. In the middle of the Grand Place there are a series of water fountains while the circular staircase to the top of the belfry can be climbed.\nThere are several buildings in the art nouveau style.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== A French-speaking Walloon town ===\n\nTournai is a French-speaking town of Belgium. The local language is tournaisien, a Picard dialect similar to that of other communes of Hainaut and Northern France.\nTournai belongs to Romance Flanders, like Lille, Douai, Tourcoing, and Mouscron. The city of Tournai was one of the greatest cultural and economic centers of the County of Flanders.  Some traces can still be seen today:\n\nThe gothic choir of Our Lady's Cathedral is a precursory element of the Scaldian (meaning from the Scheldt area), typically Flemish, Gothic art.\nThe bishopric of Tournai was the religious capital of Flanders during more than a millennium (from 496 to 1559).\nThe tapestries and draperies of Tournai belong to the great Flemish school of tapestry and Tournai was part of the Flemish Hansa of London, which also included the draper towns of Flanders.\nThe Saint-Brice church of Tournai, dedicated to Saint Britius, is one of the first examples of the hallekerk style, so typical of the Flemish countryside.\nSome of the great Flemish Primitives are from Tournai: Robert Campin, Rogier van der Weyden, Jacques Daret.Although Tournai is in the Flemish cultural area (of the Scheldt), it also possesses some treasures of the Mosan style.  Indeed, the two most beautiful shrines of the Cathedral, commissioned by the Bishop of Tournai, were made in the region of Li\u00e8ge by the artist Nicholas of Verdun: the shrines of Saint-Eleutherius and of Our Lady of Flanders (13th century). Those shrines testify to the opulence of the towns of Tournai and Li\u00e8ge during the Middle-Ages.  The shrine of Our Lady of Flanders has been called one of the seven wonders of Belgium.\n\n\n=== Festivities ===\nThe \"Great Procession\" (in French: Grande Procession) is a procession initiated by the bishop Radbot II during a plague epidemic. It has taken place every year since 1092, with the single exception of the year 1566, when the iconoclasts considerably damaged the religious symbols of the city.  This historic procession unfolds in the streets every second Sunday of September.\nThe first Monday after January 6 is known as \"Lost Monday\" (in French: Lundi perdu) or \"Perjury Monday\" (Lundi parjur\u00e9).  This tradition dates from more than 700 years ago.  The wealthier city inhabitants used to prepare fastidious family dinners and elect a king.  Today, the family dinners have expanded to wider groups and a rabbit dish is often served.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe Faculty of architecture, architectural engineering and urban planning of the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) is located in Tournai.\n\n\n== People born in Tournai ==\nClovis I, first king of all Salian Franks\nGilles Li Muisis, French chronicler and poet (13th century)\nRogier van der Weyden, Flemish painter (15th century)\nJacques Daret, Flemish painter (15th century)\nPierre de La Rue, Franco-Flemish composer (15th century)\nPerkin Warbeck, impostor and pretender to the throne of England (15th century)\nMarbrianus de Orto, Franco-Flemish composer (15th-16th century)\nCharles Blount, 5th Baron Mountjoy, courtier and patron of learning (16th century)\nIsaac Le Maire, pioneering merchant of the VOC, the Dutch East India Company (16th century)\nLouise-Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon (1673\u20131743) illegitimate daughter of Louis XIV of France and his most famous mistress Madame de Montespan.\nDonat Casterman, publisher (18th century)\nPhilippe de la Motte, 1556-1617, Pastor at Tournai (1582/3) and of Walloon Church, Southampton (1586).\nPiat Sauvage, painter (19th century)\nLouis Gallait, painter (19th century)\nJean-Baptiste Mo\u00ebns, philatelist (19th century)\nJules Bara, statesman (19th century)\nGeorges Rodenbach, Symbolist poet and novelist (19th century)\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Dutrieu, cycle racer, stunt driver and aviator (19th and 20th centuries)\nMarc Quaghebeur, writer (20th century)\nXaveer De Geyter, architect (20th century)\nGabrielle Petit, spy for the British Secret Service during the First World War, executed in 1916 by the Germans (20th century)\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Twin towns ==\n Troyes, France\n Villeneuve-d'Ascq, France\n Bethlehem, Palestine\n Tarija, Bolivia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInternationale petitie tegen het bouwproject van een toren in de Unesco zone van de kathedraal van Doornik (Belgi\u00eb).\nUNESCO World Heritage Site Citation\nOfficial site \u2014 The city's site, available in French, English and Dutch.\nTournai City.net \u2014 Online directory for this city.\nJoan of Arc's letter to Tournai \u2014 English translation (by Allen Williamson) of this letter dictated by Joan of Arc on June 25, 1429.\nApis Tornacensis \u2014 database and bibliography about history.\nMedieval Tournai An Academic Resource Center\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale d'Histoire et d'Arch\u00e9ologie de Tournai, an exhaustive list of references on the history of the Tournai region, in French.",

          "Only 2 euro 10 cents to ascend around 250 stairs to get to the top with a very nice view of the whole town. Definitely worth it and highly recommended.",
          "Just slightly over-shadowed by the Notre Dame Cathedral, this historical landmark is beautifully maintained and striking. Well worth the time spent and please pause to listen to the bells every half hour!",
          "The belfry itself it quite impressive viewed from the Grand Place or outside the cathedral but the best views are from the top after climbing the 256 stairs! On the way up (or down) you can see the bells and the carillon as, well as finding out more information from the displays",

          "Well worth the time and money to see the views and learn the history of bell towers. As you climb, stop in each side room and read the history of these towers in the region. Of the towers we\u2019ve visited, this had the best presentations on the topic. Also, don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a",

          "Definitely worth a visit (check opening times) to get great views of the surrounding area for a very modest charge of 2.10. The steps are very narrow and could be difficult during busy times but fortunately was quiet when I visited. Informative plaques tell you about the",
          "This is a very impressive tower that complements the city centre area without dominating it. Nicely, it also has a rather lovely carillon, well worth listening to before the hourly chimes are tolled.",
          "Right before the main square as one walks up the hill, is the belfry of Tournai. Like many other beautiful towns in Belgium, the belfry occupies an important place and is in itself a beautiful building. Unfortunately, it was closed when I visited but a lot can be seen from",

          "There are many beautiful belfries around Belgium, but the one in Tournai is one of my favorites. It has the original dragon weather vane still attached and the ornate gold gargoyles are really beautiful. I went in December, so the view of the city had sparkling Christmas",
          "Climbing the 256 steps to the top of the Belfry of Tournai is definitely worth it. The views across the landscape are amazing. There are plaques on the railings to tell you where you are looking and what the buildings are in the distance. We went on a rather cold Tuesday",
          "At only \u20ac2 you may as well take a look if passing. It was interesting to learn the history of this tower and belfries in general however all the information is in the first room and after that there is no more. This was disappointing and it would be a vast improvement to have",
          "It does not Seem high, But when you are at the top, you have a great view over Tournai. And when we went Up it was free of charge!",
          "We were positively surprised at the belfry. Free entrance, small platforms breaking up the climb, a cool 360-balcony 2/3 up and another one at the top! Small play area for children - positively surprised!!",
          "The views from on top were awesome and the Cathedral beside it was beautiful. The walkway was small and tight but worth it.",
          "I had the opportunity to see this wonderful attraction while someone was actually playing the bells. There are about 254 steps going all the way up to the top of the tower, my four year old made the climb up with no rest stops. There are a couple of open rooms, balcony and a",
          "We climbed the belfry (200+ steps, I forget exactly) on a Sunday morning and had it all to ourselves for the first 10 minutes or so, and luckily it was a clear day and we could see for miles around. Superb views of the cathedral and the Grand Place. Only \u20ac1.10 for seniors!",
          "Climbing the 256 stairs to the top is already a great experience. On the way, you have access to several rooms (history of the beffroi, jail). The view from the top is impressive and breathtaking, on a narrow platform. Not to miss!!",
          "It claims to be the oldest belfry, and probably base is, however the upper part probably isn\u00b4t. Still, it is a nice and slender tower in the city centre symbolizing the power of the citizens. Along the climb there is not too much to see, other than the bells used of sounding the",

          "The belfry of Tournai is a freestanding bell tower of medieval origin, 72 m in height with a 256-step stairway. Construction of the belfry began around 1188. This beautiful building is one of a set of belfries of Belgium and France designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so",

          "You can't miss it, but once you've found it, there you are. It just seems to be a very tall tower in the middle of town. Tournai has VERY rich history, but they don't seem to build tourism on this reality.",
          "For less than 3 Euros you get an incredible view all over the city. Worth the climb if you like those kinds of things :)",
          "Liked very much. Took 2 tries to visit though because on the first try we learned they're closed 12-1:30 for lunch, even though it's high season! The 257 steps went easily because I stopped at every level. After the first 2 levels the stairs get to be a bit of a tight squeeze.",

          "Very interesting and informative attraction, good multilingual information and excellent views of this lovely city. The first thing to do in Tournai is to climb the Belfry, its a fair way up but its well worth the small price",
          "This is a must see in Tournai, definetly my favorite attraction. You need to go up 300 stairs, but the view is absolutely worth it, even looking at the roof of the belfry at close was amazing.",
          "Very interesting building to visit. Magnificent view on the city. If you're affraid of heights it's a bit scary but you'll be glad you've done it. The rest of Tourcoing is also nice. Market square is charming square to have a drink on a terrace in the shade of the belfrey.",
          "Obviously for a tower, there are lots of steps, but the climb is worth it. Try to time the visit to coincide with the carillion playing.",
          "Though a bit of an effort to climb, it's worth it for the views over the town and you can catch a glimpse of the 16th-century carillon and the splendid 5,000 kg bell Bancloque cast by Robins de Croissilles in 1393.",
          "The belfry is the coolest thing to see in this town. it costs about 2 euro if I remember right. About 300 steps to the top, but well worth it. We live in Belgium and have been up Belfrys all over Europe and this is the coolest one we've found. We brought our 3 and 7 year",
          "No better view of Tournai is available. Steep stairs and a lot of them but well worth the effort. Inexpensive tickets. Highly recommended when touring Tournai.",

        "wiki": "Lille Olympique Sporting Club (French pronunciation: \u200b[lil \u0254l\u025b\u0303pik sp\u0254\u02d0\u02b3t\u026a\u014b kl\u0153b]), commonly called LOSC, also referred to as LOSC Lille, Lille OSC or simply Lille, is a  French professional association football club based in Lille in Hauts-de-France. The club was founded in 1944 as a result of a merger and plays in Ligue 1, the first division of French football. Lille has played its home matches since 2012 at Stade Pierre-Mauroy in nearby Villeneuve d'Ascq, which replaced the club's previous home of Stade Lille-Metropole in the same community.\nLille was founded as a result of a merger between Olympique Lillois and SC Fives. Both clubs were founding members of the French Division 1 and Lillois was the league's inaugural champions. Under the Lille emblem, the club has won three league titles (in 1946, 1954, and 2011) and six Coupe de France titles. Lille's most successful period was the decade from 1946 to 1956 when the team was led by managers George Berry and Andr\u00e9 Cheuva.Lille has a long-standing rivalry with nearby club RC Lens, with whom they contest the Derby du Nord. The club is owned and presided over by G\u00e9rard Lopez, an entrepreneur-investor and an active Luxembourgish-Spanish businessman who invests in the sports industry.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1944\u20131955: The first decade ===\n\nBefore the Second World War, the city of Lille had two clubs in Ligue 1; Olympique Lillois and Sporting Club Fivois. Weakened by the war, the two clubs decided to merge in the autumn of 1944, giving birth to Lille Olympique Sporting Club (LOSC). Within its first decade of existence, the new club won two league titles and reached the second place for four consecutive seasons. In the Coupe de France the club accumulated five wins in seven finals, including five successive finals. The final of the Latin Cup was also reached.\n\n\n=== 1956\u20131980: Lille loses its way ===\nLille were relegated for the first time in 1956. The club became a mid-table side and in the late 1960s, after a long period of anonymity, and weighed down by a lack of facilities and resources, Lille abandoned its professional status. It was feared that the club might disappear. However, some young leaders, such as Max Pommerolle, came and gave new impetus to the club. Nevertheless, the results remained erratic and the only titles that ignited the fans' passions were won in the Second Division.\n\n\n=== 1980\u20132000: Laying the foundations for future success ===\nIn July 1980, Lille was the first French club to opt for the status of a mixed economy company, of which the city of Lille became the majority shareholder. The team of presidents Amyot, Deschot and Dewailly all struggled to compete with the top teams in the country. Jacques Amyot's resignation in 1990 led to three more difficult years for the club which compromised its very existence. It took Bernard Lecomte's arrival in 1993 to set the club finances on the road to recovery. After a final relegation in 1997, the team trained by Bosnian coach Vahid Halilhod\u017ei\u0107 was soon promoted back to the elite, in the same year the French Football League was privatised.\n\n\n=== 2000\u2013present: A steady climb to the top ===\n\nIn just its first season back in the top flight 2000\u201301 French Division 1, Lille qualified for Europe for the first time in the club's history, booking its place in the 2001\u201302 Champions League. On the back of the club's new status, Lille entered into a decisive new era under the guidance of chairman and chief executive officer Michel Seydoux and coach Claude Puel. The club left the historical Stade Grimonprez-Jooris to join the Stadium Lille M\u00e9tropole and became a regular on the European scene. Amongst its most emphatic results was the 1\u20130 victory over Manchester United at the Stade de France in 2005, the 2\u20130 triumph over Milan in San Siro in 2006 and the 1\u20130 home win over Liverpool in 2010. A steady development off the pitch (inauguration of the Domaine de Luchin training complex in 2007, opening of the Grand Stade in 2012), coupled with the sporting progression under the expert hand of coach Rudi Garcia, took Lille back to the summit of the French game with the League and Cup double in 2011 (56 years after the club's last trophy). In 2012, LOSC confirmed its place at the top table of the domestic game with another qualification for Europe's most prestigious club competition, the Champions League in 2012\u201313. With the club finishing just outside the UCL places that season, Garcia left to join Roma, while former Montpellier coach Ren\u00e9 Girard was appointed the new Lille manager. After two years in charge of the club, Girard left his role as the head coach by mutual consent. He was joined by assistants Gerard Bernadet and Nicolas Girard in making the exit. In May 2015, the Ivory Coast national team head coach Herv\u00e9 Renard was appointed as the new manager.  On 11 November 2015, Renard was terminated as manager and was replaced by Frederic Antonetti. On 23 November 2016, a year after being appointed, Lille terminated Antonetti's contract with the club lying second last in the table. In March 2017, Lille appointed Marcelo Bielsa as new manager of the club. In November 2017, Bielsa was suspended by Lille following an unauthorized trip to Chile with the club lying second from bottom on the table again and only managing 3 wins from the first 14 games of the season.On 23 December 2017, Bielsa was terminated by Lille and replaced with former Saint-Etienne manager Christophe Galtier. After a difficult 2017\u20132018 season, Lille managed to avoid relegation to Ligue 2 by defeating Toulouse 3\u20132 in the second last game of the campaign.In the 2018\u201319 Ligue 1 season, Lille secured the second place to qualify for the 2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League group stage, they returned to the competition after a seven-year absence.\n\n\n== Stadiums ==\n\nStade Pierre-Mauroy was inaugurated in 2012. Originally named the Centre Olympique de Lille Est, the club's sporting venue is spread over five hectares and features three natural grass football pitches and one synthetic pitch, as well as a number of buildings including a medical centre and gymnasium. These attributes had seen the club house part of the LOSC Youth Academy here, before all the club's operations were moved to the Domaine de Luchin in Camphin-en-P\u00e9.\n\n\n== Club rivalries ==\n\nThe Derby du Nord is a football match contested between Lille and RC Lens. The derby name refers only to their geographical location in France since Lille is the only club of the two actually situated in the department of Nord. Lens are situated in the western department of Pas-de-Calais. The name can also refer to matches involving Lille and Valenciennes as both clubs are located within Nord, however, the match historically refers to matches involving Lille and Lens. As a result, the Lille\u2013Valenciennes match is sometimes referred to as Le Petit Derby du Nord. The two clubs first met in 1937 when Lille were playing under the Olympique Lillois emblem. Due to each club's close proximity towards each other being separated by only 40 kilometres (25 mi) and sociological differences between each club's supporters, a fierce rivalry developed. The Derby du Nord is underpinned by social and economic differences, since the city of Lens is known as an old, working-class, industrial city and Lille as a middle-class, modern, internationally oriented one. Nowadays the matches, which can spark intense feelings on both sides, have gained prominence as they may determine berths in continental competitions.\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== Current squad ===\nAs of 4 September 2020Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Rudi Garcia, who played for Lille from 1980 to 1988, replaced Claude Puel at the beginning of the 2008 season. Puel had been with Lille since 2002. Thanks to his successes with the club, Puel had been approached by Portuguese club Porto to replace Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and league rivals Lyon to replace Alain Perrin; he finally decided to join Lyon after six seasons at the club.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Domestic ===\nLigue 1\nChampions (3): 1945\u201346, 1953\u201354, 2010\u201311\nRunners-up (6): 1947\u201348, 1948\u201349, 1949\u201350, 1950\u201351, 2004\u201305, 2018\u201319\nLigue 2\nChampions (4): 1963\u201364, 1973\u201374, 1977\u201378, 1999\u20132000\nCoupe de France\nChampions (6): 1945\u201346, 1946\u201347, 1947\u201348, 1952\u201353, 1954\u201355, 2010\u201311\nRunners-up (2): 1944\u201345, 1948\u201349\nCoupe de la Ligue\nRunners-up (1): 2015\u201316\nCoupe Gambardella\nChampions (1): 1960\nRunners-up (2): 1955, 2000\nCoupe Charles Drago\nRunners-up (2): 1954, 1956\n\n\n=== Europe ===\nUEFA Intertoto Cup\nWinner (1): 2004\nLatin Cup\nRunners-up (1): 1951\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "Lille ( LEEL; French: [lil] (listen); Dutch: Rijsel [\u02c8r\u025bis\u0259l]; Picard: Lile; West Flemish: Rysel) is a city at the northern tip of France, in French Flanders. On the De\u00fble River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region, the prefecture of the Nord department, and the main city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille.\nAs of 2017, Lille had a population of 232,787 within its administrative limits, and Lille is the first city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille with a population of 1,146,320, making it the fourth-largest urban area in France after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nArcheological digs seem to show the area as inhabited by as early as 2000 BC, most notably in the modern quartiers of Fives, Wazemmes and Vieux Lille. The original inhabitants of the region were the Gauls, such as the Menapians, the Morins, the Atrebates and the Nervians, who were followed by Germanic peoples: the Saxons, the Frisians and the Franks.\nThe legend of \"Lyd\u00e9ric and Phinaert\" puts the foundation of the city of Lille at 640. In the 8th century, the language of Old Low Franconian was spoken, as attested by toponymic research. Lille's Dutch name is Rijsel, which comes from ter ijsel (at the island) from Middle Dutch ijssel (\u201csmall island, islet\u201d), calque of Old French l'Isle (\u201cthe Island\u201d), itself from Latin \u012ansula, from \u012bnsula (\u201cisland\u201d).\nFrom 830 to around 910, the Vikings invaded Flanders. After the destruction caused by Normans' and the Magyars' invasion, the eastern part of the region was ruled by various local princes.\nThe first mention of the town dates from 1066: apud Insulam (Latin for \"at the island\"). It was then controlled by the County of Flanders, as were the regional cities (the Roman cities Boulogne, Arras, Cambrai as well as the Carolingian cities Valenciennes, Saint-Omer, Ghent and Bruges). The County of Flanders thus extended to the left bank of the Scheldt, one of the richest and most prosperous regions of Europe.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe Carolingian duke \u00c9vrard lived in the city in the 9th century and participated in many of the day's political and military affairs. There was an important Battle of Lille in 1054.\nFrom the 12th century, the fame of the Lille cloth fair began to grow. In 1144 Saint-Sauveur parish was formed, which would give its name to the modern-day quartier Saint-Sauveur.\nThe counts of Flanders, Boulogne, and Hainaut came together with England and East Frankia and tried to regain territory taken by Philip II of France following Henry II of England's death, a war that ended with the French victory at Bouvines in 1214. Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders was imprisoned and the county fell into dispute: it would be his wife, Jeanne, Countess of Flanders and Constantinople, who ruled the city. She was said to be well loved by the residents of Lille, who by that time numbered 10,000.\nIn 1225, the street performer and juggler Bertrand Cordel, doubtlessly encouraged by local lords, tried to pass himself off as Baldwin I of Constantinople (the father of Jeanne of Flanders), who had disappeared at the battle of Adrianople. He pushed the counties of Flanders and Hainaut towards sedition against Jeanne in order to recover his land. She called her cousin, Louis VIII (\"The Lion\"). He unmasked the imposter, whom Countess Jeanne quickly had hanged. In 1226 the king agreed to free Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders. Count Ferrand died in 1233, and his daughter Marie soon after. In 1235, Jeanne granted a city charter by which city governors would be chosen each All Saint's Day by four commissioners chosen by the ruler. On 6 February 1236, she founded the Countess's Hospital (Hospice Comtesse), which remains one of the most beautiful buildings in Old Lille. It was in her honour that the hospital of the Regional Medical University of Lille was named \"Jeanne of Flanders Hospital\" in the 20th century.\nThe Countess died in 1244 in the Abbey of Marquette, leaving no heirs. The rule of Flanders and Hainaut thus fell to her sister, Margaret II, Countess of Flanders, then to Margaret's son, Guy of Dampierre. Lille fell under the rule of France from 1304 to 1369, after the Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305).\nThe county of Flanders fell to the Duchy of Burgundy next, after the 1369 marriage of Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, and Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Lille thus became one of the three capitals of said Duchy, along with Brussels and Dijon. By 1445, Lille counted some 25,000 residents. Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, was even more powerful than the King of France, and made Lille an administrative and financial capital.\nOn 17 February 1454, one year after the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, Philip the Good organised a Pantagruelian banquet at his Lille palace, the still-celebrated \"Feast of the Pheasant\". There the Duke and his court undertook an oath to Christianity.\nIn 1477, at the death of the last duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian of Austria, who thus became Count of Flanders.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\n\nThe 16th and the 17th centuries were marked by a boom in the regional textile industry, the Protestant revolts and outbreaks of the plague.\nLille came under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1519. The Low Countries fell to his eldest son, Philip II of Spain, in 1555. The city remained under Spanish Habsburg rule until 1668.\nCalvinism first appeared in the area in 1542, and by 1555, the authorities were taking steps to suppress that form of Protestantism. In 1566, the countryside around Lille was affected by the Iconoclastic Fury. In 1578, the Hurlus, a group of Protestant rebels, stormed the castle of the Counts of Mouscron. They were removed four months later by a Catholic Wallon regiment, and they tried several times between 1581 and 1582 to take the city of Lille, all in vain. The Hurlus were notably held back by the legendary Jeanne Maillotte. At the same time (1581), at the call of Elizabeth I of England, the north of the Seventeen Provinces, having gained a Protestant majority, successfully revolted and formed the Dutch Republic. The war brought or exacerbated periods of famine and plague (the last in 1667\u20131679).The first printer to set up shop in Lille was Antoine Tack in 1594. The 17th century saw the building of new institutions: an Irish College in 1610, a Jesuit college in 1611, an Augustinian college in 1622, almshouses or hospitals such as the Maison des Vieux hommes in 1624 and the Bonne et Forte Maison des Pauvres in 1661, and of a Mont-de-pi\u00e9t\u00e9 in 1626.Unsuccessful French attacks on the city were launched in 1641 and 1645. In 1667, Louis XIV of France (the Sun King) successfully laid siege to Lille, resulting in it becoming French in 1668 under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, provoking discontent among the citizens of the prosperous city. A number of important public works undertaken between 1667 and 1670, such as the Citadel (erected by Vauban), or the creation of the quartiers of Saint-Andr\u00e9 and la Madeleine, enabled the French king to gradually gain the confidence of his new subjects in Lille, some of whom continued to feel Flemish, but they had always spoken the Romance Picard language.\n\nFor five years, from 1708 to 1713, the city was occupied by the Dutch during the War of the Spanish Succession. Throughout the 18th century, Lille remained profoundly Catholic. It took little part in the French Revolution, but there were riots and the destruction of churches. In 1790, the city held its first municipal elections.\n\n\n=== Post-French Revolution ===\nIn 1792, in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the Austrians, then in the United Provinces, laid siege to Lille. The \"Column of the Goddess\", erected in 1842 in the \"Grand-Place\" (officially named Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle), is a tribute to the city's resistance, led by Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9-Bonte. Although Austrian artillery destroyed many houses and the main church of the city, the city did not surrender, and the Austrian Army left after eight days.\n\nThe city continued to grow and, by 1800, had some 53,000 residents, leading to Lille becoming the seat of the Nord d\u00e9partment in 1804. In 1846, a railway connecting Paris and Lille was built. In the early the 19th century, Napoleon I's continental blockade against the United Kingdom led to Lille's textile industry developing even more fully. The city was known for its cotton while the nearby towns of Roubaix and Tourcoing worked wool.  Leisure activities were thoroughly organised in 1858 for the 80,000 inhabitants.  Cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1,300, or one for every three houses. At that time the city counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations. Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets festivals and competitions. In 1853, Alexandre Desrousseaux composed his lullaby P'tit quinquin.\nIn 1858, Lille annexed the adjacent towns of Fives, Wazemmes, and Moulins. Lille's population was 158,000 in 1872, growing to over 200,000 by 1891. In 1896 Lille became the first city in France to be led by a socialist, Gustave Delory.\nBy 1912, Lille's population stood at 217,000. The city profited from the Industrial Revolution, particularly via coal and the steam engine. The entire region grew wealthy thanks to its mines and textile industry.\n\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nLille's occupation by the Germans began on 13 October 1914 after a ten-day siege and heavy shelling, which destroyed 882 apartment and office blocks and 1,500 houses, mostly around the railway station and in the centre. By the end of October, the city was being run by German authorities.\nBecause Lille was only 20 km from the battlefield, German troops passed through the city regularly on their way to and from the front. As a result, occupied Lille became a place for the hospitalisation and the treatment of wounded soldiers as well as a place for soldiers' relaxation and entertainment. Many buildings, homes and businesses were requisitioned to those ends.Lille was liberated by the Allies on 17 October 1918, when General Sir William Birdwood and his troops were welcomed by joyous crowds. The general was made an honorary citizen of the city of Lille on 28 October.\nThe only audio recording known to have been made during World War I was recorded near Lille in October 1918. The two-minute recording captured the Royal Garrison Artillery conducting a gas shell bombardment.Lille was also the hunting ground of the German World War I flying ace Max Immelmann, who was nicknamed \"the Eagle of Lille\".\n\n\n=== Ann\u00e9es Folles, Great Depression and Popular Front ===\n\nIn July 1921, at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin discovered the first anti-tuberculosis vaccine, known as BCG (\"Bacille de Calmette et Gu\u00e9rin\"). The Op\u00e9ra de Lille, designed by Lille architect Louis M. Cordonnier, was dedicated in 1923.\nFrom 1931, Lille felt the repercussions of the Great Depression, and by 1935, a third of the city's population lived in poverty. In 1936, the city's mayor, Roger Salengro, became Minister of the Interior of the Popular Front but eventually killed himself after right-wing groups led a slanderous campaign against him.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring the Battle of France, Lille was besieged by German forces for several days. When Belgium was invaded, the citizens of Lille, still haunted by the events of World War I, began to flee the city in large numbers. Lille was part of the zone under control of the German commander in Brussels, and was never controlled by the Vichy government in France. Lille was instead controlled under the military administration in Northern France. The d\u00e9partments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais (with the exception of the coast, notably Dunkirk) were for the most part liberated from 1 to 5 September 1944, by British, Canadian and Polish troops. On 3 September, German troops began to leave Lille out of fear of the British, who were on their way from Brussels. The city was liberated by a British force consisting largely of tanks.Rationing came to an end in 1947, and by 1948, normality had returned to Lille.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\n\nIn 1967, the Chambers of Commerce of Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing were joined, and in 1969< the Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Lille (Lille urban community) was created, linking 87 communes with Lille.\nThroughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the region was faced with some problems after the decline of the coal, mining and textile industries. From the early 1980s, the city began to turn itself more towards the service sector.\nIn 1983, the VAL, the world's first automated rapid transit underground network, opened. In 1993, a high-speed TGV train line was opened connecting Paris with Lille in one hour. This, with the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 and the arrival of the Eurostar train put Lille at the centre of a triangle connecting Paris, London and Brussels.\nWork on Euralille, an urban remodelling project, began in 1991. The Euralille Centre was opened in 1994, and the remodeled district is now full of parks and modern buildings containing offices, shops and apartments. In 1994 the \"Grand Palais\" was also opened for the general public, which is free for the public to enter on the first Sunday of every month.\nLille was chosen as European Capital of Culture in 2004, along with the Italian city of Genoa.\nLille and Roubaix were affected by the 2005 riots, like all of France's other urban centres.\nIn 2007 and again in 2010, Lille was awarded the label \"Internet City\".\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLille can be described as having a temperate oceanic climate; summers normally do not reach high average temperatures, but winters can fall below freezing temperatures, but with averages quite a bit above the freezing mark. Precipitation is plentiful year round.\nThe table below gives average temperatures and precipitation levels for the 1981-2010 reference period.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nLille is noted for its air pollution, with a 2018 study attributing 1,700 deaths per year in the agglomeration of Lille to pollution. In 2018, Lille held France's record pollution peaks.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nA former major mechanical, food industry and textile manufacturing centre as well as a retail and finance center, Lille is the largest city of a conurbation, built like a network of cities: Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing and Villeneuve d'Ascq. The conurbation forms the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille which is France's fourth-largest urban conglomeration with a 2016 population of over 1.15 million.\n\n\n=== Revenues and taxes ===\nFor centuries, Lille, a city of merchants, has displayed a wide range of incomes: great wealth and poverty have lived side by side, especially until the end of the 1800s. This contrast was noted by Victor Hugo in 1851 in his poem Les Ch\u00e2timents:  \u00ab Caves de Lille ! on meurt sous vos plafonds de pierre ! \u00bb (\"Cellars of Lille! We die under your stone ceilings!\")\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment in Lille has switched over half a century from a predominant industry to tertiary activities and services.\nServices account for 91% of employment in 2006.\n\nEmployment in Lille-Hellemmes-Lomme from 1968 to 2006\n\nEmployment per categories in 1968 and in 2006\n\nUnemployment in active population from 1968 to 2006\n\n\n=== Enterprises ===\nIn 2007, Lille hosts around 21,000 industry or service sites.\n\nEnterprises as per 31 December 2007\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nLille features an array of architectural styles with various amounts of Flemish influence, including the use of brown and red brick. In addition, many residential neighborhoods, especially in Greater Lille, consist of attached 2\u20133 story houses aligned in a row, with narrow gardens in the back. These architectural attributes, many uncommon in France, help make Lille a transition in France to neighboring Belgium, as well as nearby Netherlands and England, where the presence of brick, as well as row houses or the terraced house is much more prominent.\nPoints of interest include\n\nLille Cathedral (Basilique-cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame-de-la-Treille)\nCitadel of Lille\nPalais des Beaux-Arts de Lille\nJardin botanique de la Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie\nJardin botanique Nicolas Boulay\nJardin des Plantes de Lille\n\n\n=== La Braderie ===\n\nLille hosts an annual braderie on the first weekend in September. Its origins are thought to date back to the twelfth century and between two and three million visitors are drawn into the city. It is one of the largest gatherings of France and the largest flea market in Europe.\nMany of the roads in the inner city (including much of the old town) are closed and local shops, residents and traders set up stalls in the street.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille has a mixed mode public transport system, which is considered one of the most modern in the whole of France. It comprises buses, trams and a driverless light metro system, all of which are operated under the Transpole name. The Lille Metro is a VAL system (v\u00e9hicule automatique l\u00e9ger = light automated vehicle) that opened on 16 May 1983, becoming the first automatic light metro line in the world. The system has two lines, with a total length of 45 kilometres (28 miles) and 60 stations. The tram system consists of two interurban tram lines, connecting central Lille to the nearby communities of Roubaix and Tourcoing, and has 45 stops. 68 urban bus routes cover the metropolis, 8 of which reach into Belgium.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nLille is an important crossroads in the European high-speed rail network. It lies on the Eurostar line to London (1:20 hour journey). The French TGV network also puts it only 1 hour from Paris, 38 minutes from Brussels, and connects to other major centres in France such as Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse. Lille has two railway stations, which stand next door to one another: Lille-Europe station (Gare de Lille-Europe), which primarily serves high-speed trains and international services (Eurostar), and Lille-Flandres station (Gare de Lille-Flandres), which primarily serves lower speed regional trains and regional Belgian trains.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nFive autoroutes pass by Lille, the densest confluence of highways in France after Paris:\n\nAutoroute A27 : Lille \u2013 Tournai \u2013 Brussels / Li\u00e8ge \u2013 Germany\nAutoroute A23 : Lille \u2013 Valenciennes\nAutoroute A1  : Lille \u2013 Arras \u2013 Paris / Reims \u2013 Lyon / Orl\u00e9ans / Le Havre\nAutoroute A25 : Lille \u2013 Dunkirk \u2013 Calais \u2013 England / North Belgium\nAutoroute A22 : Lille \u2013 Antwerp \u2013 NetherlandsA sixth one \u2013 the proposed A24 \u2013 will link Amiens to Lille if built, but there is opposition to its route.\n\n\n=== Air traffic ===\nLille Lesquin International Airport is 15 minutes from the city centre by car (11 km). In terms of shipping, it ranks fourth, with almost 38,000 tonnes of freight which pass through each year. Its passenger traffic, around 1.2 million in 2010, is modest due to the proximity to Brussels, Charleroi, and Paris-CDG airports. The airport mostly connects other French and European cities (some with low-cost airlines).\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\n\nLille is the third-largest French river port after Paris and Strasbourg. The river De\u00fble is connected to regional waterways with over 680 km (423 mi) of navigable waters. The De\u00fble connects to Northern Europe via the River Scarpe and the River Scheldt (towards Belgium and the Netherlands), and internationally via the Lys River (to Dunkerque and Calais).\nShipping statistics\n\n\n== Education ==\nWith over 110,000 students, the metropolitan area of Lille is one of France's top student cities.\n\nWith roots back from 1562 to 1793 as University of Douai, (then as Universit\u00e9 Imp\u00e9riale in 1808), the State University of Lille was established in Lille in 1854 with Louis Pasteur as the first dean of its Faculty of Sciences. A school of medicine and an engineering school were also established in Lille in 1854; and the University of Lille was united as the association of existing public Faculties in 1896. It was then split into three independent university campuses in 1970: Lille 1 University of Science and Technology, Lille 2 University of Law and Health, and Lille 3 Charles de Gaulle University of Humanities, Social sciences, Literature and Arts.At the beginning of 2018, Lille 1, Lille 2 and Lille 3 merged to form the new University of Lille (student enrollment: 70,000).\nIt is part of the Community of Universities and Institutions (COMUE) Lille Nord de France and the European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France.\n\nThe Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech, an engineering graduate school of industrial and mechanical engineering, settled in Lille in 1900. This campus is one of the eight Teaching and Research Center (CER) of the school. Its creation was decided by Pierre-Nicolas Legrand de L\u00e9rant.\nEcole Centrale de Lille is one of the five Centrale Graduate Schools of engineering in France; it was founded in Lille city in 1854, its graduate engineering education and research center was established as Institut industriel du Nord (IDN) in 1872, in 1968 it moved in a modern campus in Lille suburb.\n\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de chimie de Lille was established as Institut de chimie de Lille in 1894 supporting chemistry research as followers of Kuhlmann's breakthrough works in Lille.\n\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de journalisme de Lille, journalism school created in 1924.\nSkema Business School established in 1892 is ranked among the top business schools in France.\n\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies settled in Lille in 2009.\nESME-Sudria and E-Artsup settled in Lille in 2012.\nThe ESA \u2013 \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Affaires is a Business Management school established in Lille in 1990.\nIEP Sciences-Po Lille political studies institute was established in Lille in 1992.\nThe Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action is also located in Lille.\nThe Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group) established in Lille in 1988.\nThe European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France is headquartered in Lille Metropolis and includes 3,000 PhD Doctorate students supported by university research laboratories.\nThe Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Lille was founded in 1875. Today it has law, economics, medicine, physics faculties and schools. Among the most famous is Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers (ICAM) founded in 1898, ranked 20th among engineering schools, with the specificity of graduating polyvalent engineers, Ecole des Hautes \u00e9tudes d'ing\u00e9nieur (HEI) a school of engineering founded in 1885 and offering 10 fields of specialization, \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes commerciales du nord (EDHEC) founded in 1906, IESEG School of Management founded in 1964 (17th place in the latest Financial Times global ranking of the 90 best masters in management, published on Monday 12 September 2016).  and Skema Business School currently ranked within the top 5, the top 10 and top 15 business schools in France, respectively. In 1924 ESJ \u2013 a leading journalism school \u2013 was established.\n\n\n== Notable people from Lille ==\n\n\n=== Writers ===\nJacquemart Gi\u00e9l\u00e9e (13th century), poet\nYvonne Chauffin (1905\u20131995), writer, winner of the 1970 edition of the Prix Breizh\nJean Prieur (1914\u20132008), writer and professor\n\n\n=== Scientists and mathematicians ===\n\n\n=== Artists ===\n\n\n=== Politicians, professionals and military ===\n\n\n=== Sportspeople ===\n\n\n== Media and sports ==\nLocal newspapers include Nord \u00e9clair and La Voix du Nord.\nFrance's national public television network has a channel that focuses on the local area: France 3 Nord-Pas-de-Calais\nThe city's most major association football club, Lille OSC, currently plays in Ligue 1, the highest level of football in France.

        "wiki": "The Third Battle of Ypres (German: Dritte Flandernschlacht; French: Troisi\u00e8me Bataille des Flandres; Dutch: Derde Slag om Vlaanderen), also known as the Battle of Passchendaele (), was a campaign of the First World War, fought by the Allies against the German Empire. The battle took place on the Western Front, from July to November 1917, for control of the ridges south and east of the Belgian city of Ypres in West Flanders, as part of a strategy decided by the Allies at conferences in November 1916 and May 1917. Passchendaele lies on the last ridge east of Ypres, 5 mi (8.0 km) from Roulers (now Roeselare) junction of the Bruges (Brugge) to Kortrijk railway. The station at Roulers was on the main supply route of the German 4th Army. Once Passchendaele Ridge had been captured, the Allied advance was to continue to a line from Thourout (now Torhout) to Couckelaere (Koekelare).\nFurther operations and a British supporting attack along the Belgian coast from Nieuport (Nieuwpoort), combined with an amphibious landing (Operation Hush), were to have reached Bruges and then the Dutch frontier. The resistance of the 4th Army, unusually wet weather in August, the beginning of the autumn rains in October and the diversion of British and French resources to Italy, enabled the Germans to avoid the general withdrawal which had seemed inevitable in early October. The campaign ended in November, when the Canadian Corps captured Passchendaele, apart from local attacks in December and early in the new year. The Battle of the Lys (Fourth Battle of Ypres) and the Fifth Battle of Ypres of 1918, were fought before the Allies occupied the Belgian coast and reached the Dutch frontier.\nA campaign in Flanders was controversial in 1917 and has remained so. The British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, opposed the offensive, as did General Ferdinand Foch, the Chief of Staff of the French Army. Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), did not receive approval for the Flanders operation from the War Cabinet until 25 July. Matters of dispute by the participants, writers and historians since 1917 include the wisdom of pursuing an offensive strategy in the wake of the Nivelle Offensive, rather than waiting for the arrival of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in France.\nThe choice of Flanders, its climate, the selection of General Hubert Gough and the Fifth Army to conduct the offensive, debates over the nature of the opening attack and between advocates of shallow and deeper objectives, remain controversial. The time between the Battle of Messines (7\u201314 June) and the first Allied attack (the Battle of Pilckem Ridge, 31 July), the extent to which the internal troubles of the French armies influenced the British, the effect of the exceptional weather, the decision to continue the offensive in October and the human costs of the campaign, are also debated.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Flanders ===\n\n\n==== 1914 ====\n\nBelgium had been recognised in the Treaty of London (1839) as a sovereign and neutral state after the secession of the southern provinces of the Netherlands in 1830. The German invasion of Belgium on 4 August 1914, in violation of Article VII of the treaty, was the British casus belli against Germany. British military operations in Belgium began with the arrival of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) at Mons on 22 August. Operations in Flanders began during the Race to the Sea, reciprocal attempts by the French and German armies to turn their opponents' northern flank, through Picardy, Artois and Flanders. On 10 October, Lieutenant-General Erich von Falkenhayn, the Chief of Staff of the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, supreme army command), ordered an attack towards Dunkirk and Calais, followed by a turn south behind the Allied armies, to gain a decisive victory. On 16 October, the Belgians and some French reinforcements began the defence of western Belgium and the French Channel ports, at the Battle of the Yser. When the German offensive failed, Falkenhayn ordered the capture of Ypres to gain a local advantage. By 18 November, the First Battle of Ypres had also ended in failure, at a cost of 160,000 German casualties. In December, the British Admiralty began discussions with the War Office, for a combined operation to re-occupy the Belgian coast but were obliged to conform to French strategy and participate in offensives further south.\n\n\n==== 1915 ====\nLarge British offensive operations in Flanders were not possible in 1915, due to a lack of resources. The Germans conducted their own Flanders offensive at the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April \u2013 15 May 1915), making the Ypres salient more costly to defend. Sir Douglas Haig succeeded Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF on 19 December. A week after his appointment, Haig met Vice-Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon, who emphasised the importance of obtaining control of the Belgian coast, to end the threat posed by German U-boats. Haig was sceptical of a coastal operation, believing that a landing from the sea would be far more difficult than anticipated and that an advance along the coast would require so much preparation, that the Germans would have ample warning. Haig preferred an advance from Ypres, to bypass the flooded area around the Yser and the coast, before attempting a coastal attack to clear the coast to the Dutch border.\n\n\n==== 1916 ====\n\nMinor operations took place in the Ypres salient in 1916, some being German initiatives to distract the Allies from the preparations for the offensive at Verdun and later attempts to divert Allied resources from the Battle of the Somme. Other operations were begun by the British to regain territory or to evict the Germans from ground overlooking their positions. Engagements took place on 12 February at Boesinghe and on 14 February at Hooge and Sanctuary Wood. There were actions from 14\u201315 February and 1\u20134 March at The Bluff, 27 March \u2013 16 April at the St Eloi Craters and the Battle of Mont Sorrel from 2\u201313 June. In January 1917, the Second Army (General Herbert Plumer) with the II Anzac, IX, X and VIII corps, held the Western Front in Flanders from Laventie to Boesinghe, with eleven divisions and up to two in reserve. There was much trench mortaring, mining and raiding by both sides and from January to May, the Second Army had 20,000 casualties. In May, reinforcements began arriving to Flanders from the south; the II Corps headquarters and 17 divisions had arrived by the end of the month.In January 1916, Plumer began to plan offensives against Messines Ridge, Lille and Houthulst Forest. General Henry Rawlinson was also ordered to plan an attack from the Ypres Salient on 4 February; planning continued but the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme took up the rest of the year. In November, Haig, the French commander-in-chief Joseph Joffre and the other Allies met at Chantilly. The commanders agreed on a strategy of simultaneous attacks, to overwhelm the Central Powers on the Western, Eastern and Italian fronts, by the first fortnight of February 1917. A meeting in London of the Admiralty and the General Staff urged that the Flanders operation be undertaken in 1917 and Joffre replied on 8 December, agreeing to a Flanders campaign after the spring offensive. The plan for a year of attrition offensives on the Western Front, with the main effort to be made in the summer by the BEF, was scrapped by the new French Commander-in-Chief Robert Nivelle in favour of a return to a strategy of decisive battle.\n\n\n=== Allied strategy ===\n\nNivelle planned preliminary offensives to pin German reserves by the British at Arras and the French between the Somme and the Oise, then a French breakthrough offensive on the Aisne, followed by pursuit and exploitation. Haig had reservations and on 6 January Nivelle agreed to a proviso that if the first two parts of the operation failed to lead to a breakthrough, the operations would be stopped and the British could move their forces north for the Flanders offensive, which was of great importance to the British government. On 23 January, Haig wrote that it would take six weeks to move British troops and equipment to Flanders and on 14 March, noted that the Messines Ridge operation could begin in May. On 21 March, he wrote to Nivelle that it would take two months to prepare the offensive from Messines to Steenstraat but that the Messines operation could be ready in five or six weeks. The main French attack took place from 9 April to 9 May and failed to achieve a breakthrough. On 16 May, Haig wrote that he had divided the Flanders operation into two phases, one to take Messines Ridge and the main attack several weeks later. British determination to clear the Belgian coast took on more urgency, after the Germans resumed unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 February 1917. On 1 May 1917, Haig wrote that the Nivelle Offensive had weakened the German army but that an attempt at a decisive blow would be premature. The wearing-out process would continue on a front where the Germans had no room to retreat. Even limited success would improve the tactical situation in the Ypres salient, reducing the exceptional wastage, even in quiet periods. In early May, Haig set the date for the Flanders offensive, the attack on Messines Ridge to begin on 7 June.\n\n\n=== Kerensky offensive ===\n\nThe Russian army conducted the Kerensky Offensive in Galicia, to honour the agreement struck with the Allies at the Chantilly meeting of 15 to 16 November 1916. After a brief period of success from 1 to 19 July, the Russian offensive was contained by the German and Austro-Hungarian armies, which counter-attacked and forced the Russian armies to retreat. On the Baltic coast from 1 to 5 September 1917, the Germans attacked with their strategic reserve of six divisions and captured Riga. In Operation Albion (September\u2013October 1917), the Germans took the islands at the mouth of the Gulf of Riga. The British and French commanders on the Western Front had to reckon on the German western army (Westheer) being strengthened by reinforcements from the Ostheer on the Eastern Front by late 1917. Haig wished to exploit the diversion of German forces in Russia for as long as it continued and urged the British War Cabinet to commit the maximum amount of manpower and munitions to the battle in Flanders.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\n\n\n=== Ypres salient ===\nYpres is overlooked by Kemmel Hill in the south-west and from the east by a line of low hills running south-west to north-east Wytschaete (Wijtschate) and Hill 60 are to the east of Verbrandenmolen, Hooge, Polygon Wood and Passchendaele (Passendale). The high point of the ridge is at Wytschaete, 7,000 yd (4.0 mi; 6.4 km) from Ypres, while at Hollebeke the ridge is 4,000 yd (2.3 mi; 3.7 km) distant and recedes to 7,000 yd (4.0 mi; 6.4 km) at Polygon Wood. Wytschaete is about 150 ft (46 m) above the plain; on the Ypres\u2013Menin road at Hooge, the elevation is about 100 ft (30 m) and 70 ft (21 m) at Passchendaele. The rises are slight, apart from the vicinity of Zonnebeke, which has a gradient of 1:33. From Hooge and further east, the slope is 1:60 and near Hollebeke, it is 1:75; the heights are subtle and resemble a saucer lip around the city. The main ridge has spurs sloping east and one is particularly noticeable at Wytschaete, which runs 2 mi (3.2 km) south-east to Messines (Mesen) with a gentle slope on the east side and a 1:10 decline westwards. Further south, is the muddy valley of the River Douve, Ploegsteert Wood (Plugstreet to the British) and Hill 63. West of Messines Ridge is the parallel Wulverghem (Spanbroekmolen) Spur and on the east side, the Oosttaverne Spur, which is also parallel to the main ridge. The general aspect south and east of Ypres, is one of low ridges and dips, gradually flattening northwards beyond Passchendaele, into a featureless plain.Possession of the higher ground to the south and east of Ypres, gives an army ample scope for ground observation, enfilade fire and converging artillery bombardments. An occupier also has the advantage that artillery deployments and the movement of reinforcements, supplies and stores can be screened from view. The ridge had woods from Wytschaete to Zonnebeke giving good cover, some being of notable size, like Polygon Wood and those later named Battle Wood, Shrewsbury Forest and Sanctuary Wood. In 1914, the woods usually had undergrowth but by 1917, artillery bombardments had reduced the woods to tree stumps, shattered tree trunks tangled with barbed wire and more wire festooning the ground, which was full of shell-holes; fields in the gaps between the woods, were 800\u20131,000 yd (730\u2013910 m) wide and devoid of cover. The main road to Ypres from Poperinge to Vlamertinge is in a defile, easily observed from the ridge. A century ago, roads in the area were unpaved, except for the main ones from Ypres, with occasional villages and houses dotted along them. The lowland west of the ridge, was a mixture of meadow and fields, with high hedgerows dotted with trees, cut by streams and a network of drainage ditches emptying into canals.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nIn Flanders, sands, gravels and marls predominate, covered by silts in places. The coastal strip is sandy but a short way into the hinterland, the ground rises towards the Vale of Ypres, which before 1914 was a flourishing market garden. Ypres is 66 ft (20 m) above sea level; Bixschoote 4 mi (6.4 km) to the north is at 28 ft (8.5 m). To the east the land is at 66\u201382 ft (20\u201325 m) for several miles, with the Steenbeek river at 49 ft (15 m) near St Julien. There is a low ridge from Messines, 260 ft (80 m) at its highest point, running north-east past Clapham Junction at the west end of Gheluvelt plateau (\u200b2 1\u20442 miles from Ypres at 213 ft (65 m) and Gheluvelt, above 160 ft (50 m) to Passchendaele, (\u200b5 1\u20442 miles from Ypres at 160 ft (50 m) declining from there to a plain further north. Gradients vary from negligible, to 1:60 at Hooge and 1:33 at Zonnebeke.Underneath the soil is London clay, sand and silt; according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission categories of sand, sandy soils and well-balanced soils, Messines ridge is well-balanced soil and the ground around Ypres is sandy soil. The ground is drained by many streams, canals and ditches, which need regular maintenance. Since 1914 much of the drainage had been destroyed, though some parts were restored by land drainage companies from England. The British considered the area drier than Loos, Givenchy and Plugstreet Wood further south. A study of weather data recorded at Lille, 16 mi (26 km) from Ypres from 1867\u20131916, published in 1989, showed that August was more often dry than wet, that there was a trend towards dry autumns (September\u2013November) and that average rainfall in October had decreased since the 1860s.\n\n\n=== British plans ===\nPreparations for operations in Flanders began in 1915, with the doubling of the Hazebrouck\u2013Ypres rail line and the building of a new line from Bergues to Proven, which was doubled in early 1917. Progress on roads, rail lines, railheads and spurs in the Second Army zone was continuous and by mid-1917, gave the area the most efficient supply system of the BEF. Several plans and memoranda for a Flanders offensive were produced between January 1916 and May 1917, in which the writers tried to relate the offensive resources available to the terrain and the likely German defence. In early 1916, the importance of the capture of the Gheluvelt plateau for an advance further north was emphasised by Haig and the army commanders. On 14 February 1917, Colonel Norman MacMullen of GHQ proposed that the plateau be taken by a mass tank attack, reducing the need for artillery; in April a reconnaissance by Captain Giffard LeQuesne Martel found that the area was unsuitable for tanks.On 9 February, Rawlinson, commander of the Fourth Army, suggested that Messines Ridge could be taken in one day and that the capture of the Gheluvelt plateau should be fundamental to the attack further north. He suggested that the southern attack from St Yves to Mont Sorrel should come first and that Mont Sorrel to Steenstraat should be attacked within 48\u201372 hours. After discussions with Rawlinson and Plumer and the incorporation of Haig's changes, Macmullen submitted his memorandum on 14 February. With amendments the memorandum became the GHQ 1917 plan. A week after the Battle of Messines Ridge, Haig gave his objectives to his army commanders, the wearing out the enemy, securing the Belgian coast and connecting with the Dutch frontier by capturing Passchendaele ridge, followed by an advance on Roulers and Operation Hush, an attack along the coast with a combined amphibious landing. If manpower and artillery were insufficient, only the first part of the plan might be fulfilled. On 30 April, Haig told Gough, the Fifth Army commander, that he would lead the Northern Operation and the coastal force, although Cabinet approval for the offensive was not granted until 21 June.\n\n\n=== German defences ===\n\nThe 4th Army held a front of 25 mi (40 km) with three Gruppen, composed of a corps headquarters and a varying complement of divisions; Group Staden, based on the headquarters of the Guards Reserve Corps was added later. Group Dixmude held 12 mi (19 km) with four front divisions and two Eingreif divisions, Group Ypres held 6 mi (9.7 km) from Pilckem to Menin Road with three front divisions and two Eingreif divisions and Group Wijtschate held a similar length of front south of the Menin road, with three front divisions and three Eingreif divisions. The Eingreif divisions were stationed behind the Menin and Passchendaele ridges. About 5 mi (8.0 km) further back, were four more Eingreif divisions and 7 mi (11 km) beyond them, another two in OHL reserve.The Germans were anxious that the British would attempt to exploit the victory of the Battle of Messines, with an advance to the Tower Hamlets spur beyond the north end of Messines Ridge. On 9 June, Crown Prince Rupprecht proposed a withdrawal to the Flandern line east of Messines. Construction of defences began but was terminated after Fritz von Lo\u00dfberg was appointed Chief of Staff of the 4th Army. Lo\u00dfberg rejected the proposed withdrawal to the Flandern line and ordered that the front line east of the Oosttaverne line be held rigidly. The Flandernstellung (Flanders Position) along Passchendaele Ridge, in front of the Flandern line, would become Flandern I Stellung and a new position, Flandern II Stellung, would run west of Menin, northwards to Passchendaele. Construction of a Flandern III Stellung east of Menin northwards to Moorslede was also begun. From July 1917, the area east of Ypres was defended by the front position, the Albrechtstellung (second position), Wilhelmstellung (third position), Flandern I Stellung (fourth position), Flandern II Stellung (fifth position) and Flandern III Stellung, the sixth position (incomplete). Between the German defences lay villages such as Zonnebeke and Passchendaele, which were fortified and prepared for all-round defence.On 25 June, Erich Ludendorff, the First Quartermaster General, suggested to Crown Prince Rupprecht that Group Ypres should withdraw to the Wilhelmstellung, leaving only outposts in the Albrechtstellung. On 30 June, the army group Chief of Staff, General von Kuhl, suggested a withdrawal to the Flandern I Stellung along Passchendaele ridge, meeting the old front line in the north near Langemarck and Armenti\u00e8res in the south. Such a withdrawal would avoid a hasty retreat from Pilckem Ridge and force the British into a time-consuming redeployment. Lo\u00dfberg disagreed, believing that the British would launch a broad front offensive, that the ground east of the Sehnenstellung was easy to defend and that the Menin road ridge could be held if it was made the Schwerpunkt (point of main effort) of the German defensive system. Pilckem Ridge deprived the British of ground observation over the Steenbeek Valley, while the Germans could see the area from Passchendaele Ridge, allowing German infantry to be supported by observed artillery-fire. Lo\u00dfberg's judgement was accepted and no withdrawal was made.\n\n\n=== Battle of Messines ===\n\nThe first stage in the British plan was a preparatory attack on the German positions south of Ypres at Messines Ridge. The Germans on the ridge had observation over Ypres and unless it was captured, observed enfilade artillery-fire could be fired against a British attack from the salient further north. Since mid-1915, the British had been mining under the German positions on the ridge and by June 1917, 21 mines had been filled with nearly 1,000,000 lb (454 t) of explosives. The Germans knew the British were mining and had taken counter-measures but they were surprised at the extent of the British effort. Two of the mines failed to detonate but 19 went off on 7 June, at 3:10 a.m. British Summer Time. The final objectives were largely gained before dark and the British had fewer losses than the expected 50 percent in the initial attack. As the infantry advanced over the far edge of the ridge, German artillery and machine-guns east of the ridge opened fire and the British artillery was less able to suppress them. The attack removed the Germans from the dominating ground on the southern face of the Ypres salient, which the 4th Army had held since the First Battle of Ypres in 1914.\n\n\n== Battles ==\n\n\n=== July\u2013August ===\n\nHaig selected Gough to command the offensive on 30 April, and on 10 June Gough and the Fifth Army headquarters took over the Ypres salient north of Messines Ridge. Gough planned an offensive based on the GHQ 1917 plan and the instructions he had received from Haig. Gough held meetings with his corps commanders on 6 and 16 June, where the third objective, which included the Wilhelmstellung (third line), a second-day objective in earlier plans, was added to the two objectives due to be taken on the first day. A fourth objective, the red line was also given for the first day, to be attempted by fresh troops, at the discretion of divisional and corps commanders, in places where the German defence had collapsed. The attack was not planned as a breakthrough operation and Flandern I Stellung, the fourth German defensive position, lay 10,000\u201312,000 yd (5.7\u20136.8 mi; 9.1\u201311.0 km) behind the front line and was not an objective on the first day.The Fifth Army plan was more ambitious than the plans devised by Rawlinson and Plumer, which had involved an advance of 1,000\u20131,750 yd (910\u20131,600 m) on the first day, by compressing their first three attacks into one day instead of three. Major-General John Davidson, Director of Operations at GHQ, wrote in a memorandum that there was \"ambiguity as to what was meant by a step-by-step attack with limited objectives\" and suggested reverting to a 1,750 yd (1,600 m) advance on the first day to increase the concentration of British artillery. Gough stressed the need to plan to exploit opportunities to take ground left temporarily undefended, more likely in the first attack, which would have the benefit of long preparation. This had not been done in earlier battles and vacant ground, there for the taking, had been re-occupied by the Germans. At the end of June, Haig added a division to II Corps (Lieutenant-General Claud Jacob) from the Second Army and next day, after meeting with Gough and General Herbert Plumer, the Second Army commander, Haig endorsed the Fifth Army plan.\n\n\n==== Battle of Pilckem Ridge ====\n\nThe British attack began at 3:50 a.m. on 31 July; the attack was to commence at dawn but a layer of unbroken low cloud meant that it was still dark when the infantry advanced. The main attack, by II Corps across the Ghelveult Plateau to the south, confronted the principal German defensive concentration of artillery, ground-holding divisions (Stellungsdivisionen) and Eingreif divisions. The attack had most success on the northern flank, on the fronts of XIV Corps and the French First Army, both of which advanced 2,500\u20133,000 yd (1.4\u20131.7 mi; 2.3\u20132.7 km) to the line of the Steenbeek river. In the centre, XVIII Corps and XIX Corps pushed forward to the line of the Steenbeek (black line) to consolidate and sent fresh troops towards the green line and on the XIX Corps front to the red line, for an advance of about 4,000 yd (3,700 m). Group Ypres counter-attacked the flanks of the British break-in, supported by every artillery piece and aircraft within range, around noon. The Germans were able to drive the three British brigades back to the black line with 70 percent casualties; the German advance was stopped at the black line by mud, artillery and machine-gun fire.\n\n\n==== Capture of Westhoek ====\n\nAfter rain delays from 2 August, II Corps attacked again on 10 August, to capture the rest of the black line (second objective) on the Gheluvelt plateau. The infantry advance succeeded but German artillery-fire and infantry counter-attacks isolated the infantry of the 18th (Eastern) Division in Glencorse Wood. At about 7:00 p.m., German infantry attacked behind a smokescreen and recaptured all but the north-west corner of the wood; only the 25th Division gains on Westhoek Ridge to the north were held. Lieutenant-Colonel Albrecht von Thaer, Chief of Staff of Gruppe Wijtschate (Group Wytschaete, the headquarters of the IX Reserve Corps), noted that casualties after 14 days in the line averaged 1,500\u20132,000 men, compared to 4,000 men on the Somme in 1916 and that German troop morale was higher than the year before.\n\n\n==== Battle of Hill 70 ====\n\nAttacks to threaten Lens and Lille were to be made by the First Army in late June near Gavrelle and Oppy, along the Souchez river. The objective was to eliminate a German salient between Avion and the west end of Lens, by taking reservoir Hill (Hill 65) and Hill 70. The attacks were conducted earlier than planned to use heavy and siege artillery before it was transferred to Ypres, the Souchez operation being cut back and the attack on Hill 70 postponed. The Battle of Hill 70, 30 mi (48 km) south of Ypres, eventually took place from 15 to 25 August. The Canadian Corps fought four divisions of the German 6th Army in the operation. The capture of Hill 70 was a costly success in which three Canadian divisions inflicted many casualties on the German divisions opposite and pinned down troops reserved for the relief of tired divisions in Flanders. Hermann von Kuhl, chief of staff of Army Group Crown Prince Rupprecht, wrote later that it was a costly defeat and wrecked the plan for relieving fought-out (exhausted) divisions in Flanders.\n\n\n==== Battle of Langemarck ====\n\nThe Battle of Langemarck was fought from 16\u201318 August; the Fifth Army headquarters was influenced by the effect that delay would have on Operation Hush, which needed the high tides due at the end of August or it would have to be postponed for a month. Gough intended that the rest of the green line, just beyond the Wilhelmstellung (German third line), from Polygon Wood to Langemarck, was to be captured and the Steenbeek crossed further north. In the II Corps area, the disappointment of 10 August was repeated, with the infantry managing to advance, then being isolated by German artillery and forced back to their start line by German counter-attacks, except in the 25th Division area near Westhoek. Attempts by the German infantry to advance further were stopped by British artillery-fire with many casualties. The advance further north in the XVIII Corps area retook and held the north end of St Julien and the area south-east of Langemarck, while XIV Corps captured Langemarck and the Wilhelmstellung north of the Ypres\u2013Staden railway, near the Kortebeek stream. The French First Army conformed, pushing up to the Kortebeek and St Jansbeck stream west of the northern stretch of the Wilhelmstellung, where it crossed to the east side of the Kortebeek.\n\n\n==== Local attacks ====\n\nOn the higher ground, the Germans continued to inflict many losses on the British divisions beyond Langemarck but on 19 August, after two fine dry days, XVIII Corps conducted a novel infantry, tank, aircraft and artillery operation. German strongpoints and pillboxes along the St Julien\u2013Poelcappelle road in front of the Wilhelmstellung were captured. On 22 August, more ground was gained by XIX and XVIII corps but the tactical disadvantage of being overlooked by the Germans continued. A II Corps attack on the Gheluvelt Plateau from 22 to 24 August, to capture Nonne Bosschen, Glencorse Wood and Inverness Copse, failed in fighting that was costly to both sides. Gough laid down a new infantry formation of skirmish lines to be followed by \"worms\" on 24 August and Cavan noted that pillboxes should be attacked on a broad front, to engage them simultaneously. Another general offensive intended for 25 August, was delayed by the failure of the preliminary attacks and then postponed due to more bad weather. On 27 August, II Corps tried a combined tank and infantry attack but the tanks bogged, the attack failed and Haig called a halt to operations until the weather improved.\n\n\n==== Weather ====\n\nIn Field Marshal Earl Haig (1929), Brigadier-General John Charteris, the BEF Chief of Intelligence from 1915 to 1918, wrote that\n\nCareful investigation of records of more than eighty years showed that in Flanders the weather broke early each August with the regularity of the Indian monsoon: once the Autumn rains set in difficulties would be greatly enhanced....Unfortunately, there now set in the wettest August for thirty years.\nonly the first part of which was quoted by Lloyd George (1934), Liddell Hart (1934) and Leon Wolff (1959); in a 1997 essay, John Hussey called the passage by Charteris \"baffling\". The BEF had set up a Meteorological Section under Ernest Gold in 1915, which by the end of 1917 had 16 officers and 82 men. The section predicted the warm weather and thunderstorms of 7 to 14 June; in a letter to the press of 17 January 1958, Gold wrote that the facts of the Flanders climate contradicted Charteris. In 1989, Philip Griffiths examined August weather in Flanders for the thirty years before 1916 and found that,\n\n...there is no reason to suggest that the weather broke early in the month with any regularity.\nFrom 1901 to 1916, records from a weather station at Cap Gris Nez showed that 65 percent of August days were dry and that from 1913 to 1916, there were 26, 23, 23 and 21 rainless days and monthly rainfall of 17, 28, 22 and 96 mm (0.67, 1.10, 0.87 and 3.78 in);\n\n...during the summers preceding the Flanders campaign August days were more often dry than wet.\nThere were 127 mm (5 in) of rain in August 1917 and 84 mm (3 in) of the total fell on 1, 8, 14, 26 and 27 August. The month was overcast and windless, which much reduced evaporation. Divided into two ten-day and an eleven-day period, there were 53.6, 32.4 and 41.3 mm (2, 1 and 2 in) of rain; in the 61 hours before 6:00 p.m. on 31 July, 12.5 mm (0 in) fell. From 6:00 p.m. on 31 July to 6:00 p.m. on 4 August, there was another 63 mm (2 in) of rain. August 1917 had three dry days and 14 days with less than 1 mm (0 in) of rain. Three days were sunless and one had six minutes of sunshine; from 1 to 27 August there were 178.1 hours of sunshine, an average of 6.6 hours per day. Hussey wrote that the wet weather in August 1917 was exceptional, Haig had been justified in expecting little rain, swiftly dried by sunshine and breezes.\n\n\n==== Verdun ====\n\nPetain had committed the French Second Army to an attack at Verdun in mid-July, in support of the Flanders offensive. The attack was delayed, partly due to mutinies in the French army after the failure of the Nivelle Offensive and because of a German attack at Verdun from 28 to 29 June, which captured some of the French jumping-off points. A French counter-attack on 17 July re-captured the ground, the Germans regained it on 1 August, then took ground on the east bank on 16 August. The French attack on 20 August and by 9 September had taken 10,000 prisoners. Sporadic fighting continued into October, adding to the German difficulties on the Western Front and elsewhere. Ludendorff wrote\n\nOn the left bank, close to the Meuse, one division had failed ... and yet both here and in Flanders everything possible had been done to avoid failure ... The French army was once more capable of the offensive. It had quickly overcome its depression.\nNo German counter-attack was possible because the local Eingreif divisions had been transferred to Flanders.\n\n\n=== September\u2013October ===\n\nThe 4th Army had held on to the Gheluvelt Plateau in August but its casualties worsened the German manpower shortage. Haig transferred the main offensive effort to the Second Army on 25 August and moved the northern boundary of the Second Army closer to the Ypres\u2013Roulers railway. More heavy artillery was sent to Flanders from the armies further south and placed opposite the Gheluvelt Plateau. Plumer continued the tactical evolution of the Fifth Army during its slow and costly progress in August. After a pause of about three weeks, Plumer intended to capture the plateau in four steps, with six-day intervals to bring forward artillery and supplies. The Second Army attacks were to remain limited and infantry brigade tactics were changed to attack the first objective with a battalion each and the final one with two battalions, the opposite of the Fifth Army practice on 31 July, to adapt to the dispersed defences being encountered between the Albrechtstellung and the Wilhelmstellung.Plumer arranged for the medium and heavy artillery reinforcements reaching Flanders to be added to the creeping bombardment, which had been impossible with the amount of artillery available to the Fifth Army. The tactical changes ensured that more infantry attacked on narrower fronts, to a shallower depth than on 31 July, like the Fifth Army attacks in August. The shorter and quicker advances possible once the ground dried, were intended to be consolidated on tactically advantageous ground, especially on any reverse slopes in the area, with the infantry still in contact with the artillery and aircraft, ready to repulse counter-attacks. The faster tempo of operations was intended to add to German difficulties in replacing tired divisions through the railway bottlenecks behind the German front. The pause in British attacks misled the some of the German commanders and Thaer, the Chief of Staff of Gruppe Wijtschate, wrote that it was almost boring. Kuhl doubted that the offensive had ended but had changed his mind by 13 September; two divisions, thirteen heavy artillery batteries, twelve field batteries, three fighter squadrons and four other units of the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte were transferred from the 4th Army.\n\n\n==== German tactical changes ====\n\nAfter setting objectives 1\u20132 mi (1.6\u20133.2 km) distant on 31 July, the British attempted shorter advances of approximately 1,500 yd (1,400 m) in August but were unable to achieve these lesser objectives on the south side of the battlefield, because the rain soaked ground and poor visibility were to the advantage of the defenders. After the dry spell in early September, British advances had been much quicker and the final objective was reached a few hours after dawn, which confounded the German counter-attack divisions. Having crossed 2 mi (3.2 km) of mud, the Eingreif divisions found the British already dug in, with the German forward battle zone and its weak garrison gone beyond recapture. In August, German front-line divisions had two regiments deployed in the front line, with the third regiment in reserve. The front battalions had needed to be relieved much more frequently than expected, due to the power of British attacks, constant artillery-fire and the weather. Replacement units became mixed up with ones holding the front and reserve regiments had failed to intervene quickly, leaving front battalions unsupported until Eingreif divisions arrived some hours later.In July and August, German counter-attack (Eingreif) divisions had conducted an \"advance to contact during mobile operations\", which had given the Germans several costly defensive successes. After the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge, German tactics were changed. After another defeat on 26 September, the German commanders made more tactical changes to counter the more conservative form of limited attacks adopted by the British. German counter-attacks in September had been \"assaults on reinforced field positions\", due to the restrained nature of British infantry advances. The fine weather in early September had greatly eased British supply difficulties, especially in ammunition and the British made time to establish a defence in depth on captured ground, protected by standing artillery barrages. The British attacked in dry, clear conditions, with more aircraft over the battlefield for counter-attack reconnaissance, contact patrol and ground-attack operations. Systematic defensive artillery-fire was forfeited by the Germans, due to uncertainty over the position of their infantry, just when the British infantry benefited from the opposite. German counter-attacks were costly failures and on 28 September, Thaer wrote that the experience was \"awful\" and that he did not know what to do.Ludendorff ordered the Stellungsdivisionen (ground holding divisions) to reinforce their front garrisons; all machine-guns, including those of the support and reserve battalions were sent into the forward zone, to form a cordon of four to eight guns every 250 yd (230 m). The Stellungsdivisionen were reinforced by the Sto\u00df regiments of Eingreif divisions, which were moved into the artillery protective line behind the forward battle zone, to counter-attack sooner. The other regiments of the Eingreif divisions were to be held back and used for a methodical counter-attack (Gegenangriff) a day or two after and for spoiling attacks as the British reorganised. More tactical changes were ordered on 30 September; operations to increase British infantry losses were to continue and gas bombardments were to be increased, weather permitting. Every effort was to be made to induce the British to reinforce their forward positions with infantry for the German artillery to bombard them. Between 26 September and 3 October, the Germans attacked at least 24 times and Operation High Storm Unternehmen Hohensturm, a Gegenangriff (methodical counter-attack), to recapture the area around Zonnebeke was planned for 4 October.\n\n\n==== Battle of the Menin Road Ridge ====\n\nThe British plan for the battle fought from 20\u201325 September, included more emphasis on the use of heavy and medium artillery to destroy German concrete pill-boxes and machine-gun nests, which were more numerous in the battle zones being attacked, than behind the original July front line and to engage in more counter-battery fire. The British had 575 heavy and medium and 720 field guns and howitzers, more than double the quantity of artillery available at the Battle of Pilckem Ridge. Aircraft were to be used for systematic air observation of German troop movements to avoid the failures of previous battles, where too few aircrews had been burdened with too many duties and had flown in bad weather, which multiplied their difficulties.On 20 September, the Allies attacked on a 14,500 yd (8.2 mi; 13.3 km) front and by mid-morning, had captured most of their objectives, to a depth of about 1,500 yd (1,400 m). The Germans made many hasty counter-attacks (Gegensto\u00dfe), beginning around 3:00 p.m. until early evening, all of which failed to gain ground or made only a temporary penetration of the new British positions. The German defence had failed to stop a well-prepared attack made in good weather. Minor attacks took place after 20 September, as both sides jockeyed for position and reorganised their defences. A mutually-costly attack by the Germans on 25 September, recaptured pillboxes at the south western end of Polygon Wood. Next day, the German positions near the wood were swept away in the Battle of Polygon Wood.\n\n\n==== German counter-attack, 25 September ====\n\nTwo regiments of the German 50th Reserve Division attacked on a 1,800 yd (1,600 m) front, either side of the Reutelbeek, supported by aircraft and 44 field and 20 heavy batteries of artillery, four times the usual amount for a division. The German infantry managed to advance on the flanks, about 100 yd (91 m) near the Menin road and 600 yd (550 m) north of the Reutelbeek. The infantry were supported by artillery-observation and ground-attack aircraft; a box-barrage was fired behind the British front-line, which isolated the British infantry from reinforcements and ammunition. Return-fire from the 33rd Division and the 15th Australian Brigade of the 5th Australian Division along the southern edge of Polygon Wood to the north, forced the attackers under cover around some of the Wilhelmstellung pillboxes, near Black Watch Corner, at the south-western edge of Polygon Wood. German attempts to reinforce the attacking troops failed, due to British artillery observers isolating the advanced German troops with artillery barrages.Plumer ordered the attack due on 26 September to go ahead but reduced the objectives of the 33rd Division. The 98th Brigade was to advance and cover the right flank of the 5th Australian Division and the 100th Brigade was to re-capture the lost ground further south. The 5th Australian Division advance the next day began with uncertainty as to the security of its right flank; the attack of the depleted 98th Brigade was delayed and only managed to reach Black Watch Corner, 1,000 yd (910 m) short of its objectives. Reinforcements moved into the 5th Australian Division area and attacked south-westwards at noon as a silent (without artillery support) frontal attack was made from Black Watch Corner, because British troops were known to be holding out in the area. The attack succeeded by 2:00 p.m. and later in the afternoon, the 100th Brigade re-took the ground lost north of the Menin road. Casualties in the 33rd Division were so great that it was relieved on 27 September by the 23rd Division, which had only been withdrawn on the night of 24/25 September.\n\n\n==== Battle of Polygon Wood ====\n\nThe Second Army altered its Corps frontages soon after the attack of 20 September, for the next effort (26 September \u2013 3 October) so that each attacking division could be concentrated on a 1,000 yd (910 m) front. Roads and light railways were extended to the new front line, to allow artillery and ammunition to be moved forward. The artillery of VIII Corps and IX Corps on the southern flank, simulated preparations for attacks on Zandvoorde and Warneton. At 5.50 a.m. on 26 September, five layers of barrage fired by British artillery and machine-guns began. Dust and smoke thickened the morning mist and the infantry advanced using compass bearings. Each of the three German ground-holding divisions attacked on 26 September, had an Eingreif division in support, twice the ratio of 20 September. No ground captured by the British was lost and German counter-attacks managed only to reach ground to which survivors of the front-line divisions had retired.\n\n\n=== October\u2013November ===\n\n\n==== German counter-attacks, 30 September \u2013 4 October ====\n\nAt 4:00 a.m. on 30 September, a thick mist covered the ground and at 4:30 a.m. German artillery began a bombardment between the Menin road and the Reutelbeek. At 5:15 a.m., German troops emerged from the mist on an 800 yd (730 m) front. The attack was supported by flame-throwers and German infantry throwing smoke- and hand-grenades. The British replied with small-arms fire and bombs, forcing the Germans to retreat in confusion but a post was lost south of the Menin road, then retaken by an immediate counter-attack. SOS rockets were not seen in the mist and the British artillery remained silent. The Germans were repulsed again at 6:00 a.m. but German artillery-fire continued during the day.On 1 October, at 5:00 a.m., a German hurricane bombardment began from the Reutelbeek north to Polygon Wood and Black Watch Corner; by coincidence a Second Army practice barrage began at 5:15 a.m. The British front line was cut off and German infantry attacked in three waves at 5:30 a.m. Two determined German attacks were repulsed south of Cameron Covert, then at 7:00 p.m. German troops massed near the Menin road. The German attack was defeated by small-arms fire and the British artillery, whose observers had seen the SOS rockets. The British were forced out of Cameron Covert and counter-attacked but a German attack began at the same time and the British were repulsed. Another German attack failed and the German troops dug in behind some old German barbed wire; after dark, more German attacks around Cameron Covert failed. North of the covert near Polygon Wood, deep mud smothered German shells before they exploded but they still caused many casualties. Communication with the rear was lost and the Germans attacked all day but British SOS rockets remained visible and the attacks took no ground; after dark German attacks were repulsed by another three SOS barrages.Unternehmen Hohensturm (Operation High Storm) was planned by Gruppe Ypern to recapture the Tokio Spur from Zonnebeke south to Molenaarelsthoek at the eastern edge of Polygon Wood on 3 October. The attacking infantry from the 45th Reserve and the 4th Guard divisions were commanded by Major Freiherr von Schleinitz in the north and Lieutenant-Colonel Rave in the south. After the costly failure of the methodical counter-attack ( Gegenangriff) on 1 October, the attack was put back to 4 October, rehearsals taking place from 2 to 3 October. On the night of 3/4 October, the German commanders had doubts about the attack but decided to proceed with the Gegenangriff, warning the artillery to be ready to commence defensive bombardments. A contact patrol aircraft was arranged to fly over the area at 7:30 a.m.\n\n\n==== Battle of Broodseinde ====\n\nOn 4 October, the British began the Battle of Broodseinde to complete the capture of the Gheluvelt Plateau and occupy Broodseinde Ridge. By coincidence, the Germans sought to recapture their defences around Zonnebeke with a Gegenangriff at the same time. The British attacked along a 14,000 yd (8.0 mi; 13 km) front and as the I Anzac Corps divisions began their advance towards Broodseinde Ridge, men were seen rising from shell-holes in no man's land and more German troops were found concealed in shell-craters. Most of the German troops of the 45th Reserve Division were overrun or retreated through the British barrage, then the Australians attacked pillboxes one-by-one and captured the village of Zonnebeke north of the ridge. When the British barrage began on Broodseinde Ridge, the Keiberg Spur and Waterdamhoek, some of the German forward headquarters staffs only realised that they were under attack when British and Australian troops appeared.As news arrived of the great success of the attack, the head of GHQ Intelligence went to the Second Army headquarters to discuss exploitation. Plumer declined the suggestion, as eight fresh German divisions were behind the battlefield, with another six beyond them. Later in the day, Plumer had second thoughts and ordered I Anzac Corps to push on to the Keiberg spur, with support from the II Anzac Corps. The II Anzac Corps commander wanted to advance north-east towards Passchendaele village but the I Anzac Corps commander preferred to wait until artillery had been brought up and supply routes improved. The X Corps commander proposed an attack northward from In de Ster into the southern flank of the Germans opposite I Anzac Corps. The 7th Division commander objected, due to uncertainty about the situation and the many casualties suffered by the 21st Division on the right flank and Plumer changed his mind again. During the morning, Gough had told the Fifth Army corps commanders to push on but when reports arrived of a repulse at 19 Metre Hill, the order was cancelled.\n\n\n==== German defensive changes ====\n\nOn 7 October, the 4th Army again dispersed its troops in the front defence zone. Reserve battalions moved back behind the artillery protective line and the Eingreif divisions were organised to intervene as swiftly as possible once an attack commenced, despite the risk of British artillery-fire. Counter-battery fire to suppress the British artillery was to be increased, to protect the Eingreif divisions as they advanced. All of the German divisions holding front zones were relieved and an extra division brought forward, because the British advances had lengthened the front line. Without the divisions necessary for a counter-offensive south of the Gheluvelt Plateau towards Kemmel Hill, Rupprecht began to plan for a slow withdrawal from the Ypres Salient, even at the risk of uncovering German positions further north and on the Belgian coast.\n\n\n==== Battle of Poelcappelle ====\n\nThe French First Army and British Second and Fifth armies attacked on 9 October, on a 13,500 yd (7.7 mi; 12.3 km) front, from south of Broodseinde to St Jansbeek, to advance half of the distance from Broodseinde ridge to Passchendaele, on the main front, which led to many casualties on both sides. Advances in the north of the attack front were retained by British and French troops but most of the ground taken in front of Passchendaele and on the Becelaere and Gheluvelt spurs was lost to German counter-attacks. General William Birdwood later wrote that the return of heavy rain and mud sloughs was the main cause of the failure to hold captured ground. Kuhl concluded that the fighting strained German fighting power to the limit but that the German forces managed to prevent a breakthrough, although it was becoming much harder to replace losses.\n\n\n==== First Battle of Passchendaele ====\n\nThe First Battle of Passchendaele on 12 October was another Allied attempt to gain ground around Passchendaele. Heavy rain and mud again made movement difficult and little artillery could be brought closer to the front. Allied troops were exhausted and morale had fallen. After a modest British advance, German counter-attacks recovered most of the ground lost opposite Passchendaele, except for an area on the right of the Wallemolen spur. North of Poelcappelle, the XIV Corps of the Fifth Army advanced along the Broembeek some way up the Watervlietbeek and the Stadenrevebeek streams and the Guards Division captured the west end of the Vijwegen spur, gaining observation over the south end of Houthulst Forest. There were 13,000 Allied casualties, including 2,735 New Zealanders, 845 of whom were dead or stranded in the mud of no-man's-land; it was one of the worst days in New Zealand military history.At a conference on 13 October, Haig and the army commanders agreed that attacks would stop until the weather improved and roads could be extended, to carry more artillery and ammunition forward. The offensive was to continue, to reach a suitable line for the winter and to keep German attention on Flanders, with a French attack due on 23 October and the Third Army operation south of Arras scheduled for mid-November. The battle was also costly for the Germans, who lost more than 1,000 prisoners. The German 195th Division at Passchendaele suffered 3,325 casualties from 9 to 12 October and had to be relieved by the 238th Division. Ludendorff became optimistic that Passchendaele Ridge could be held and ordered the 4th Army to stand fast. On 18 October, Kuhl advocated a retreat as far to the east as possible; Armin and Lo\u00dfberg wanted to hold on, because the ground beyond the Passchendaele watershed was untenable, even in winter.\n\n\n==== Action of 22 October ====\n\nOn 22 October the 18th (Eastern) Division of XVIII Corps attacked the east end of Poelcappelle as XIV Corps to the north attacked with the 34th Division between the Watervlietbeek and Broenbeek streams and the 35th Division northwards into Houthulst Forest. The attack was supported by a regiment of the French 1st Division on the left flank of the 35th Division and was intended to obstruct a possible German counter-attack on the left flank of the Canadian Corps as it attacked Passchendaele and the ridge. The artillery of the Second and Fifth armies conducted a bombardment to simulate a general attack as a deception. Poelcappelle was captured but the attack at the junction between the 34th and 35th divisions was repulsed. German counter-attacks pushed back the 35th Division in the centre but the French attack captured all its objectives. Attacking on ground cut up by bombardments and soaked by rain, the British had struggled to advance in places and lost the ability to move quickly to outflank pillboxes. The 35th Division reached the fringe of Houthulst Forest but was outflanked and pushed back in places. German counter-attacks made after 22 October, were at an equal disadvantage and were costly failures. The German 4th Army was prevented from transferring troops away from the Fifth Army and from concentrating its artillery-fire on the Canadians as they prepared for the Second Battle of Passchendaele (26 October \u2013 10 November 1917).\n\n\n==== Battle of La Malmaison ====\n\nAfter numerous requests from Haig, Petain began the Battle of La Malmaison, a long-delayed French attack on the Chemin des Dames, by the Sixth Army (General Paul Maistre). The artillery preparation started on 17 October and on 23 October, the German defenders were swiftly defeated and the French advanced up to 3.7 mi (6.0 km), capturing the village and fort of La Malmaison, gaining control of the Chemin des Dames ridge. The Germans lost 38,000 men killed or missing and 12,000 prisoners, along with 200 guns and 720 machine-guns, against 14,000 French casualties, fewer than a third of the German total. The Germans had to withdraw from their remaining positions on the Chemin des Dames to the north of the Ailette Valley early in November. Haig was pleased with the French success but regretted the delay, which had lessened its effect on the Flanders operations.\n\n\n==== Second Battle of Passchendaele ====\n\nThe British Fifth Army undertook minor operations from 20\u201322 October, to maintain pressure on the Germans and support the French attack at La Malmaison, while the Canadian Corps prepared for a series of attacks from 26 October \u2013 10 November. The four divisions of the Canadian Corps had been transferred to the Ypres Salient from Lens, to capture Passchendaele and the ridge. The Canadians relieved the II Anzac Corps on 18 October and found that the front line was mostly the same as that occupied by the 1st Canadian Division in April 1915. The Canadian operation was to be three limited attacks, on 26 October, 30 October and 6 November. On 26 October, the 3rd Canadian Division captured its objective at Wolf Copse, then swung back its northern flank to link with the adjacent division of the Fifth Army. The 4th Canadian Division captured its objectives but was forced slowly to retire from Decline Copse, against German counter-attacks and communication failures between the Canadian and Australian units to the south.The second stage began on 30 October, to complete the previous stage and gain a base for the final assault on Passchendaele. The attackers on the southern flank quickly captured Crest Farm and sent patrols beyond the final objective into Passchendaele. The attack on the northern flank again met with exceptional German resistance. The 3rd Canadian Division captured Vapour Farm on the corps boundary, Furst Farm to the west of Meetcheele and the crossroads at Meetcheele but remained short of its objective. During a seven-day pause, the Second Army took over another section of the Fifth Army front adjoining the Canadian Corps. Three rainless days from 3\u20135 November eased preparation for the next stage, which began on the morning of 6 November, with the 1st Canadian Division and the 2nd Canadian Division. In fewer than three hours, many units reached their final objectives and Passchendaele was captured. The Canadian Corps launched a final action on 10 November, to gain control of the remaining high ground north of the village near Hill 52.\n\n\n=== December ===\n\n\n==== Night action of 1/2 December 1917 ====\n\nOn 18 November the VIII Corps on the right and II Corps on the left (northern) side of the Passchendaele Salient took over from the Canadian Corps. The area was subjected to constant German artillery bombardments and its vulnerability to attack led to a suggestion by Brigadier C. F. Aspinall, that either the British should retire to the west side of the Gheluvelt Plateau or advance to broaden the salient towards Westroosebeke. Expanding the salient would make the troops in it less vulnerable to German artillery-fire and provide a better jumping off line for a resumption of the offensive in the spring of 1918. The British attacked towards Westroozebeke on the night of 1/2 December but the plan to mislead the Germans by not bombarding the German defences until eight minutes after the infantry began their advance came undone. The noise of the British assembly and the difficulty of moving across muddy and waterlogged ground had also alerted the Germans. In the moonlight, the Germans had seen the British troops when they were still 200 yd (180 m) away. Some ground was captured and about 150 prisoners were taken but the attack on the redoubts failed and observation over the heads of the valleys on the east and north sides of the ridge was not achieved.\n\n\n==== Action on the Polderhoek Spur ====\n\nThe attack on the Polderhoek Spur on 3 December 1917, was a local operation by the British Fourth Army (renamed from the Second Army on 8 November). Two battalions of the 2nd New Zealand Brigade of the New Zealand Division attacked the low ridge, from which German observers could view the area from Cameron Covert to the north and the Menin road to the south-west. A New Zealand advance of 600 yd (550 m) on a 400 yd (370 m) front, would shield the area north of the Reutelbeek stream from German observers on the Gheluvelt spur. Heavy artillery bombarded the ruins of Polderhoek Ch\u00e2teau and the pillboxes in the grounds to mislead the defenders and the attack was made in daylight as a ruse to surprise the Germans, who would be under cover sheltering from the routine bombardments. Smoke and gas bombardments on the Gheluvelt and Becelaere spurs on the flanks and the infantry attack began at the same time as the \"routine\" bombardment. The ruse failed, some British artillery-fire dropped short on the New Zealanders and the Germans engaged the attackers with small-arms fire from Polderhoek Spur and Gheluvelt ridge. A strong west wind ruined the smoke screens and the British artillery failed to suppress the German machine-guns. New Zealand machine-gunners repulsed a counter-attack but the New Zealand infantry were 150 yd (140 m) short of the first objective; another attempt after dark was cancelled because of the full moon and the arrival of German reinforcements.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Analysis ===\nIn a German General Staff publication, it was written that \"Germany had been brought near to certain destruction (sicheren Untergang) by the Flanders battle of 1917\". In his Memoirs of 1938, Lloyd George wrote, \"Passchendaele was indeed one of the greatest disasters of the war ... No soldier of any intelligence now defends this senseless campaign ...\". In 1939, G. C. Wynne wrote that the British had eventually reached Passchendaele Ridge and captured Flandern I Stellung but beyond them were Flandern II Stellung and Flandern III Stellung. The German submarine bases on the coast had not been captured but the objective of diverting the Germans from the French further south, while they recovered from the Nivelle Offensive in April, had succeeded. In 1997, Paddy Griffith wrote that the bite and hold system kept moving until November, because the BEF had developed a workable system of offensive tactics, against which the Germans ultimately had no answer. A decade later, Jack Sheldon wrote that relative casualty figures were irrelevant, because the German army could not afford the losses or to lose the initiative by being compelled to fight another defensive battle on ground of the Allies' choosing. The Third Battle of Ypres had pinned the German army to Flanders and caused unsustainable casualties.In 2018, Jonathan Boff wrote that after the war the Reichsarchiv official historians, many of whom were former staff officers, wrote of the tactical changes after 26 September and their scrapping after the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October, as the work of Lo\u00dfberg. By blaming an individual, the rest of the German commanders were exculpated, which gave a false impression that OHL operated in a rational manner, when Ludendorff imposed another defensive scheme on 7 October. Boff wrote that this narrative was facile and that it avoided the problem faced by the Germans in late 1917. OHL had issued orders to change tactics again days before Lo\u00dfberg was blamed for giving new orders to the 4th Army. Boff also doubted that all of the divisions in Flanders could act on top-down changes. The 119th Division was in the front line from 11 August to 18 October and replied that new tactics were difficult to implement due to lack of training. The tempo of British attacks and the effect of attrition meant that although six divisions were sent to the 4th Army by 10 October, they were either novice units deficient in training or veteran formations with low morale after earlier defeats; good divisions had been diluted with too many replacements. Boff wrote that the Germans consciously sought tactical changes for an operational dilemma for want of an alternative. On 2 October, Rupprecht had ordered the 4th Army HQ to avoid over-centralising command, only to find that Lo\u00dfberg had issued an artillery plan detailing the deployment of individual batteries.At a British conference on 13 October, the Third Army (General Julian Byng) scheme for an attack in mid-November was discussed. Byng wanted the operations at Ypres continued, to hold German troops in Flanders. The Battle of Cambrai began on 20 November and the British breached the first two parts of the Hindenburg Line, in the first successful mass use of tanks in a combined arms operation. The experience of the failure to contain the British attacks at Ypres and the drastic reduction in areas of the western front that could be considered \"quiet\" after the tank and artillery surprise at Cambrai, left the OHL with little choice but to return to a strategy of decisive victory in 1918. On 24 October, the Austro-German 14th Army (General der Infanterie Otto von Below), attacked the Italian Second Army on the Isonzo at the Battle of Caporetto and in 18 days, inflicted casualties of 650,000 men and 3,000 guns. In fear that Italy might be put out of the war, the French and British governments offered reinforcements. British and French troops were swiftly moved from 10 November \u2013 12 December but the diversion of resources from the BEF forced Haig to conclude the Third Battle of Ypres short of Westrozebeke; the last substantial British attack took place on 10 November.\n\n\n=== Casualties ===\nVarious casualty figures have been published for the Third Battle of Ypres, sometimes with acrimony; the highest estimates for British and German casualties appear to be discredited but the British claim to have taken 24,065 prisoners has not been disputed. In 1940, C. R. M. F. Cruttwell recorded 300,000 British casualties and 400,000 German. In the History of the Great War volume Military Operations.... published in 1948, James Edmonds put British casualties at at 244,897 and wrote that equivalent German figures were not available, estimating German losses at 400,000. A. J. P. Taylor wrote in 1972 that no one believed Edmonds' \"farcical calculations\". Taylor put British wounded and killed at 300,000 and German losses at 200,000, \"a proportion slightly better than the Somme\". In 2007, Jack Sheldon wrote that although German casualties from 1 June to 10 November were 217,194, a figure available in Volume III of the Sanit\u00e4tsbericht (Medical Report, 1934), Edmonds may not have included these data as they did not fit his case, using the phrases \"creative accounting\" and \"cavalier handling of the facts\". Sheldon wrote that the German casualties could only be brought up to 399,590 by including the 182,396 soldiers who were sick or treated at regimental aid posts for \"minor cuts and wounds\" but not struck off unit strength; Sheldon wrote \"it is hard to see any merit\" in doing so.Leon Wolff, writing in 1958, gave German casualties as 270,713 and British casualties as 448,688. Wolff's British figure was refuted by John Terraine in a 1977 publication. Despite writing that 448,614 British casualties was the BEF total for the second half of 1917, Wolff had neglected to deduct 75,681 casualties for the Battle of Cambrai, given in the Official Statistics from which he quoted or \"normal wastage\", averaging 35,000 per month in \"quiet\" periods. In 1959, Cyril Falls estimated 240,000 British, 8,525 French and 260,000 German casualties. In his 1963 biography of Haig, Terraine accepted Edmonds' figure of 244,897 British casualties and agreed that German losses were at least equal to and probably greater than British, owing to the strength of British artillery and the high number of German counterattacks; he did not accept Edmonds' calculation that German losses were as high as 400,000. In his 1977 work, Terraine wrote that the German figure ought to be increased because their statistics were incomplete and because their data omitted some lightly wounded men, who would have been included under British casualty criteria, revising the German figure by twenty per cent, which made German casualties 260,400. Prior and Wilson, in 1997, gave British losses of 275,000 and German casualties at just under 200,000. In 1997, Heinz Hagenl\u00fccke gave c.\u2009217,000 German casualties. Gary Sheffield wrote in 2002 that Richard Holmes guessed that both sides suffered 260,000 casualties, which seemed about right to him.\n\n\n=== Subsequent operations ===\n\n\n==== Winter, 1917\u20131918 ====\nThe area to the east and south of the ruins of Passchendaele village was held by posts, those to the east being fairly habitable, unlike the southern ones; from Passchendaele as far back as Potijze, the ground was far worse. Each brigade spent four days in the front line, four in support and four in reserve. The area was quiet apart from artillery-fire and in December the weather turned cold and snowy, which entailed a great effort to prevent trench foot. In January, spells of freezing cold were followed by warmer periods, one beginning on 15 January with torrential rain and gale-force winds, washing away plank roads and duckboard tracks. Conditions in the salient improved with the completion of transport routes and the refurbishment of German pillboxes. Both sides raided and the British used night machine-gun fire and artillery barrages to great effect. On the evening of 3 March 1918, two companies of the 8th Division raided Teal Cottage, supported by a smoke and shrapnel barrage, killed many of the garrison and took six prisoners for one man wounded. A German attack on 11 March was repulsed; after that the Germans made no more attacks, keeping up frequent artillery bombardments and machine-gun fire instead. When the German armies further south began the Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918, \"good\" divisions in Flanders were sent south; the 29th Division was withdrawn on 9 April and transferred to the Lys.\n\n\n==== Retreat, 1918 ====\n\nOn 23 March, Haig ordered Plumer to make contingency plans to shorten the line and release troops for the other armies. Worn-out divisions from the south had been sent to Flanders to recuperate closer to the coast. On 11 April, Plumer authorised a withdrawal of the southern flank of the Second Army. On 12 April, the VIII Corps HQ ordered the infantry retirement to begin that night and the 59th Division was replaced by part of the 41st Division and transferred south. The II Corps had begun to withdraw its artillery at the same time as VIII Corps on the night of 11/12 April and ordered the 36th and 30th divisions to conform to the VIII Corps retirement, which were completed by 13 April, without German interference. On 13 April, Plumer agreed to a retirement in the south side of the salient to a line from Mt Kemmel to Voormezeele [2.5 mi (4.0 km) south of Ypres], White Ch\u00e2teau [1 mi (1.6 km) east of Ypres] and Pilckem Ridge. The 4th Army diary recorded that the withdrawal was discovered at 4:40 a.m. Next day, at the Battle of Merckem, the Germans attacked from Houthulst Forest, north-east of Ypres and captured Kippe but were forced out by Belgian counter-attacks, supported by the II Corps artillery. On the afternoon of 27 April, the south end of the Second Army outpost line was driven in near Voormezeele and another British outpost line was established north-east of the village.\n\n\n=== Commemoration ===\n\nThe Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing commemorates those of all Commonwealth nations (except New Zealand) who died in the Ypres Salient and have no known grave. In the case of the United Kingdom only casualties before 16 August 1917 are commemorated on the memorial. United Kingdom and New Zealand servicemen who died after that date are named on the memorial at Tyne Cot Cemetery. There is a New Zealand Memorial marking where New Zealand troops fought at Gravenstafel Ridge on 4 October, located on Roeselarestraat. There are numerous tributes and memorials in Australia and New Zealand to Anzac soldiers who died in the battle, including plaques at the Christchurch and Dunedin railway stations. The Canadian Corps' participation in the Second Battle of Passchendaele is commemorated with the Passchendaele Memorial at site of the Crest Farm on the south-west fringe of Passchendaele village.One of the newest monuments to be dedicated to the fighting contribution of a group is the Celtic Cross memorial, commemorating the Scottish contribution to the fighting in Flanders during the Great War. This memorial is on Frezenberg Ridge where the 9th (Scottish) Division and the 15th (Scottish) Division fought during the Third Battle of Ypres. The monument was dedicated by Linda Fabiani, the Minister for Europe of the Scottish Parliament, during the late summer of 2007, the 90th anniversary of the battle. In July 2017 a two-day event was organised in Ypres to mark the centenary of the battle. Members of the British Royal family and Prime Minister Theresa May joined the ceremonies, which started in the evening of 30 July with the service at Menin Gate, followed by ceremonies at the Market Square. On the following day, a ceremony was held at Tyne Cot cemetery, headed by the Prince of Wales.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPasschendaele, a 2008 Canadian film with the battle as a backdrop.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nConnelly, M.; Goebel, S.

          "We really enjoyed this museum, it is well laid out, lots to see and read, plus you get an audio device full of interesting information. The grounds outside are lovely to walk around. From here you can follow trails to Tyne Cot Cemetery and other memorials. Very interesting.",

          "The Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917 presents the historic story of the First World War in a poignant and vivid way, with a particular emphasis on the Battle of Passchendaele. This battle in 1917 is known as one of the most horrific battles from the First World War, with more",
          "This is a follow up review following a previous visit about 5 years ago. We have just visited again as a couple this time though with friends. We had not told them what to expect and we were not disappointed by their reactions as we toured the exhibition. They were fascinated by",
          "Having attend the 100years memorial service last year we returned to the museum and we all found it a very moving experience.We were given hand held audio devices and were able to follow the story of Passchendale with ease,we found the dugout and trenches extremely thought",
          "this museum is focused on the battle of passchendaele itself interspersed with other elements of the war. visited armistice weekend so was busy, but were lucky that we got in before the bust trips turned up making the queue even longer. the audio guides are a great touch & give",
          "My wife and I had wanted to visit this area due to her family connections through her Grandfather who fought, was seriously injured (lost his left hand + other injuries) but survived but did not tell the tale - he was not the only one. On arrival, we enquired about a lift as my",
          "Found this a very difficult place to find considering the importance and size of the grounds. The Museum is excellent as well as the grounds which contain memorial gardens of all the principal nations involved, including Germany. Well worth a visit and also a place where you can",
          "A museum and grounds that depict Passchendale, no matter how many sites of museums you visit, there is always something new to move you or make you think how lucky you are. Visit the site and keep this wonderful museum going",
          "As part of my pilgrimage to Ypres Salient and battlefields tour visited this museum during day around Passchendaele and Tyne Cot Cemetery",
          "Great place to learn more about WW1. Experience a little of what it was like in the trenches and \u201cunderground\u201d in bunkers. Nice little gift shop to finish the tour and plenty of grounds to walk in and enjoy the serenity.",
          "This museum and experience is stunning. The audio tour is perfect for learning, full of information and you can go along at your own pace. There is so much history in this place and many artefacts from the war. The dugout and trench experience only added to the atmosphere and",
          "The museum guides you through the war using a combination of different methods. Be prepared to walk up and down stairs as you move through the museum. You can walk through reconstructed trenches and also underground dugouts giving you a sense of the terrible conditions they had",
          "We visited this museum in the past, but decided to revisit it because of the new addition. There is plenty of parking next to the museum. But the museum gets a lot of visitors and it is advised to come early in the morning. It can be crowded when a bus full of English",
          "This Museum tells the story of what happened in this area during World War 1. Brings the era to life (and death)",
          "A visit to this very special place is a requirement if you want to get some actual experience of what life in the trenches was like. The new memorial garden is a place of solitude and will look terrific when it is finally finished.",
          "An excellent exhibition and museum of the Great War, with lots to see and do. The grounds of the museum are filled with canvas tents with re-enactment groups showing you the artifacts and life of the times. There are trenches and dugouts to explore too. My only criticism,",
          "What looks like a big old house from the outside transforms itself into a great museum once you get inside. Very interesting presentations of the WWI history of the area and a cool recreation of the trenches. Really a great museum for folks who are into that significant period",
          "The first part of the museum was very informative and is contained in a large well presented fashion. Rooms concentrate on clothing, weaponry, equipment. The second part of the museum consists of a labyrinth of underground rooms replicating a series of rooms built in Zonnebeke",
          "I cannot stress enough that this museum is the best of its kind my father and I have seen to date. The gardens, library and the exhibits come together to make a superbly informative and, at times, heart rending account of the horrors of the First Great War, specifically in the",
          "The Battle of Passchendaele has personal meaning to us (grandfather) and this museum turned out to be a very good first stop. We found out lots of things we didn't know and the reconstructed trenches gave us a little bit of a feel for what trench warfare must have been like.",
          "This is superb so much history in such a small space, it's presented very well and the audio guide is great. You walk your way through the war and the trenches. I can't recommend this highly enough.",
          "This is a must visit for everyone to discover more about the horror of war in 1914-1918 The trenches are superbly done and a sober reminder of how many millions suffered during the conflict You cannot come away from the visit without being a little better educated and thoughtful",
          "A great museum to get an insight and experience of the 1st World War, including walking in a trench system and seeing what life was like in a bunker complex. The personal audio guide is a great way of finding out about the exhibits and allows you to go round at your own pace.",
          "Great museum. Great experience to walk in the underground trench system. You\u2019re given an audio device to get all the info on the displays. A truly humbling experience to imagine what the heroes endured.",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to this museum,lots of exhibits and the recreations of the trenches give a little idea of what life was like for the troops.I much preferred this museum to the in Flanders fields museum which I found a bit too worthy and dry",
          "This serves as a great memory and educational centre showing the suffering and hardships of the First World War ending 100 years ago",
          "Not our first visit here but well worth a return. Great items in the museum and the recreation of life underground and the trenches in the grounds offers an insight into life during that time. Well worth a visit.",
          "This is the must visit museum although from the entrance it is very deceiving. We paid our entrance fee and got our audio guides (which are essential) then climbed the stairs to the start of the \"trail\" through the museum - it is a bit like an Ikea store where you start at the",
          "Would recommend having the audio which gives you a running commentary of each exhibit. There is lots to see and gives a good account if events. The trenches were very realistic so worth a look. In parts not great if you struggle with steps especially that are steep. Excellent",
          "We were on a tour and only given about 75 minutes. That is not nearly enough time! There are so many displays to see-uniforms, everyday life, munitions, etc. You start on an upper floor of the chateau and work your way down to the Underground, where you can see what life was",
          "This has a mixture of history and a bit of active listening and doing. At the start of tour you work your way to the top (lift for those who need it. There is a recordings as you go around to tell you in detail if you do not want to read. There are a number of items on display",
          "We planned a visit here and it was much better than expected. Sometimes these places can be less interesting for a 13 year old but this had interactive items, a fab audio commentary which you took with you the whole way. We spent a good 2 hours there and my 13 year old daughter",
          "The museam is fantastic, in plain language it tells you what the war was about, what it was like to fight, and does not confuse by adding too much detail. Its really imformative and edcuational.",
          "This is chilling and awe inspiring in equal measures. Senseless massacre of hundreds of thousands on men shown to be fighting the weather and resulting conditions as much as the \u201c enemy \u201c. The personal items on display merely reinforce the tragedy.",
          "This museum is well thought out and presented, making it really educational and informative. The dugouts and the replica trenches offered a very valuable experience. We learned a lot from our visit which was also very good value. We would highly recommend this museum to learn",
          "I would like to say that this is a well presented and thoughtful way of presenting the subject matter as a commercial concern, but this in no way trivialises the subject matter and duty of remembrance The audio guide hand held speakers actually work!!, just take care to locate",
          "This museum (and the In Flanders Fields Museum) are those 2 places you have to visit to get an impression of The Great War.",
          "We really found this museum to be emotional but at the same time fascinating on what the soldiers had to go through with the equipment they had. The audio tour was well done & it meant that you could go at your own pace. There were a few stairs in the place & walking in the",
          "Visited this museum with a 1 yr old on the road trip home from 10 days in Normandy and after lots of ww2 museums. This museum was the best place we visited our entire holiday. It would have been the best even if they were not helpful with small children, but they were that as",
          "On our visit around the Ypres area we re visited the Passchendale Museum, it is excellent, well laid out and plenty to see and listen to, worth getting the scanning unit to take around the exhibits, short film to watch and then go into the trenches to get a real feel of how they",
          "Excellent museum. The visit was informative and worthwhile. It covered all aspects of WW1 and gives an idea of what it was like to spend time in the trenches. Bart who is a tour guide was excellent in the information he had about the area and was happy to answer any questions we",
          "Excellent museum,well thought out and very engaging which will keep younger visitors interested during their visit. Highly recommend a visit.",
          "In my opinion, the best museum in the region to tell you the story of what happened here during WO1. The feeling you get walking through the reconstructed dugouts and trenches, the well explained displays of items and gear and a really well told chronological sequence of events",
          "I came here as part of an organised tour so unfortunately couldn't spend as much time as I'd have liked to really see everything (I practically had to jog through the trenches so I didn't miss the bus!). Well worth a visit.",
          "This museum in a former chateau is well worth a visit, it is informative and uses technology so keeps children of all ages interested. The hand set links to numbers so that displays are explained in simple terms. There are hands on displays of helmets, back packs and smells.",
          "The museum is very up to date with interactive screens and accessibility for multiple languages. The exhibits are varied and interesting even to a group of teenagers that have travelled 6 hours from England that day. The underground dugout was really showing how cramped it was",
          "Travelling with my children (11 - 16 years) we stopped here to break our journey south encouraged by previous reviews. I'm so glad we did. An excellent museum which presents what can be a difficult story, very well indeed. The audio guides are fantastic and suited both myself",
          "This is a really excellent museum, with a terrific audioguide and a lot to see. You start in the museum, visit all the exhibits whilst listening to information on the audio guide. Then you descend down into \u2018dugouts\u2019, still listening to the audio guide and learn about those.",
          "You can't visit this area without taking in this memorial. It's a park and museum which make beauty out of the beast of war. The parkland is stunning and a perfect picnic spot. The museum itself is all-engrossing. Go and weep and man's inhumanity to man.",
          "Set in a beautiful parkland with gardens n walks to visit,the museum is housed in a wonderful building. With the audio guide you work your way through. The upper levels are an overview of the war..causes and conditions. You then make your way through a recreated trench living",
          "It's always very mouving when you enter this museum. Tourist or not, a must see when you want to learn about the Great War.",
          "Set in large ground this museum is excellent and provides an overview of the five battles of Ypres including Passchendaale. There are \"Poppy gardens\" which are themed gardens in the grounds didicated to the various nations that fought the Battle of Passchendaale. I think they",
          "This museum is located on a large domain with a big park. We thought this to be the best museum experience, with a good audio guide and trenches experience, which was very impressive and educational.",
          "Wow this Museum is amazing I cannot recommend it high enough ! You really experience the awfulness of Passchendaele and the huge loss of life. They have recreated the trenches and the tunnels and you really can feel how terrible it must have been for the poor soldiers from both",
          "This experience was, I feel, a must see. Yes it was busy but we could all take our time. It was a revelation.",
          "This is the best museum in the Ypres area. The underground living quarters are very good (although the stairway down is lethal!), there is a first rate film which explains 1917 in great clarity and the exhibits are well laid out. Walking through the trench system gives a good",
          "Like many I love a good museum and I have a strong interest in ww1 and ww2. This however is astounding. I'm not one for an organised trip so we visited here and the Tyne Cot Cemetry which is a good 30 min walk away. However the lovely lady at the desk of the museum did give us a",
          "Starting from just before the war and ending with the background of the CWGC. There is a lot to see inside, so take your time. Could be a bit to long for some people. Only downside: the audio-guide does not really offer more information then what you can read on the displays",
          "Very well done museum giving experience of the trenches and underground tunnels and rooms in Flanders Fields during WW1. Great explanation of the history and life for the soldiers. Highly recommended. Go to Tyne Cot cemetery as well. Very moving.",
          "Fantastic museum very thought provoking . Excellent audio facilities fantastic displays films etc . There is a dug out walk and a trench walk . Beautifully presented memorial gardens one not to miss",
          "This is an excellent museum. As you enter through the main stairwell you imagine it to be small but the exhibition works it's way through the house and keeps on going! I was fascinated by the exhibits from start to finish. Each area has an audio commentary which you can listen",
          "Nice place to visit. Not far from Ypres but also pricey for what you see. \u20ac21.00 for 2 people. Museum tour lasts about 20-30 minutes. Still glad we went though.",
          "This museum does cover the battles of Ypres, and the audio tour is okay but the beauty is in the trenches and the bunkers that they have built (a replica of the ones under Zonnebeke church). It is a very good museum with lots of exhibits and things to see but be aware that some",
          "THE TRAVELLING COSGROVES The one where they\u2019re about to give you far too much information about a truly incredible day As a mum of a son, I found today way too emotional, as we made our trip back in time to the horrors of the First World War. Up until today, my knowledge",
          "I would highly recommend this as a starting or finishing point on a tour of the area. It vividly brings to life the feel, smell and the impact of war on this area and every one's lives. From how the battle's took shape, to the impact on the area and individuals. Great care",
          "Having just visited Tyne Cot we stopped off at the Passchendaele Museum and I can honestly say that we all thought that it bought a horror to what we had seen at Tyne Cot, made all the more real when some of the soldiers who died were a similar age to my children.",
          "the best way to start any visit to Ypres, for adults and children.it explains everything really well. excellently presented and very informative",
          "The main building contains the usual selection of exhibits and displays of WW1 artifacts and information, but the best parts of the overall presentation are the reconstructed dugouts in its basement and the extensive range of reconstructed trench types covering the whole period",
          "The Memorial Museum Passchendaele commerates the horrific battle in which over 400,000 soldiers died to gain only a few kilometers. There is much to see in this museum. It includes a full size dugout which you actually descend into and see how the soldiers lived up close to",
          "For any Canadian, this is a must-see place. It is yet another scene of an outstanding Canadian victory, at a terrible price, some 16,000 casualties on the first day of fighting alone.",
          "A very informative museum with a great audio system. There was not an over load of reading but it was well written and factually to the point. Excellent exhibits and reconstructed trenches. A very interesting short video and hands on things for the children.. Set up in stages",
          "We went almost by accident and finished up spending a few hours there. The museum is magnificent and has, in my opinion, no equal in the area. A great deal of effort has been put into the layout of the place and the exhibits on display. If you are visiting the WW1 battlefields",
          "Just down the road from tynecot. Museum in a chateau, set in lovely grounds. ideal for families with great walks and cafe, toilets etc. Also a large pond for fishing competition! Some lovely play equipment for little ones and loads of parking. The museum pieces are amazing and",
          "A very interactive museum that separates the most important year 1917 off from the rest of the WWI years and concentrates the visitor's attention to this most important turning point. Not only do you experience the underground tunnels but also can \"walk through\" an outside",
          "The first thing you notice on arrival at the museum is the grounds that it is set in, they are beautiful and tranquil, although we didn't have the time to take in the many walks available. We did see the Canadian Memorial Garden which is so well laid out and in some respects",
          "A great museum giving a vivid insight as to how it must have been to have actually been there in the trenches one hundred years ago. Good that such horrors are not forgotten.",
          "This is a very nice museum. For starters the surrounding park is nice and quiet. Don't be fooled by the building, it's a lot bigger then that building alone. The audio guide is quite handy as it gives extra information. It's very well done and the atmosphere is well done.",
          "We visited as part of a large group. We spent around 1 to 2 hours at the museum but could have spent longer as there is plenty to see. The underground and trench experience are really good with an excellent attention to detail.",
          "The experience is total. There are free audio guides. Things to smell hear and experience. The trip through the trenches was only missing the mud, wet and rats.",
          "Fantastic museum with good audio guide Well laid out with lots of information and things to do. Free parking was also a bonus",
          "Visited (March, 2018); easy to find, good sized free car park - well set out in extensive grounds. A quality museum deals with a very complicated subject in an educational and instructive way. Maybe geared towards a younger audience - plenty of school parties there. Worth",
          "This is an amazing place to visit for those who want to have a wider knowledge of the events of WWI. The museum contains trenches and bunks that are replicants of the real life versions that soldiers were in, in WWI",
          "A very good museum on the history of trench warfare and of WWI experience. Well designed and kept up museum includes trench reproductions that brought history to life. My 8 year old especially liked these. Nice audio guide does a great job of explaining what you are seeing and",
          "Thus place is amazing. Cost 10.50 euro each and is well worth a visit. Take the audio through the house. Very interesting and informative. Tour takes you through the museum down into a reconstruction of underground tunnels then outside to reconstructed trenches. Absolutely",
          "It's easy to spend most of the day here. The dug outs and trenches give a real feel of how it might have felt one hundred years ago and the conditions the men had to live in. Many exhibits of uniforms and artillery to give an understanding of the time. Incidentally a very",
          "A very telling history of trench warfare and the military development of ww1. excellent dugout and trench reproductions to give a glimpse of what it might have been like. very easy not to \"get it\" with the sun on your face and leaves on the trees, but the audio guide does a",
          "This was powerful and extensive museum. We rented a car from Bruges to visit. Very interesting exhibits with thorough audio guide. Has replica trenches and tunnels.",
          "I visited the museum on Thursday with my 2 children aged 13 & 11. Quite frankly the best learning experience one could wish for. The headset documentary in most rooms explains in easy language (very suitable for children) the details of the Passchendaele war. I learned more",
          "We visited the museum earlier this month. We very much appreciated how much effort had been made to make it accessible, even with a baby asleep in a buggy. The staff member who helped us get around was wonderful. The background \u2018music\u2019 playing throughout the main house really",
          "This was a brilliant experience. The museum was so well done and informative - a must see. The walk through the trenches was an eye opener. The surrounded park is a beautiful place to walk and remember fallen family members of WW1. Some of the signs outside would be good in",
          "This is an extraordinary museum, giving a real insight into WW1 in Belgium. The mix of displays, walking through the dugouts and the audio guide were all so informative and well done that the time flew by. Amazing experience not to be missed.",
          "I\u2019ve done many battlefields before hand and museums this has to one of the better ones in Belgium. The building itself don\u2019t look big and you think it will be over quickly but don\u2019t let that fool you. Easily spend a few hours here. Start of in the museum which has everything",
          "Stayed in Ypres for 5 days with a friend so I could lay a wreath on my great uncle's grave on the 100yr anniversary of his death. Visited this museum the day before and wow, awesome place. We had bought tickets to go into the dug-out and thought 2 hours would be plenty to get",

Inside there is loads of artefacts and a great exhibition of a recreated",

          "Nothing to add to what previous reviewers have said. I would endorse their opinions that this a \u201cmust see\u201d museum of the highest quality. The only negative is that after visiting Sanctuary Wood trenches and the Zonnenbeke Church Dugout ( now sealed up again) the mock trenches &",
          "This was an excellent museum which gave you a flavour (as best as one can) of how horrific it would have had to have been to be in the damp, soggy, dangerous, rat-infested trenches waiting for the enemy to come and kill you! It was by far the best museum about the warfare side",
          "This was by far the best war museum we visited. Very informative, and very well done. Walk through the museum and see firearms, military equipment, uniforms, and the like. Outside are preserved trenches that transport you back 100 years. Absolutely amazing.",
          "This museum offers surprising insight into what life was like at Paschendaele - well without the actual awful experience. You're given sights, sounds, smells of various gases, easy-to-absorb information, excellent displays, and then you head underground to see what life was like",
          "An excellent museum. Inside a chateau rebuilt in the 1920s. Beautiful building. Museum has very interesting exhibits, excellent artefacts and great explanations. The museum is probably the best one I visited in the area. In addition, there are reconstructed trenches and a",
          "This museum is outstanding. It chronicles the battles fought in WW1 around the region very well. The floor plan is excellent and they have a highly recommended short film on the Battle of Passchendale. The trench experience is outstanding. Well worth a visit.",
          "This museum is absolutely brilliant, exhibitions are superb and the electronic audio aid is so informative. Walking in the trenches was a great experience but very touching and thought provoking I cannot rate it highly enough Simply superb!!!!!!",

          "We should have allowed at least half a day here to take in fully all the exhibits. We paid 13 Euros each that included the nearby visit to the dug out underneath the church foundations that has recently been drained. The museum is linked room by room throughout the chateau.",
          "I had been meaning to bring a school group to this museum for a few years and finally got the chance yesterday. This far surpasses the In Flanders Fields museum for a number of reasons. Firstly, the traditional museum part of the experience is well laid out in small but easily",
          "The Passchebdaele Memorial Museum is a 'must' for any visit to Ypres. Totally re-organised the story of the battle is sensitively presented with a variety of exhibits - photographs, artifects and reconstructions. A very informative two hours can be spent walking the prescribed",

          "If you have a hard time choosing which museum to visit - go to this one. Covers everything from WW1 - uniforms, artefacts, maps, movies, trenches etc. The dugouts beside the church is worth a visit too - this part is only open till November '17.",
          "The museum is located throughout, underneath and across the grounds of the Zonnebeke chateau about 10-15 minutes from Ypres. Ample parking. Good caf\u00e9. Exhibits cover everything from uniform, equipment, weaponry, and of course in many ways the human realities of WW1 in the area.",
          "If you've booked a tour of the Zonnebeke Church Dugout, come early and do the museum first - it will mean much more to you. The museum is fabulous, and really brings to life the everyday existence of the troops who lived and died here. There are pipes, playing cards,",

          "This museum is one of the best Great War exhibitions I have ever visited. It shows every detail of the soldiers interior and living. It starts from the first days of war, shows the razzle-dazzle when the soldiers arrive at the battle fields. It leads you through the underground",
          "To be truthful the museum itself is just another ww1 museum of which their are many. However the visit was made by the churchdugout exhibition. Opened up after 100 years 5 metres below the ground and due to only remain open this summer/Autumn. The ww1 construction will collapse",
          "Excellent museum, well worth a visit. Quite an extensive display covering multiple floors giving a glimpse of what life might have been like in trench warfare. There is the option of going outside to visit some trenches. Overall great experience. Took advantage of a lovely",
          "Always good. Worth a visit while you are here. It explains a lot about Passchendaele and there are lots of interActive things like smelling gas.",
          "This is a wonderful museum and experience and we learnt about it by having visited the In Flanders Field exhibition in The Cloth Hall in Ypres the day before. We receive a discount voucher of 1.50 euros for the Zonnebeke exhibition and with the tour of the Church Dugout came to",
          "A great fact filled museum with plenty of twists and turns along the way. The route of the museum involves descending into a dugout and trenches along the other cabinets filled with information about both sides of the conflict. We paid extra for an audio tour which gave extra",
          "I have been to the Western Front many many times and in my opinion the best Museum has always been In Flanders Field, Ypres BUT this one takes the biscuit. The museum itself is housed in an oldish building with creaky floors, set in a beautiful park with lake and lawns and a",
          "A thoroughly engrossing museum. Excellent. Lots to see, read and do, whether outside or inside. Many items on display from WW1. You head downstairs into the dark corridors, getting a feel of what the horror must have been like trying to survive in such an environment for an",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this museum, there is so much to see and the trenches and dugout really give you an idea of what it was like. We also did the Zonnebeke church dugout tour as part of our entry to the museum, it was fascinating and definitely worth a visit. Our",
          "Excellent museum, the audio guide is a must as it gives additional information to the exhibits. The examples of the German and British trenches show how Britain lost so many men.",
          "You will have to be quick to see this fascinating sight as its due for permanent closure in November but quite something to experience if you get the chance. The museum has all the artefacts that were discovered which is fascinating but the chance to go down gave the opportunity",
          "This is a good museum but the adult entry price is far too expensive at 10.5 euros, even with an audioguide. It is by far the most expensive entry fee of all the museums in the area. The other problem is that if you go into the museum just after a group has arrived you are",
          "With all due respect, if you want a WWI experience visit this museum. It's difficult to put into words but this museum has it all. From the artefacts on display to the dugout and the trenches it cannot be faulted for the effort that has gone in to making this one of the most",
          "This museum really brought home to me the horror of the \"great war\", the facts of all leading up to Passchendaele, and much I didn't know about the whole war. It was really well laid out, bu tdo make sure you have plenty of time to do the place justice. We had to rush round the",
          "Very well conceived museum, creating a real impression on World War I. Temporary underground construction 'Dug Out' also truly impressive. Memorial garden very respectful.",
          "As a New Zealander this was a very moving place. We were lucky enough to have a guided half day tour by Freddie De Clerk...apologies if I got the name wrong but what he doesn't know, you don't need to know. Zonnebekke museum was awesome, could have spent longer there, totally",
          "I think that this is by far the best museum in the Ypres Salient battlefield area. There is a huge amount of things to see, look at and read but by far the best part of the museum is the Dugout experience and the trenches. Both are recreations but are realistic and well done.",
          "When we reached Zonnebeke we saw the sign to the Memorial Museum. It is situated in a park with a lake in the centre which was very popular with local anglers and their families. When we were told about the museum we expected to be in about 20 minutes. We came out two and a",
          "This museum experience was excellent for the whole family. When we arrived they said the museum would take 1.5 hours, we found it took us well over 3 hours to fully complete. We were lucky enough to experience the church dug out which was a really amazing experience especially",
          "An unique opportunity to walk through an original dugout 10 meters down. It is planned to be allowed to reflood in November 17, but it is likely the many movement detectors will call an end to the experience before then",
          "This is an excellent museum with lots of very good exhibits. I found it easier to get around, and more interesting, than the 'In Flanders Field' museum in nearby Ypres (though that was still good). You also get the opportunity to visit reconstructed dugout and trenches. If you",
          "The museum covers multiple aspects of the battles fought in the area between Ieper (Ypres) and Passchendale: the nature and history of the battles, equipment used, the forces involved etc. The displays are excellent and very informative. There is an underground area recreating a",
          "The variety of things to see was great, the children enjoyed the trenches.It was very interesting and worth the entrance fee.",
          "Very beautiful muse with an interesting collection ang great info. The church dugout, found during construction works, is open for a limited time only. It is a must see!",
          "With detailed displays, sound and smell effects, original material trenches and surrounded by a stunning park, this museum provides a great insight in the First World War. Free parking, wheel chair accessible, helpful staff. Highly recommended.",
          "An excellent way to spend a few hours! Very worthwhile & informative. Lots underground so not so good if at all bothered by claustrophobia or similar. Lovely park nearby & great way to while away a few hours & lovely tea place nearby!!",
          "Excellent background to the 3rd Battle of Ypres. Does not grab the emotions like a cemetery visit, and so felt a bit dry. Interesting video interviews with survivors of the battles. Really good representations of the dugout and trenches, and lots of historical detail, but these",
          "An excellent museum, providing plenty of information and artefacts, which helped us to understand all aspects of WW1. Do not miss the watching the short video.",
          "Family trip to Zonnebeke, including a visit to the museum. We found it interesting and informative. The children enjoyed the more interactive parts most. Trying on armour and exploring the dugout and trench sections, were definitely favourites, but there was plenty for",
          "The museum in Passchendaele Memorial Park is like many other war museums you will have seen, consisting mainly of uniforms, weapons, ordnance and other artefects in glass cases, with notices in several languages describing the contents. You can also get guides on audio headsets.",
          "so much to learn and what a place to be educated about this area and the tales form world war1 , staff were very helpful and it was nice to see school trips going around showing and educating the children of today about yesterday. VERY HIGHLY RECOMENDED",
          "a very atmospheric museum , full of exhibits and stores , quite sobering however thoroughly recommend",
          "A friend in Canada recommended this museum and I am glad that I visited. The collections are extensive and well presented. I actually learned quite a bit here. If you could only visit one Western Front museum, I recommend this one.",
          "The basement of this chateau has been made into bunkers and represents the conditions in which the British soldiers lived (if they were lucky). Very atmospheric it's a must see.",
          "Situated in a park with a lake, this museum is inside a beautiful old timber framed building. We paid 21.00 euros for 2 tickets and for this you get an audio tour and a visitor's guide (156 page book) all about the war in Flanders. Your tour starts on the 1st floor with displays",
          "This museum is a must-see! It is different in nature from the In Flanders Fields museum in Ypres (Ieper), and therefore both can be visited without too much overlap. Covering WW1, the converted mansion takes you through different rooms of artefacts before then taking you down",
          "This is a very powerful site, combining a museum with mock-ups of underground bunkers and wartime trenches. In a few weeks we will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the seat of the Battle of Passchendaele, so it is very surprising that a number of exhibits are missing, and",
          "Went here on a day trip when visiting Brugge. A bit of a journey but very worthwhile. The museum is very well laid out and great for all languages. Extremely informative and provides a great understanding of what all armies went through during the various campaigns at",
          "What a wonderful, inspiring and educative visit.myou get a real feel for what it was like in World War 1. Lots to see and listen to. The hand held audio guide was superb. You get an experience of being underground and in trenches. The museum is set in a beautiful parkland and it",
          "We visited the Memorial museum in April this year after attending the 100th anniversary of the battle of Vimy Ridge. We have visited quite a few sites and we found this museum totally amazing. The level of detail is quite astounding. You can track the progress of the battles in",
          "Beautiful grounds and a surprisingly detailed museum complete with replicas of the underground tunnels and open trenches. Well worth the trip and it's also closely Tyne Cot cemetery which is also amazing.",
          "A very comprehensive museum depicting ww1 and the battles around the area. Should be coupled with a trip to Menin Gate for last post.",
          "Take a few hours to explore this interactive museum which tells the story of the Battle of Passchendaele (part of the Ypres Salient) in WW1. A complete collection allows you to view everything from the uniforms of the soldiers, the weaponry, the way soldiers lived, photographs",
          "We visited for the first time recently and enjoyed? The realistic dioramas and exhibits here, from the descriptions of what it was like to be in the conflict to the dugouts and trenches. All in a most beautiful setting. If you are seeking a First World War experience - don't",
          "This museum really puts into perspective the devestation of WWI on Ieper and the surrounding area. Not to mention the loss of life on both sides. It was very well put otgether with accuracy and care. The dugout nad trench system is also very well done. The ability to see the way",
          "This is simply one of the best museums I have seen anywhere, and certainly the best war museum. Dedicated to the First World War, it encapsulates every aspect of the battle on the front lines, providing a fascinating and very sobering insight into what went on and how the",
          "This museum is superb, as well as the fabulous displays of artefacts that you would expect, the recreated underground bunkers and trenches are long enough to give you an idea of what they were really like (minus the noise, stench, horror and danger of course). The recreated",
          "We called in on the last day of our trip to Ypres, the sun was out, so we walked the gardens and forest walks instead of going into the museum. The Poppy Garden designs are very well thought out and will surely resonate with the visitors from those countries. A lovely",
          "I've visited this excellent museum on two previous occasions and most recently on April 06. It has remained steadfast to it's origins and has not tried to overly \"modernize\" as many museums nowadays are doing i.e. the Army Museum in London which in my opinion has been ruined!",
          "A very moving and informative museum with excellent staff able to answer questions. The walk through the trenches was excellent and is a must see for anybody who visits.",
          "Didn't actually go into the museum but walked around the gardens, they are currently working on a series of poppy gardens to remember the countries of the commonwealth that took part in a unique way.",
          "Great museum for reasonable entry fee and free parking. Beautiful grounds for walking with fishing lake.",
          "This museum was amazing. Very informative with a booklet for the children (available in English) for a couple of euros etc which explained things to them. It actually contained some information that I didn't read on the information boards, and had activities for them to",
          "Was very knowledgeable shame our supposed guide never turned up. So we ended up strolling around at our own leisure. Definitely worth a visit but would have been better with a guide.",
          "The museum has alot to offer in terms of exhibits and experiences that provide good insight into what it may have been like for the soldier in WWI. It is well thought out and the exhibits are arranged such that you progress through them easily. It needs about 2 - 3 hours to go",
          "If you only have time to visit one museum in the Ypres area I'd recommend it be this one. Apart from a huge amount of equipment and artefacts to see there's a large reconstruction of an underground bunker system and a long stretch of trench that demonstrates various construction",
          "I can only fully endorse the many very positive reviews of this excellent museum. It does what it says on the tin, offering a very informative insight into the realities of that terrible war. The exhibits are absolutely first class. The huge dug-out and trenches are done in the",
          "The history of all of the battles around Ypers, very detailed with many interesting items to see. The trip includes passage through underground dug outs and restored trenches. Afterwards walk around the gardens or maybe to some of the nearby cemeteries",
          "An ideal introduction to the First World War , starting with the Uniforms , wepons , life underground in the dugouts , the various shells and artillary used to finally ending over ground in the open trenches , top class.",
          "If you ever needed to appreciate the sacrifices that previous generations have made the this is a truly eye opening experience. A comprehensive walk through the life of soldiers in the first world war.. It was interactive and engaging for all the family from 4-40! So",
          "Going into the recreated underground where troops lived and the trenches gave one the feeling for what life was like during the battles. Also enjoyed the parts of the museum that highlighted the contributions of British Commonwealth soldiers.",
          "We visited here as part of an organised tour from Bruges. Amazing to see trenches German and English and the lay out of trenches and a video you can watch in the trenches. If you are not able bodied there are some steep steps down to the trenches. Materials and equipment and",
          "Having been to the In Flanders Field museum in Ypres, this was a little disappointing in that the displays are much more traditional, less interactive. Having said that. this is worth a visit, if only to experience the trenches and dug outs.",
          "I was expecting a moderately interesting museum with a lot of WW1 artefacts but what we got was a fantastic experience. As well as the artefacts there is also an opportunity to explore dugouts and trenches. A really interesting (and interactive) museum for both adults and",
          "With so many memorials and museums it is difficult to single one out and I have been to so few but after visiting this museum I felt I had a very good understanding of the history of the battles and especially from the personal accounts taken from veterans who have now passed",
          "Such an amazing place to visit. It's so informative and so well put together. I learned so many things by visiting it. Definitely a must see. Especially if you are interested in the WWI or history in general.",
          "We took two elderly ladies and when we asked for a lift to take them to the upper floors we ended up with a conducted tour. It was brilliant. Very informative and what a nice man. Made our day.",
          "I've studied and taught WWI for a number of years and this museum is in my opinion the best of the lot. It is fairly new (2012 or so) and therefore this was new to me, it has been a few years since I visited the area. The museum has an excellent collection, well displayed and",
          "One of the most impressive museums I've visited. Something to interest anyone whether you're a student of The Great War or not. Wide variety of presentations offer as much detail as you could want. Located in beautiful surroundings. Staff very friendly and helpful. The futility",
          "The best museum I've been to on the battlefields of Belgium and northern France. Brilliant displays in the main museum, with lots of video clips. A huge recreated dug-out system. Above all, includes replicas of German and British trenches. A brilliant way to bring the First",
          "The reconstructed dugouts and trenches are fantastic as is the whole museum. This is worth a trip. I've been here three times and still enjoy. I will be taking my son later in the year as he loves it here.",
          "This is housed in a lovely timber constructed building in a park. Has fantastic exhibits but the best thing is the reconstruction of a trench in the basement which gives a real feeling of what these trenches must have been like",
          "The museum contains lots of things to see, including weapons and shells from war and actual trenches. Overall the visit took about 90 minutes.",
          "This is a very good museum if your short of time don't go it will take an hour longer than you allow for the visit",
          "First encounter with this museum and really surprising well organized and laid out. It evokes in every manor what you would expect from a museum on this topic. Directed to all the common wealth people with interesting details and clear audio indications. Definitely a place to",

          "Having visited the museum we decided to have a snack in the cafe alongside quality food at a reasonable price very friendly service.",
          "We visited the Museum after paying our respects at the Tyne Cot War Grave some 3 km distant. Many times I have visited war graves on the WW1 Western Front asking the question why? Why thousands of our youngest lost their lives and how did they spend there last days and months? I",
          "I have visited many WW1-sites and museums. This one was new for me and definitely worth the visit. Good exhibit of ww1-artifacts, great replica of very large underground dugout, and replica trench outside (was okay, not as good as the ones at Vimy). My boys (10 and 12) found it",
          "Was a sunny day and we went for a WO I trip through Flanders. Tyne Cot was our first stop. The Memorial museum the second stop, 3.5km further. Going through the museum gives you a good view and overview on where and how the fights took place. It gives you a feeling/glance on how",
          "If you want to appreciate the Ypres battles and WW1 trench warfare in general (including the Somme) this is a must, together with Sanctuary Wood Museum. It takes a couple of hours to do it justice, but the young find it interesting as it has a underground bunker in the museum",
          "Sunshine for our first tour of the day to Zonnebeke Castle whose memorial keeps alive the Battle of Passchendaele aka the Third Battle of Ypres. In 1917 half a million casualties fell here in 100 days to gain just 8 kilometres of ground. The exhibition is beautifully",
          "This is one of those museums that helps you understand the complexity of the great war from the various nation that were drawn into the war. The exhibits are enlightening and the film in the cinema show the way it all progressed . The place is one that requires more than one",
          "So we went while staying in France and on the way to my a Great Grandads memorial site. Brings the who thing in to line when you see and think about what went on in the war I would say to anyone who has even a slight intrest go and see it and follow the steps of people before",
          "This is an excellent museum exploring many aspects of world war 1. It is thoughtful and has a couple of unusual attractions, no spoiler here. Well worth a two hour visit.",
          "This was my second visit to this outstanding museum set within stunning grounds. Because I like to take my time and immerse myself in the exhibits, I arrived when the doors opened and was the only visitor for the first hour - highly recommended if you are like me! Having visited",
          "This was my 4th time of visiting this museum and I would go back again. Situated in the town of Ypers just down from the Menim Gate this is a must see if your here. Not to expensive to go in and once in you are transported back in time. They cover all aspects of WW1 from the",
          "An essential \"must do\" if you are here to learn about what happened here 100 years ago. A very detailed museum providing information on the battles fought, and life in the trenches. Finishes off with a walk though trench reconstructions which gives you some feeling for what it",
          "The museum is set in beautiful grounds and is very interesting and informative. The recreation of the trenches and dugouts is a really good way to get a sense of life in the trenches during WW1, particularly for children. There are a good range of exhibits and information is",
          "Another superb museum in the WW1 Flanders battlefields. Hosed in the chateau grounds in Zonnebeke near Passchendaele (now Passendale) memorial and Tyne Cot Cemetery. Along with and impressive amount of historical effects well displayed,you are guided into the basement where you",
          "This is the actual battlefield museum with many recreations of the trenches (allies and German) and underground shelters and living facilities. The entire facility is very informative had is well staffed with knowledgeable personnel.",

          "The Memorial Museum Passchendaele is a real gem of a museum that should be visited be anyone visiting the Ypres Salient. It gives a very good overview of the Battle of Passchendaele along with a chance to get a flavour of the atmosphere of the dugouts and the trenches and a",
          "This was value for money, helpful staff, a real insight into to all that happened in the area during WW1",
          "We would say that this is the best area museum by far. The exhibits are well done. We had been here before and we're glad we came again as the addition of the outdoor trenches was very well done. There was a special exhibit as well with a detailed movie about the German trench",
          "The displays are well presented though the English explanations are in a small font and can make it challenging. The dugout experience is a little claustrophobic for those with that issue but if you can push through that there are some examples of trenches. The separate cafe",
          "Although the weather was very wet it seemed in keeping with the history of the area! The museum was quite extensive both inside and outside where they had restored a trench among other things.",
          "We were advised to go to this museum but were a bit disappointed. It had a lot of displays and artefacts but not much information. There was an opening audio display that went on for a long time, basically recalling the whole of the battles at Passchendaele. This became",
          "This is a must do, very moving and full of interesting artifacts and information. Found out a lot of things I didn't know.",
          "An excellent retelling of the battle, the trenches are party vivid. Highly recommended, allow plenty of time for your visit.",
          "We visited here on a Leger WW1 walking tour. It's not just a museum where you have to read information boards all of the time but if you do like your facts & figures you will not be disappointed but you'll go upstairs and then find stairs going down into 'the tunnels' then you",
          "Excellent museum,loads of artefacts and information in a lovely area,please take time to read the information boards.",
          "We went to visit this museum after lots of research and asking others. Thank you all colleagues reviewers on Tripadvisor. It does what it says on the tin! Moving exposition, with good structure and very valuable treasures, medals and variable possessions of soldiers, weapons,",
          "This museum is stunning, informative and emotional. The exhibits are displayed well and very thought provoking. This was the highlight of our visit. The dugouts and trenches give a small insight into the daily life of a soldier.",
          "This museum is one of the top two in the area. Good well spread displays with a brilliant dugout and trench set up for everyone to explore. Several touchy feely exhibits for children. Well worth a visit",
          "Probably the best museum we visited in Ypres. Very enjoyable and fascinating with the underground dugouts and trenches. A must see.",
          "This was my second visit to the Museum and this time I took a group of friends who had not been before. They all found the visit highly informative and interesting and allows a real insight into what these soldiers went through. I believe anyone visiting this area should pay a",
          "very interesting museum and certainly next year we will come back because of 2017 then!we are glad we visited this museum and you won't be disappointed",
          "You need a few hours to go through this museum - probably repeat visits would be the best if you can do it - there is a lot of content - I found the many of boards on the glass displays difficult to read due to the small print and the lighting arrangements - there is so much to",
          "Set in lovely surroundings of lakes and forests, this museum provides a glimpse into the horrors of the Great War that seem almost unimaginable in such a tranquil setting, which include a couple of nature trails (about 6-8 kms I believe) passing through other historic sites (we",

          "Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917 is the best WWI museum I visited on my recent France/Belgium trip. This museum is located in a hot spot battleground area (although where around Ypres isn't, to be honest?), and it is walkable to/from Polygon Wood and Tyne Cot. An",
          "Myself and my grandson visited this museum because he wanted to see what the trenches from WW1 actually looked like. Its located beside a lake, in a public park and right beside a small restaurant. There is free parking on site. When you enter the building it does not seem",
          "Had the pleasure of visiting this fantastic building and the exhibition on 22nd July with Cambuslang volunteers flute band ,the stuff on show is amazing .",
          "great museum with so many interesting displays and zones to explore. thought it wasn't going to be very good but I was mistaken. kept my interest and that of my son.",
          "A superb museum with the usual displays in glass cabinets augmented by the bunker complex that visitors can walk through to help them gain an understanding of the cramped conditions experienced by soldiers at the time. The reconstructed trench systems were also of great interest.",
          "Brilliantly curated, great range of exhibits and experiences for the whole family. Starts off feeling like any other museum but gets better and better. If you're not good with enclosed spaces avoid the dugout experience.",
          "Initially a little slow, and we didn't spend as much time looking at many of the exhibits which became a little repetitive. However overall the visit was a great educational experience and the latter part of the trip, learning about the trenches brings the horrors of the war",
          "We thought we will visit the museum in max 1hr, judging by the size of the building. Hours later we were still there. This place tells you a lot about World War I. Daily live of soldiers, smell of combat gases, statistics of the battles, details about weapons, tour through the",
          "At first glimpse this museum appears to be a simple wooden structure no more than a couple of thousand square feet. What lies beneath is breath taking a truly informative and experiential.",
          "The museum starts with an old fashioned display case section and then transforms to a mock up of the living conditions for soldiers, a new lighter and brighter building and finally the trenches. In the park outside there are walks and bike trails and, if you plan ahead, you",
          "This museum gives a very good picture of the battles in Flanders. Their collections are huge and cover all sides of the war in this area during the Great War. And You may get a hint of how it was to live in dugouts, when visiting the rooms under ground.",
          "Not only do you get to see the uniforms and kit of the soldiers from different nations who took part in the war but you see some personal accounts as well. You to experience the noise and even smells of the war! You can go down into the reconstructed dugouts which brings home",
          "This museum was quite informative and well laid out. The different stories, uniforms, and artifacts from teh battles are displayed thoughtfully. When we went, there was also a special exhibition of Canadian invovement in Passendaele and WWI, including a focus on John McCrae who",
          "This is simply an outstanding and informative museum. There is so much to see an read about covering all aspects of the war from all sides. So much effort has gone into this 'project' and I can't heap enough praise onto it.",
          "Really thorough, interactive and informative museum which seamlessly moves through so much of the impact of WW1 on the western front. Our ten year old loved the mock trench but we then came to the dug out, 20 feet underground. The narrow steps down are not suitable for the",
          "Extremely interesting and well organised. Something for everyone. You could spend a whole day here easily.",
          "Not far from Ypres this museum dedicated to WW1 was excellent, very modern in its design with multi media elements. Excellent, how you walk from exhibits to being suddenly in the trenches which are very well recreated, you walk around through outside trenches before returning",
          "Incredible museum so full of facts, stories and memorabilia. Well worth a visit if you are in the area touring the battlefields, We has a time constraint of two hours only but could have been there for a lot longer. Check it out!",
          "What an absolutely superb museum. Extremely well thought out and presented. Great empathy to the subject. You will not regret going here. If you get the choice try and avoid the endless chain of school trips tramping noisily through at great pace with little interest in",
          "Considering the compact building, there's a lot packed in to this museum. If you're at all interested in WW1 history, this is well worth a visit, although the Ypres Flanders Fields museum is in a different (higher) league. There's a cafe next door and the village is literally a",
          "I travelled here as a last minute trip on a self-guided tour of the Battlefields. I will be taking a school group in the near future so had my students in mind. The museum is fantastic, there are lots of little interactive pieces all the way around as well as the standard glass",
          "Very well designed museum full of details and items from all countries involved with the Great War. Multi lingual displays and audio visual is good for all ages. After the displays, the bunkers and trenches give you a feel of what it was like to live and fight here. Very well",
          "This is a most impressive and very full museum. An easy local bus ride from Ypres - bus 94 from town. Allow at least 2 hours. It compliments the In Flsnders museum in Ypres. So is not a duplicate experience. In combination these 2 museums effective cover local WW1 history 100",
          "The museum was excellent and one I'd recommend to all. The museum has a lot of variety and something for people of all ages. There were excellent audio-visual presentations, displays of weapons and aircraft, photographs, maps and interactive elements. The replica trenches and",
          "Wonderful place. Very informative and interactive. Super fun to walk through and read about the history of the war. The trenches and dugout were very well done and 100% alone worth the visit If you find yourself anywhere near here make the stop in.",
          "This is a must see museum for the Passchendaele battlefields tourist. The museum is well priced and has a great display of artifacts, including reconstructions of the French, German and British trench systems which are accessed via a reconstructed bunker system. The display was",
          "You may come here after having visited some of the all too many war cemeteries from the First World War 1914-1918 in Belgium. This time I chose to visit Diksmuide cemetery for German soldiers and Tyne Cot Cemetary for British and Commonwealth soldiers. Many more are buried",
          "Visited the museum today with family (children 9&5). Really impressed with the professionalism of the exhibition. Many varied things to see and experience. Very well put together and flowed really nicely to the conclusion point. Very worthwhile and a must see in the area.",
          "A Spectacular and moving experience in particular the recreated trenches Extensive displays and presentations in various languages Set in peaceful gardens Well. Worth a visit",
          "This is the 3rd time that I have been here last time 2 years ago, and boy has it grown new trenches and extra exhibitions which really makes you think. Please go to this if its the only museum you go to in Belgium I now feel its better than the Flanders Field Museum in Ieper.",
          "We ranked this as the most informative museum we visited in the area so if visiting do not miss it. It is surrounded by a park with a lake and is quite stunning to visit, there is so much to see that it would take me forever but the highlights for me were the trenches that",
          "If you are expecting a run of the mill museum, this is brilliant and one of the best museums I have visited, housed in a large house. Exhibits are well laid out and have lots of explanation. Large exhibits include field guns, ammunition, rifles and kids get the opportunity to",
          "We visited this museum as our last \"wartime\" experience in this area. Initially we weren't sure about another museum, and the initial displays in cabinets made us rather wary, but as we moved through the museum we became more and more impressed with both the exhibits and the",
          "Unassuming on arriving you expect the museum to be run of the mill, it is anything but. I don't want to say too much as it gives the game away but we'll worth the visit",
          "Having visited Passchendaele twice previously on school trips this was a moving visit as my great uncle died here and is on the Menin Gate. The museum did not exist in its current form until recently but is definitely worth a visit for people of all ages. The layout makes it an",
          "Well worth a visit. Brings the horrors of WW1 into sharp focus. When we were there there was a re-enactment that really brought it alive. It is difficult to say that it was enjoyable since the subject matter is so grim but it is very interesting and there is lots of information.",
          "This was a good museum- lots of interesting exhibits depicting life in the trenches. Museum is housed on the site of a chateau which was destroyed in the fighting There are trenches to explore outside. Restaurant is expansive - no snacks available. Combine it with a visit to",
          "Very well and cleverly set out, you move through 5 (?) different sections each clearly illustrating a particular aspect of the conflict. I was especially moved by, and edgy in, the underground bunker where there is background noise presumably designed to mimic something of the",
          "The museum details the horrific events of the time. It helps us understand the magnitude and destruction that war brings. It is well done.",
          "The first part of the museum is of a fairly traditional style, with a good range of artefacts and ephemera that, of necessity, are in display cases. There could, in some instances, be more explanation, but circulation space is limited and the more people have to read, the more",
          "This place is well worth a visit, the museum has many excellent exhibits and I was able to meander around for nearly 2 hours, the 8.00 euros is a bargain in my eyes. How they managed to fit all that in is a bit of a mystery. Fancy a bite to eat, no problem right next door is a",
          "I spent three hours here....and it felt like an hour. There are excellent reconstructions of trenches and superb exhibitions. There are also things to touch and try on at different stages. There's enough information...not too much. A lot of artefacts and photos to see. The",
          "We stumbled across this museum after visiting the Tyne Cot war cemetery just down the road. We were looking for something to do as we had pretty much seen all we wanted to in Bruges, and wanted to explore further. We picked up a leaflet for the museum at the cemetery, and",
          "This is an excellent museum although oddly housed in what looks like a large American or Canadian Mansion. The museum has also reproduced facsimiles of the tech systems yused during WW1 which also help to provide visitors with a much better idea of the conditions that combatants",
          "When we first arrived, this was not what we expected, thought it was small and would take very little time out of our day to tour. We were wrong. 8Euro pp admission and 4 complete floors of history plus more outdoors. Found it to be very sombering and quite interesting. Take",
          "This would be great for kids - and several were there during our visit. There are lots of interactive areas to let kids engage, which you don't often see at battlefield museums. There are trenches (inside and out), weaponry, uniforms and gear, and an American House...",
          "Really enjoyed this museum tour. Visited with the kids (7 & 9) and they were really impressed. A must do if you want your kids to learn about WWI.",
          "Follow the course of the was with informative, relevant but not over cluttered displays. There are several videos of veterans describing actions. All nationalities are represented. You then move down to the cellar which has been made into an excellent tunnel experience. This",
          "The WOI Paschendaele Museum is located in the old castle of Zonnebeke and offers and amazing insight in to the daily life during the great war. Amazing collection of clothes, weapons, work and communication tools that brings the war to live. Must have been terrible to fight",
          "Situated in the centre of Zonnebeke, in the grounds of the old Chateau, the museum is housed in the totally reconstructed Chateau itself, rebuilt in the '20's (as was the rest of the town). On three levels, the museum is a walk through experience of life in the Ypres Salient",
          "This is by far the best museum in the Ieper area. If you have time for one, then this should be it, better than the In Flanders Field (after the renovations). Truly moving to experience the reconstructed dugouts and trenches as well as the exhibits and videos. Nothing the young",
          "Visited the Flanders in the field museum and Menin gate. Then drove to here. Glad we did what a brilliant afternoon. I loved the lay out and the lighting of the displays. The information and the interactive displays. The bunker and the trenches brought home how this was all such",
          "i went to visit the museum earlier this week it makes you think alot about how lucky we are in the time .its a very informative place you can get out of it as much as you want to, ie, there is lots to read before you look at the exhibits to give you more insight or just look and",
          "We spent a morning visiting this museum - it was a truly memorable visit. I was particularly struck by dug outs and trenches which have been created to give an idea of what that experience would have been like. Incredibly poignant and very informative museum.",
          "This is a fairly recent museum inside Zonnebeke Chateau, only about 8km from the centre of Ypres. Follow the signs & there is ample free parking (up to 3 hours) onsite, & the entrance is on the far side of the Chateau to the car park. The interior has been fully converted to a",
          "Overall great place to visit, the recreated trenches, both German and Allied. It was also great to go into the recreated dugouts to see what it would have been like, albeit without the guns, cold, lack of food, rats and people dying. Also interesting interactive \"smells\" of",
          "Loads of information for the visitor to take in. Presented in a factual non judgemental manner. Great education for the children and adults alike. Excellent recreation of conditions for the visitor to gain an insight to the life of the soldiers",
          "Well worth the visit especially combined with the Tyne Cot Memorial and Cemetery. The museum hosts many relics from the Great War plus an incite into trench warfare.",
          "I have never been to a museum as interactive and informative as this. The way this is planned out and tells the history of WW1 is amazing. The experience of the trenches is very good but not suitable for those with mobility problems.",
          "Visited as part of battlefields pilgrimage. Top museum with friendly staff. Returning this year to see the new trench exhibits.",
          "If there is one museum that you are planning to visit while you are in Flanders then it should be this one. Having been to several others, this seemed to tick every box - it was informative, interesting, set in a lovely spot with a big caf\u00e9 and other refreshments available too.",
          "This museum is really great, very organized, well preserved, clean... We visited with friends, we expected to stay max one hour there... We stayed at least 3 hours inside... We learned a lot there! Definitely worthed!",
          "well presented museum with great displays for both adults and children. Dugouts and trenches make for great interactive displays keeping our young children interested and involved.",
          "Three generations (from 10 years to 60 something) all enjoyed this. Plenty of interactive things to do. The dug out and trenches were fantastic. Genius building layout. Really good value for money. We also had light lunch at the restaurant on site - the homemade soup was",
          "You could spend hours in this museum. It has very well laid out & informative exhibits explaining the battles fought around Ypres / Ieper in 1914/1915 and Paschendale in 1917 ( note: some of the explanations in english are badly illuminated). Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This museum was a stop on our guided ww1 tour and we are so happy to have seen it. There is so much to learn about the history of the Great War and this museum collection is well presented and honors the fallen in a brilliantly respectful way. And! When I lost my cell phone in",
          "I'm not normally a big fan of museums, most bore me, but this is the best I have been to in quite some time. Engaging for both adults and children alike (my 10 & 7 year olds both found it interesting) and a good start to a day in the Ypres Salient to give some context. The",
          "Been here about four times over 10 years and the museum has got better and better. There is a very good account of WW1. A large display on show over a number of levels. The recreated trenches are excellent.",
          "Very interesting displays with high dedication to detail and historical information. Very meticulous displays of weaponry, ALL participants in the nearby battles and the units that they were comprised of. Trench reconstructions are well-done. Over all, an excellent museum and",
          "Excellent displays. The replica underground living quarters and outdoor trenches bring conditions to life for children. Reasonably priced as well.",

          "I can't add much to the excellent review below by Harold03 of Farnborough! I agree with every word he says. I only wish that the new WW1 gallery in the Imperial War Museum in London was as well laid-out. Huge congratulations to all involved in creating this stunning new",
          "The museum is fantastic well set out with some great items. The rebuilt trenches give real perspective as to what the soldiers lived in. One of the things that had me thinking is just how incredible it was that the troops on both sides built the trenches with limited resources",
          "Overall, a good presentation about the battles around Passchendale, and very sobering to understand how nearly 1/2 million lives were lost over a few kilometres. It felt a little sanitised, but did give the education that I wanted.",
          "Tells the story of the battles, with a good 10 minute film and 3D map presentation. Some good displays, and trench reconstructions showing how the opposing sides built trenches, and how they were meant to be (and why).",
          "Visited here a few years ago with family and revisited this month. In that time it has been enlarged and improved. Definitely a first stop for anyone around Ieper researching or just interested in the history surrounding WW1. Cannot recommend it enough. There is a reproduction",
          "This museum has only been open for two years. It's a great place to start any battlefield tour for the context it gives to WW1 and the fighting around the Ypres area. The recreations of underground bunkers and trench systems were very realistic and gave some sense of what it",
          "after visiting this museam, you will know almost every detail of the war of 1914-1918 in West-Flanders. You will be able to experience the life circumstances of the soldiers, and go through the trenches. It is a huge museum so count a whole day. The park in which this museum is",
          "Quite easy to miss as it is up a minor street and not well signed except as 'car park'. The location is very pleasant in a park with a large lake and a small restaurant. The museum itself is in a large manor house and has several different areas to visit. The first is upstairs",
          "This was an excellent museum and well worth visiting. Their display of the tunnel world of trench warfare was very well done, as were the trenches set up in the open. There was also a rat to make the experience more authentic. This is an excellent companion to the In Flanders",
          "One of the top museums. it provides an emotive and balanced view of the battle of Passchendale. The trenches and memorial park are great. The large poppy sculptures and gardens will be grwat once fully planted.",
          "Very interesting interactive exhibition. Well worth attending. But well worth the effort and cost, going through the actual trenches, made it feel real.",
          "A well documented, well displayed top collection of WW1 Western Front military equipment and weaponry. Fact and figures on the Ypres Salient main battles, main focus on the Third Battle of Ypres ( Battle of Passchendaele ). Splendid reproduction of a British dugout system and",
          "We visited this set in its own landscaped gardens plus over looking a lake the museum itself is very informative and well set out the staff are very friendly and helpful being disabled I needed access the lift to the 1st floor the staff looked after me superbly can't praise them",
          "We had visited the In Flanders Fileds museum and the Hooge Crater museum previously. Both were very good but this one topped them both. Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917 is situated in a rebuilt chateau in Zonnebeke. It is well laid out with lots of exhibits and lots of",
          "Some museums can be hard going but not this one. It's very informative and well set out. You just follow it through to see everything. Bunkers and trenches expertly re-created in the grounds and included in the entry fee. Unsurprisingly though the cafe was shut.",
          "A really interesting, well presented museum with very many well presented exhibits, including underground shelter complex and the short film on the 3rd Ypres Battle, which is on a continuous loop. Most informative & poignant; very good value & definitely worth visiting.",
          "A great museum covering the horrible history ina both informative and touching way, for both children and adults.",
          "With only a day to tour the Ypres Salient and an impatient teenager in tow, we opted to tour this museum instead of the larger WWI museum in Ypres. It's idyllically located in a beautiful park, inside a chalet type country house that survived WWI. You will see the setting in a",
          "My family and I visited this Museum on our vacation in Belgium. I think this is one of the better war museums I have been to - it is informative and well planned out. I read books on the battles of Ypres before my visit and still there was information at this museum that I did",
          "If you only have time to go to one museum on WW1 make it this one. Good timeline of events, informative and immersive. The dugouts and trenches enabled you to begin to imagine the lives of the soldiers. Would highly recommend.",
          "This is a must, it takes 3 hours to go round everything, but is so well done and a credit to the War Graves Commission.",
          "An excellent visit with a myriad of ways to discover a very emotional subject. A young teenager was kept interested in the weaponry and equipment displays whilst us parents could immerse ourselves in the historical developments. The trench reconstructions are excellent and took",
          "I recommend this museum to anyone interested in WW1, especially the terrible slaughter of Passchendale. It does not duplicate the In Flanders Fields Museum in Ypres significantly, in fact they are quite complementary. Walking around the bunker and reconstructed trenches outside,",
          "This is such an excellent museum giving a very informative impression of the first world war, I can't recommend this highly enough, giving you facts and displays that portray the history of this brutal period of history in a way that feels fresh and interestingand is done in a",
          "Was doubtful at the beginning of visit but WOW, what an amazing way to present all the experiences and information to do with WW1. Would highly recommend this experience.",
          "I actually visited this Museum over 2 years ago (but that option wasn't there) and although it hadn't yet been finished, it was still by far the best War Museum I have visited. I loved the fact it was eerie, and there was so much to look at but not all of our party wanted to",
          "Housed in an attractive brownstone masnor, this museum is a treasure trove of exhibits. In addition, the progressive background presentation of each successive battle is commendable. The tour ends with a walk through a recreated trench. Although this great for try he casual",
          "We were a family group of 38 and, as tour leader, I had included this as a lunch break spot as rumour had it that it was earned praise from other guides. Personally I found it quite the most comprehensive museum of WW1 that I had experienced anywhere including Meaux and even",
          "The Museum has been recently been revamped and updated. The interactive displays which include being able to try on pieces of clothing, smell the gases used are fantastic. I just felt it was missing something , I didn't have the same feelings walking thru here as I had at",
          "We were driving and saw the museum sign. We said what do we have to loss. Wow. This was such a great museum. They had exhibits with three languages. Then they had bunkers where you could see how the soldiers lived and worked underground. These lead out to trenches outside. So",
          "One of the best museum experiences I have been to. Don't miss it if you are in the area. The Trench experience is unforgettable and the rest of the Museum brilliant",
          "Well worth a visit to learn about one of the worst battles that ever took place in WW1. A tragic event of 100 days of complete suffering, horrendous conditions and an unbelievable waste of life and heartache. It isn't until you actually go and read about all this that you can",
          "After a disappointing visit to the super modern Flanders Fields Museum in a Ypres we came here - chalk and cheese, but in a good way. The traditional layout with glass cases and written summaries on the walls (including in English) at first feels a bit old fashioned. But as we",
          "Having read that the Memorial Museum Passchendale had trench displays, we decided this was one not to miss. And we were not disappointed. Every museum dedicated to World War I has all the static displays, to be sure \u2026 uniforms, weapons, equipment, maps showing the ebb and flow",
          "We stopped here for a few hours to visit the museum and get a better understanding of the equipment material, men and conditions of this great WW1 battle. My grandfather fought here. The only story I ever remember him telling was of his column being bombed by a German biplane",
          "This is an ideal place to bring your teenage son or daughter. A good balance of excellent displays, information, artefacts, and opportunities to get a tactile sense of what life was like in the trenches. Two hours was not really enough ... A deep impression was made on the whole",
          "This is the best of the \"small\" museums in the area. It is better organized and with more information than the Hooge Crater Museum. So if you have limited time, this is definitely the one to choose as second priority - First priority should of course be \"in Flanders Fields\" in",
          "We spent three days driving around France and Belgium, visiting places of interest and finding family graves, but of the museums we visited, this was by far my favourite. The displays were extremely informative, as well as interactive parts, such as bits of uniform you could try",
          "Really well set out museum., with distinct sections for the Aussies, New Zealanders, Canadians etc Even had the bunkers & trenches. Well worth a visit.",
          "A very good and interesting exhibition, providing both a fitting tribute and a comprehensive exhibition of Passchendaele and the events leading up to it. The recreated dugout complex and trench systems really bring to life the more traditional exhibits. Highly recommended.",
          "This was an excellent museum, particularly made special by the inclusion of the recreated dug outs and trenches which enable you to experience first hand what it was like for troops. Due to the location of the museum, when there are tour groups visiting, it can make movement",
          "This is a wonderful museum about The battles in the area. Since Americans were not among the clashing armies here, this story is very distant. This museum will change that feeling for you. It is particularly jarring when you notice that you passed by the featured locations on",
          "see the trenches, walk the site, well worth the walk around. good for young and old, the trenches are clean but give the feeling of being there",
          "Renewed in 2013 , very interesting look on what happened in Passendaele during and after the war. Makes one silent.",
          "The museum is built on the site of the battle that raged in and around the museums location. Great thought has been put in to collect and collate the excibits for this museum . You get a good insight to what it was really like to be fighting in the trenches of the first world",
          "This museum has really found out the true history of the battle that raged around the location of this museum. It really gives you a feel of what it was like to be a soldier of the great war. Was a very moving experience and the best museum i have been in for a very long time.",
          "This was a surprise. I had already visited similar museums in and around the area, doing the 'Canadian tour' so to speak. This is the best museum to go and see. The bunkers in the basement of the museum and the outside bunkers and displays are absolutely the best. For a war to",
          "This museum is a good way to start a WWI battlefields tour. It gives an excellent overview of the different elements of the war - soldiers, trenches, bunkers, artillery, communications, etc, etc. The displays are clear and very well maintained. I don't think it allows you to",
          "Thoroughly enjoyable visit to this great museum. This is a gem \u2013 hugely informative, well-structured visit and mock-up of the trenches is thought provoking. The way in which the history of the battles of Passchendaele, the respective forces involved including the latter Allies",
          "A not particularly well advertised museum but excellent. It appealed to the group's need for chronological explanation and included make ups of a bunker and trenches. Excellent, clear film about half way around that explained the battle of Passchendale. \u20ac7,50 ish for adults.",
          "The museum is set in some very quiet and respectful grounds, although it looks like a small museum from the main entrance it has a lot of hidden secrets. Going upstairs and working down you are taken through how Passchendaele was a key area in the Great War. It is only when",
          "This is an extremely well organised Museum, with all exhibits presented in an interesting way, and well described. The short film describing the battle conditions and progress of the war action locally in 1917 was in English, and informative. The reconstructed dugouts and",
          "Just a note that we left it too late to get in. It closes at 6pm but the lasts entry is 4.30pm. There are walks around the surrounding woods up to 6 miles with artefacts to see. Suggest visit as a half day and not an add on.",
          "Upon arrival here we thought it would be a very small exhibition, but how wrong we were! The 7.50 Euro entrance price is excellent value and what appears at first just to be a wooden Chateau with a few rooms really opens out into a below and above ground modern and well",
          "An impressive and informative display of the men, materials and incredible struggle and senseless loss of life at this historic site. One of the best military museums I've seen.",
          "This museum, even more than the Flanders Field Museum in Ieper, allows you to experience and understand what happened during the 1st World War. Not only the environment is astonishing and beautiful, the museum itself has won the Museum Price and well deserved. While in the",
          "We called here as part of the Ypres Salient self drive. The museum has been refurbished and extended. it now has replicas of both German and British trench in the grounds, a presentation of a dugout as well as numerous exhibits and artefacts. As an introduction and overview it",
          "Took the family there are visiting a number of cemeteries, really put the whole war and impact on the area into persepective",
          "This is a fantastic experience not only is this a museum it is a hands on insight into the conditions that the soldiers of World War 1 had to face not only in the battle of Passchendale but in the whole of northern France and Belgium! The trench and dugout experience help you",
          "A very worthwhile museum in a beautiful setting. Be sure to not miss the tunnel and trench re-creation to really get a feel for how these heroes lived.",
          "Visited with a disabled family member, and the staff bent over backwards to assist the person confined to a wheelchair - with one assistant at hand to negotiate the various routes through the museum. All the indoor displays are well presented. There is an underground dug-out",
          "This museum gives you a very good idea of what happened in Passchendaele (Belgium) during the Great War, more specially during the 3rd Battle of Ypres in 1917... Next to general information, you will find specific information on the British Commonwealth forces and its different",
          "Very informative and worth while visit - the museum leads you around so you don't miss a thing. The trench experience is good and gives you an insight view into life in the trenches If you to stay near by, try De Akkerwinde- fabulous B & B and is close to Polygon and Wood and",
          "This museum gives a great insight into the lives of the soldiers who fought on the Western Front. The highlight is a recreation of tunnels and trenches that really bring to life the conditions that the troops endured. One of the best WW1 museums we have visited.",
          "Really good museum with some interesting displays. This is also a great place to stop and have lunch next to the river outside. Make sure you go through the underground trench network where it shows how the British soldiers slept. Don't miss this on a trip to the Battlefields!",
          "This only came to my notice on our visit this July, because it is relatively new. It is excellently done, starting in a reconstructed chateau and moving underground and round and through dugouts, bunkers, and trenches, all set out in beautiful grounds. Very worth a visit.",
          "What a great museum. You start off inside a big house. And work your way round. With many uniforms and guns , then the next thing you are in the wooden shelters that the soldiers use to live in, in the trenches. Then you carry on out into the open trenches out side. It flows",
          "Living in Flanders I have the luxury of being able to take my time visiting the various WW1 sites. For some reason this one fell off my radar until now. If you only have time to visit one place this is it. A very tasteful and well laid out museum with a little of everything",
          "Not as well known as the nearby In Flanders Fields museum in The Cloth Hall in Ypres, in my opinion, this one is now the better of the two. Numerous well maintained tableaux really bring the history of the variuos battles around the Ypres Salient, and the outseide trench system",
          "Stumbled on this museum while driving through Zonnebeke. Great museum. Must see. Dugouts to wander through and reconstructed trenches. Great little film. Really wonderful use of space.",
          "This is amazing. The grounds are beautiful and peaceful. The museum is well done. touching, funny, interesting. it really gives a good understanding. must see",
          "Easily missed but well worth a visit - collection chronicles the events in Ypres during WW1, lots of recreations and exhibits including 'smell' exhibits, restored trenches and tunnels with realistic feel. Very moving reflections section towards the end. Lots of social history",
          "Great experience for people of all ages and all corners of the world! Engaging is the world. Well done! The trenches give you the feeling the war is ongoing!",

      "name": "Canadian National Vimy Memorial",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Canadian National Vimy Memorial is a war memorial site in France dedicated to the memory of Canadian Expeditionary Force members killed during the First World War. It also serves as the place of commemoration for Canadian soldiers of the First World War killed or presumed dead in France who have no known grave. The monument is the centrepiece of a 100-hectare (250-acre) preserved battlefield park that encompasses a portion of the ground over which the Canadian Corps made their assault during the initial Battle of Vimy Ridge offensive of the Battle of Arras.\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was the first time all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle as a cohesive formation, and it became a Canadian national symbol of achievement and sacrifice. France ceded to Canada perpetual use of a portion of land on Vimy Ridge on the understanding that Canada use the land to establish a battlefield park and memorial. Wartime tunnels, trenches, craters, and unexploded munitions still honeycomb the grounds of the site, which remains largely closed off for reasons of public safety. Along with preserved trench lines, several other memorials and cemeteries are contained within the park.\nThe project took designer Walter Seymour Allward eleven years to build. King Edward VIII unveiled it on 26 July 1936 in the presence of French President Albert Lebrun and a crowd of over 50,000 people, including 6,200 attendees from Canada. Following an extensive multi-year restoration, Queen Elizabeth II re-dedicated the monument on 9 April 2007 at a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. The site is maintained by Veterans Affairs Canada. The Vimy Memorial is one of only two National Historic Sites of Canada located outside the country, the other being the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nVimy Ridge is a gradually rising escarpment on the western edge of the Douai Plains, eight kilometres (5.0 mi) northeast of Arras. The ridge gradually rises on its western side, dropping more quickly on the eastern side. The ridge is approximately seven kilometres (4.3 mi) in length, 700 metres (2,300 ft) wide at its narrowest point, and culminates at an elevation of 145 metres (476 ft) above sea level, or 60 metres (200 ft) above the Douai Plains, providing a natural unobstructed view for tens of kilometres in all directions.\n\n\n=== Early conflicts on site ===\n\nThe ridge fell under German control in October 1914, during the Race to the Sea, as the Franco-British and German forces continually attempted to outflank each other through northeastern France. The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. During the attack, the French 1st Moroccan Division briefly captured the height of the ridge, where the Vimy memorial is currently located, but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915, but were once again unsuccessful in capturing the top of the ridge. The French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.The British XVII Corps relieved the French Tenth Army from the sector in February 1916. On 21 May 1916, the German infantry attacked the British lines along a 1,800-metre (2,000 yd) front in an effort to force them from positions along the base of the ridge. The Germans captured several British-controlled tunnels and mine craters before halting their advance and entrenching their positions. Temporary Lieutenant Richard Basil Brandram Jones was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his ultimately unsuccessful defence of the Broadmarsh Crater during the attack. British counter-attacks on 22 May did not manage to change the situation. The Canadian Corps relieved the British IV Corps stationed along the western slopes of Vimy Ridge in October 1916.\n\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\n\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was the first instance in which all four Canadian divisions participated in a battle together, as a cohesive formation. The nature and size of the planned Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities. Consequently, the British 5th Infantry Division and supplementary artillery, engineer and labour units reinforced the four Canadian divisions already in place. The 24th British Division of I Corps supported the Canadian Corps along its northern flank while the XVII Corps did so to the south. The ad hoc Gruppe Vimy formation, based under I Bavarian Reserve Corps commander General der Infanterie Karl Ritter von Fasbender, was the principal defending formation with three divisions responsible for manning the frontline defences opposite the Canadian Corps.\n\nThe attack began at 5:30 am on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917. Light field guns laid down a barrage that advanced in predetermined increments, often 91 metres (100 yd) every three minutes, while medium and heavy howitzers established a series of standing barrages against known defensive systems further ahead. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Canadian Divisions quickly captured their first objectives. The 4th Canadian Division encountered a great deal of trouble during its advance and was unable to complete its first objective until some hours later. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Canadian Divisions captured their second objective by approximately 7:30 am. The failure of the 4th Canadian Division to capture the top of the ridge delayed further advances and forced the 3rd Canadian Division to expend resources establishing a defensive line to its north. Reserve units from the 4th Canadian Division renewed the attack on the German positions on the top of the ridge and eventually forced the German troops holding the southwestern portion of Hill 145 to withdraw.On the morning of 10 April, Canadian Corps commander Lieutenant-General Julian Byng moved up three fresh brigades to support the continued advance. The fresh units leapfrogged units already in place and captured the third objective line, including Hill 135 and the town of Th\u00e9lus, by 11:00 am. By 2:00 pm both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reported capturing their final objectives. By this point the \"Pimple\", a heavily defended knoll west of the town of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, was the only German position remaining on Vimy Ridge. On 12 April, the 10th Canadian Brigade attacked and quickly overcame the hastily entrenched German troops, with the support of artillery and the 24th British Division. By nightfall on 12 April, the Canadian Corps was in firm control of the ridge. The Canadian Corps suffered 10,602 casualties: 3,598 killed and 7,004 wounded. The German Sixth Army suffered an unknown number of casualties, and around 4,000 men became prisoners of war.Although the battle is not generally considered Canada's greatest military achievement, the image of national unity and achievement imbued the battle with considerable national significance for Canada. According to Pierce, \"the historical reality of the battle has been reworked and reinterpreted in a conscious attempt to give purpose and meaning to an event that came to symbolize Canada's coming of age as a nation.\" The idea that Canada's identity and nationhood were born out of the battle is an opinion that is widely held in military and general histories of Canada.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Selection ===\n\nIn 1920, the Government of Canada announced that the Imperial War Graves Commission had awarded Canada eight sites\u2014five in France and three in Belgium\u2014on which to erect memorials. Each site represented a significant Canadian engagement, and the Canadian government initially decided that each battlefield be treated equally and commemorated with identical monuments. In September 1920, the Canadian government formed the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission to discuss the process and conditions for holding a memorial competition for the sites in Europe. The commission held its first meeting on 26 November 1920 and during this meeting decided that the architectural design competition would be open to all Canadian architects, designers, sculptors, and artists. The jury consisted of Charles Herbert Reilly representing the Royal Institute of British Architects, Paul Philippe Cret representing the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 centrale des architectes fran\u00e7ais and Frank Darling representing the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. Each jury member was a leader in the architectural field; Reilly was training students in design and development of war memorials, and Cret had been selected by the United States to design national monuments in Europe. Interested parties submitted 160 design drawings, and the jury selected 17 submissions for consideration, commissioning each finalist to produce a plaster maquette of their respective design. The jury recommended in a 10 September 1921 report to the commission that two of the designs be executed. In October 1921, the commission formally selected the submission of Toronto sculptor and designer Walter Seymour Allward as the winner of the competition; the design submitted by Frederick Chapman Clemesha was selected as runner-up. The complexity of Allward's design precluded the possibility of duplicating the design at each site. The approach of selecting one primary memorial ran counter to the recommendation of Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission architectural advisor Percy Erskine Nobbs, who had consistently expressed his preference for a series of smaller monuments. The consensus went in Allward's favour, his design receiving both public and critical approval. The commission revised its initial plans and decided to build two distinctive memorials\u2014those of Allward and Clemesha\u2014and six smaller identical memorials.\n\nAt the outset, members of the commission debated where to build Allward's winning design. The jury's assessment was that Allward's submission was best suited to a \"low hill rather than to a continuous and lofty bluff or cliff like Vimy Ridge\". The commission committee initially recommended placing the monument in Belgium on Hill 62, near the location of the Battle of Mont Sorrel, as the site provided an imposing view. This ran counter to the desires of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King who, while speaking in the House of Commons of Canada in May 1922, argued in favour of placing the memorial at Vimy Ridge. King's position received the unanimous support of the House and, in the end, the commission selected Vimy Ridge as the preferred site. The government announced its desire to acquire a more considerable tract of land along the ridge after the commission selected Vimy Ridge as the preferred location for Allward's design. In the interval between the 1st and 2nd session of the 14th Canadian Parliament, Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada Rodolphe Lemieux went to France to negotiate the acquisition of more land. On 5 December 1922, Lemieux concluded an agreement with France in which France granted Canada \"freely and for all time\" the use of 100 hectares (250 acres) of land on Vimy Ridge, inclusive of Hill 145, in recognition of Canada's war effort. The only condition placed on the donation was that Canada use the land to erect a monument commemorating Canadian soldiers killed during the First World War and assume the responsibility for the maintenance of the memorial and the surrounding battlefield park.\n\n\n=== Memorial construction ===\n\nFollowing the competition, Allward spent the remainder of 1921 and the spring of 1922 preparing for his move to Europe. After selling his home and studio, Allward finally departed for Belgium on 6 June 1922 and spent several months seeking a suitable studio in Belgium and then Paris, though he eventually set up a studio in London.Allward had initially hoped to use white marble for the memorial's facing stone, but Percy Nobbs suggested this would be a mistake because marble was unlikely to weather well in northern France and the memorial would have a \"ghost like\" appearance. Allward undertook a tour of almost two years to find stone of the right colour, texture, and luminosity. He found it in the ruins of Diocletian's Palace at Split, Croatia; he observed that the palace had not weathered over the years, which Allward took as evidence of the stone's durability. His choice\u2014Seget limestone\u2014came from an ancient Roman quarry located near Seget, Croatia. The difficulties with the quarrying process, coupled with complicated transportation logistics, delayed delivery of the limestone and thus construction of the memorial. The first shipment did not arrive at the site until 1927, and the larger blocks, intended for the human figures, did not begin to arrive until 1931.On Allward's urging the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission hired Oscar Faber, a Danish structural engineer, in 1924 to prepare foundation plans and provide general supervision of the foundation work. Faber had recently designed the substructure for the Menin Gate at Ypres, and he selected a design that employed cast-in-place reinforced concrete to which the facing stone would be bonded. Major Unwin Simson served as the principal Canadian engineer during the construction of the memorial and oversaw much of the daily operations at the site. Allward moved to Paris in 1925 to supervise construction and the carving of the sculptures. Construction commenced in 1925 and took eleven years to complete. The Imperial War Graves Commission concurrently employed French and British veterans to carry out the necessary roadwork and site landscaping.While awaiting the first delivery of stone, Simson noticed that the battlefield landscape features were beginning to deteriorate. Seeing an opportunity to not only preserve a portion of the battlefield but also keep his staff occupied, Simson decided to preserve a short section of trench line and make the Grange Subway more accessible. Labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall, on both the Canadian and German sides of the Grange crater group, in concrete. The workforce also built a new concrete entrance for the Grange Subway and, after excavating a portion of the tunnel system, installed electric lighting.\n\nAllward chose a relatively new construction method for the monument: limestone bonded to a cast concrete frame. A foundation bed of 11,000 tonnes of concrete, reinforced with hundreds of tonnes of steel, served as the support bed for the memorial. The memorial base and twin pylons contained almost 6,000 tonnes of Seget limestone. Sculptors carved the 20 approximately double life-sized human figures on site from large blocks of stone. The carvers used half-size plaster models produced by Allward in his studio, now on display at the Canadian War Museum, and an instrument called a pantograph to reproduce the figures at the proper scale. The carvers conducted their work year-round inside temporary studios built around each figure. The inclusion of the names of those killed in France with no known grave was not part of the original design, and Allward was unhappy when the government asked him to include them. Allward argued that the inclusion of names was not part of the original commissioning. Through a letter to Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission in October 1927, Allward indicated his intention to relegate the names of the missing to pavement stones around the monument. The collective dismay and uproar of the commission forced Allward to relent and incorporate the names of the missing on the memorial walls. The task of inscribing the names did not begin until the early 1930s and employed a typeface that Allward designed for the monument.\n\n\n=== Pilgrimage and unveiling ===\n\nIn 1919, the year after the war ended, around 60,000 British tourists and mourners made pilgrimages to the Western Front. The transatlantic voyage was longer and more expensive from Canada; many attempts to organize large pilgrimages failed, and journeys overseas were largely made individually or in small, unofficial groups. The delegates of the 1928 national convention of the Canadian Legion passed a unanimous resolution asking that a pilgrimage be organized to the Western Front battlefields. A plan began to take form wherein the Legion aimed to coordinate the pilgrimage with the unveiling of the Vimy memorial, which at the time was expected to be completed in 1931 or 1932. Due to construction delays with the memorial, it was not until July 1934 that the Canadian Legion announced a pilgrimage to former battlefield sites in conjunction with the unveiling of the memorial. Although the exact date of the memorial unveiling was still not set, the Legion invited former service members to make tentative reservations with their headquarters in Ottawa. The response from veterans and their families was enthusiastic\u20141,200 inquiries by November 1934. The Legion presumptuously announced that the memorial would be unveiled on Dominion Day, 1 July 1936, even though the government still did not know when it would be completed.For event planning purposes, the Legion and the government established areas for which each was responsible. The government was responsible for selection of the official delegation and the program for the official unveiling of the memorial. The Legion was responsible for the more challenging task of organizing the pilgrimage. For the Legion this included planning meals, accommodations and transportation for what was at the time the largest single peacetime movement of people from Canada to Europe. The Legion took the position that the pilgrimage would be funded by its members without subsidies or financial aid from Canadian taxpayers, and by early 1935 they had established that the price of the 3\u00bd-week trip, inclusive of all meals, accommodation, health insurance, and sea and land transportation would be CA$160 per person ($2,923.84 as of 2016). Indirect assistance came in a number of forms. The government waived passport fees and made a special Vimy passport available to pilgrims at no extra cost. The government and private sector also provided paid leave for their participating employees. It was not until April 1936 that the government was prepared to publicly commit to an unveiling date, 26 July 1936. On 16 July, the five transatlantic liners, escorted by HMCS Champlain and HMCS Saguenay, departed the Port of Montreal with approximately 6,200 passengers and arrived in Le Havre on 24 and 25 July. The limited accommodation made it necessary for the Legion to lodge pilgrims in nine cities throughout northern France and Belgium and employ 235 buses to move the pilgrims between various locations.\nIt is an inspired expression in stone, chiselled by a skilful Canadian hand, of Canada's salute to her fallen sons.\n\nOn 26 July, the day of the ceremony, pilgrims spent the morning and early afternoon exploring the landscape of the memorial park before congregating at the monument. For the ceremony, sailors from HMCS Saguenay provided the guard of honour. Also present were The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Band, French army engineers, and French-Moroccan cavalry who had fought on the site during the Second Battle of Artois. The ceremony itself was broadcast live by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission over shortwave radio, with facilities of the British Broadcasting Corporation transmitting the ceremony to Canada. Senior Canadian, British, and European officials, including French President Albert Lebrun, and a crowd of over 50,000 attended the event. Absent, though, was Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, it being well understood that he was generally not comfortable around veterans and felt it more appropriate for a war veteran in Cabinet to act as minister in attendance.Before the ceremony began, King Edward VIII, present in his capacity as king of Canada, inspected the guard of honour, was introduced to the honoured guests, and spent approximately half an hour speaking with veterans in the crowd. Two Royal Air Force and two French Air Force squadrons flew over the monument and dipped their wings in salute. The ceremony itself began with prayers from chaplains representing the Church of England, the United Church of Canada, and the Roman Catholic Church. Ernest Lapointe, Canadian Minister of Justice, spoke first, followed by Edward VIII who, in both French and English, thanked France for its generosity and assured those assembled that Canada would never forget its war missing and dead. The King then pulled the Royal Union Flag from the central figure of Canada Bereft and the military band played the Last Post. The ceremony was one of the King's few official duties before he abdicated the throne. The pilgrimage continued, and most participants toured Ypres before being taken to London to be hosted by the British Legion. One-third of the pilgrims left from London for Canada on 1 August, while the majority returned to France as guests of the government for another week of touring before going home.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nIn 1939, the increased threat of conflict with Nazi Germany amplified the Canadian government's level of concern for the general safety of the memorial. Canada could do little more than protect the sculptures and the bases of the pylons with sandbags and await developments. When war did break out in September 1939, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) deployed to France and assumed responsibility for the Arras sector, which included Vimy. In late May 1940, following the British retreat to Dunkirk after the Battle of Arras, the status and condition of the memorial became unknown to Allied forces. The Germans took control of the site and held the site's caretaker, George Stubbs, in an Ilag internment camp for Allied civilians in St. Denis, France. The rumoured destruction of the Vimy Memorial, either during the fighting or at the hands of the Germans, was widely reported in Canada and the United Kingdom. The rumours led the German Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda to formally deny accusations that Germany had damaged or desecrated the memorial. To demonstrate the memorial had not been desecrated, Adolf Hitler, who reportedly admired the memorial for its peaceful nature, was photographed by the press while personally touring it and the preserved trenches on 2 June 1940. The undamaged state of the memorial was not confirmed until September 1944 when British troops of the 2nd Battalion, the Welsh Guards of the Guards Armoured Division recaptured Vimy Ridge.\n\n\n=== Post-war years ===\nImmediately following the Second World War, very little attention was paid to the Battle of Vimy Ridge or the Vimy Memorial. The Winnipeg Free Press and The Legionary, the magazine of the Royal Canadian Legion, were the only publications to note the 35th anniversary of the battle in 1952. The 40th anniversary in 1957 received even less notice, with only the Halifax Herald making any mention. Interest in commemoration remained low in the early 1960s but increased in 1967 with the 50th anniversary of the battle, paired with the Canadian Centennial. A heavily attended ceremony at the memorial in April 1967 was broadcast live on television. Commemoration of the battle decreased once again throughout the 1970s and only returned in force with the 125th anniversary of Canadian Confederation and the widely covered 75th anniversary of the battle in 1992. The 1992 ceremony at the memorial was attended by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and at least 5,000 people. Subsequent smaller-scale ceremonies were held at the memorial in 1997 and 2002.\n\n\n=== Restoration and rededication ===\n\nBy the end of the century, the many repairs undertaken since the memorial's construction had left a patchwork of materials and colours, and a disconcerting pattern of damage from water intrusion at the joints. In May 2001, the Government of Canada announced the Canadian Battlefield Memorials Restoration Project, a major C$30 million restoration project to restore Canada's memorial sites in France and Belgium, in order to maintain and present them in a respectful and dignified manner. In 2005, the Vimy memorial closed for major restoration work. Veterans Affairs Canada directed the restoration of the memorial in cooperation with other Canadian departments, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, consultants and specialists in military history.Time, wear, and severe weather conditions led to many identified problems, the single most pervasive being water damage. In building a memorial made of cast concrete covered in stone, Allward had failed to take into account how these materials would shift over time. The builders and designer failed to incorporate sufficient space between the concrete and stones, which resulted in water infiltrating the structure through its walls and platforms, dissolving lime in the concrete foundation and masonry. As the water exited, it deposited the lime on exterior surfaces, obscuring many of the names inscribed thereon. Poor drainage and water flows off the monument also caused significant deterioration of the platform, terrace, and stairs. The restoration project was intended to address the root causes of damage and included repairs to the stone, walkways, walls, terraces, stairs, and platforms. In order to respect Allward's initial vision of a seamless structure, the restoration team were required to remove all foreign materials employed in patchwork repairs, replace damaged stones with material from the original quarry in Croatia, and correct all minor displacement of stones caused by the freeze-thaw activity. Underlying structural flaws were also corrected.Queen Elizabeth II, escorted by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, rededicated the restored memorial on 9 April 2007 in a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. Other senior Canadian officials, including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and senior French representatives, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin among them, attended the event, along with thousands of Canadian students, veterans of the Second World War and of more recent conflicts, and descendants of those who fought at Vimy. The crowd attending the rededication ceremony was the largest crowd on the site since the 1936 dedication.\n\n\n=== Centennial commemoration ===\nThe centennial commemoration of the Battle of Vimy Ridge took place at the memorial on 9 April 2017, coincidentally during the Canadian sesquicentennial celebrations. Estimates before the event indicated that an audience of up to 30,000 would be present. The Mayor of Arras, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leturque, thanked Canadians, along with Australians, Britons, New Zealanders and South Africans, for their role in the First World War battles in the area.Attending dignitaries for Canada included Governor General David Johnston; Prince Charles; Prince William, Duke of Cambridge; Prince Harry; and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve represented France. Elizabeth II issued a statement via the Governor General, remarking \"[Canadians] fought courageously and with great ingenuity in winning the strategic high point of Vimy Ridge, though victory came at a heavy cost\".Two postage stamps were released jointly by Canada Post and France's La Poste featuring the memorial, one designed by each country, to commemorate the centennial of the Battle of Vimy Ridge.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\nThe Canadian National Vimy Memorial site is located approximately 8 km (5.0 mi) north of Arras, France, circled by the small towns and communes of Vimy to the east, Givenchy-en-Gohelle to the north, Souchez to the northwest, Neuville-Saint-Vaast to the south and Th\u00e9lus to the southeast. The site is one of the few places on the former Western Front where a visitor can see the trench lines of a First World War battlefield and the related terrain in a preserved natural state. The total area of the site is 100 hectares (250 acres), much of which is forested and off limits to visitors to ensure public safety. The site's rough terrain and buried unexploded munitions make the task of grass cutting too dangerous for human operators. Instead, sheep graze the open meadows of the site.The site was established to honour the memory of the Canadian Corps, but it also contains other memorials. These are dedicated to the French Moroccan Division, Lions Club International, and Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins. There are also two Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries on site: Canadian Cemetery No. 2 and Givenchy Road Canadian Cemetery. Beyond being a popular location for battlefield tours, the site is also an important location in the burgeoning field of First World War battlefield archaeology, because of its preserved and largely undisturbed state. The site's interpretive centre helps visitors fully understand the Vimy Memorial, the preserved battlefield park, and the history of the Battle of Vimy within the context of Canada's participation in the First World War. The Canadian National Vimy Memorial and Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial sites comprise close to 80 percent of conserved First World War battlefields in existence and between them receive over one million visitors each year.\n\n\n=== Vimy memorial ===\nAllward constructed the memorial on the vantage point of Hill 145, the highest point on the ridge. The memorial contains many stylized features, including 20 human figures, which help the viewer in contemplating the structure as a whole. The front wall, normally mistaken for the rear, is 7.3 metres (24 ft) high and represents an impenetrable wall of defence. There is a group of figures at each end of the front wall, next to the base of the steps. The Breaking of the Sword is located at the southern corner of the front wall while Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless is located at the northern corner. Collectively, the two groups are The Defenders and represent the ideals for which Canadians gave their lives during the war. There is a cannon barrel draped in laurel and olive branches carved into the wall above each group, to symbolize victory and peace. In Breaking of the Sword, three young men are present, one of whom is crouching and breaking his sword. This statue represents the defeat of militarism and the general desire for peace. This grouping of figures is the most overt image to pacifism in the monument, the breaking of a sword being extremely uncommon in war memorials. The original plan for the sculpture included one figure crushing a German helmet with his foot. It was later decided to dismiss this feature because of its overtly militaristic imagery. In Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless, one man stands erect while three other figures, stricken by hunger or disease, are crouched and kneeling around him. The standing man represents Canada's sympathy for the weak and oppressed.The figure of a cloaked young woman stands on top and at the centre of the front wall and overlooks the Douai Plains. She has her head bowed, her eyes cast down, and her chin resting in one hand. Below her at ground level is a sarcophagus, bearing a Brodie helmet and a sword, and draped in laurel branches. The saddened figure of Canada Bereft, also known as Mother Canada, is a national personification of the young nation of Canada, mourning her dead. The statue, a reference to traditional images of the Mater Dolorosa and presented in a similar style to that of Michelangelo's Piet\u00e0, faces eastward looking out to the dawn of the new day. Unlike the other statues on the monument, stonemasons carved Canada Bereft from a single 30 tonne block of stone. The statue is the largest single piece in the monument and serves as a focal point. The area in front of the memorial was turned into a grassed space, which Allward referred to as the amphitheatre, that fanned out from the monument's front wall for a distance of 270 feet (82 m) while the battle-damaged landscape around the sides and back of the monument were left untouched.\n\nThe twin pylons rise to a height 30 metres above the memorial's stone platform; one bears the maple leaf for Canada and the other the fleur-de-lis for France, and both symbolize the unity and sacrifice of the two countries. At the top of the pylons is a grouping of figures known collectively as the Chorus. The most senior figures represent Justice and Peace; Peace stands with a torch upraised, making it the highest point in the region. The pair is in a style similar to Allward's previously commissioned statues of Truth and Justice, located outside the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa. The remainder of the Chorus is located directly below the senior figures: Faith, Hope and Truth on the eastern pylon; and Honour, Charity and Knowledge on the western pylon. Around these figures are shields of Canada, Britain, and France. Large crosses adorn the outside of each pylon. The First World War battle honours of the Canadian regiments, and a dedicatory message to Canada's war dead in both French and English are located at the base of the pylons. The Spirit of Sacrifice is located at the base between the two pylons. In the display, a young dying soldier is gazing upward in a crucifixion-like pose, having thrown his torch to a comrade who holds it aloft behind him. In a lightly veiled reference to the poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae, the torch is passed from one comrade to another in an effort to keep alive the memory of the war dead.\nThe Mourning Parents, one male and one female figure, are reclining on either side of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the Medici Tomb in Florence.  Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base of the monument. As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; Robert Grierson Combe, Frederick Hobson, William Johnstone Milne, and Robert Spall.\n\n\n=== Moroccan Division Memorial ===\n\nThe Moroccan Division Memorial is dedicated to the memory of the French and Foreign members of the Moroccan Division, killed during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915. The monument was raised by veterans of the division and inaugurated on 14 June 1925, having been built without planning permission. Excluding the various commemorative plaques at the bottom front facade of the memorial, campaign battles are inscribed on the left- and right-hand side corner view of the memorial. The veterans of the division later funded the April 1987 installation of a marble plaque that identified the Moroccan Division as the only division where all subordinate units had been awarded the Legion of Honour.The Moroccan Division was initially raised as the Marching Division of Morocco. The division comprised units of varying origins and although the name would indicate otherwise, it did not in fact contain any units originating from Morocco. Moroccans were part of the Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion which was formed from the merger of the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment with the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 2nd Foreign Regiment, both also part of the Moroccan Division Brigades. The division contained Tirailleurs and Zouaves, of principally Tunisian and Algerian origin, and most notably Legionnaires from the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment and the 7th Algerian Tirailleurs Regiment. The French Legionnaires came, as attested to by a plaque installed on the memorial, from 52 different countries and included amongst them American, Polish, Russian, Italian, Greek, German, Czechoslovakian, Swedish, Armenian, various nationals of the Jewish faith (http://monumentsmorts.univ-lille3.fr/monument/2892/givenchyengohelle-autre/), and Swiss volunteers such as writer Blaise Cendrars.In the battle, General Victor d'Urbal, commander of the French Tenth Army, sought to dislodge the Germans from the region by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. When the attack began on 9 May 1915, the French XXXIII Army Corps made significant territorial gains. The Moroccan Division, which was part of the XXXIII Army Corps, quickly moved through the German defences and advanced 4 kilometres (4,400 yd) into German lines in two hours. The division managed to capture the height of the ridge, with small parties even reaching the far side of the ridge, before retreating due to a lack of reinforcements. Even after German counter-attacks, the division managed to hold a territorial gain of 2,100 metres (2,300 yd). The division did however suffer heavy casualties. Those killed in the battle and commemorated on the memorial include both of the division's brigade commanders, Colonels Gaston Cros and Louis Augustus Theodore Pein.\n\n\n=== Grange Subway ===\nThe First World War's Western Front included an extensive system of tunnels, subways, and dugouts. The Grange Subway is a tunnel system that is approximately 800 metres (870 yd) in length and once connected the reserve lines to the front line. This permitted soldiers to advance to the front quickly, securely, and unseen. A portion of this tunnel system is open to the public through regular guided tours provided by Canadian student guides.The Arras-Vimy sector was conducive to tunnel excavation owing to the soft, porous yet extremely stable nature of the chalk underground. As a result, pronounced underground warfare had been a feature of the Vimy sector since 1915. In preparation for the Battle of Vimy Ridge, five British tunnelling companies excavated 12 subways along the Canadian Corps' front, the longest of which was 1.2 kilometres (1,300 yd) in length. The tunnellers excavated the subways at a depth of 10 metres to ensure protection from large calibre howitzer shellfire. The subways were often dug at a pace of four metres a day and were often two metres tall and one metre wide. This underground network often incorporated or included concealed light rail lines, hospitals, command posts, water reservoirs, ammunition stores, mortar and machine gun posts, and communication centres.\n\n\n=== Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins memorial ===\nNear the Canadian side of the restored trenches is a small memorial plaque dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins MBE. Watkins was head of Explosive Ordnance Disposal at the Directorate of Land Service Ammunition, Royal Logistic Corps, and a leading British explosive ordnance disposal expert. In August 1998, he died in a roof collapse near a tunnel entrance while undertaking a detailed investigative survey of the British tunnel system on the grounds of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial site. Watkins was no stranger to the tunnel system at Vimy Ridge. Earlier the same year, he participated in the successful disarming of 3 tonnes of deteriorated ammonal explosives located under a road intersection on the site.\n\n\n=== Visitors' centre ===\nThe site has a visitors' centre, staffed by Canadian student guides, which is open seven days a week. During the memorial restoration, the original visitors' centre near the monument was closed and replaced with a temporary one, which remains in use today. The visitors' centre is now near the preserved forward trench lines, close to many of the craters created by underground mining during the war and near the entrance of the Grange Subway. Construction of a new educational visitors' centre is expected to be completed by April 2017, in advance of the 100th anniversary of the battle. The new CA$10 million visitor centre is a public-private partnership between government and the Vimy Foundation. In order to raise funds the Vimy Foundation granted naming rights in various halls of the visitor centre to sponsors, an approach which has met some level of controversy due to the site being a memorial park.\n\n\n== Sociocultural influence ==\n\nThe Canadian National Vimy Memorial site has considerable sociocultural significance for Canada. The idea that Canada's national identity and nationhood were born out of the Battle of Vimy Ridge is an opinion that is widely repeated in military and general histories of Canada. Historian Denise Thomson suggests that the construction of the Vimy memorial represents the culmination of an increasingly assertive nationalism that developed in Canada during the interwar period. Hucker suggests that the memorial transcends the Battle of Vimy Ridge and now serves as an enduring image of the whole First World War, while expressing the enormous impact of war in general, and also considers that the 2005 restoration project serves as evidence of a new generation's determination to remember Canada's contribution and sacrifice during the First World War.The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada recognized the importance of the site by recommending its designation as one of the National Historic Sites of Canada; it was so designated in 1996, and is one of only two outside of Canada. The other is the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial, also in France. Remembrance has also taken other forms: the Vimy Foundation, having been established to preserve and promote Canada's First World War legacy as symbolized by the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, and Vimy Ridge Day, to commemorate the deaths and casualties during the battle. Local Vimy resident Georges Devloo spent 13 years until his death in 2009 offering car rides to Canadian tourists to and from the memorial at no charge, as a way of paying tribute to the Canadians who fought at Vimy.The memorial is not without its critics. Alana Vincent has argued that constituent parts of the monument are in conflict, and as a result the message conveyed by the monument is not unified. Visually, Vincent argues there is a dichotomy between the triumphant pose of the figures at the top of the pylons and the mourning posture of those figures at the base. Textually, she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the list of names of the missing at the base of the monument.\n\nThe memorial is regularly the subject or inspiration of other artistic projects. In 1931, Will Longstaff painted Ghosts of Vimy Ridge, depicting ghosts of men from the Canadian Corps on Vimy Ridge surrounding the memorial, though the memorial was still several years away from completion. The memorial has been the subject of stamps in both France and Canada, including a French series in 1936 and a Canadian series on the 50th anniversary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918. The Canadian Unknown Soldier was selected from a cemetery in the vicinity of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, and the design of the Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is based upon the stone sarcophagus at the base of the Vimy memorial. The Never Forgotten National Memorial was intended to be a 24-metre (79 ft) statue inspired by the Canada Bereft statue on the memorial, before the project was cancelled in February 2016. A 2001 Canadian historical novel The Stone Carvers by Jane Urquhart involves the characters in the design and creation of the memorial. In 2007, the memorial was a short-listed selection for the Seven Wonders of Canada. The Royal Canadian Mint released commemorative coins featuring the memorial on several occasions, including a 5 cent sterling silver coin in 2002 and a 30 dollar sterling silver coin in 2007. The Sacrifice Medal, a Canadian military decoration created in 2008, features the image of Mother Canada on the reverse side of the medal. A permanent bas relief sculpted image of the memorial is presented in the gallery of the grand hall of the Embassy of France in Canada to symbolize the close relations between the two countries. The memorial is featured on the reverse of the Frontier Series Canadian polymer $20 banknote, which was released by the Bank of Canada on 7 November 2012.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nWorld War I memorials\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nThe Vimy Foundation \u2013 Canadian educational charity\nRadio recording of King Edward VIII's speech at the dedication ceremony from CBC Archives\nVimy Memorial and casualty records at Commonwealth War Graves Commission\nReturn to Vimy, including video clip of the 1936 unveiling (Archives of Ontario)\nVeterans Affairs Canada - Vimy Ridge 100th anniversary",

          "Having been to Vimy on two prior occasions, I took this recent opportunity to visit at dusk and stay until dark. I never grow tired of the magnificence of the twin pylons that overlook the land beyond, it's stark white stone contrasting against everything around it. Add",

          "Vimy is one of the best preserved WWI battle sites, in terms of still seeing the craters pock-marking the ground, etc. and getting a bit of a feel for the time. The trenches are good. The Memorial itself very impressive, and the museum pretty good. Hard not to give it a 5 on",

          "It is difficult to convey the scale of this beautiful dazzling white memorial as it reaches up into the sky. It is well worth visiting and enjoying as well as remembering. A walk around the perimeter is lined with warnings of unexploded WW1 ordnance, just to remind you that this",

          "This is one of the best memorials I've seen and I've seen a few WW2 and WW1 sites. You can really visualise and imagine what it must have been like for those brave soldiers. If you are passing by you must visit the memorial. The only negative was the trenches as there are",
          "The Vimy Ridge Memorial is a monument to the Canadians who gave there lives while engaged in the taking of this important ridge in 1917. I can't describe how overpowering this memorial is to me as a Canadian and the incredible pride I felt as a Canadian visitor. This was offset",

          "Being Canadians we felt it a very good time to visit given the 100 year anniversary of this battle. The monument is massive, standing gleaming white on the ridge so hard fought for in WW1. The tour of the tunnels that were dug under the ridge were well worth a visit and evoked",
          "We visited out of curiosity and felt a little voyeuristic but left enlightened and informed . The Canadian staff on site were really welcoming and explained what to see and and do and were a credit to their nation, especially in light of the subject they have guardianship over.",

          "I was here in 2000, and returned in July 2017, 100 years after the battle for Vimy Ridge. Vimy Ridge is to the Canadians as Gallipoli is to the ANZACs and it is the crucible in which the Nation of Canada matured. The Canadian Memorial at Vimy Ridge, to my mind, is the most",
          "Vimy Ridge is a fascinating collection of memorial and museum, and worth a visit on anyone's Battlefield agenda. The museum side consists of tunnels and trenches which are worth queuing for. They are guided trips, guided by Canadian docents. This is a great idea, as they are",
          "Wonderful day trip from Paris! Took train to Arras and then cab to Memorial. Enjoyed the artifacts and movies at visit centre. Staff very informative and helpful. Definitely take time to do the tunnel and trenches tour. We were amazed at how close the German trenches were.",

          "Vimy was one of several Canadian memorials on our trip. Both Vimy and Beaumont Hamel have free tours provided by the Canadian government and worth taking the time to visit. Even though we knew \"No Mans Land\" was not a big area it was shocking to exit the tunnel at Vimy and see",
          "Fantastic experience. The tunnel tour is a must do. The Canadian guides are wonderful. You can't begin to understand what the western front and trench warfare were like without coming here. It is very moving and is a memorial, not touristy at all.",

          "The monument itself is breath-taking, towering over the French countryside and glowing white against the sky. The Canada Bereft sculpture captures the feeling of senseless loss, not just to Canada but to all of humanity. That loss is further conveyed by the list of names of men",
          "So proud to be Canadian and so thankful for what Canadians and allied forces accomplished. The memorial, and trenches and tunnels were all a great experience - one that my family will never forget. Assuming you are making the trip from Paris, I would recommend taking the train",

          "Such a splendid and majestic place now. But the tunnels and great guided tours give some indication of the hell and folly there one hundred years ago. Thtourvand guides, all free, were wonderful. It was an eye opener to see first hand just how close were the front line trenches",
          "It's difficult to describe a visit to such a poignant location. If you've never been to Vimy Ridge you will be moved by the suffering and death that was experienced by the Canadian troops in WW1. France gave the location to the Canadian people in recognition of their efforts and",

          "An incredible memorial to the Canadian soldiers who lost their lives at Vimy ridge and to those who have no known grave. The memorial itself can be seen for miles and is even more breathtaking up close engraved with the thousands upon thousands of names.",

        "wiki": "Lille ( LEEL; French: [lil] (listen); Dutch: Rijsel [\u02c8r\u025bis\u0259l]; Picard: Lile; West Flemish: Rysel) is a city at the northern tip of France, in French Flanders. On the De\u00fble River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region, the prefecture of the Nord department, and the main city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille.\nAs of 2017, Lille had a population of 232,787 within its administrative limits, and Lille is the first city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille with a population of 1,146,320, making it the fourth-largest urban area in France after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nArcheological digs seem to show the area as inhabited by as early as 2000 BC, most notably in the modern quartiers of Fives, Wazemmes and Vieux Lille. The original inhabitants of the region were the Gauls, such as the Menapians, the Morins, the Atrebates and the Nervians, who were followed by Germanic peoples: the Saxons, the Frisians and the Franks.\nThe legend of \"Lyd\u00e9ric and Phinaert\" puts the foundation of the city of Lille at 640. In the 8th century, the language of Old Low Franconian was spoken, as attested by toponymic research. Lille's Dutch name is Rijsel, which comes from ter ijsel (at the island) from Middle Dutch ijssel (\u201csmall island, islet\u201d), calque of Old French l'Isle (\u201cthe Island\u201d), itself from Latin \u012ansula, from \u012bnsula (\u201cisland\u201d).\nFrom 830 to around 910, the Vikings invaded Flanders. After the destruction caused by Normans' and the Magyars' invasion, the eastern part of the region was ruled by various local princes.\nThe first mention of the town dates from 1066: apud Insulam (Latin for \"at the island\"). It was then controlled by the County of Flanders, as were the regional cities (the Roman cities Boulogne, Arras, Cambrai as well as the Carolingian cities Valenciennes, Saint-Omer, Ghent and Bruges). The County of Flanders thus extended to the left bank of the Scheldt, one of the richest and most prosperous regions of Europe.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe Carolingian duke \u00c9vrard lived in the city in the 9th century and participated in many of the day's political and military affairs. There was an important Battle of Lille in 1054.\nFrom the 12th century, the fame of the Lille cloth fair began to grow. In 1144 Saint-Sauveur parish was formed, which would give its name to the modern-day quartier Saint-Sauveur.\nThe counts of Flanders, Boulogne, and Hainaut came together with England and East Frankia and tried to regain territory taken by Philip II of France following Henry II of England's death, a war that ended with the French victory at Bouvines in 1214. Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders was imprisoned and the county fell into dispute: it would be his wife, Jeanne, Countess of Flanders and Constantinople, who ruled the city. She was said to be well loved by the residents of Lille, who by that time numbered 10,000.\nIn 1225, the street performer and juggler Bertrand Cordel, doubtlessly encouraged by local lords, tried to pass himself off as Baldwin I of Constantinople (the father of Jeanne of Flanders), who had disappeared at the battle of Adrianople. He pushed the counties of Flanders and Hainaut towards sedition against Jeanne in order to recover his land. She called her cousin, Louis VIII (\"The Lion\"). He unmasked the imposter, whom Countess Jeanne quickly had hanged. In 1226 the king agreed to free Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders. Count Ferrand died in 1233, and his daughter Marie soon after. In 1235, Jeanne granted a city charter by which city governors would be chosen each All Saint's Day by four commissioners chosen by the ruler. On 6 February 1236, she founded the Countess's Hospital (Hospice Comtesse), which remains one of the most beautiful buildings in Old Lille. It was in her honour that the hospital of the Regional Medical University of Lille was named \"Jeanne of Flanders Hospital\" in the 20th century.\nThe Countess died in 1244 in the Abbey of Marquette, leaving no heirs. The rule of Flanders and Hainaut thus fell to her sister, Margaret II, Countess of Flanders, then to Margaret's son, Guy of Dampierre. Lille fell under the rule of France from 1304 to 1369, after the Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305).\nThe county of Flanders fell to the Duchy of Burgundy next, after the 1369 marriage of Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, and Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Lille thus became one of the three capitals of said Duchy, along with Brussels and Dijon. By 1445, Lille counted some 25,000 residents. Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, was even more powerful than the King of France, and made Lille an administrative and financial capital.\nOn 17 February 1454, one year after the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, Philip the Good organised a Pantagruelian banquet at his Lille palace, the still-celebrated \"Feast of the Pheasant\". There the Duke and his court undertook an oath to Christianity.\nIn 1477, at the death of the last duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian of Austria, who thus became Count of Flanders.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\n\nThe 16th and the 17th centuries were marked by a boom in the regional textile industry, the Protestant revolts and outbreaks of the plague.\nLille came under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1519. The Low Countries fell to his eldest son, Philip II of Spain, in 1555. The city remained under Spanish Habsburg rule until 1668.\nCalvinism first appeared in the area in 1542, and by 1555, the authorities were taking steps to suppress that form of Protestantism. In 1566, the countryside around Lille was affected by the Iconoclastic Fury. In 1578, the Hurlus, a group of Protestant rebels, stormed the castle of the Counts of Mouscron. They were removed four months later by a Catholic Wallon regiment, and they tried several times between 1581 and 1582 to take the city of Lille, all in vain. The Hurlus were notably held back by the legendary Jeanne Maillotte. At the same time (1581), at the call of Elizabeth I of England, the north of the Seventeen Provinces, having gained a Protestant majority, successfully revolted and formed the Dutch Republic. The war brought or exacerbated periods of famine and plague (the last in 1667\u20131679).The first printer to set up shop in Lille was Antoine Tack in 1594. The 17th century saw the building of new institutions: an Irish College in 1610, a Jesuit college in 1611, an Augustinian college in 1622, almshouses or hospitals such as the Maison des Vieux hommes in 1624 and the Bonne et Forte Maison des Pauvres in 1661, and of a Mont-de-pi\u00e9t\u00e9 in 1626.Unsuccessful French attacks on the city were launched in 1641 and 1645. In 1667, Louis XIV of France (the Sun King) successfully laid siege to Lille, resulting in it becoming French in 1668 under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, provoking discontent among the citizens of the prosperous city. A number of important public works undertaken between 1667 and 1670, such as the Citadel (erected by Vauban), or the creation of the quartiers of Saint-Andr\u00e9 and la Madeleine, enabled the French king to gradually gain the confidence of his new subjects in Lille, some of whom continued to feel Flemish, but they had always spoken the Romance Picard language.\n\nFor five years, from 1708 to 1713, the city was occupied by the Dutch during the War of the Spanish Succession. Throughout the 18th century, Lille remained profoundly Catholic. It took little part in the French Revolution, but there were riots and the destruction of churches. In 1790, the city held its first municipal elections.\n\n\n=== Post-French Revolution ===\nIn 1792, in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the Austrians, then in the United Provinces, laid siege to Lille. The \"Column of the Goddess\", erected in 1842 in the \"Grand-Place\" (officially named Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle), is a tribute to the city's resistance, led by Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9-Bonte. Although Austrian artillery destroyed many houses and the main church of the city, the city did not surrender, and the Austrian Army left after eight days.\n\nThe city continued to grow and, by 1800, had some 53,000 residents, leading to Lille becoming the seat of the Nord d\u00e9partment in 1804. In 1846, a railway connecting Paris and Lille was built. In the early the 19th century, Napoleon I's continental blockade against the United Kingdom led to Lille's textile industry developing even more fully. The city was known for its cotton while the nearby towns of Roubaix and Tourcoing worked wool.  Leisure activities were thoroughly organised in 1858 for the 80,000 inhabitants.  Cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1,300, or one for every three houses. At that time the city counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations. Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets festivals and competitions. In 1853, Alexandre Desrousseaux composed his lullaby P'tit quinquin.\nIn 1858, Lille annexed the adjacent towns of Fives, Wazemmes, and Moulins. Lille's population was 158,000 in 1872, growing to over 200,000 by 1891. In 1896 Lille became the first city in France to be led by a socialist, Gustave Delory.\nBy 1912, Lille's population stood at 217,000. The city profited from the Industrial Revolution, particularly via coal and the steam engine. The entire region grew wealthy thanks to its mines and textile industry.\n\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nLille's occupation by the Germans began on 13 October 1914 after a ten-day siege and heavy shelling, which destroyed 882 apartment and office blocks and 1,500 houses, mostly around the railway station and in the centre. By the end of October, the city was being run by German authorities.\nBecause Lille was only 20 km from the battlefield, German troops passed through the city regularly on their way to and from the front. As a result, occupied Lille became a place for the hospitalisation and the treatment of wounded soldiers as well as a place for soldiers' relaxation and entertainment. Many buildings, homes and businesses were requisitioned to those ends.Lille was liberated by the Allies on 17 October 1918, when General Sir William Birdwood and his troops were welcomed by joyous crowds. The general was made an honorary citizen of the city of Lille on 28 October.\nThe only audio recording known to have been made during World War I was recorded near Lille in October 1918. The two-minute recording captured the Royal Garrison Artillery conducting a gas shell bombardment.Lille was also the hunting ground of the German World War I flying ace Max Immelmann, who was nicknamed \"the Eagle of Lille\".\n\n\n=== Ann\u00e9es Folles, Great Depression and Popular Front ===\n\nIn July 1921, at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin discovered the first anti-tuberculosis vaccine, known as BCG (\"Bacille de Calmette et Gu\u00e9rin\"). The Op\u00e9ra de Lille, designed by Lille architect Louis M. Cordonnier, was dedicated in 1923.\nFrom 1931, Lille felt the repercussions of the Great Depression, and by 1935, a third of the city's population lived in poverty. In 1936, the city's mayor, Roger Salengro, became Minister of the Interior of the Popular Front but eventually killed himself after right-wing groups led a slanderous campaign against him.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring the Battle of France, Lille was besieged by German forces for several days. When Belgium was invaded, the citizens of Lille, still haunted by the events of World War I, began to flee the city in large numbers. Lille was part of the zone under control of the German commander in Brussels, and was never controlled by the Vichy government in France. Lille was instead controlled under the military administration in Northern France. The d\u00e9partments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais (with the exception of the coast, notably Dunkirk) were for the most part liberated from 1 to 5 September 1944, by British, Canadian and Polish troops. On 3 September, German troops began to leave Lille out of fear of the British, who were on their way from Brussels. The city was liberated by a British force consisting largely of tanks.Rationing came to an end in 1947, and by 1948, normality had returned to Lille.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\n\nIn 1967, the Chambers of Commerce of Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing were joined, and in 1969< the Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Lille (Lille urban community) was created, linking 87 communes with Lille.\nThroughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the region was faced with some problems after the decline of the coal, mining and textile industries. From the early 1980s, the city began to turn itself more towards the service sector.\nIn 1983, the VAL, the world's first automated rapid transit underground network, opened. In 1993, a high-speed TGV train line was opened connecting Paris with Lille in one hour. This, with the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 and the arrival of the Eurostar train put Lille at the centre of a triangle connecting Paris, London and Brussels.\nWork on Euralille, an urban remodelling project, began in 1991. The Euralille Centre was opened in 1994, and the remodeled district is now full of parks and modern buildings containing offices, shops and apartments. In 1994 the \"Grand Palais\" was also opened for the general public, which is free for the public to enter on the first Sunday of every month.\nLille was chosen as European Capital of Culture in 2004, along with the Italian city of Genoa.\nLille and Roubaix were affected by the 2005 riots, like all of France's other urban centres.\nIn 2007 and again in 2010, Lille was awarded the label \"Internet City\".\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLille can be described as having a temperate oceanic climate; summers normally do not reach high average temperatures, but winters can fall below freezing temperatures, but with averages quite a bit above the freezing mark. Precipitation is plentiful year round.\nThe table below gives average temperatures and precipitation levels for the 1981-2010 reference period.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nLille is noted for its air pollution, with a 2018 study attributing 1,700 deaths per year in the agglomeration of Lille to pollution. In 2018, Lille held France's record pollution peaks.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nA former major mechanical, food industry and textile manufacturing centre as well as a retail and finance center, Lille is the largest city of a conurbation, built like a network of cities: Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing and Villeneuve d'Ascq. The conurbation forms the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille which is France's fourth-largest urban conglomeration with a 2016 population of over 1.15 million.\n\n\n=== Revenues and taxes ===\nFor centuries, Lille, a city of merchants, has displayed a wide range of incomes: great wealth and poverty have lived side by side, especially until the end of the 1800s. This contrast was noted by Victor Hugo in 1851 in his poem Les Ch\u00e2timents:  \u00ab Caves de Lille ! on meurt sous vos plafonds de pierre ! \u00bb (\"Cellars of Lille! We die under your stone ceilings!\")\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment in Lille has switched over half a century from a predominant industry to tertiary activities and services.\nServices account for 91% of employment in 2006.\n\nEmployment in Lille-Hellemmes-Lomme from 1968 to 2006\n\nEmployment per categories in 1968 and in 2006\n\nUnemployment in active population from 1968 to 2006\n\n\n=== Enterprises ===\nIn 2007, Lille hosts around 21,000 industry or service sites.\n\nEnterprises as per 31 December 2007\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nLille features an array of architectural styles with various amounts of Flemish influence, including the use of brown and red brick. In addition, many residential neighborhoods, especially in Greater Lille, consist of attached 2\u20133 story houses aligned in a row, with narrow gardens in the back. These architectural attributes, many uncommon in France, help make Lille a transition in France to neighboring Belgium, as well as nearby Netherlands and England, where the presence of brick, as well as row houses or the terraced house is much more prominent.\nPoints of interest include\n\nLille Cathedral (Basilique-cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame-de-la-Treille)\nCitadel of Lille\nPalais des Beaux-Arts de Lille\nJardin botanique de la Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie\nJardin botanique Nicolas Boulay\nJardin des Plantes de Lille\n\n\n=== La Braderie ===\n\nLille hosts an annual braderie on the first weekend in September. Its origins are thought to date back to the twelfth century and between two and three million visitors are drawn into the city. It is one of the largest gatherings of France and the largest flea market in Europe.\nMany of the roads in the inner city (including much of the old town) are closed and local shops, residents and traders set up stalls in the street.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille has a mixed mode public transport system, which is considered one of the most modern in the whole of France. It comprises buses, trams and a driverless light metro system, all of which are operated under the Transpole name. The Lille Metro is a VAL system (v\u00e9hicule automatique l\u00e9ger = light automated vehicle) that opened on 16 May 1983, becoming the first automatic light metro line in the world. The system has two lines, with a total length of 45 kilometres (28 miles) and 60 stations. The tram system consists of two interurban tram lines, connecting central Lille to the nearby communities of Roubaix and Tourcoing, and has 45 stops. 68 urban bus routes cover the metropolis, 8 of which reach into Belgium.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nLille is an important crossroads in the European high-speed rail network. It lies on the Eurostar line to London (1:20 hour journey). The French TGV network also puts it only 1 hour from Paris, 38 minutes from Brussels, and connects to other major centres in France such as Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse. Lille has two railway stations, which stand next door to one another: Lille-Europe station (Gare de Lille-Europe), which primarily serves high-speed trains and international services (Eurostar), and Lille-Flandres station (Gare de Lille-Flandres), which primarily serves lower speed regional trains and regional Belgian trains.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nFive autoroutes pass by Lille, the densest confluence of highways in France after Paris:\n\nAutoroute A27 : Lille \u2013 Tournai \u2013 Brussels / Li\u00e8ge \u2013 Germany\nAutoroute A23 : Lille \u2013 Valenciennes\nAutoroute A1  : Lille \u2013 Arras \u2013 Paris / Reims \u2013 Lyon / Orl\u00e9ans / Le Havre\nAutoroute A25 : Lille \u2013 Dunkirk \u2013 Calais \u2013 England / North Belgium\nAutoroute A22 : Lille \u2013 Antwerp \u2013 NetherlandsA sixth one \u2013 the proposed A24 \u2013 will link Amiens to Lille if built, but there is opposition to its route.\n\n\n=== Air traffic ===\nLille Lesquin International Airport is 15 minutes from the city centre by car (11 km). In terms of shipping, it ranks fourth, with almost 38,000 tonnes of freight which pass through each year. Its passenger traffic, around 1.2 million in 2010, is modest due to the proximity to Brussels, Charleroi, and Paris-CDG airports. The airport mostly connects other French and European cities (some with low-cost airlines).\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\n\nLille is the third-largest French river port after Paris and Strasbourg. The river De\u00fble is connected to regional waterways with over 680 km (423 mi) of navigable waters. The De\u00fble connects to Northern Europe via the River Scarpe and the River Scheldt (towards Belgium and the Netherlands), and internationally via the Lys River (to Dunkerque and Calais).\nShipping statistics\n\n\n== Education ==\nWith over 110,000 students, the metropolitan area of Lille is one of France's top student cities.\n\nWith roots back from 1562 to 1793 as University of Douai, (then as Universit\u00e9 Imp\u00e9riale in 1808), the State University of Lille was established in Lille in 1854 with Louis Pasteur as the first dean of its Faculty of Sciences. A school of medicine and an engineering school were also established in Lille in 1854; and the University of Lille was united as the association of existing public Faculties in 1896. It was then split into three independent university campuses in 1970: Lille 1 University of Science and Technology, Lille 2 University of Law and Health, and Lille 3 Charles de Gaulle University of Humanities, Social sciences, Literature and Arts.At the beginning of 2018, Lille 1, Lille 2 and Lille 3 merged to form the new University of Lille (student enrollment: 70,000).\nIt is part of the Community of Universities and Institutions (COMUE) Lille Nord de France and the European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France.\n\nThe Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech, an engineering graduate school of industrial and mechanical engineering, settled in Lille in 1900. This campus is one of the eight Teaching and Research Center (CER) of the school. Its creation was decided by Pierre-Nicolas Legrand de L\u00e9rant.\nEcole Centrale de Lille is one of the five Centrale Graduate Schools of engineering in France; it was founded in Lille city in 1854, its graduate engineering education and research center was established as Institut industriel du Nord (IDN) in 1872, in 1968 it moved in a modern campus in Lille suburb.\n\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de chimie de Lille was established as Institut de chimie de Lille in 1894 supporting chemistry research as followers of Kuhlmann's breakthrough works in Lille.\n\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de journalisme de Lille, journalism school created in 1924.\nSkema Business School established in 1892 is ranked among the top business schools in France.\n\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies settled in Lille in 2009.\nESME-Sudria and E-Artsup settled in Lille in 2012.\nThe ESA \u2013 \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Affaires is a Business Management school established in Lille in 1990.\nIEP Sciences-Po Lille political studies institute was established in Lille in 1992.\nThe Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action is also located in Lille.\nThe Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group) established in Lille in 1988.\nThe European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France is headquartered in Lille Metropolis and includes 3,000 PhD Doctorate students supported by university research laboratories.\nThe Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Lille was founded in 1875. Today it has law, economics, medicine, physics faculties and schools. Among the most famous is Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers (ICAM) founded in 1898, ranked 20th among engineering schools, with the specificity of graduating polyvalent engineers, Ecole des Hautes \u00e9tudes d'ing\u00e9nieur (HEI) a school of engineering founded in 1885 and offering 10 fields of specialization, \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes commerciales du nord (EDHEC) founded in 1906, IESEG School of Management founded in 1964 (17th place in the latest Financial Times global ranking of the 90 best masters in management, published on Monday 12 September 2016).  and Skema Business School currently ranked within the top 5, the top 10 and top 15 business schools in France, respectively.

          "Arras famous for its \"Places\". This one is off the Grand Place, where there is ample parking both above and below the Square. Some good options of cafes, bars and restaurants around.",
          "Awesome place for lunch, dinner or just a drink. Love the architecture. So pretty at night, so much sure you enjoy it during the day and evening.",
          "This square really struck us as being amazing. During both the day and night, there is just something magical about it. We still talk about it several months later.",
          "The Place des Heros is HUGE and there are a myriad pf pl;aces to east and drink. Its large enough to decide, sun or shade, and there's a bar nearby! On Wednesdays they have a market and we bought local cheeses and meats",
          "The facades of the buildings are stunning. The square itself takes you back in time. After the city was completely destroyed during the two world wars the town has truly out done itself. Worth the time visiting and doing things around the area.",
          "Don't be fooled if the gate looks closed and the sign dictates opening times. Push the gate and it opens to a very sombre and humbling moated area of remembrance for the resistance killed during World War 2",
          "Whilst on your travel this square is a place to see. Beats architecture and well kept. Lots of eateries close by. Tourist information nearby. Will go again.",
          "We drove in to Arras just for lunch after visiting Vimy Ridge (about 20 minute drive away). After having lunch at the Vertigo restaurant, we could see the street opening up down the block, so thought let's just check out what is around the corner. Wow - major town scare with",

          "Used Arras as a base for touring. Visited the square most days as we used the bistro on the corner to refresh ourselves. The square comes alive at night with the church lit up and local people using the bars. Astounding to believe that most of it was badly damaged during the",
          "This is a remarkable town square which was destroyed during World War 2 and has now been rebuilt as it was previously. A lovely place to sit and enjoy the lovely buiklding with a cup of Coffee in the daytime and at night the place comes alive.",
          "...but no longer - it's a pedestrian zone and all the better for it. It's difficult to believe that what you see is 90% a reconstruction but it's none the worse for that. Follow the circular tour from the tourist information office to get a good view of the city!",
          "The place to be in Arras really. Lovely big square, surrounded by beautiful architecture. There are restaurants, cafes and bars all around the square, a lovely place to sit and people watch. They have a market on a Wednesday morning and we discovered, much to our shock, that",

          "it is clearly Flemish and with the Beffroi a direct link to the centuries where this city was part of the rich Flemish region. But.... it looks like is is in need of urgent restauration. Many buildings are not looking well at all and the emty top-floors do not help to improve",
          "One of the squares in the old part of Arras. A beautiful old square that was rebuilt as it was after WW1. About 80% of Arras was destroyed during WW1 so rebuilt. The area is cobbled and is lined with shops, patisseries, cafes and restaurants.",

          "Smaller than the Grand Place but a great place to sit and have a drink and watch the world go by but also to look around as several of the shops have signs outside in both french and English to explain their history. The Belfroi also houses the Tourist Office and Arras .giants.",
          "Fantastic is all I can say. Enormous cobbled town square with numerous cafes and bars surrounding it. Understand it was totally destroyed during WW1 in the battle for Arras. It apparently was rebuilt using modern methods back then but it is just so spectacular you cannot grasp",

          "Arras is only an hour or so from Calais and a lovely place to visit. The Place des H\u00e9ros is at the heart of the city. Cafes, bars and restaurants plus a large traffic-free square make it a great place to sit and relax and soak up a bit of real France. We came here first with",
          "Next to the grand place is the Place des H\u00e9ros situated. It is a lively location with many terraces where you can enjoy the impressive view on the beautifully restored square and its buildings with their uniform architecture, with a drink. There are more places worth seeing but",

          "While we were in Arras as a stop over to see Vimy we took time to wander around and take in this site. So much history and to know it met great destruction in both WW I and WW II made it very meaningful to learn more about the history of this community",
          "I am glad we were there in the evening as I had been there only during the day during my previous visits. It\u2019s awesome. It will be good to ban or at least to limit the number of cars parking on the main square which is quite nice too.",
          "There are two squares in Arras, this is by far the nicest as it has the church in it and is not used as a car park like the 'Grand Place'",
          "Bearing in mind that the majority of this square was ruined in WW1 it is amazing how it has been rebuilt in the last century. Just stand and admire.",
          "I suppose that we were spoiled by the similar squares in Brugge and Ypres which we thought were in a lot better condition whereas we thought that the two squares an Arras were looking a little tired. We ate in a restaurant just off the square so can\u2019t comment on the multitude of",
          "This square in the centre of Arras is a meeting place for many of the locals and visitors, holds markets on numerous occasions. Plenty of fines eating and drinking establishments to be enjoyed. Study the pictures of the ruins after bitter fighting in WW1 but it has been rebuilt",
          "Visited her arriving late on a Saturday morning when the market, which stretches through the town centre, was in full swing. Bustling and busy it had everything from fresh produce to the cheap rubbish clothing and electronics stalls. Then as if by magic, at around 1pm the market",
          "This is a great square. Has so much history as it was completely destroyed during WW1 and has been reconstructed. Lots of restaurants here if they ever open to serve food. Could not get use to the hours of operation. You can get a beer here at any time of the day or night",
          "There\u2019s always something to do here with the bars, shops and restaurants. In the summer its a vibrant place filled with life and a fantastic market at the weekend. The architecture is wonderful and at night it glows",

          "My wife and I have spent quite a bit of time in Arras over the years. The Place des Heros is always worth a visit for its historic buildings, shops and cafes. It's right in the centre of the city with ample parking.",
          "I was here in April for the 100th anniversary of Vimy Ridge and I was not dissapointed. The square itself was amazing and full of history and they did it all up with a light show commemorating the battle of Vimy Ridge, fantastic. If you're in the area I definitely recommend",
          "Lots to do here in the evenings - walk the full length of the square before deciding which restaurant to visit. One or two lovely patisseries to grab breakfast in. Visit the tourist information office that has a terrific display of WW1 material especially specialist books and",

        "wiki": "Lille ( LEEL; French: [lil] (listen); Dutch: Rijsel [\u02c8r\u025bis\u0259l]; Picard: Lile; West Flemish: Rysel) is a city at the northern tip of France, in French Flanders. On the De\u00fble River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region, the prefecture of the Nord department, and the main city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille.\nAs of 2017, Lille had a population of 232,787 within its administrative limits, and Lille is the first city of the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille with a population of 1,146,320, making it the fourth-largest urban area in France after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nArcheological digs seem to show the area as inhabited by as early as 2000 BC, most notably in the modern quartiers of Fives, Wazemmes and Vieux Lille. The original inhabitants of the region were the Gauls, such as the Menapians, the Morins, the Atrebates and the Nervians, who were followed by Germanic peoples: the Saxons, the Frisians and the Franks.\nThe legend of \"Lyd\u00e9ric and Phinaert\" puts the foundation of the city of Lille at 640. In the 8th century, the language of Old Low Franconian was spoken, as attested by toponymic research. Lille's Dutch name is Rijsel, which comes from ter ijsel (at the island) from Middle Dutch ijssel (\u201csmall island, islet\u201d), calque of Old French l'Isle (\u201cthe Island\u201d), itself from Latin \u012ansula, from \u012bnsula (\u201cisland\u201d).\nFrom 830 to around 910, the Vikings invaded Flanders. After the destruction caused by Normans' and the Magyars' invasion, the eastern part of the region was ruled by various local princes.\nThe first mention of the town dates from 1066: apud Insulam (Latin for \"at the island\"). It was then controlled by the County of Flanders, as were the regional cities (the Roman cities Boulogne, Arras, Cambrai as well as the Carolingian cities Valenciennes, Saint-Omer, Ghent and Bruges). The County of Flanders thus extended to the left bank of the Scheldt, one of the richest and most prosperous regions of Europe.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe Carolingian duke \u00c9vrard lived in the city in the 9th century and participated in many of the day's political and military affairs. There was an important Battle of Lille in 1054.\nFrom the 12th century, the fame of the Lille cloth fair began to grow. In 1144 Saint-Sauveur parish was formed, which would give its name to the modern-day quartier Saint-Sauveur.\nThe counts of Flanders, Boulogne, and Hainaut came together with England and East Frankia and tried to regain territory taken by Philip II of France following Henry II of England's death, a war that ended with the French victory at Bouvines in 1214. Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders was imprisoned and the county fell into dispute: it would be his wife, Jeanne, Countess of Flanders and Constantinople, who ruled the city. She was said to be well loved by the residents of Lille, who by that time numbered 10,000.\nIn 1225, the street performer and juggler Bertrand Cordel, doubtlessly encouraged by local lords, tried to pass himself off as Baldwin I of Constantinople (the father of Jeanne of Flanders), who had disappeared at the battle of Adrianople. He pushed the counties of Flanders and Hainaut towards sedition against Jeanne in order to recover his land. She called her cousin, Louis VIII (\"The Lion\"). He unmasked the imposter, whom Countess Jeanne quickly had hanged. In 1226 the king agreed to free Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders. Count Ferrand died in 1233, and his daughter Marie soon after. In 1235, Jeanne granted a city charter by which city governors would be chosen each All Saint's Day by four commissioners chosen by the ruler. On 6 February 1236, she founded the Countess's Hospital (Hospice Comtesse), which remains one of the most beautiful buildings in Old Lille. It was in her honour that the hospital of the Regional Medical University of Lille was named \"Jeanne of Flanders Hospital\" in the 20th century.\nThe Countess died in 1244 in the Abbey of Marquette, leaving no heirs. The rule of Flanders and Hainaut thus fell to her sister, Margaret II, Countess of Flanders, then to Margaret's son, Guy of Dampierre. Lille fell under the rule of France from 1304 to 1369, after the Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305).\nThe county of Flanders fell to the Duchy of Burgundy next, after the 1369 marriage of Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, and Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Lille thus became one of the three capitals of said Duchy, along with Brussels and Dijon. By 1445, Lille counted some 25,000 residents. Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, was even more powerful than the King of France, and made Lille an administrative and financial capital.\nOn 17 February 1454, one year after the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, Philip the Good organised a Pantagruelian banquet at his Lille palace, the still-celebrated \"Feast of the Pheasant\". There the Duke and his court undertook an oath to Christianity.\nIn 1477, at the death of the last duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian of Austria, who thus became Count of Flanders.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\n\nThe 16th and the 17th centuries were marked by a boom in the regional textile industry, the Protestant revolts and outbreaks of the plague.\nLille came under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1519. The Low Countries fell to his eldest son, Philip II of Spain, in 1555. The city remained under Spanish Habsburg rule until 1668.\nCalvinism first appeared in the area in 1542, and by 1555, the authorities were taking steps to suppress that form of Protestantism. In 1566, the countryside around Lille was affected by the Iconoclastic Fury. In 1578, the Hurlus, a group of Protestant rebels, stormed the castle of the Counts of Mouscron. They were removed four months later by a Catholic Wallon regiment, and they tried several times between 1581 and 1582 to take the city of Lille, all in vain. The Hurlus were notably held back by the legendary Jeanne Maillotte. At the same time (1581), at the call of Elizabeth I of England, the north of the Seventeen Provinces, having gained a Protestant majority, successfully revolted and formed the Dutch Republic. The war brought or exacerbated periods of famine and plague (the last in 1667\u20131679).The first printer to set up shop in Lille was Antoine Tack in 1594. The 17th century saw the building of new institutions: an Irish College in 1610, a Jesuit college in 1611, an Augustinian college in 1622, almshouses or hospitals such as the Maison des Vieux hommes in 1624 and the Bonne et Forte Maison des Pauvres in 1661, and of a Mont-de-pi\u00e9t\u00e9 in 1626.Unsuccessful French attacks on the city were launched in 1641 and 1645. In 1667, Louis XIV of France (the Sun King) successfully laid siege to Lille, resulting in it becoming French in 1668 under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, provoking discontent among the citizens of the prosperous city. A number of important public works undertaken between 1667 and 1670, such as the Citadel (erected by Vauban), or the creation of the quartiers of Saint-Andr\u00e9 and la Madeleine, enabled the French king to gradually gain the confidence of his new subjects in Lille, some of whom continued to feel Flemish, but they had always spoken the Romance Picard language.\n\nFor five years, from 1708 to 1713, the city was occupied by the Dutch during the War of the Spanish Succession. Throughout the 18th century, Lille remained profoundly Catholic. It took little part in the French Revolution, but there were riots and the destruction of churches. In 1790, the city held its first municipal elections.\n\n\n=== Post-French Revolution ===\nIn 1792, in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the Austrians, then in the United Provinces, laid siege to Lille. The \"Column of the Goddess\", erected in 1842 in the \"Grand-Place\" (officially named Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle), is a tribute to the city's resistance, led by Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9-Bonte. Although Austrian artillery destroyed many houses and the main church of the city, the city did not surrender, and the Austrian Army left after eight days.\n\nThe city continued to grow and, by 1800, had some 53,000 residents, leading to Lille becoming the seat of the Nord d\u00e9partment in 1804. In 1846, a railway connecting Paris and Lille was built. In the early the 19th century, Napoleon I's continental blockade against the United Kingdom led to Lille's textile industry developing even more fully. The city was known for its cotton while the nearby towns of Roubaix and Tourcoing worked wool.  Leisure activities were thoroughly organised in 1858 for the 80,000 inhabitants.  Cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1,300, or one for every three houses. At that time the city counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations. Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets festivals and competitions. In 1853, Alexandre Desrousseaux composed his lullaby P'tit quinquin.\nIn 1858, Lille annexed the adjacent towns of Fives, Wazemmes, and Moulins. Lille's population was 158,000 in 1872, growing to over 200,000 by 1891. In 1896 Lille became the first city in France to be led by a socialist, Gustave Delory.\nBy 1912, Lille's population stood at 217,000. The city profited from the Industrial Revolution, particularly via coal and the steam engine. The entire region grew wealthy thanks to its mines and textile industry.\n\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nLille's occupation by the Germans began on 13 October 1914 after a ten-day siege and heavy shelling, which destroyed 882 apartment and office blocks and 1,500 houses, mostly around the railway station and in the centre. By the end of October, the city was being run by German authorities.\nBecause Lille was only 20 km from the battlefield, German troops passed through the city regularly on their way to and from the front. As a result, occupied Lille became a place for the hospitalisation and the treatment of wounded soldiers as well as a place for soldiers' relaxation and entertainment. Many buildings, homes and businesses were requisitioned to those ends.Lille was liberated by the Allies on 17 October 1918, when General Sir William Birdwood and his troops were welcomed by joyous crowds. The general was made an honorary citizen of the city of Lille on 28 October.\nThe only audio recording known to have been made during World War I was recorded near Lille in October 1918. The two-minute recording captured the Royal Garrison Artillery conducting a gas shell bombardment.Lille was also the hunting ground of the German World War I flying ace Max Immelmann, who was nicknamed \"the Eagle of Lille\".\n\n\n=== Ann\u00e9es Folles, Great Depression and Popular Front ===\n\nIn July 1921, at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin discovered the first anti-tuberculosis vaccine, known as BCG (\"Bacille de Calmette et Gu\u00e9rin\"). The Op\u00e9ra de Lille, designed by Lille architect Louis M. Cordonnier, was dedicated in 1923.\nFrom 1931, Lille felt the repercussions of the Great Depression, and by 1935, a third of the city's population lived in poverty. In 1936, the city's mayor, Roger Salengro, became Minister of the Interior of the Popular Front but eventually killed himself after right-wing groups led a slanderous campaign against him.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring the Battle of France, Lille was besieged by German forces for several days. When Belgium was invaded, the citizens of Lille, still haunted by the events of World War I, began to flee the city in large numbers. Lille was part of the zone under control of the German commander in Brussels, and was never controlled by the Vichy government in France. Lille was instead controlled under the military administration in Northern France. The d\u00e9partments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais (with the exception of the coast, notably Dunkirk) were for the most part liberated from 1 to 5 September 1944, by British, Canadian and Polish troops. On 3 September, German troops began to leave Lille out of fear of the British, who were on their way from Brussels. The city was liberated by a British force consisting largely of tanks.Rationing came to an end in 1947, and by 1948, normality had returned to Lille.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\n\nIn 1967, the Chambers of Commerce of Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing were joined, and in 1969< the Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Lille (Lille urban community) was created, linking 87 communes with Lille.\nThroughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the region was faced with some problems after the decline of the coal, mining and textile industries. From the early 1980s, the city began to turn itself more towards the service sector.\nIn 1983, the VAL, the world's first automated rapid transit underground network, opened. In 1993, a high-speed TGV train line was opened connecting Paris with Lille in one hour. This, with the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 and the arrival of the Eurostar train put Lille at the centre of a triangle connecting Paris, London and Brussels.\nWork on Euralille, an urban remodelling project, began in 1991. The Euralille Centre was opened in 1994, and the remodeled district is now full of parks and modern buildings containing offices, shops and apartments. In 1994 the \"Grand Palais\" was also opened for the general public, which is free for the public to enter on the first Sunday of every month.\nLille was chosen as European Capital of Culture in 2004, along with the Italian city of Genoa.\nLille and Roubaix were affected by the 2005 riots, like all of France's other urban centres.\nIn 2007 and again in 2010, Lille was awarded the label \"Internet City\".\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLille can be described as having a temperate oceanic climate; summers normally do not reach high average temperatures, but winters can fall below freezing temperatures, but with averages quite a bit above the freezing mark. Precipitation is plentiful year round.\nThe table below gives average temperatures and precipitation levels for the 1981-2010 reference period.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nLille is noted for its air pollution, with a 2018 study attributing 1,700 deaths per year in the agglomeration of Lille to pollution. In 2018, Lille held France's record pollution peaks.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nA former major mechanical, food industry and textile manufacturing centre as well as a retail and finance center, Lille is the largest city of a conurbation, built like a network of cities: Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing and Villeneuve d'Ascq. The conurbation forms the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille which is France's fourth-largest urban conglomeration with a 2016 population of over 1.15 million.\n\n\n=== Revenues and taxes ===\nFor centuries, Lille, a city of merchants, has displayed a wide range of incomes: great wealth and poverty have lived side by side, especially until the end of the 1800s. This contrast was noted by Victor Hugo in 1851 in his poem Les Ch\u00e2timents:  \u00ab Caves de Lille ! on meurt sous vos plafonds de pierre ! \u00bb (\"Cellars of Lille! We die under your stone ceilings!\")\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment in Lille has switched over half a century from a predominant industry to tertiary activities and services.\nServices account for 91% of employment in 2006.\n\nEmployment in Lille-Hellemmes-Lomme from 1968 to 2006\n\nEmployment per categories in 1968 and in 2006\n\nUnemployment in active population from 1968 to 2006\n\n\n=== Enterprises ===\nIn 2007, Lille hosts around 21,000 industry or service sites.\n\nEnterprises as per 31 December 2007\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nLille features an array of architectural styles with various amounts of Flemish influence, including the use of brown and red brick. In addition, many residential neighborhoods, especially in Greater Lille, consist of attached 2\u20133 story houses aligned in a row, with narrow gardens in the back. These architectural attributes, many uncommon in France, help make Lille a transition in France to neighboring Belgium, as well as nearby Netherlands and England, where the presence of brick, as well as row houses or the terraced house is much more prominent.\nPoints of interest include\n\nLille Cathedral (Basilique-cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame-de-la-Treille)\nCitadel of Lille\nPalais des Beaux-Arts de Lille\nJardin botanique de la Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie\nJardin botanique Nicolas Boulay\nJardin des Plantes de Lille\n\n\n=== La Braderie ===\n\nLille hosts an annual braderie on the first weekend in September. Its origins are thought to date back to the twelfth century and between two and three million visitors are drawn into the city. It is one of the largest gatherings of France and the largest flea market in Europe.\nMany of the roads in the inner city (including much of the old town) are closed and local shops, residents and traders set up stalls in the street.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille has a mixed mode public transport system, which is considered one of the most modern in the whole of France. It comprises buses, trams and a driverless light metro system, all of which are operated under the Transpole name. The Lille Metro is a VAL system (v\u00e9hicule automatique l\u00e9ger = light automated vehicle) that opened on 16 May 1983, becoming the first automatic light metro line in the world. The system has two lines, with a total length of 45 kilometres (28 miles) and 60 stations. The tram system consists of two interurban tram lines, connecting central Lille to the nearby communities of Roubaix and Tourcoing, and has 45 stops. 68 urban bus routes cover the metropolis, 8 of which reach into Belgium.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nLille is an important crossroads in the European high-speed rail network. It lies on the Eurostar line to London (1:20 hour journey). The French TGV network also puts it only 1 hour from Paris, 38 minutes from Brussels, and connects to other major centres in France such as Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse. Lille has two railway stations, which stand next door to one another: Lille-Europe station (Gare de Lille-Europe), which primarily serves high-speed trains and international services (Eurostar), and Lille-Flandres station (Gare de Lille-Flandres), which primarily serves lower speed regional trains and regional Belgian trains.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nFive autoroutes pass by Lille, the densest confluence of highways in France after Paris:\n\nAutoroute A27 : Lille \u2013 Tournai \u2013 Brussels / Li\u00e8ge \u2013 Germany\nAutoroute A23 : Lille \u2013 Valenciennes\nAutoroute A1  : Lille \u2013 Arras \u2013 Paris / Reims \u2013 Lyon / Orl\u00e9ans / Le Havre\nAutoroute A25 : Lille \u2013 Dunkirk \u2013 Calais \u2013 England / North Belgium\nAutoroute A22 : Lille \u2013 Antwerp \u2013 NetherlandsA sixth one \u2013 the proposed A24 \u2013 will link Amiens to Lille if built, but there is opposition to its route.\n\n\n=== Air traffic ===\nLille Lesquin International Airport is 15 minutes from the city centre by car (11 km). In terms of shipping, it ranks fourth, with almost 38,000 tonnes of freight which pass through each year. Its passenger traffic, around 1.2 million in 2010, is modest due to the proximity to Brussels, Charleroi, and Paris-CDG airports. The airport mostly connects other French and European cities (some with low-cost airlines).\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\n\nLille is the third-largest French river port after Paris and Strasbourg. The river De\u00fble is connected to regional waterways with over 680 km (423 mi) of navigable waters. The De\u00fble connects to Northern Europe via the River Scarpe and the River Scheldt (towards Belgium and the Netherlands), and internationally via the Lys River (to Dunkerque and Calais).\nShipping statistics\n\n\n== Education ==\nWith over 110,000 students, the metropolitan area of Lille is one of France's top student cities.\n\nWith roots back from 1562 to 1793 as University of Douai, (then as Universit\u00e9 Imp\u00e9riale in 1808), the State University of Lille was established in Lille in 1854 with Louis Pasteur as the first dean of its Faculty of Sciences. A school of medicine and an engineering school were also established in Lille in 1854; and the University of Lille was united as the association of existing public Faculties in 1896. It was then split into three independent university campuses in 1970: Lille 1 University of Science and Technology, Lille 2 University of Law and Health, and Lille 3 Charles de Gaulle University of Humanities, Social sciences, Literature and Arts.At the beginning of 2018, Lille 1, Lille 2 and Lille 3 merged to form the new University of Lille (student enrollment: 70,000).\nIt is part of the Community of Universities and Institutions (COMUE) Lille Nord de France and the European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France.\n\nThe Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech, an engineering graduate school of industrial and mechanical engineering, settled in Lille in 1900. This campus is one of the eight Teaching and Research Center (CER) of the school. Its creation was decided by Pierre-Nicolas Legrand de L\u00e9rant.\nEcole Centrale de Lille is one of the five Centrale Graduate Schools of engineering in France; it was founded in Lille city in 1854, its graduate engineering education and research center was established as Institut industriel du Nord (IDN) in 1872, in 1968 it moved in a modern campus in Lille suburb.\n\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de chimie de Lille was established as Institut de chimie de Lille in 1894 supporting chemistry research as followers of Kuhlmann's breakthrough works in Lille.\n\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de journalisme de Lille, journalism school created in 1924.\nSkema Business School established in 1892 is ranked among the top business schools in France.\n\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies settled in Lille in 2009.\nESME-Sudria and E-Artsup settled in Lille in 2012.\nThe ESA \u2013 \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Affaires is a Business Management school established in Lille in 1990.\nIEP Sciences-Po Lille political studies institute was established in Lille in 1992.\nThe Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action is also located in Lille.\nThe Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group) established in Lille in 1988.\nThe European Doctoral College Lille Nord de France is headquartered in Lille Metropolis and includes 3,000 PhD Doctorate students supported by university research laboratories.\nThe Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Lille was founded in 1875. Today it has law, economics, medicine, physics faculties and schools. Among the most famous is Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers (ICAM) founded in 1898, ranked 20th among engineering schools, with the specificity of graduating polyvalent engineers, Ecole des Hautes \u00e9tudes d'ing\u00e9nieur (HEI) a school of engineering founded in 1885 and offering 10 fields of specialization, \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes commerciales du nord (EDHEC) founded in 1906, IESEG School of Management founded in 1964 (17th place in the latest Financial Times global ranking of the 90 best masters in management, published on Monday 12 September 2016).  and Skema Business School currently ranked within the top 5, the top 10 and top 15 business schools in France, respectively. In 1924 ESJ \u2013 a leading journalism school \u2013 was established.\n\n\n== Notable people from Lille ==\n\n\n=== Writers ===\nJacquemart Gi\u00e9l\u00e9e (13th century), poet\nYvonne Chauffin (1905\u20131995), writer, winner of the 1970 edition of the Prix Breizh\nJean Prieur (1914\u20132008), writer and professor\n\n\n=== Scientists and mathematicians ===\n\n\n=== Artists ===\n\n\n=== Politicians, professionals and military ===\n\n\n=== Sportspeople ===\n\n\n== Media and sports ==\nLocal newspapers include Nord \u00e9clair and La Voix du Nord.\nFrance's national public television network has a channel that focuses on the local area: France 3 Nord-Pas-de-Calais\nThe city's most major association football club, Lille OSC, currently plays in Ligue 1, the highest level of football in France.

          "I went to visit this cathedral and this building is just amazing with incredible stained glasses. You can discovered 2 kinds of architecture In one building (Roman & gothic) which is not that common at all! You can also see some amazing pieces of art in this beautiful and",
          "Will not return and would not recommend. Dog mess everywhere - never been to a place like it. Can\u2019t look up at buildings or admire views due to the constant need to avoid dog mess all over the pavements. No other town or city in Belgium that I\u2019ve stayed in was like this. Why",
          "Pour destination, the valon city is not quite touristic but the centre is marvelous. Situated near the france border, the cathedral is visible from E52 highway, the reason i visited the city.",
          "What a magnificent site to behold. We have seen many Cathedrals in Europe (Mont san Michel, Notre Dame in Paris, Rouen, etc) but this one is truly special. Well worth the time spent in Tournai",
          "Seems to be under constant renovation, but worth a brief visit: I'm not sure if this is worth going out of your way to visit if you're staying in Brussels, probably best to stop in on the way to somewhere else, although there isn't luggage storage at the train station, it is",
          "A part of the outside still has scaffolding over it and part of the inside is boarded off so that you cannot see it all. However it is still worth visiting the cathedral as it is an active place of worship. There are a few interesting things in the cathedral such as the pulpit,",
          "Tournai is definitively worth visiting as a day-trip. The town is charming and I recommend to follow one of the 1-2 hours self walking tours recommended by the local tourist bureau, located behind the cathedral. The cathedral is impressive, not the range of Reims or Paris but",
          "This UNESCO World Heritage Site is without doubt one of the best preserved cathedrals in Northern Europe. Unlike its namesake in Paris, this church is built in a mix of Baroque, Gothic and Romanesque. As soon as you enter, the first thing to notice is one of the most impressive",
          "Huge church that is undergoing major repair inside and out. You can still go inside and see a couple of items, but most interior items are behind scaffolding, supports, or have been pulled down for restoration. It\u2019ll be worth a visit in a few years ...",
          "We visited this church on August 20. The cathedral is undergoing a big restoration, inside and outside. Before visiting the cathedral we advise to watch the movie about the history of the cathedral at the Tourism Office. Afterwards you can read the information boards placed",
          "So we compare on our way to lille and drove past the street this is on a had to have a look and was impressed. Nice place to reflect on our long roadtrip and even though there is scaffolding up you can go around the museum for\u20ac2.50 and theres alot of treasures within.",
          "Everything here - inside and outside - is under renovation. There\u2019s as much scaffolding as there is stained glass! It\u2019s still worth a tour. The Treasury is too - if you like tapestries or paintings or metalwork.",
          "Although part of the exterior and interior is covered in scaffolding, this cathedral is worth a detour. The interior is hardly enhanced by the rows of plastic chairs, but you have to be impressed by the sheer scale of the building. If you want to visit the treasury, for which",

        "wiki": "Euralille is an urban quarter in the centre of Lille, France. Conceived as a major European business district in the 1980s, it is strategically located at the intersection of the high-speed railway lines linking Paris, Brussels, and London, and incorporates the Gare de Lille Europe and Gare de Lille Flandres railway stations. The master plan was commissioned in 1988 to the Office of Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) led by Rem Koolhaas.\n\n\n== Masterplan ==\n\nThe masterplan comprised an area of 120 hectares, and proposed a program of 800,000 square metres of floor area for various urban activities, including shopping, offices, hotels and housing, a concert hall and a congress centre. The planned functional mix has been subject to change and in 2006 comprised 40% office, 20% residential and 40% amenities space.The masterplan defined several distinct areas: a mixed-use precinct comprising a shopping mall named Triangle des Gares designed by Jean Nouvel, the TGV station designed by Jean-Marie Duthilleul with two office towers above by architects Christian de Portzamparc and Claude Vasconi, a park designed by Gilles Cl\u00e9ment and a congress centre known as the Grand Palais designed by OMA. The masterplan also re-organized the infrastructure, a complicated junction of various transportation systems.The initial development area has been extended since 2000 by another 22 hectares, named Euralille 2.\n\n\n== Project development ==\nThe project was financed as a private-public partnership, established in 1990. The ambitious program was delayed in part because of the mid-1990s real-estate market crisis.The first phase of the project opened in 1994 and continued to expand in the following decade. After the Tour de Lille and Tour Lilleurope office towers were completed in 1995, the Suite H\u00f4tel was completed in 2005.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEspace Crois\u00e9 and Isabelle Menu (ed.)

          "enjoyed our brief look around this very large mall, usual stores on 4 levels clean and spacious and if you like shopping one to think about.(very good mark is purely on my wife's say so)",
          "Oh dire...This could be anywhere - Starbucks, Burger King, Primark, Body Shop, Lush, Levis, H&M...Le fast food, Culture de la celebrite...& the French were lapping it up...depressing! Strangely this mall doesn't open particularly early & on a Monday if you fancy an early coffee",
          "A large relatively new shopping mall. Many shops and a number of food outlets. Very modern over two sales floors. Was very busy just after lunchtime midweek.",
          "I can see in this shopping mall there are a lot of different shops that are interesting for children and as well as for teenagers and also for grown-ups",
          "Different stores in it ,, i did not see any ,, there is starbuck ,,,,,fast food in it ,,, Great mall",
          "This mall is very beautiful with wooden floors and modern architecture. Right in between the two main train stations in Lille, it is the perfect stop for a bite or some shopping. It has a large supermarket as well and a number of hotels that range all budgets on the buildings on",
          "We parked at the car park here. Parking was easy and price wasn't to bad for parking in the middle of the city centre. There was plenty of shops like most large shopping malls, and this one was no difference. It does get very crowded, and there is very little sitting, so if you",
          "Came here Saturday as part of a stay in Lille - heard a lot about it and we enjoyed Primark, Hollister and Pull and Bear amongst other shops. Quite good value for money as well. Only downside was that it was hugely overcrowded so would maybe recommend a limit on capacity by",
          "Large mall located within close proximity to Gare Lille Europe. Full of shops including fashion brands H&M, Hollister and Levi\u2019s. Huge hypermarket towards the rear exit containing all range of travel accessories.",

          "In size it is not very big but the shops itself are quite big! For Primark and Sephora fans I would recommend this place. I went on a saturday, before 2PM there was hardly any people. Beware between 2-6PM it is very crowded, and after 6PM it was quieter. We parked in the",
          "Levis is of course expensive, carefour is the best in prices. sport shop in 2nd floor is very nice you should visit. burger king is suitable for fast meal. LEGO, ZARA, H&M .. etc",
          "...what more can one say? It's possibly feels slightly more spacious and less oppressive than some - but the shops are the same global brands that you'll find in any shopping centre anywhere in the 'civilised' world. The eating places on the ground floor may be slightly better",
          "Not much wrong with this place, it's a very chic shopping experience. Most of the top brands can be found here. It's large, busy, plenty to buy and plenty to eat. If you love shopping, you'll love Eurolille. The only small downside is the smell of fish around Carrefour!!",
          "A temple to modern retail therapy, particularly amongst the youth of today, and only for the most hardened cultural tourist. Seriously, France is increasingly imitating other western countries with these kinds of retail meccas. This one is large, bright, clean, modern, and with",
          "It's a massive shopping centre with a big Carrefour (useful) and all the normal shops you find in every other shopping centre. Cool on a hot day. Closed on a Sunday.",
          "One of the nicest shopping malls I\u2019ve been to in France. It\u2019s right next to the two trains stations so you can miss it when arriving in Lille. The mall itself is huge, with lots of shops. If you like fashion, it\u2019s the right place for you, you can find almost every shop here.",

          "If you go to Lille by car expect rather small parking, not easy to access with an SUV. However, there is the parking of the Euralille. Very spacious, clean and clear, and easy to access from the highway, being at the same time in the middle of the city, so you can use it",
          "Like many cities in France are the streets also in Lille dirty. Lots of garbage on the streets, low maintenance, ... So when we entered the shopping mall, it was like a breath of fresh air! Extremely clean, security everywhere, cozy corners, all The necessary facilities (Mobil",
          "There is nothing special about this huge mall but it does provide a big opportunity to shop for virtually anything you want. On a number floors it has all the big names and some not so well known. There's a large Primark here and a huge Carrefour too - good for buying food and",
          "A typical shopping mall, nothing really sticks out as special. Plenty of shops with the standard names.",
          "A clean and warm place to wander around and shop, good range of shops from expensive to cheap. Particularly full of shoe shops and make up/beauty stores. Right next to Lille Europe and Gare de Flandres stations and a short walk from the town centre. Missing out on 5 stars",
          "The mall is clean and has a large amount of retail and food options. Carrefour is also in the mall with everything you would need. Good facilities, close to town and between both flandres and Gare Europe stations.",
          "You'll be spoilt for choice here. We went at Xmas time and it was super busy but, so convenient from the Eurostar train station, less than a 5min walk away.",
          "A typical shopping mall with typical shops, a few local exceptions. They have a small playground for little children.",
          "Stopped off at Euralille en route to Belgium to shop at Carrefour and have lunch at Paul. There is no doubt it is a very large space and has a lot of well known shops done in the traditional excellent way the French do their malls. Carrefour was a little dated with a confusing",
          "The Mall is very well located, next to the train station and is very clean and modern. There is security as you enter and also throughout the Mall; commonplace now in France. As with most Malls they cater more to a young crowd although we did find some stores such as Desigual",
          "We stayed in a hotel which was a 2 minute walk away from the mall. It is very large and has a wide range of shops and restaurants. It has a modern and pleasant feel about it. Expect a security check if you are carrying any sort of bag as is the norm in France today.",
          "This big mall is quite chick. It has many shops and several restaurants, and if you have nothing to do, you can easily expend a couple of hours (or more) walking, eating and shopping around. Besides, it is very new and nice.",
          "Good selection of shops and quality restaurants . Ideal place to kill time while waiting for train connection . Just a view minute from Lille Europe for Eurostar and Lille Flanders station.",
          "I think that this mall is good because it has a lot of good, child friendly shops and excellent teenager style shops. The only bad thing is that most of the mannequins are very \"detailed\" as in they have very realistic breasts.",
          "Great place to shop . Right near by the Eurostar . Has cafes and places to eat shops like disugle and pull and bear, h & m and so many more. Most shop have their sale on which seams to be good pricing , some can be more expensive than home you just need to look out for",
          "Usual brands, very clean, nice layout. Unlike many other shopping malls security is good. Good selection of restaurants",

          "If you are a shopping lover (unlike me), this might be paradise. All the main brands you can find here with large shops. For me it was just another mall with many many shops!",
          "Modern addition to an olde worlde town. Nice place to hang out with good security on all the entrances (bag checks, etc), and no beggars to bother you, as there are in the town itself. Good selection of shops, restaurants, home wares, sports, beauty and jewellery outlets.",
          "Modern style, spacious mall. Good variety of shops and food outlets. Very close to public transport and the stylish inner city of Lille. Large parking garage with lots of space available, easily accessible form the highway / Lille ring road.",
          "Biggest shopping centre in Lille in the heart of the city. Spent most of our time in the massive Carrefour though.",
          "Euralille Mall is okay but distinctly average inside with a range of chain stores, eateries which could be anywhere in France but externally the building is striking in parts like many of the new structures in Lille.",
          "Great shops and very nice interior. Well organized and many places to relax, even places to charge phones in the open areas.",
          "Euralille offered a great selection of shops and includes a huge Carrefour. We went to escape the rain but ended up leaving with a lot of bags! There were a few places to eat but not as many as might be expected for the a centre of it's size. Euralille offers free WiFi and",

          "This shopping centre is between Lille Flandres and Lille Europe railway stations. It's split on a number of levels but it's very well laid out and easy to get about. There's some really nice shops where you can spend a lot of money quite easily. There are also places to eat and",
          "Really nice place to pass an hour plenty of shops but like France its really expensive. There is a lot of shops and a nice place to go if you are stuck on a rainy day. The center is clean and well maintained with lots of places to eat close to all the cities transports as well.",
          "Modern mall very well designed - the mall is so airy one can see natural daylight from the -2 parking lot! Lots of nice stores - good buy can be made, especially during the \"p\u00e9riode de soldes\" (sales period). There is no designated food court, but many food stores here and there",
          "I've been coming to Lille to work on and off for the last ten years, and this shopping mall has received quite a few visits from me. It has always been fairly average as far as shopping malls go, but it's recent facelift is a marked improvement. Very clean and airy with plenty",
          "Nice place to shop although the prices are so much higher than here. Clean and well maintained throughout. My only beef is the whole place is shut on Sunday. Massive Carrefour at the back for an absorbing shopping experience!",
          "Nice shops, but not even the security guards speak English. Bad signing, easy to get lost in a big mall like that. Good for quick shopping.",
          "There are many nice shops in this Mall as well as a Post Office.A large Carrefour Supermarket is also in evidence.As to restuarants there are many choices some open early to catch the breakfast trade whilst others open at 11a.m. The newly opened Burger King has very long queues",
          "They are doing a complete make-over of the mall so it looked more like a construction site when we visited but the shops were all open and the place was clean. Easy to reach by car or train and a huge!",
          "I wouldn't set aside time especially for this mall. However, it's ideal for those who want to wander around somewhere close to the station while waiting for departure. There's a wide selection if restaurants and snack shops. Renovations are underway so hopefully it'll be more",
          "It's a great mall, specially for young people and foreigner students. It has a Carrefour there, so you can save a lot with groceries and also a Zara and a H&M, where you can find good deals for clothes. There are also good places to have some snacks, like Quick and Subway.",
          "This shopping centre has a mixture of high street names and independents. On a rainy day somewhere to escape to but very much every day shops. The overall appearance is dated and dark however it appears they are refurbishing at the moment. Highlight for us was Carrefour.",
          "Other reviewers are right, this shopping centre is short on charm, but on a grey and wet afternoon you can do a lot worse than a browse round its shops or getting lost in the enormous Carrefour - an entertaining activity for any Brit abroad.",
          "If you enjoy modern shopping complexes then this may be for you but it did nothing for me. Loads of shops but none of the character that the city has to over. I suppose it's convenient for the Eurostar station and local hotels, but to be honest you get the same shops in the uk",
          "Worth a quick walk through this big mall located between the two main Lille railway stations. Generous scale of walkways with little or no clutter. Downside to this is a definite lack of character and colour, even if it is artificial and manufactured. The Carrefour is the",
          "I do love a shopping mall, and one in a foreign country always excites me but this often leaves me a little flat. There are a fairly good mix of shops, H & M, The Lego Store and plenty of reasonably priced shoe shops but its a bit like shopping at home. The are some good clothes",
          "Well worth a glide through. Nice range of shops and as usual in France especially bread cakes,and confectionary. We were only passing through station to station so finding a nice mall was a nice surprise. Lille is fun a real mix of old and new. A Logan's run feel around the",
          "Good mall,great Carrefour. Excellent prices for antipasti and cheese for Christmas.Lots of small shops,not just the usual chains",
          "Euralille very popular shopping mall and fairly busy. Other Hypermarkets outside of Lille much larger and have more choice but in general Euralille very good for in town shopping",
          "We have been to his Mall twice now and cannot say that I would make a definite point of going again. The shops are very 'samey' (mostly clothing) with a few fast food places. It served a purpose of getting us out of the rain for an hour but I think the shops at Cite Europe",
          "Carrefour, then other designer shops for clothes, bags, sports shop, mobile, phone connection, bakery, snacks shop take away, Belgium chocolate, watches, etc.. Nice to sit between Euralille Mall and Lille Europe Station with sacks to munch.",
          "This is a fantastic mall. It has a lot of designer shops that you would not find in the UK malls. It is right next to the Lille Eurail Station. The only drawback is that if you need to go to the loos/toilets, you have to pay for it. This is unheard of here in the UK malls,",
          "Euralille Mall is just one more shopping centre. Withing 10 minutes walk is an extensive old town, with a better atmosphere and more interesting shops & cafes."

        "wiki": "Ghent (; Dutch: Gent, [\u0263\u025bnt] (listen); French: Gand, [\u0261\u0251\u0303] (listen); traditional English: Gaunt) is a city and a municipality in the Flemish Region of Belgium. It is the capital and largest city of the East Flanders province, and the third largest in the country, exceeded in size only by Brussels and Antwerp. It is a port and university city.\nThe city originally started as a settlement at the confluence of the Rivers Scheldt and Leie and in the Late Middle Ages became one of the largest and richest cities of northern Europe, with some 50,000 people in 1300.\nThe municipality comprises the city of Ghent proper and the surrounding suburbs of Afsnee, Desteldonk, Drongen, Gentbrugge, Ledeberg, Mariakerke, Mendonk, Oostakker, Sint-Amandsberg, Sint-Denijs-Westrem, Sint-Kruis-Winkel, Wondelgem and Zwijnaarde. With 262,219 inhabitants at the beginning of 2019, Ghent is Belgium's second largest municipality by number of inhabitants. The metropolitan area, including the outer commuter zone, covers an area of 1,205 km2 (465 sq mi) and has a total population of 560,522 as of 1 January 2018, which ranks it as the fourth most populous in Belgium. The current mayor of Ghent, Mathias De Clercq is from the liberal & democratic party Open VLD.\nThe ten-day-long Ghent Festival (Gentse Feesten in Dutch) is held every year and attended by about 1\u20131.5 million visitors.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nArchaeological evidence shows human presence in the region of the confluence of Scheldt and Leie going back as far as the Stone Age and the Iron Age.Most historians believe that the older name for Ghent, 'Ganda', is derived from the Celtic word ganda which means confluence. Other sources connect its name with an obscure deity named Gontia.There are no written records of the Roman period, but archaeological research confirms that the region of Ghent was further inhabited.\nWhen the Franks invaded the Roman territories from the end of the 4th century and well into the 5th century, they brought their language with them and Celtic and Latin were replaced by Old Dutch.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nAround 650, Saint Amand founded two abbeys in Ghent: St. Peter's (Blandinium) and Saint Bavo's Abbey. Around 800, Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne, appointed Einhard, the biographer of Charlemagne, as abbot of both abbeys. The city grew from several nuclei, the abbeys and a commercial centre. However, both in 851 and 879, the city was plundered  by the Vikings.\n\nWithin the protection of the County of Flanders, the city recovered and flourished from the 11th century, growing to become a small city-state. By the 13th century, Ghent was the biggest city in Europe north of the Alps after Paris; it was bigger than Cologne or Moscow. Within the city walls lived up to 65,000 people. The belfry and the towers of the Saint Bavo Cathedral and Saint Nicholas' Church are just a few examples of the skyline of the period.\nThe rivers flowed in an area where much land was periodically flooded. These rich grass 'meersen' (\"water-meadows\": a word related to the English 'marsh') were ideally suited for herding sheep, the wool of which was used for making cloth. During the Middle Ages Ghent was the leading city for cloth.\nThe wool industry, originally established at Bruges, created the first European industrialized zone in Ghent in the High Middle Ages. The mercantile zone was so highly developed that wool had to be imported from Scotland and England. This was one of the reasons for Flanders' good relationship with Scotland and England. Ghent was the birthplace of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. Trade with England (but not Scotland) suffered significantly during the Hundred Years' War.\n\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nThe city recovered in the 15th century, when Flanders was united with neighbouring provinces under the Dukes of Burgundy. High taxes led to a rebellion and eventually the Battle of Gavere in 1453, in which Ghent suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of Philip the Good. Around this time the centre of political and social importance in the Low Countries started to shift from Flanders (Bruges\u2013Ghent) to Brabant (Antwerp\u2013Brussels), although Ghent continued to play an important role. With Bruges, the city led two revolts against Maximilian of Austria, the first monarch of the House of Habsburg to rule Flanders.\n\nIn 1500, Juana of Castile gave birth to Charles V, who became Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Although native to Ghent, he punished the city after the 1539 Revolt of Ghent and obliged the city's nobles to walk in front of the Emperor barefoot with a noose (Dutch: \"strop\") around the neck; since this incident, the people of Ghent have been called \"Stroppendragers\" (noose bearers). Saint Bavo Abbey (not to be confused with the nearby Saint Bavo Cathedral) was abolished, torn down, and replaced with a fortress for Royal Spanish troops. Only a small portion of the abbey was spared demolition.\nThe late 16th and the 17th centuries brought devastation because of the Eighty Years' War. The war ended the role of Ghent as a centre of international importance. In 1745, the city was captured by French forces during the War of the Austrian Succession before being returned to the Empire of Austria under the House of Habsburg following the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when this part of Flanders became known as the Austrian Netherlands until 1815, the exile of the French Emperor Napoleon I, the end of the French Revolutionary and later Napoleonic Wars and the peace treaties arrived at by the Congress of Vienna.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the textile industry flourished again in Ghent. Lieven Bauwens, having smuggled the industrial and factory machine plans out of England, introduced the first mechanical weaving machine on the European continent in 1800.\nThe Treaty of Ghent, negotiated here and adopted on Christmas Eve 1814, formally ended the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States (the North American phase of the Napoleonic Wars). After the Battle of Waterloo, Ghent and Flanders, previously ruled from the House of Habsburg in Vienna as the Austrian Netherlands, became a part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands with the northern Dutch for 15 years. In this period, Ghent established its own university (1816) and a new connection to the sea (1824\u201327).\nAfter the Belgian Revolution, with the loss of port access to the sea for more than a decade, the local economy collapsed and the first Belgian trade union originated in Ghent. In 1913 there was a world exhibition in Ghent. As a preparation for these festivities, the Sint-Pieters railway station was completed in 1912.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nGhent was occupied by the Germans in both World Wars but escaped severe destruction. The life of the people and the German invaders in Ghent during World War I is described by H. Wandt in \"etappenleven te Gent\". In World War II the city was liberated by the British 7th \"Desert Rats\" Armoured Division and local Belgian fighters on 6 September 1944.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAfter the fusions of municipalities in 1965 and 1977, the city is made up of:\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, Ghent has a marine west coast climate, abbreviated \"Cfb\" on climate maps.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nGhent is home to a large number of people of foreign origin and immigrants. From the 2019 census, it was concluded that 34.3% of the inhabitants have roots outside of Belgium and 14.5% have a non-Belgian nationality.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n \nMuch of the city's medieval architecture remains intact and is remarkably well preserved and restored. Its centre is a carfree area. Highlights are the Saint Bavo Cathedral with the Ghent Altarpiece, the belfry, the Gravensteen castle, and the splendid architecture along the old Graslei harbour. Ghent has established a blend between comfort of living and history; it is not a city-museum. The city of Ghent also houses three b\u00e9guinages and numerous churches including Saint-Jacob's church, Saint-Nicolas' church, Saint Michael's church and St. Stefanus.\n\n \nIn the 19th century Ghent's most famous architect, Louis Roelandt, built the university hall Aula, the opera house and the main courthouse. Highlights of modern architecture are the university buildings (the Boekentoren or Book Tower) by Henry Van de Velde. There are also a few theatres from diverse periods.\nThe beguinages, as well as the belfry and adjacent cloth hall, were recognized by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites in 1998 and 1999.\nThe Zebrastraat, a social experiment in which an entirely renovated site unites living, economy and culture, can also be found in Ghent.\nCampo Santo is a famous Catholic burial site of the nobility and artists.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nImportant museums in Ghent are the Museum voor Schone Kunsten (Museum of Fine Arts), with paintings by Hieronymus Bosch, Peter Paul Rubens, and many Flemish masters; the SMAK or Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (City Museum for Contemporary Art), with works of the 20th century, including Joseph Beuys and Andy Warhol; and the Design Museum Gent with masterpieces of Victor Horta and Le Corbusier. The Huis van Alijn (House of the Alijn family) was originally a beguinage and is now a museum for folk art where theatre and puppet shows for children are presented. The Museum voor Industri\u00eble Archeologie en Textiel or MIAT displays the industrial strength of Ghent with recreations of workshops and stores from the 1800s and original spinning and weaving machines that remain from the time when the building was a weaving mill. The Ghent City Museum (Stadsmuseum, abbreviated STAM), is committed to recording and explaining the city's past and its inhabitants, and to preserving the present for future generations.\n\n\n=== Restaurants and culinary traditions ===\nIn Ghent and other regions of East-Flanders, bakeries sell a donut-shaped bun called a \"mastel\" (plural \"mastellen\"), which is basically a bagel. \"Mastellen\" are also called \"Saint Hubert bread\", because on the Saint's feast day, which is 3 November, the bakers bring their batches to the early Mass to be blessed. Traditionally, it was thought that blessed mastellen immunized against rabies.\nOther local delicacies are the praline chocolates from local producers such as Leonidas, the cuberdons or 'neuzekes' ('noses'), cone-shaped purple jelly-filled candies, 'babelutten' ('babblers'), hard butterscotch-like candy, and of course, on the more fiery side, the famous 'Tierenteyn', a hot but refined mustard that has some affinity to French 'Dijon' mustard.\nStoverij is a classic Flemish meat stew, preferably made with a generous addition of brown 'Trappist' (strong abbey beer) and served with French fries. 'Waterzooi' is a local stew originally made from freshwater fish caught in the rivers and creeks of Ghent, but nowadays often made with chicken instead of fish. It is usually served nouvelle-cuisine-style, and will be supplemented by a large pot on the side.\nThe city promotes a meat-free day on Thursdays called Donderdag Veggiedag with vegetarian food being promoted in public canteens for civil servants and elected councillors, in all city funded schools, and promotion of vegetarian eating options in town (through the distribution of \"veggie street maps\"). This campaign is linked to the recognition of the detrimental environmental effects of meat production, which the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization has established to represent nearly one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe traditional confectionery is the cuberdon (also known as neuzekes or little noses). These are conical sweets with a soft centre, usually raspberry but other flavours can be found on the many street stalls around the city. Between 2011 and 2015 a feud between two local vendors made international news.\n\n\n=== Festivities ===\nThe city is host to some big cultural events such as the Gentse Feesten, I Love Techno in Flanders Expo, the \"10 Days Off\" musical festival, the International Film Festival of Ghent (with the World Soundtrack Awards) and the Gent Festival van Vlaanderen. Also, every five years, an extensive botanical exhibition (Gentse Florali\u00ebn) takes place in Flanders Expo in Ghent, attracting numerous visitors to the city.\nThe Festival of Flanders had its 50th celebration in 2008. In Ghent it opens with the OdeGand City festivities that takes place on the second Saturday of September. Some 50 concerts take place in diverse locations throughout the medieval inner city and some 250 international artists perform. Other major Flemish cities hold similar events, all of which form part of the Festival of Flanders (Antwerp with Laus Polyphoniae; Bruges with MAfestival; Brussels with KlaraFestival; Limburg with Basilica, Mechelen and Brabant with Novecento and Transit).\nThe city of Ghent will co-host the 2020 World Choir Games together with the city of Antwerp. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation, the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n\n=== Nature ===\nThe numerous parks in the city can also be considered tourist attractions. Most notably, Ghent boasts a nature reserve (Bourgoyen-Ossemeersen, 230 hectare) and a recreation park (Blaarmeersen, 87 hectares).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe port of Ghent, in the north of the city, is the third largest port of Belgium. It is accessed by the Ghent\u2013Terneuzen Canal, which ends near the Dutch port of Terneuzen on the Western Scheldt. The port houses, among others, large companies like ArcelorMittal, Volvo Cars, Volvo Trucks, Volvo Parts, Honda, and Stora Enso.\nThe Ghent University and a number of research oriented companies, such as Ablynx, Innogenetics, Cropdesign and Bayer Cropscience, are situated in the central and southern part of the city.\nAs the largest city in East Flanders, Ghent has many hospitals, schools and shopping streets. Flanders Expo, the biggest event hall in Flanders and the second biggest in Belgium, is also located in Ghent. Tourism is becoming a major employer in the local area.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nAs one of the largest cities in Belgium, Ghent has a highly developed transport system.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nBy car the city is accessible via two motorways:\n\nThe E40 connects Ghent with Bruges and Ostend to the west, and with Brussels, Leuven and Li\u00e8ge to the east.\nThe E17 connects Ghent with Sint-Niklaas and Antwerp to the north, and with Kortrijk and Lille to the south.In addition Ghent also has two ringways:\n\nThe R4 connects the outskirts of Ghent with each other and the surrounding villages, and also leads to the E40 and E17 roads.\nThe R40 connects the different downtown quarters with each other and provides access to the main avenues.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe municipality of Ghent comprises five railway stations:\n\nGent-Sint-Pieters Station: an international railway station with connections to Bruges, Brussels, Antwerp, Kortrijk, other Belgian towns and Lille. The station also offers a direct connection to Brussels Airport.\nGent-Dampoort Station: an intercity railway station with connections to Sint-Niklaas, Antwerp, Kortrijk and Eeklo.\nGentbrugge Station: a regional railway station in between the two main railway stations, Sint-Pieters and Dampoort.\nWondelgem Station: a regional railway station with connections to Eeklo once an hour.\nDrongen Station: a regional railway station in the village of Drongen with connections to Bruges once an hour.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nGhent has an extensive network of public transport lines, operated by De Lijn.\n\n\n==== Trams ====\n\nLine 1: Flanders Expo \u2013 Sint-Pieters-Station \u2013 Korenmarkt (city centre) \u2013 Wondelgem \u2013 Evergem\nLine 2: Zwijnaarde Bibliotheek \u2013 Sint-Pieters-Station \u2013 Zonnestraat (city centre) \u2013 Brabantdam \u2013 Zuid \u2013 Melle Leeuw (fuse of line 21 and 22 as of May 2017)\nLine 4: UZ \u2013 Sint-Pieters-Station \u2013 Muide \u2013 Korenmarkt (city centre) \u2013 Zuid \u2013 Moscou\nLine 21: Zwijnaarde Bibliotheek \u2013 Sint-Pieters-Station \u2013 Zonnestraat (city centre) \u2013 Zuid \u2013 Melle Leeuw (fused into line 2)\nLine 22: Kouter \u2013 Bijlokehof \u2013 Sint-Pieters-Station \u2013 Zonnestraat (city centre) \u2013 Zuid \u2013 Gentbrugge (fused into line 2)\n\n\n==== Buses ====\n\nLine 3: Mariakerke \u2013 Korenmarkt (city centre) \u2013 Dampoort \u2013 Gentbrugge (formerly a trolleybus line; see picture below)\nLine 5: Van Beverenplein \u2013 Sint-Jacobs (city centre) \u2013 Zuid \u2013 Heuvelpoort \u2013 Nieuw-Gent\nLine 6: Watersportbaan \u2013 Zuid \u2013 Dampoort \u2013 Meulestede \u2013 Wondelgem \u2013 Mariakerke\nLine 8: AZ Sint-Lucas \u2013 Sint-Jacobs (city centre) \u2013 Zuid \u2013 Heuvelpoort \u2013 Arteveldepark\nLine 9: Mariakerke \u2013 Malem \u2013 Sint-Pieters-Station \u2013 Ledeberg \u2013 Gentbrugge\nLine 17/18: Drongen \u2013 Malem \u2013 Korenmarkt (city centre) \u2013 Dampoort \u2013 Oostakker\nLine 38/39: Blaarmeersen \u2013 Ekkergem -Korenmarkt (city centre) \u2013 Dampoort \u2013 Sint-AmandsbergApart from the city buses mentioned above, Ghent also has numerous regional bus lines connecting it to towns and villages across the province of East Flanders. All of these buses stop in at least one of the city's regional bus hubs at either Sint-Pieters Station, Dampoort Station, Zuid or Rabot.\nInternational buses connecting Ghent to other European destinations are usually found at the Dampoort Station. A couple of private bus companies such as Eurolines, Megabus and Flixbus operate from the Dampoort bus hub.\nBuses to and from Belgium's second airport \u2013 Brussels South Airport Charleroi \u2013 are operated by Flibco, and can be found at the rear exit of the Sint-Pieters Station.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nGhent has the largest designated cyclist area in Europe, with nearly 400 kilometres (250 mi) of cycle paths and more than 700 one-way streets, where bikes are allowed to go against the traffic. It also boasts Belgium's first cycle street, where cars are considered \u2018guests\u2019 and must stay behind cyclists. In 2017 the city restricted car traffic circulation which boosts cycling. More cyclists means a higher demand for bicycle parking stations. In 2010, the plans to renovate Gent-Sint-Pieters railway station, included 10,000 bicycle parking spots. In 2020 several sections of the underground parking facilities have been build, and the targets have been adjusted to a total of 17,000 parking spots.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nIn the Belgian first football division Ghent is represented by K.A.A. Gent, who became Belgian football champions for the first time in its history in 2015. Another Ghent football club is KRC Gent-Zeehaven, playing in the Belgian fourth division.

The horse racing track was about seven to eight furlongs or a mile.In 1960, the course was redeveloped to celebrate Nigeria's independence and the lowering of the union jack.\n\n\n== Location ==\nTBS was constructed in 1972 over the site of a defunct rack for horse racing. It is bounded by Awolowo road, Cable Street, Force road, Catholic Mission street and the 26-storey independence building.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\nThe entrance to the square has gigantic sculptures of four white horses hovering above the gate and seven red eagles, which are symbols from the national emblem signifying Strength and Dignity respectively. Other monuments in the square include the Remembrance Arcade 1(with memorials to World War I, World War II and Nigerian civil war victims) and the 26-storey Independence House, built in 1963 which was for a long time, the tallest building in Nigeria.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe square has a capacity for 50,000 people. Facilities at the square include a shopping center, Airline's Travel Agencies, restaurants and car parking and a bus terminal.\n\n\n== Historical Events ==\nMajor national events at TBS  includes Nigeria\u2019s independence celebration which took place on  1 October 1960 with the Prime Minister, Tafawa Balewa, delivering his speech.

The foundation stone was laid by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) on 21 April 1925. It was completed in 1946.\nIn 1976 the relics of Rev Dr Samuel Ajayi Crowther, a former Yoruba slave who became the first African bishop in the Anglican Church, were translated to the cathedral. There is a cenotaph erected as a memorial of him.It is popularly known as the Cathedral Church of Christ Marina, and is the oldest Anglican cathedral in the Church of Nigeria. At various times in its history, the cathedral was the seat of the archbishop of the Province of West Africa, the seat of the archbishop and primate of All Nigeria and the seat of the archbishop of the Ecclesiastical Province of Lagos. It is currently the seat of the Bishop of Lagos.\nThe organ was built by Oberlinger Orgelbau, Germany on right side of the altar with two fa\u00e7ades - one looking to the altar and second looking to the right nave. One of the sections, Antiphonal, is located at the organ loft above the main entrance to the church. At the beginning of 21st century the whole instrument was renewed (and console rebuilt) by English company Harrison & Harrison; it consists 64 stops on 4 manuals and a pedalboard. It is the largest organ in Nigeria.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Eko Atlantic, officially Nigeria International Commerce city, also known as Eko Atlantic City, or the initials E.A.C. and E.A., is a planned city of Lagos State, Nigeria, being constructed on land reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean. Upon completion, the new peninsula is anticipating at least 250,000 residents and a daily flow of 150,000 commuters.  The development is also designed to help in stopping the erosion of Lagos State's coastline.The city adjoins Victoria Island district of Lagos city, and the Phase 1 area of Lekki to the north, while the entire Western, eastern and southern borders is a coastline. Eko Atlantic is expected to rise as the next generation of property on the African continent; having a total of 10 districts, spread across a land area of approximately 10 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi), the city will satisfy needs for financial, commercial, residential and tourist accommodations.Eko Atlantic development is being carried out as a Public\u2013private partnership, with private companies and investors providing the funding, whilst Lagos State Government is a strategic partner, with the support of the Federal Government. The Contractors are China Communications Construction Group, a company that works in the field of marine dredging and landfill operation. Consultants are Royal Haskoning (traffic and transport expertise) and ar+h Architects. South Energyx Nigeria Ltd., a subsidiary of the Chagoury group, was specifically created to undertake the development. Testing of the sea defence system took place at the DHI Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark, where models were successfully tested for one-in-a-hundred-year ocean surges, and one-in-120-year, one-in-150-year and one-in-1,000-year storms.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nEko Atlantic will satisfy needs for financial, commercial, residential and tourist accommodations, with infrastructure in line with modern and environmental standards. These standards will offer the city\u2019s residents water, waste management, security and transportation systems. The city will also have an independent source of energy generated specifically for the city.The Eko Atlantic City project received global attention in 2009, as the Lagos State Government and its private sector partners on the Project, South Energyx, received the Clinton Global Initiative Commitment Certificate.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nEko Atlantic is master-planned to contain ten districts which are as follows:\n\nHarbour Lights\nBusiness District\nMarina\nDowntown\nEko Island\nAvenues\nFour Bridges\nEko Drive\nEast Side Marina\nOcean Front\n\n\n== Milestones ==\n\nAs of May 2009, while the project was still in its dredging phase, about 3,000,000 cubic metres (3,900,000 cu yd) have been sand-filled and placed in the reclamation area, while about 35,000 tonnes of rock have been delivered to the site.  In certain parts of Bar Beach, the land being reclaimed can already be seen. Dredgers are working around the clock to fill the site with sand.\nOn 21 February 2013, a dedication ceremony was held at the reclaimed land of Eko Atlantic, with Goodluck Jonathan, Bill Clinton, Babatunde Fashola, Bola Tinubu, Aminu Tambuwal, and Ibikunle Amosun attending.In March 2014, David Frame, managing director of South Energyx Nigeria Ltd., the firm responsible for the development, confirmed that \"The first residential tower will open in 2016\".\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nThe Eko Atlantic project has been criticised by local residents living nearby, saying that ongoing construction works have caused coastal erosion and ocean surges; as ocean water surges through living areas, flooding access roads and taking down electricity poles and forcing residents to relocate. The Lagos State Government is also being criticised for failing to involve the people in the project.In August 2012, the Atlantic Ocean surged and overflowed its banks, sweeping 16 people into the Atlantic Ocean, killing several people and flooding Kuramo Beach, Victoria Island and other areas. According to an environmental expert, \"the ocean surge occurred as a result of the failure of the contractors handling the sandfilling activities of the proposed Atlantic Ocean City, to put in place measure that would reduce the effect of the surge on the environment\". The Lagos State chapter of the People's Democratic Party issued an official statement, blaming the ACN now APC  led state government's sand filling for the ocean surge. The party called for a stop to the Eko Atlantic project and immediate compensation to the bereaved families.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEko Pearl Towers\nCentenary City\nLekki\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBrown, Brad (5 June 2012). \"Nigeria's most populous state poised to become a metropolis\".

        "wiki": "Lagos (, US also ; Yoruba: \u00c8k\u00f3) is the most populous city in Nigeria and all of Africa. Lagos is a major financial centre for all of Africa and is the economic hub of Lagos State. The megacity has the fourth-highest GDP in Africa and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports on the continent. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world.Lagos initially emerged as a port city that originated on a collection of islands, which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos Island, Eti-Osa, Amuwo-Odofin and Apapa. The islands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon, while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach, which stretch up to 100 km (62 mi) east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanization, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland, Ajeromi-Ifelodun and Surulere. This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the Island, which was the initial city of Lagos, before it expanded into the area known as the Mainland. This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council, until the creation of Lagos State in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the then Western Region to form the state.Lagos, the capital of Nigeria since its amalgamation in 1914, went on to become the capital of Lagos State after its creation. However, the state capital was later moved to Ikeja in 1976, and the federal capital moved to Abuja in 1991. Even though Lagos is still widely referred to as a city, the present day Lagos, also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\", and officially as \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\" is an urban agglomeration or conurbation, consisting of 16 LGAs including Ikeja, the state capital of Lagos State. This conurbation makes up 37% of Lagos State's total land area, but houses about 85% of the state's total population.The exact population of Metropolitan Lagos is disputed. In the 2006 federal census data, the conurbation had a population of about 8 million people. However, the figure was disputed by the Lagos State Government, which later released its own population data, putting the population of Lagos Metropolitan Area at approximately 16 million. As of 2015, unofficial figures put the population of \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\", which includes Lagos and its surrounding metro area, extending as far as into Ogun State, at approximately 21 million.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLagos was originally inhabited by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba people in the 15th century. Under the leadership of the Oloye Olofin, the Awori moved to an island now called Iddo and then to the larger Lagos Island. In the 16th century, the Awori settlement was conquered by the Benin Empire and the island became a Benin war-camp called \"Eko\" under Oba Orhogbua, the Oba of Benin at the time. Eko is still the native name for Lagos.\nLagos, which means \"lakes\", was a name given to the settlement by the Portuguese. Throughout history, it was home to a number of warring ethnic groups who had settled in the area. Following its early settlement by the Awori nobility, and its conquest by the Bini warlords of Benin, the state first came to the attention of the Portuguese in the 15th century.Portuguese explorer Rui de Sequeira visited the area in 1472, naming the area around the city Lago de Curamo. Another explanation is that Lagos is named after a major port in Portugal\u2014a maritime town that, at the time, was the main centre of Portuguese expeditions down the African coast, Lagos, Portugal.\nIn Britain's early 19th century fight against the transatlantic slave trade, its West Africa Squadron or Preventative Squadron as it was also known, continued to pursue Portuguese, American, French and Cuban slave ships and to impose anti-slavery treaties with West African coastal chiefs with so much doggedness that they created a strong presence along the West African coast from Sierra Leone all the way to the Niger Delta (today's Nigeria) and as far south as Congo. In 1849, Britain appointed John Beecroft Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, a position he held (along with his governorship of Fernando Po) until his death in 1854. John Duncan was appointed Vice Consul and was located at Wydah. At the time of Beecroft's appointment, the Kingdom of Lagos (under Oba Kosoko) was in the western part of the Consulate of the Bights of Benin and Biafra and was a key slave trading port. In 1851 and with pressure from liberated slaves who now wielded political and business influence, Britain intervened in Lagos in what is now known as the Bombardment of Lagos or Capture of Lagos resulting in the installation of Oba Akitoye and the ouster of Oba Kosoko. Oba Akitoye then signed the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos abolishing slavery. The signing of the 1852 treaty ushered in the Consular Period in Lagos' history wherein Britain provided military protection for Lagos.Following threats from Kosoko and the French who were positioned at Wydah, a decision was made by Lord Palmerston (British Prime Minister) who noted in 1861, \"the expediency of losing no time in assuming the formal Protectorate of Lagos\". William McCoskry, the Acting Consul in Lagos with Commander Bedingfield convened a meeting with Oba Dosunmu on 30 July 1861 aboard HMS Prometheus where Britain's intent was explained and a response to the terms were required by August 1861. Dosunmu resisted the terms of the treaty but under the threat to unleash violence on Lagos by Commander Bedingfield, Dosunmu relented and signed the Lagos Treaty of Cession on 6 August 1861.\n\nLagos was declared a colony on 5 March 1862. The remainder of modern-day Nigeria was seized in 1887, and when the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was established in 1914, Lagos became its capital, continuing as such after the country's independence from Britain in 1960. Along with migrants from all over Nigeria and other West African nations were the returnee ex-slaves known as Creoles, who came from Freetown, Sierra Leone, Brazil and the West Indies to Lagos. The Creoles contributed to Lagos' modernisation and their knowledge of Portuguese architecture can still be seen from the architecture on Lagos Island. Since the 19th century, Lagos gradually transformed to a melting pot of Africans and Europeans. Railway links and telephone cables connecting Lagos to London had been established by 1886. Electric street lighting was introduced in the city in 1898. Lagos experienced rapid growth throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a result of Nigeria's economic boom.Before the creation of Lagos State on 27 May 1967, Lagos, which was the country's capital had been administered directly by the Federal Government as a Federal Territory through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs, while the Lagos City Council (LCC) governed the city. Lagos, along with the towns from the then Western region (Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu, Epe and Badagry), were eventually captured to create Lagos State. Lagos city was split into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), while the other towns now make up 13 LGAs in the state. Lagos played the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital until 1976 when the state capital was moved to Ikeja. Lagos was adversely affected during Nigeria's military rule. Also, on 12 December 1991, the seat of the Federal Government was also formally relocated to Abuja. However, Lagos remains the financial centre of the country, and also grew to become the most populous conurbation in the country.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLagos is loosely classified into two main geographical areas\u2014the \"Island\" and the \"Mainland\".\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n==== Island ====\n\nThe Island is a loose geographical term that is used to define the area of Lagos that is separated from the \"mainland\" by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic Ocean, which forms Lagos Harbour. The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected together by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events in Lagos takes place. It also houses most of the upscale residential areas in Lagos. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be in the Island include Lagos Island, Eti-Osa. The major upscale island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include Ikoyi and Victoria Island. Three major bridges join the island to the mainland. They are the Carter Bridge, which starts from Iddo; the Eko Bridge (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the Third Mainland Bridge, which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon.\n\n\n===== Lagos Island =====\n\nLagos Island contains a central business district. This district is characterized by high-rise buildings. The island also contains many of the city's largest wholesale marketplaces (such as the popular Idumota and Balogun Markets). It also has the National Museum of Nigeria, the Central Mosque, the Glover Memorial Hall, Christ's Church Cathedral (CMS) and the Oba's Palace (Iga Idunganran). Another major part of Lagos Island is Marina. It borders around the idumota and Balogun markets and houses major Banking institutions. Though formerly in a derelict condition, Lagos Island's Tinubu Square is a site of historical importance; it was here that the Amalgamation Ceremony that unified the North and South protectorate to form Nigeria took place in 1914.\n\n\n===== Ikoyi =====\n\nIkoyi is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a land fill. Ikoyi is also connected to Victoria Island by Falomo bridge, which carries the main road over Five Cowrie creek. Ikoyi housed the headquarters of the federal government of Nigeria and other buildings owned by the government, including the old federal secretariat complex. The complex today is on reestablishment.In Ikoyi there are military and police barracks, a top-security prison and a federal high court of Nigeria. Ikoyi also has a number of hotels, night clubs, a recreational park and one of Africa's largest golf courses. Originally a middle class neighbourhood, in recent years, it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the upper middle class to the upper class. There are also commercial activities in Ikoyi, which is spotted in an increasing number of offices, banks, and shopping complexes. The commercial section is concentrated in the South-West.\n\n\n===== Victoria Island =====\n\nVictoria Island with its annexe is situated to the south of Lagos Island. It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments are blooming up everywhere.\nAlong with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts of several sizeable shopping districts. On its sea shore along the Atlantic front, there is environmentally reconstructed Bar Beach.\n\n\n===== Iddo =====\nAcross the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called Iddo. Iddo is also a railroad terminus and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland local government area after it was connected to the mainland like a peninsula.\n\n\n==== Mainland ====\nA huge population of Lagosians also live on the Lagos mainland, and most industries are located there. The mainland is known for its music and nightlife, which used to be located in areas around Yaba and Surulere. However, in recent years more night clubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island, Ikate and Lekki Phase 1) the main nightlife attractions. Mainland LGAs include Surulere, Apapa, and Lagos Mainland. Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: Agege, Amuwo Odofin, Mushin, Oshodi-Isolo and Ikeja (site of Murtala Muhammed International Airport and the capital of Lagos State).\nMajor Areas on the mainland include Ebute Metta, Yaba and Ejigbo. Some rivers, like Badagry Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLagos experiences a tropical savanna climate (Aw) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, as there's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season. The wet season starts in April and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in March. The wettest month is June with precipitation total 315.5 millimetres (12.42 in), while the driest month is January with precipitation total 13.2 millimetres (0.52 in).\nLocated near the equator, Lagos has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging 28.3\u201332.9 \u00b0C (82.9\u201391.2 \u00b0F). Lagos shares the seasons of the Southern Hemisphere, with summer highs in March, daily range 32.9\u201324.1 \u00b0C (91.2\u201375.4 \u00b0F), and warm winters in August, ranging 28.3\u201321.8 \u00b0C (82.9\u201371.2 \u00b0F) as the daily average.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nLagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria. The architectural styles in Lagos are diverse and range from tropical and vernacular to colonial European and ultramodern buildings or a mixture. Brazilian style architecture brought by the creoles is evident in buildings such as Water House and  Shitta Bey Mosque. Skyscrapers and most high rise buildings are centered on the islands, while the mainland has some high rise buildings. In recent years, the Lagos State government has renovated existing parks and green areas, with a long-term goal of expansion. Many good quality buildings are interspersed across the city.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, there are Christian churches and temples: Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of Nigeria (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Nigerian Baptist Convention (Baptist World Alliance), The Apostolic Church Nigeria (TACN), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Assemblies of God, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos (Catholic Church) and Muslim mosques such as Lagos Central Mosque in Lagos- island, Wahab Folawiyo Central Mosque in Surulere, Lekki Central Mosque in Lekki, The Syrian Mosque in Ikoyi. There are also various shrines and temples for traditional worshipers scattered across the state and they include several Igbo Igunnuko shrines, Egungun shrines, Eyo Shrines and other various traditional shrines and places of worship. For the 25,000 strong Hindu community, there is an ISKCON temple and three other Hindu temples dotted around the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn terms of administration, Lagos is not a single municipality and therefore has no overall city administration. The geographical city limits of Metropolitan Lagos comprises 16 of the 20 Local Government Areas, which together comprise Lagos State. The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region. The Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi, and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several Local Government Areas (most notably Lagos Island LGA, Lagos Mainland LGA and Eti-Osa LGA).The mainland beyond the Municipality of Lagos, on the other hand, comprised several separate towns and settlements such as Mushin, Ikeja and Agege. In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom, Lagos experienced a population explosion, untamed economic growth, and unmitigated rural migration. This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly, thus forming the present day \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\", also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\". The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them.\nBy 2006, the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State's boundaries and attained a megacity status. This much larger area is referred to as \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\" or \"Lagos Megacity Region\", which is a continuous built up land area of additional 1,535.4 square kilometres (592.8 square miles), comprising sprawls in LGAs situated next to Lagos' eastern and western city limits in Lagos State, and beyond northern limits, spilling into the LGAs in adjoining Ogun State. Ogun State LGAs within Greater Metropolitan Lagos majorly include: Obafemi Owode, Sagamu, Ifo, Ado-Odo/Ota and part of Ewekoro.\n\nToday, the word Lagos most often refers to the urban area, called \"Metropolitan Lagos\" in Nigeria, which includes both the islands of the former municipality of Lagos and the mainland suburbs. Lagos State government is responsible for some of the utilities including roads and transportation, power, water, health and education. Metropolitan Lagos extends over 16 of the 20 LGAs of Lagos State, and contains about 85% of the population of Lagos State, and includes semi-rural areas. Lagos City has a considerable number of high-rise buildings that dominate its skyline. Most of the tall buildings are located in the downtown Central Business District.\nLagos was the former capital city of Nigeria but it has since been replaced by Abuja. Abuja officially gained its status as the capital of Nigeria on 12 December 1991, although the decision to move the federal capital had been made in now Act no. 6 of 1976. Lagos is also home to the High Court of the Lagos State Judiciary, housed in an old colonial building on Lagos Island.\n\n\n=== Census data for Lagos ===\nAlthough the 2006 National Population Census of Nigeria credited the metropolitan area with a population figure of 7,937,932, the figure is at variance with some projections by the UN and other population agencies and groups worldwide. The population figure of Lagos State given by the Lagos State Government is 17,553,924. It was based on claimed conducted enumeration for social planning by the Lagos State Government \"parallel census\" and it believes that since the inhabitants of the metropolitan area of Lagos constitute 88% of the Lagos State population, the population of metropolitan Lagos is about 15.5 million.A rejoinder to Lagos State Government views concluded that Lagos State concealed the fact that the population projection, for Lagos Urban Agglomeration by the UN agencies had been revised downwards substantially as early as 2003. It failed to interpret the two most important and fairly representative and reliable secondary data sets already in public domain, the National Identity Card Scheme and the 2003 Voters Registration figures from INEC. The figures for 2007 Voters Registration by INEC were an act subsequent to the release of the provisional census results and comprehensively corroborate, vindicate and validate the population figures in no uncertain terms.\nAccording to the official results of the 2006 census, there were 8,048,430 inhabitants in Metropolitan Lagos. This figure was lower than anticipated, and has created controversy in Nigeria. Lagos Island, the central Local Government Area and historic centre of Metropolitan Lagos, had a population of 212,700 at the 2006 Census.\n\nAuthorities of Lagos State have attacked the results of the 2006 census, accusing the Nigerian National Population Commission of having undercounted the population of the state. This accusation is denied by the National Population Commission. A study found that research carried out by Africapolis (the African subsidiary of e-Geopolis backed by the Agence fran\u00e7aise de d\u00e9veloppement), in addition to the cross-referencing of official figures with more scientific independent research concluded that the 2006 census figures for Lagos State of about 9 million were valid and that the state's own assessments are inflated.Lagos is, by most estimates, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Lagos is currently experiencing a population increase of about 275,000 persons per annum. In 1999 the United Nations predicted that the city's metropolitan area, which had only about 290,000 inhabitants in 1950, would exceed 20 million by 2010 and thus become one of the ten most populated cities in the world.\n\nThere is a huge spectrum of wealth distribution among the people that reside in Lagos. It ranges from the very wealthy to the very poor. Lagos has attracted many young people and families seeking a better life from all other parts of Nigeria and beyond and this has also contributed to its cosmopolitan status. Some people are leaving Lagos and Nigeria in search of better living conditions, cities like Townsville in Australia are very popular with expats and have services set up to assist people in settling into their new life.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Lagos is a major economic focal point in Nigeria, generating around 10% of the country's GDP. Most commercial and financial business is carried out in the central business district situated on the island. This is also where most of the country's commercial banks, financial institutions and major corporations are headquartered. Lagos is also the major Information Communications and Telecommunications (ICT) hub of West Africa and potentially, the biggest ICT market in the continent. Lagos is developing a 24-hour economy and has also been ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the world. In some parts of Lagos, residents have one of the highest standards of living in Nigeria and in Africa. At the same time, a sizable proportion of the residents live in slums without access to piped water and sanitation.The Port of Lagos is Nigeria's leading port and one of the largest and busiest in Africa. It is administered by the Nigerian Ports Authority and it is split into three main sections: Lagos port, in the main channel next to Lagos Island, Apapa Port (site of the container terminal) and Tin Can Port, both located in Badagry Creek, which flows into Lagos Harbour from the west. The port features a railhead. The port has seen growing amounts of crude oil exported, with export figures rising between 1997 and 2000. Oil and petroleum products provide 14% of GDP and 90% of foreign exchange earnings in Nigeria as a whole.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music and film industry ===\nLagos is famous throughout Africa for its music scene. Lagos has a vibrant nightlife and has given birth to a variety of styles such as Sakara music, Nigerian hip hop, highlife, juju, fuji, Afrobeat, and Afrobeats.Lagos is the centre of the Nigerian movie industry, often referred to as 'Nollywood'. Idumota market on Lagos Island is the primary distribution centre. Many films are shot in the Festac area of Lagos, where the World Festival of Black Arts was held.Iganmu is home to the primary centre for the performing arts and artistes in Nigeria: the National Arts Theatre.\nJames Brown performed in Lagos in 1970. Paul McCartney recorded his fifth post-Beatles album, Band on the Run, in an EMI studio in Lagos in August and September 1973. Other foreign musicians who have also performed in the city include Sean Paul, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Akon, Jarule, Ashanti, Usher, Shaggy, R Kelly, Cardi B, Migos especially during the Star Mega Jam; Shakira, John Legend, Boyz II Men T-Pain, Brian McKnight, JayZ, Mary J. Blige, Beyonc\u00e9, Brandy, Ciara, Keri Hilson and Lauryn Hill, among others.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nAssociation football is Lagos' most popular sport. Prominent Lagos football clubs include Bridge Boys F.C. MFM F.C. and First Bank: both play in Nigeria National League, the second tier of Nigerian football.\n\nThe Nigeria national football team, also known as the Super Eagles, used to play almost all of their home games in Lagos at the National Stadium in Surulere; much later, games were played at the then New Abuja National Stadium in Abuja for sometime; however, games are now mostly played at the newer Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, which is the default home of the Super Eagles. Lagos also hosted the 2nd All-African games in 1973.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLagos, subsequent to the re-modernization project achieved by the previous administration of Governor Raji Babatunde Fashola, is gradually becoming a major tourist destination, being one of the largest cities in Africa and in the world. Lagos is currently taking steps to become a global city. The 2009 Eyo carnival (a yearly festival originated from Iperu Remo, Ogun State), which took place on 25 April, was a step toward world city status. Currently, Lagos is primarily known as a business-oriented and a fast-paced community.Lagos has become an important location for African and \"black\" cultural identity. Many festivals are held in Lagos; festivals vary in offerings each year and may be held in different months. Some of the festivals are Festac Food Fair held in Festac Town Annually, Eyo Festival, Lagos Black Heritage Carnival, Lagos Carnival, Eko International Film Festival, Lagos Seafood Festac Festival, LAGOS PHOTO Festival and the Lagos Jazz Series, which is a unique franchise for high-quality live music in all genres with a focus on jazz. Established in 2010, the popular event takes place over a 3\u20135 day period at selected high quality outdoor venues. The music is as varied as the audience itself and features a diverse mix of musical genres from rhythm and blues to soul, Afrobeat, hip hop, bebop, and traditional jazz. The festivals provide entertainment of dance and song to add excitement to travelers during a stay in Lagos.\nLagos has a number of sandy beaches by the Atlantic Ocean, including Elegushi Beach and Alpha Beach. Lagos also has a number of private beach resorts including Inagbe Grand Beach Resort and several others in the outskirts.\nLagos has a variety of hotels ranging from three star to five star hotels, with a mixture of local hotels such as Eko Hotels and Suites, Federal Palace Hotel and franchises of multinational chains such as Intercontinental Hotel, Sheraton and Four Points by Sheraton. Other places of interest include the Tafawa Balewa Square, Festac town, The Nike Art Gallery, Freedom Park, Lagos and the Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nSome of the famous cuisines in Lagos include indigenous delicacies such as eba and egusi; amala and ewedu; jollof; ofada rice; plantains (locally called dodo); beans; suya (spicy shish kebab or spiced roasted beef), which is consumed in local clubs and bars with a bottle of cold beer; and eba, made from cassava and eaten with soups prepared with vegetables and mixture of spices and herbs. Other cuisines range from local ones like Iyan (pounded yam) made from yam flour, amala; asaro, which is usually eaten with various kind of vegetables; and Egusi (melon soup) to European, Middle-Eastern, and Asian cuisine.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Lagos State Government operates state schools. The education system is the 6-3-3-4 system, which is practised throughout the country (as well as by many other members of the Economic Community of West African States). The levels are Primary, Junior Secondary School (JSS), Senior Secondary School (SSS) and university. All children are offered basic education, with special focus now on the first nine years. Many of the schools in Nigeria are federally funded and usually are boarding schools. A few examples are Federal government college Odogbolu (FGCOdogbolu), Federal government girls college Sagamu (FGGCSagamu) and Federal government college Kano (FGCKano). The state of Lagos has its own federally funded high schools namely Federal government college Ijanikin also known as FGC Lagos, Kings College and Queens College.\nLagos is home to various postsecondary schools, universities and other vocational institutions that are either operated by the government or private entities.\n\n\n=== Vocational schools ===\nInstitute for Industrial Technology (IIT) : founded in 2000, IIT is a technical vocational school for male youth from families with limited resources. Its educational model is based on the Dual Training System.\n\n\n=== Polytechnics ===\nYaba College of Technology (YABATECH) : founded in 1934, the college is Nigeria's first higher educational institution and third in Africa.

Founded in 1996 and awarded University status in 2002.  The University also places some emphasis on the study of art, running the Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art.\nNational Open University of Nigeria is the first open university in Nigeria; it is located on Ahmadu Bello Way, Victoria Island, Lagos.\nCaleb University is a private university located at Imota, Lagos.\nLagos State College of Health Technology (LASCOHET) is an institution that runs health courses such as Health Information Management, Pharmacist Tech, Medical Laboratory Tech, Community Health Extension and Environmental Health Technology; it is located in Yaba.\nLagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM), Ikeja\nLagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba-Mushin, Lagos.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nLagos has many hospitals and medical facilities, some of which have accomplished feats in Nigeria's medical history. For example, the oldest Nigerian hospital is located in the city as well as West Africa's first air-operated emergency medical service, which commenced in the city. The Lagos healthcare system is generally divided into public and private sectors that provide medical services at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Although the private hospitals are usually more expensive, it does not necessarily translate to better health-care delivery.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nLagos has one of the largest and most extensive road networks in West Africa. It also has suburban trains and some ferry services. Highways are usually congested in peak hours, due in part to the geography of the city, as well as to its explosive population growth. Lagos is also linked by many highways and bridges. A new rail system that is supposed to span the length of the Badagry expressway is currently under construction.\nThe Lagos\u2013Ibadan Expressway and the Lagos\u2013Abeokuta Expressway are the major controlled-access highways in the north of the city and serve as inter-state highways to Oyo State and Ogun State respectively. To the west the congested Lagos\u2013Badagry Expressway serves outlying towns such as Festival Town, which was the location for the 1977 Festival of Black Arts and Culture 77.Lagos's importance as a commercial centre and port and its strategic location have led to it being the end-point of three Trans-African Highway routes using Nigeria's national roads. The Trans\u2013West African Coastal Highway leaves the city as the Badagry Expressway to Benin and beyond as far as Dakar and Nouakchott; the Trans-Sahara Highway to Algiers, which is close to completion, leaves the city as the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.Lagos State has a bus rapid transit (BRT) system; the first phase was completed in February 2008. It is expected to operate along eight routes using specially designated bus rapid transit lanes running through the city, with the aim of expanding to other routes in the future.\nThe first phase of the Lagos BRT runs 19 km (12 mi) through Ikorodu Road and Funsho Williams Avenue up to CMS. After weeks of test runs, operations started on 17 March 2008, six months earlier than planned. Also, the signature color of Lagos state 14-seater bus (known as Danfo) is yellow with a touch of black.\nIt has been estimated that the system will transport about 10,000 passengers in each direction per hour during peak travel times. At these times traffic congestion, called \"Go Slow\", by Lagosians, can be extreme. The LAMATA bus rapid transit corridor covers a distance of about 22 km (14 mi). The system is run by two operators, NURTW Cooperative (Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers) and Lagbus, a Lagos State Government owned Asset Management Company that contributes about 180 high-capacity buses for the implementation of the first phase Mile 12 to CMS BRT Lite system.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nAn extensive urban rail system, Lagos Rail Mass Transit, running through the Lagos metropolis is currently under construction. Several intercity and commuter trains serve Lagos through the Lagos Terminus railway station.\n\n\n=== Ferries ===\nLagos State Ferry Services Corporation runs a few regular routes, for example between Lagos Island and the mainland, served by modern ferries and wharves. Private boats run irregular passenger services on the lagoon and on some creeks.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLagos is served by Murtala Muhammed International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in Africa. The MMIA is Nigeria's premier international air gateway. The airport's history dates back to colonial times, around the time of the Second World War. The current international airport terminal was built and commissioned over 40 years ago, in 1978. The terminal opened officially March 15, 1979. The airport had been known simply as the Lagos International Airport. It was, however, renamed for the late Nigerian Head of State, General Murtala Muhammed, who died in 1976.\nThe airport terminal has been renovated several times since the 1970s but its most radical makeover began in 2013, following the launch of the Federal government's multi-billion naira Remodelling/ Rehabilitation Programme for its airports nationwide. Under the re-modeling work there, by late in 2014, the MMlA lounge area had been expanded to four times its previous size and new passenger handling conveyor systems installed which can handle over 1,000 passengers per hour.\nA second airport, Lekki-Epe International Airport is proposed.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAbike Dabiri, Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission\nAgbani Darego, Miss Nigeria 2001, Semifinalist Miss Universe 2001 and Miss World 2001\nAkinwunmi Ambode, former Governor of Lagos state\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, Governor of Lagos State\nBabatunde Fashola, Former Governor of Lagos and current Minister of Power, Works and Housing\nBode George, Politician\nBola Tinubu, Former Governor of Lagos State\nBuchi Emecheta, novelist\nFunsho Williams, politician and one time aspirant to the office of Lagos state governor\nHakeem Olajuwon, professional basketball player\nIsrael Adesanya, UFC Middle weight champion\nIsrael Idonije, Professional American football player, Chicago Bears 2003\u20132013, Detroit Lions 2013\nNelson Agholor, Professional American football player, Super Bowl 52 Champion with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018\nRilwan Akiolu, Oba (traditional ruler) of Lagos\nToyin Saraki, global health advocate and healthcare philanthropist\nYemi Osinbajo, politician, lawyer and current Vice-President of Nigeria\nYvonne Orji, Actress, Comedian\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\n\nLagos is twinned with:\n Gary, Indiana, United States, since 1991\n Atlanta, Georgia, United States, since 1974\n Bucharest, Romania\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of largest cities\nList of Governors of Lagos State\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLeithead, Alastair (August 2017).

Unfortunately one can't take photos in there which is cool because it makes you want to know what is actually in there. I enjoyed it.",
          "In terms of history it's wonderful but the environment is nothing to talk about. I remember when I was very much younger that place was a beauty to embrace. I loved going there because of the playground but now it's all dead. It's just the museum that's still cool.",
          "We can do better! The museum can be stocked with more exciting stuff. \n\nThe ongoing art exhibition saved the day",
          "It's a fairly good place to reminisce about the history of Nigeria. The monoliths from Cross River are very real, although the tour guides don't have much to say about them\n\nNo cameras allowed inside the museum building, and there's a gate fee of N300 for Nigerian adults, N500 for foreign adults, then N200 for kids.",
          "The National Museum takes us through the traditions linked to various stages of our life and has a separate photo gallery of the leaders over the last 80 years. Highlight was the actual car, with bullet holes, in which one of the leaders was assassinated.  A very sincere and enthusiastic guide made this visit very informative",
          "Not bad of a scenery from the entrance, although its not a perfect view for a \"national museum\" but that doesn't take anything away from its collection which could prove very useful for inquisitive patriots or historians. Quite a wide \u2026",

          "This venue has so much potential to be more. I can see some effort was put into it but it still needs a lot of work. In 2020, we are still not allowed to take pictures? I mean pictures bring other guests. They are not going to deter them, if anything it just becomes a location to hangout",
          "Nice place wit bad maintenance! The government don\u2019t care about our history! God bless the remaining staffs",
          "Decrepit, badly maintained. Unprofessional staff except for one. I used to come here often over 35 years ago and it used to be something to see. Over the years it's gone completely downhill and it's just sad",
          "A great museum. We got a wonderful guide that told us all about it. You can find the car (with bullet holes in it) of the old president that was killed. Also there is an exhibition on the circle of life.\nThe entrance is 500 Naira (we have our guide 1000 as a tip)",

I was hoping for better.",

          "This place has all the potentials to be a great tourist attraction but it is not well catered for. I was really enthusiastic about going there but I wasn't impressed. I didn't get a tour guide to take me round and explain the history of the artefacts. I hope more attention can be placed on the museum to make it attractive to people.",
          "It should be part of the list of places you should visit when you come to Lagos, it gives a sense of history.\n\nTho i feel the museum focused too much on fetish things. There is so much more African culture is about aside cultural objects. \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations (SCOAN) is a  charismatic Christian megachurch located in Lagos, Nigeria. \n\n\n== History ==\nJoshua wrote that in a heavenly vision he received 'divine anointing' and a covenant from God to start his ministry in 1987.  The church started with a handful of members but has since become one of Nigeria\u2019s most influential churches, attracting over 50,000 people to its weekly Sunday services at the headquarters in Ikotun-Egbe, Lagos.\n\n\n== Religious tourism ==\nThe SCOAN is especially known for the huge number of foreign pilgrims it attracts with The Guardian reporting the church receives more weekly attendees than the combined number of visitors to Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London. This Day newspapers reported that \u201cabout two million local and inbound tourists\u201d visit The SCOAN annually.It has been described as \u201cNigeria\u2019s biggest tourist attraction\u201d and \u201cthe most visited destination by religious tourists in West Africa\u201d. Figures released by the Nigerian Immigration Service indicated that six out of every ten foreign travellers coming into Nigeria are bound for The SCOAN.The SCOAN\u2019s contribution to Nigeria's religious tourism was highlighted when the cleric hinted at the possibility of relocating his ministry to Israel during a Sunday service. The announcement proved controversial with several prominent Nigerians urging him to remain in the country, citing the economic setbacks Nigeria would likely experience through his potential relocation. The church's popular services have also resulted in an enormous boost for local businesses and hoteliers.\n\n\n== Faith healing ==\nSCOAN claims regular occurrences of divine miracles. It has published numerous videos claiming to document the healing of incurable disabilities and illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, blindness and open wounds.Spiritual healing at The SCOAN has been the subject of several media reports, including a mention in Time Magazine, an Associated Press interview and an article by Foreign Policy.\n\n\n== Television ==\nThe church's weekly services are broadcast live on Emmanuel TV as well as on The SCOAN's social media platforms. The SCOAN is particularly popular on social media with 1.4 million YouTube subscribers and 3.5 million Facebook followers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nT.B.

        "wiki": "World music (also called global music or international music) is a Western musical category encompassing many different styles of music from other parts of the globe. It includes many forms of music that Westerners consider ethnic, indigenous music, folk music, neotraditional music, and music where more than one cultural tradition, such as non-Western music and Western popular music, intermingle.\nWorld music's inclusive nature and elasticity as a musical category may pose some obstacles to a universal definition, but its ethic of interest in the culturally exotic is encapsulated in fRoots magazine's description of the 'genre' as \"local music from out there\".The term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music. It has grown to include subgenres such as ethnic fusion (Clannad, Ry Cooder, Enya, etc.) and worldbeat.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe term has been credited to ethnomusicologist Robert E. Brown, who coined it in the early 1960s at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, where he developed undergraduate through doctoral programs in the discipline. To enhance the learning process (John Hill), he invited more than a dozen visiting performers from Africa and Asia and began a world music concert series. The term became current in the 1980s as a marketing/classificatory device in the media and the music industry. There are several conflicting definitions for world music. One is that it consists of \"all the music in the world\", though such a broad definition renders the term virtually meaningless.The term also is taken as a classification of music that combines Western popular music styles with one of many genres of non-Western music that are also described as folk music or ethnic music. However, world music is not exclusively traditional folk music. It may include cutting edge pop music styles as well. Succinctly, it can be described as \"local music from out there\", or \"someone else's local music\". It is a very nebulous term with an increasing number of genres that fall under the umbrella of world music to capture musical trends of combined ethnic style and texture, including Western elements (examples noted in this section).\nWorld music may incorporate distinctive non-Western scales, modes or musical inflections, and often features distinctive traditional ethnic instruments, such as the kora (West African harp), the steel drum, the sitar or the didgeridoo.Music from around the world exerts wide cross-cultural influence as styles naturally influence one another, and in recent years world music has also been marketed as a successful genre in itself. Academic study of world music, as well as the musical genres and individual artists associated with it appear in such disciplines as anthropology, folkloristics, performance studies and ethnomusicology.\n\n\n=== Evolving terminology ===\n\nIn the age of digital music production the increased availability of high-quality, ethnic music samples, sound bites and loops from every known region are commonly used in commercial music production, which has exposed a vast spectrum of indigenous music texture to developing, independent artists.\nAn amalgamation of roots music in the global, contemporary listening palette has become apparent, which weakens the role major entertainment labels such as Columbia, Warner, MCA and EMI can play in the cultural perception of genre boundaries.\nSimilar terminology between distinctly different sub-categories under primary music genres, such as world, rock and pop, can be as ambiguous and confusing to industry moguls as it is to consumers. As Damian Burns writes, this is especially true in the context of world music, where branches of ethnically influenced pop trends are as genre-defined by consumer perception as they are by the music industry forums that govern the basis for categorical distinction. Academic scholars tend to agree that, in today's world of consumer music reviews and blogging, global music culture's public perception is what ultimately distils a prevailing basis for definition from genre ambiguity, regardless of how clearly a category has been outlined by corporate marketing forums and music journalism. The world music genre's gradual migration from a clear spectrum of roots music traditions to an extended list of hybrid subgenres is a good example of the motion genre boundaries can exhibit in a globalizing pop culture.\nThe classic, original definition of world music was in part created to instill a perceived authenticity and distinction between indigenous music traditions and those that eventually become diluted by pop culture, and the modern debate over how possible it is to maintain that perception in the richly diverse genre of world music is ongoing.In a report on the 2014 globalFEST, National Public Radio's Anastasia Tsioulcas said, \"Even within the 'world music' community, nobody likes the term 'world music'. It smacks of all kinds of loaded issues, from cultural colonialism to questions about what's 'authentic' and what isn't (and who might get to police such inquiries), and forces an incredible array of styles that don't have anything in common under the label of 'exotic Other.' What's more: I believe that in many people's imaginations, 'world music' means a kind of fairly awful, gloppy, hippy-ish, worldbeat fusion. It's a problematic, horrible term that satisfies absolutely no one.\"\n\n\n== Early influences ==\nMillie Small released \"My Boy Lollipop\" in 1964. Small's version was a hit, reaching number 2 both in the UK Singles Chart and in the US Billboard Hot 100. In the 1960s, Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela had popular hits in the USA. In 1969 Indian musician Ravi Shankar played sitar at the Woodstock festival.In the 1970s, Manu Dibango's funky track \"Soul Makossa\" (1972) became a hit, and Osibisa released \"Sunshine Day\" (1976). Fela Kuti created Afrobeat and Femi Kuti, Seun Kuti and Tony Allen followed Fela Kuti's funky music. Salsa musicians such as Jos\u00e9 Alberto \"El Canario\", Ray Sep\u00falveda, Johnny Pacheco, Fania All-Stars, Ray Barretto, Rub\u00e9n Blades, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Roberto Roena, Bobby Valent\u00edn, Eddie Palmieri, H\u00e9ctor Lavoe and Willie Col\u00f3n developed Latin music.The Breton musician Alan Stivell pioneered the connection between traditional folk music, modern rock music and world music with his 1972 album Renaissance of the Celtic Harp. Around the same time, Stivell's contemporary, Welsh singer-songwriter Meic Stevens popularised Welsh folk music. Neo-traditional Welsh language music featuring a fusion of modern instruments and traditional instruments such as the pibgorn and the Welsh harp has been further developed by Bob Delyn a'r Ebillion. Lebanese musical pioneer Lydia Canaan fused Middle-Eastern quarter notes and microtones with anglophone folk, and is listed in the catalog of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives as the first rock star of the Middle East.\n\n\n== Forms ==\n\nExamples of popular forms of world music include the various forms of non-European classical music (e.g. Chinese guzheng music, Indian raga music, Tibetan chants), Eastern European folk music (e.g. the village music of the Balkans, The Mystery of the Bulgarian Voices), Nordic folk music, Latin music, Indonesian music, and the many forms of folk and tribal music of the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America.\nThe broad category of world music includes isolated forms of ethnic music from diverse geographical regions. These dissimilar strains of ethnic music are commonly categorized together by virtue of their indigenous roots. Over the 20th century, the invention of sound recording, low-cost international air travel, and common access to global communication among artists and the general public have given rise to a related phenomenon called \"crossover\" music. Musicians from diverse cultures and locations could readily access recorded music from around the world, see and hear visiting musicians from other cultures and visit other countries to play their own music, creating a melting pot of stylistic influences. While communication technology allows greater access to obscure forms of music, the pressures of commercialization also present the risk of increasing musical homogeneity, the blurring of regional identities, and the gradual extinction of traditional local music-making practices.\n\n\n== Hybrid examples ==\n\nSince the music industry established this term, the fuller scope of what an average music consumer defines as \"world\" music in today's market has grown to include various blends of ethnic music tradition, style and interpretation, and derivative world music genres have been coined to represent these hybrids, such as ethnic fusion and worldbeat. Good examples of hybrid, world fusion are the Irish-West African meld of Afro Celt Sound System, the pan-cultural sound of AO Music and the jazz / Finnish folk music of V\u00e4rttin\u00e4, each of which bear tinges of contemporary, Western influence\u2014an increasingly noticeable element in the expansion genres of world music. Worldbeat and ethnic fusion can also blend specific indigenous sounds with more blatant elements of Western pop. Good examples are Paul Simon's album Graceland, on which South African mbaqanga music is heard; Peter Gabriel's work with Pakistani Sufi singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan; the Deep Forest project, in which vocal loops from West Africa are blended with Western, contemporary rhythmic textures and harmony structure; and the work of Mango, who combined pop and rock music with world elements.\nDepending on style and context, world music can sometimes share the new-age music genre, a category that often includes ambient music and textural expressions from indigenous roots sources. Good examples are Tibetan bowls, Tuvan throat singing, Gregorian chant or Native American flute music. World music blended with new-age music is a sound loosely classified as the hybrid genre 'ethnic fusion'. Examples of ethnic fusion are Nicholas Gunn's \"Face-to-Face\" from Beyond Grand Canyon, featuring authentic Native American flute combined with synthesizers, and \"Four Worlds\" from The Music of the Grand Canyon, featuring spoken word from Razor Saltboy of the Navajo Indian Nation.\n\n\n=== World fusion ===\nThe subgenre world fusion is often mistakenly assumed to refer exclusively to a blending of Western jazz fusion elements with world music. Although such a hybrid expression falls easily into the world fusion category, the suffix \"fusion\" in the term world fusion should not be assumed to mean jazz fusion. Western jazz combined with strong elements of world music is more accurately termed world fusion jazz, ethnic jazz or non-Western jazz. World fusion and global fusion are nearly synonymous with the genre term worldbeat, and though these are considered subgenres of popular music, they may also imply universal expressions of the more general term world music. In the 1970s and 80s, fusion in the jazz music genre implied a blending of jazz and rock music, which is where the misleading assumption is rooted.\n\n\n== Popular non-Western genres ==\nAlthough it primarily describes traditional music, the world music category also includes popular music from non-Western urban communities (e.g. South African \"township\" music) and non-European music forms that have been influenced by other so-called third-world musics (e.g. Afro-Cuban music).The inspiration of Zimbabwe's Thomas Mapfumo in blending the Mbira (finger Piano) style onto the electric guitar, saw a host of other Zimbabwean musicians refining the genre, none more successfully than The Bhundu Boys. The Bhundu Jit music hit Europe with some force in 1986, taking Andy Kershaw and John Peel fully under its spell.\nFor many years, Paris has attracted numerous musicians from former colonies in West and North Africa. This scene is aided by the fact that there are many concerts and institutions that help to promote the music.\nAlgerian and Moroccan music have an important presence in the French capital. Hundreds of thousands of Algerian and Moroccan immigrants have settled in Paris, bringing the sounds of Amazigh (Berber), ra\u00ef, and Gnawa music.\nThe West African community is also very large, integrated by people from Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, and Guinea.\nUnlike musical styles from other regions of the globe, the American music industry tends to categorize Latin music as its own genre and defines it as any music sung in Spanish from the Spanish-speaking world.\n\n\n== 1987 meeting ==\nOn 29 June 1987, a meeting of interested parties gathered to capitalize on the marketing of this genre. Paul Simon had released the world music-influenced album Graceland in 1986. The concept behind the album had been to express his own sensibilities using the sounds he had fallen in love with while listening to artists from Southern Africa, including Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Savuka. This project and the work of Peter Gabriel and Johnny Clegg among others had, to some degree, introduced non-Western music to a wider audience. They saw this as an opportunity.\nAlthough specialist music stores had been important in developing the genre over many years, the record companies, broadcasters and journalists had been finding it difficult to build a following because the music, itself, seemed too scarce.\nAt the outset of the 1987 meeting, the musician Roger Armstrong advised the reason why something had to be done:\n\n[He] felt that the main problem in selling our kind of material lay with the UK retail outlets and, specifically, the fact that they did not know how to rack it coherently. This discouraged [the retail stores] from stocking the material in any depth and made it more difficult for the record buyers to become acquainted with our catalogs.\nThe first concern of the meetings was to select the umbrella name that this music would be listed under. Suggestions included \"world beat\" and prefixing words such as \"hot\" or \"tropical\" to existing genre titles. \"World music\" won after a show of hands, but initially it was not meant to be the title for a whole new genre\u2014just something the record labels could place on record sleeves to distinguish them during the forthcoming campaign. Afterward, they agreed that despite the publicity campaign, this was not an exclusive club\u2014and that for the good of all, any label that sold this type of music could use the name.\nAnother issue was the distribution methods at the time. Most main labels were unhappy with the lack of specialist knowledge in their sales force, which led to poor service. Many larger outlets were reluctant to carry the music, because they favored larger releases they could promote within the store. It was difficult to justify a large presentation expense with limited stock going into stores.\n\n\n=== World music market ===\nOne of the marketing strategies used in the vinyl market at the time was the use of browser cards, which would appear in the record racks. As part of the \"world music\" campaign, it was decided that these would be a two color affair designed to carry a special offer package; to aid the retailer a selection of labels would also be included, presumably for shelf or rack edging.\nIn an unprecedented move, all of the world music labels coordinated together and developed a compilation cassette for the cover of the music magazine NME. The overall running time was 90 minutes, each package containing a mini-catalog showing the other releases on offer.\nBy the time of a second meeting it became clear that a successful campaign required its own dedicated press officer. The press officer would be able to juggle various deadlines and sell the music as a concept\u2014not just to national stations, but also regional DJs keen to expand their musical variety. DJs were a key resource as it was important to make \"world music\" important to people outside London\u2014most regions after all had a similarly heritage to tap into. A cost-effective way of achieving all this would be a leafleting campaign.\nThe next step was to develop a world music chart, gathering together selling information from around fifty shops, so that it would finally be possible to see which were big sellers in the genre\u2014so new listeners could see what was particularly popular. It was agreed that the NME could again be involved in printing the chart and also Music Week and the London listings magazine City Limits. It was also suggested that Andy Kershaw might be persuaded to do a run down of this chart on his show regularly.\n\n\n== Relationship to immigration and multiculturalism ==\n\nIn most wealthy industrialized countries, large amounts of immigration from other regions has been ongoing for many decades. This has introduced non-Western music to Western audiences not only as \"exotic\" imports, but also as local music played by fellow citizens. But the process is ongoing and continues to produce new forms. In the 2010s several musicians from immigrant communities in the West rose to global popularity, such as Haitian-American Wyclef Jean, Somali-Canadian K'naan, Tamil-Briton M.I.A., or Colombian Shakira, often blending the music of their heritage with hip-hop or pop. Cuban-born singer-songwriter Addys Mercedes started her international career from Germany mixing traditional elements of Son with pop.Once, an established Western artist might collaborate with an established African artist to produce an album or two. Now, new bands and new genres are built from the ground up by young performers. For example, the Punjabi-Irish fusion band Delhi 2 Dublin is from neither India nor Ireland, but Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Country for Syria, an Istanbul based music collective, blends American Country music with the music of Syrian refugees and local Turkish music. Musicians and composers also work collectively to create original compositions for various combinations of ethnic and western instruments.\n\n\n== Radio programs ==\nWorld music radio programs today often play African hip hop or reggae artists, crossover Bhangra and Latin American jazz groups, etc. Common media for world music include public radio, webcasting, the BBC, NPR, and the (Australian Broadcasting Corporation). By default, non-region-specific or multi-cultural world music projects are often listed under the generic category of world music.\nExamples of radio shows that feature world music include The Culture Cafe on WWUH West Hartford, World of Music on Voice of America, Transpacific Sound Paradise on WFMU, The Planet on Australia's ABC Radio National, DJ Edu presenting D.N.A: DestiNation Africa on BBC Radio 1Xtra, Adil Ray on the BBC Asian Network, Andy Kershaw's show on BBC Radio 3 and Charlie Gillett's show on the BBC World Service.\n\n\n== Criticisms ==\nWorld music is defined in opposition, and relative, to Western popular music and Western art music, and its constituent musics are positioned as equivalent to one another, despite the fact that they may have vastly different musical qualities. Therefore, the treatment of so-called world music is unequal to that of the normative music of the global West. This is primarily due to the fact that dominant corporate structures for music distribution and promotion in  Europe and  North America originate in those continents, as do their forums for establishing industry genre categories.\nTherefore, in market context, \"ethnic\" music is synthetically defined by a radius that extends from a Western center.\nSome musicians and curators of music have come to dislike the term \"world music\". To these critics, \"world music\" is a parochial, catch-all marketing term for non-Western music of all genres. In October 1999, Luaka Bop label founder and ex-Talking Heads frontman David Byrne wrote an \"I Hate World Music\" editorial in  The New York Times explaining his objections to the term. Byrne argued that the labelling and categorization of other cultures as \"exotic\" serves to attract an insincere consumption and deter other potential consumers.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\nThe BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music was an award given to world music artists between 2002 and 2008, sponsored by BBC Radio 3. The award was thought up by fRoots magazine's editor Ian Anderson, inspired by the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Award categories included: Africa, Asia/Pacific, Americas, Europe, Mid East and North Africa, Newcomer, Culture Crossing, Club Global, Album of the Year, and Audience Award. Initial lists of nominees in each category were selected annually by a panel of several thousand industry experts. Shortlisted nominees were voted on by a twelve-member jury, which selected the winners in every category except for the Audience Award category. These jury members were appointed and presided over by the BBC. The annual awards ceremony was held at the BBC Proms and winners were given an award called a \"Planet\". In March 2009, the BBC made a decision to axe the BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music.In response to the BBC's decision to end its awards program, the British world music magazine Songlines launched the Songlines Music Awards in 2009 \"to recognise outstanding talent in world music\".The WOMEX Awards were introduced in 1999 to honor the high points of world music on an international level and to acknowledge musical excellence, social importance, commercial success, political impact and lifetime achievement. Every October at the WOMEX event, the award figurine\u2014an ancient mother goddess statue dating back about 6000 years to the Neolithic age\u2014is presented in an award ceremony to a worthy member of the world music community.\n\n\n== Festivals ==\n\nMany festivals are identified as being \"world music\"; here's a small representative selection:\n\nThe WOMAD Foundation organizes festivals in countries around the world.Australia\n\nThe Globe to Globe World Music Festival takes place in the City of Kingston, Melbourne, for 2 days each year in January.Bangladesh\n\nThe Dhaka World Music Festival takes place in Dhaka.Belgium\n\nSfinks Festival in Boechout, Belgium is a 4-day world music festival.Canada\n\nSunfest is an annual 4-day world music festival that happens in London, Ontario, primarily in Victoria Park; it typically runs the weekend after Canada Day in early July.Croatia\n\nEthnoambient is a two- or three-day world music festival held every summer since 1998 in Solin, Dalmatia, in southern Croatia.France\n\nThe Festival de l'Inde takes place in Evian, Haute-Savoie.\nF\u00eate de la Musique (\"World Music Day\") was initiated in 1982 in France.

        "wiki": "Automobiles Talbot S.A. was a French automobile manufacturer based in Suresnes, Hauts de Seine, outside Paris.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\n\n=== Alexandre Darracq ===\n\nThe Suresnes factory had been built by Alexandre Darracq for his pioneering car manufacturing business begun in 1896, which he named A. Darracq & Cie. It was very profitable. Alexandre Darracq built racing as well as \u201cpleasure\u201d cars and Darracq rapidly became famous for its motor racing successes. Darracq sold his remaining portion of his business in 1912.\n\n\n=== Talbot ===\n\nNew owners renamed the Darracq business Automobiles Talbot in 1922. However, though its ordinary production cars were badged as Talbots, the new owners continued incorporating the Darracq name in Talbot-Darracq for their competition cars.\nOwing to the simultaneous existence of British Talbot cars, French products when sold in Britain were badged Darracq-Talbot or Talbot-Darracq, or even simply Darracq.\n\n\n=== Antonio Lago ===\nIn 1932, after the onset of the Great Depression, Italo-British businessman Antonio Lago was appointed managing director in the hope that he might revive Automobiles Talbot's business. Lago began this process, but the owners were unable to stave off receivership beyond the end of 1934. The receiver did not immediately close Automobiles Talbot, and in 1936 Antonio Lago managed to complete a management buy-out from the receiver.\n\n\n== Reorganisation under Tony Lago ==\nFor 1935, the existing range continued in production but from 1936 these were steadily replaced with cars designed by Walter Becchia, featuring transverse leaf-sprung independent suspension. These included the 4-cylinder 2323 cc (13CV) Talbot Type T4 \"Minor\", a surprise introduction at the 1937 Paris Motor Show, and the 6-cylinder 2,696 cc (15CV) Talbot \"Cadette-15\", along with and the 6-cylinder 2,996 cc or 3,996 cc (17 or 23CV) Talbot \"Major\" and its long-wheelbase version, the Talbot \"Master\": these were classified as Touring cars (voitures de tourisme).There was also in the second half of the 1930s a range of Sporting cars (voitures de sport) which started with the Talbot \"Baby-15\", mechanically the same as the \"Cadette-15\" but using a shorter slightly lighter chassis. The Sporting Cars range centred on the 6-cylinder 2,996 cc or 3,996 cc (17 or 23CV) Talbot \"Baby\" and also included the 3,996 cc (23CV) 23 and sporting Lago-Sp\u00e9ciale and Lago-SS models, respectively with two and three  carburettors, and corresponding increases in power and performance. The most frequently specified body for the Lago-SS was built by Figoni et Falaschi, and featured a particularly eye-catching aerodynamic form.Lago was an excellent engineer who developed the existing six-cylinder engine into a high-performance 4-litre one.  The sporting six-cylinder models had a great racing history. The bodies\u2014such as of the T150 coup\u00e9\u2014were made by excellent coachbuilders such as Figoni et Falaschi or Saoutchik.\n\n\n=== Talbot-Lago models 1935\u20131940 ===\nAlthough the proliferation of cars types and model names that followed Lago's acquisition of the business is at first glance bewildering, it actually involved only four standard chassis lengths as follows:\n\nShort Ch\u00e2ssis (2,950 mm (116.1 in) wheelbase):\nMinor T4 (4 cylinders, 2323 cc)\nJunior 11\nBaby-15 (6 cylinders, 2696 cc)\nBaby 3 litres (6 cylinders, 2996 cc)\nT150 3 litres (6 cylinders, 2996 cc)\nBaby 4 litres (6 cylinders, 3996 cc)\nLago Sp\u00e9cial (6 cylinders, 3996 cc with twin or triple carbs)\nExtra short Ch\u00e2ssis (2,650 mm (104.3 in) wheelbase):\nLago SS (6 cylinders, 3996 cc with triple carbs)\nNormal Ch\u00e2ssis (3,200 mm (126.0 in) wheelbase):\nCadette-15 (6 cylinders, 2696 cc)\nMajor 3 litres (6 cylinders, 2996 cc)\nMajor 4 litres (6 cylinders, 3996 cc)\nLong (7-seater) Ch\u00e2ssis (3,450 mm (135.8 in) wheelbase):\nMaster 3 litres (6 cylinders, 2996 cc)\nMaster 4 litres (6 cylinders, 3996 cc)During the early years of the war Walter Becchia left Talbot to work for Citroen, but Lago was joined in 1942 by another exceptional engineer, Carlo Machetti, and from then the two of them were working on the twin camshaft 4483 cc six-cylinder unit that would lie at the heart of the 1946 Talbot T26.\n\n\n== After World War II ==\nAfter the war, the company continued to be known both for successful high-performance racing cars and for large luxurious passenger cars, with extensive sharing of chassis and engine components between the two. Nevertheless, the period was one of economic stagnation and financial stringency. The company had difficulty finding customers, and its finances were stretched.\nIn 1946, the company began production of a new engine design, based on earlier units but with a new cylinder head featuring a twin overhead camshaft. This engine, designed under the leadership of Carlo Marchetti, was in many respects a new engine. A 4483 cc six-cylinder in-line engine was developed for the Talbot Lago Record (1946\u20131952) and for the Talbot Grand Sport 26CV (1947\u20131954). These cars were priced against large luxurious cars from the likes of Delahaye, Delage, Hotchkiss and Salmson. Talbot would remain in the auto-making business for longer than any of these others, and the Talbot name was resurrected in the early 1980s.\n\n\n=== Talbot Lago Record T26 ===\n\nThe Talbot Lago Record T26 was a large car with a fiscal horsepower of 26 CV and a claimed actual power output of 170 hp, delivered to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual gear box, with the option at extra cost of a Wilson pre-selector gear box, and supporting a claimed top speed of 170 km/h (105 mph). The car was commonly sold as a stylish four-door sedan, but a two-door cabriolet was also offered. There were also coachbuilt specials with bodywork by traditionalist firms such as Graber.\n\n\n=== Talbot Lago Grand Sport T26 ===\nThe  T26 Grand Sport (GS) was first displayed in public in October 1947 as a shortened chassis, and only 12 were made during 1948 which was the models's first full year of production. The car was noted for its speed. The engine which produced 170 hp in the Lago Record was adapted to provide 190 bhp (140 kW) or, later, 195 bhp (145 kW) in the GS, and a top speed of around 200 km/h (124 mph) was claimed, depending on the body that was fitted. The car was built for either racing or luxury and benefited directly from Talbot's successful T26C Grand Prix car. As such it was expensive, rare and helped Louis Rosier with his son to win the LeMans 24 Hour race in 1950. The GS replaced the Lago-Record chassis which was named for its remarkable top speed. The GS was one of the world's most powerful production cars at the time. It had several special features from the T26 Grand Prix cars, such as a 4.5-litre inline-6 aluminum cylinder head, a hollowed camshaft, multiport exhaust system and triple carburetors. Chassis details were similar to the Grand Prix cars, but it was longer and wider. It came it two wheelbase lengths -104 and 110 inches (2,800 mm).\nAlmost all the Talbots sold during the late 1940s came with Talbot bodies, constructed in the manufacturer's extensive workshops. The T26 Grand Sport (GS) was the exception, however, and cars were delivered only as bare chassis, requiring customers to choose bespoke bodywork from a specialist coachbuilder.  The GS was a star turn in a dull world and coachbuilders such as Saoutchik, Franay, Oblin, and Figoni et Falaschi competed to trump Talbot's own designers with elaborately elegant bodies.\n\n\n=== Talbot Lago Baby ===\n\nThe Talbot Lago Baby (1948\u20131951) marked the return of a pre-war Talbot model name and was the third model presented by the company during the 1940s. The car was commonly sold as a four-door sedan, but a two-door cabriolet was also offered. Its engine comprised only four cylinders, but the twin overhead camshaft with cylinder valves on both sides of the engine block was again featured: at 2690 cc the engine capacity equated to a fiscal horsepower of 15 CV, which was enough to attract the punitive levels of car tax applied by the French government to large cars. The power output was initially 110 bhp (82 kW), which in 1949 was increased to 120 bhp (89 kW). Although the postwar Baby sedan closely resembled the more powerful Record on a brief glance, the Baby's 2,950 mm wheelbase was slightly shorter than the 3130 mm wheelbase of the Record, and the overall length was correspondingly 200 mm shorter, reflecting the shortened 4-cylinder engine block. Additionally, the cheaper car sat on a simplified suspension set-up. Baby customers could specify as an option a Wilson pre-selector gear box.Talbot Lago manufactured three special made seven-seater presidential cars; one for the President of France, one for the President of Tunisia and one for the royal family in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n=== Talbot-Lago T26C ===\n\nThe T26C was a single-seater racing car with a box section chassis, an unsupercharged 4.5 litre straight six engine and a four speed Wilson preselector gearbox. Chassis and gearbox were derived from the company's 1930s racing cars and were similar to those used on their post-war road cars.The T26C made its racing debut in the 1948 Monaco Grand Prix, finishing second in the hands of Louis Chiron. Grand Prix victories were achieved the following year with Louis Rosier winning the 1949 Belgian Grand Prix  and Louis Chiron winning the 1949 French Grand Prix. A modified two-seat version won the 1950 24 Hours of Le Mans driven by Louis Rosier and Jean-Louis Rosier.Doug Whiteford won the 1952 and 1953 Australian Grand Prix driving a Talbot-Lago T26C.\n\n\n=== New bodies for 1952 ===\nIn 1951, as rumours of the company's financial difficulties intensified, a new Ponton format body appeared for the Talbot Baby and Record. The wheelbases were carried over from the earlier models. Although in many ways strikingly modern, the new car featured a two piece front windscreen in place of the single flat screen of its predecessor, presumably reflecting the difficulties at the time of combining the strength of a windscreen with curved glass at an acceptable price and quality. The new car's large rear window was itself replaced by a larger three-piece \u201cpanoramic\u201d wrap around back window as part of the car's first face-lift, which took place in time for the 1952 Paris Motor Show. The engine specification of the four-cylinder unit was unchanged as was the claimed performance even though the new body was some 100 kg heavier than the old. A new development with the Ponton-bodied cars body was the availability of the larger six-cylinder unit from the Talbot Record in the top-of-the-line Talbot Baby, which in this form was called the Talbot Baby/6 Luxe, and had the slightly longer wheel-base and overall length enforced by the greater length of the six-cylinder engine.\n\n\n=== T14 LS engine / Talbot Lago Sport ===\n\nAt the 1954 Salon de L'Automobile de Paris, Talbot-Lago presented their last new engine: the new four-cylinder still had the typical twin laterally mounted camshafts, although it was upgraded to five main bearings. The new 120 PS (88 kW) 2,491 cc engine was called the T14 LS, but it did not have a car to go in until May 1955 when the Talbot-Lago 2500 Coup\u00e9 T14 LS was finally presented. The first car had all-aluminium bodywork, but later cars used more steel.  Fifty-four of these coup\u00e9s were built, but they proved hard to sell - the stylish bodywork couldn't quite hide the thirties' underpinnings, and the rough engine offered little elasticity nor longevity.Lacking the resources to engineer the necessary improvements, for 1957 Talbot-Lago had to resort to buying in an engine.  They chose the V8 2580 cc made available by BMW, albeit with the bore diameter slightly reduced, to 72.5 mm, which gave rise to a 2476 cc engine displacement, positioning the car (just) within the 14CV car tax band.  Reflecting the company's export plans, Talbot now rebranded the car as the \"Talbot Lago America\" and (finally) came into line with other French automakers by placing the driver on the left side of the car.  However, market response remained lukewarm, and only about a dozen of the BMW powered Talbot Lago Americas were produced.  In the early summer of 1958, Tony Lago decided to accept an offer from Simca president, Henri Pigozzi, for the sale of the Talbot brand to Simca.  The sale of the business went ahead in 1959.With the sale of the business to Simca, the new owners found themselves with a handful of the final Talbot Lago Americas which were awaiting engines.  There was now no question of Simca being permitted, or wishing, to produce cars with BMW engines, and the only solution available was to fit the last batch of cars with Simca's own 2351 cc V8.  This engine had its roots in 1930s Detroit, and was originally provided by Ford to give the (then) Ford Vedette produced by their French subsidiary a flavor of the driving experience offered by an unstressed US style V8 sedan. It was by no stretch of the imagination an engine for a sports car, and even with a second carburetor produced only 95 bhp (71 kW), as against the 138 bhp (103 kW) of the BMW-engined cars from the previous year's production.  Claimed top speed was now 165 km/h (103 mph) in place of the 200 km/h (124 mph) listed the previous year.  At the 1959 Paris Motor Show a stand had been booked for what was by now the Simca-Talbot brand, but a late decision was taken not to exhibit a Lago America and the stand was instead given up to a hastily constructed \"motor show special\" prototype of which, after the motor show, nothing more would be heard.\n\n\n== Commercial and financial ==\nSales data by model were kept confidential, possibly in connection with the company's financial difficulties, but the overall totals for the early 1950s tell a dire story. The Suresnes plant produced 155 cars in 1947, an output which increased by 23 in 1948. 433 cars were produced in 1950, but this then fell to 80 in 1951 and to 34 in 1952.  In 1953 it is thought that the company turned out just 13 of the 26CV Record model and 4 of the 15 CV Babys. During the rest of the decade volumes did not recover significantly; no more than 54 of the T14 LS were built in 1955 and 1956.As the company's commercial trajectory implies, the years following the end of the war were marked by the slow financial collapse of Anthony Lago's Talbot company.  Other luxury automakers whose glory years had been the 1930s fared no better in the 1940s and 1950s than Talbot, with Delage, Delahaye, Hotchkiss and Bugatti disappearing from the car business while Panhard, nimbly if slightly improbably, reinvented itself as a manufacturer of small fuel efficient cars.  Customers with enough money to spend on a luxury car were hard to find, and even among those with sufficient funds, in a country where well into the 1950s the Communists, buoyed by the heroic role played by some of their leaders during the years of Resistance, regularly polled 25% of the vote in national elections, there was little of the \u201clive for today: pay later\u201d spirit that had supported extravagant spending patterns in the 1930s.  Government policy supported the austerity by creating a post-war tax regime that savagely penalised owners of cars with engines above two litres in size, and an Economic Plan, the Pons Plan, which bestowed government favour (and allocations of materials still in short supply such as steel) on just five automakers, these being the businesses that became France's big five automakers in the 1950s and early 60s.  For France's other luxury automakers, meanwhile, including Talbot, the tide had simply gone out.The money ran out, and Anthony Lago was obliged to seek court protection from his creditors, under a procedure known at that time as a \u201dD\u00e9p\u00f4t de bilan\u201d.  On 6 March 1951 the court agreed a debt moratorium which permitted a limited restart to production at the company's Suresnes plant, but the affair provided unwelcome publicity for Talbot's cash flow problems, and the company now experienced increased difficulty in obtaining credit.  Production was also limited by the extent to which it had been necessary to cut the workforce, and by the reputational damage caused by reports of the whole process.The business staggered on till 1959, but never had the financial strength to support the development and production of its last model, the Talbot-Lago 2500 Coup\u00e9 T14 LS, launched after a lengthy gestation in May 1955.  In 1958 Lago decided to throw in the sponge and put the business up for sale.  An offer was received from Henri Pigozzi under the terms of which the remains of the Talbot business would become part of Simca.  In order to avoid bankruptcy, Lago agreed to sell the business on the terms proposed by the Simca president-director, a fellow Italian expatriate.  Talbot-Lago was transferred to Simca in 1959.  Despite the sorry state of the Talbot business during the preceding ten years, commentators suggest that Pigozzi got a good bargain, receiving at Suresnes an industrial site and buildings worth many times the amount paid, along with a brand name that still resonated strongly with anyone old enough to remember the glory days of Talbot.Tony Lago died in 1960.\n\n\n== Today ==\nTalbot-Lagos have become a top-prized car at various auctions. A Figoni et Falaschi-bodied T150C SS Teardrop Coupe, owned by Brooks Stevens, would sell for US$3,535,000 at Christie's Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance auction on Aug 18, 2005, another for US$3,905,000 at the Palm Beach International Concours d'Elegance Gooding & Company auction on January 22, 2006 where it was unanimously voted \"Best in Show\", and another for US$4,620,000 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance RM Auctions Sports & Classics of Monterey auction on August 14, 2010.

          "Red door gallery is a privately owned gallery that deals on the collection of mostly African contemporary art. It\u2019s located at 51b Bishop Oluwole street, Victoria Island Lagos. It\u2019s opened from Monday to Sunday with free entrance. It has a rich collection of art but not so big",
          "I visited and what a disappointment. I could have saved the time, and energy and just went to a rummage sale. It's not the art that disappointed me but the lack of enthusiasm the staff had to visitors. I received a cold welcome, and when I approach this millennial that clearly",
          "This is a beautiful addition to the Lagos art scene. The place is a small two story building. When I went there were about 40-50 pieces of art. The selection is broad and knteresting. My favorite part was actually stumbling upon a book, The Artists of Nigeria. I sat with that",
          "Last year I had an art exhibition at the Red Door. I had not visited since last year and was worried that the standards may not be the same. From the gate to the reception, I was treated almost as a family member of the red door from. Tucked in VI, this serene gallery had it",
          "One of the coolest art galleries in Lagos. Some stunning pieces on display. There are a few places putting African art on a pedestal. Red door stands above them. I got a chance to speak with the owner, Bola. His knowledge of African art in general and the pieces in his",
          "The Red Door Art Gallery is located in an easy to find venue on a major road in Victoria Island. Good parking space so easy to drive in off the road. They offer a great revolving variety of artists with an eclectic mix of work. One of my favourite galleries in Lagos. Definately",
          "This was a great place to visit and spend some time. The art work is stunning to see. My husband and I really enjoyed our visit.",
          "I am impressed that African Art is increasingly popular as evident of the presence of another art gallery like Red Door. Nice vibe here. I need to come to Lagos more often.",
          "A small, but wonderful little art gallery that shows 3-4 artists work when I visited. Staff member was very friendly and helpful and the atmosphere in the gallery was great.",
          "The Red Door is the epitome of tranquility. You can appreciate the pieces in solitude yet should you need more information the curator is available to talk you through. Cool exhibition venue....the team know how to celebrate art. You must pop by whenever you are in Lagos.",
          "I first visited the gallery last year for 'Akintunde Akinleye's' Each passing day Exhibition, the gallery was very peaceful and I had all the time to myself checking out each piece displayed. The curator's were also very helpful taking me around.",
          "Curators were very helpful. Tranquil place and quite cool. Interesting reading the works of Yinka Shonibare.",
          "Spent a whole day visiting galleries and this was first on my list. The curator Dunnu was lovely and she spent time moving around with me whilst introducing me to some of Nigeria's finest. Definitely a gem housing some amazing work!",
          "I was opportune to visit this gallery recently on one evening. The modest front fa\u00e7ade perhaps signpost their ambition to take measured surefooted steps to be a force to be reckoned with. They have a rich collection, well arranged and very enthusiastic employees. It was",
          "The Red Door Gallery is a good place to feed your eyes. Art lovers will be thrilled and non-art lovers can be enticed.",
          "This Gallery, although small, is well appointed with good lighting throughout the gallery. Not overwhelmed with pieces, but sufficiently presented that you can truly enjoy the art on display. Excellent set up.",
          "Fantastic location, wonderfully climate controlled gallery. This space is so tastefully structured and put together. Having been to the gallery several times I never fail to be impressed by the exhibitions, clearly identified for great talent. The glass fronted space at the top",
          "There is quite some competition in the Art space in Lagos these days. Since regular auctions have captured the attention there have been several additions to the number of galleries in Lagos and Red Door is consistently one of the best. Their exhibitions can be the already",
          "Lagos can be hectic, loud and chaotic...but if you're looking for a truly unique experience where you'll be surrounded by beautiful African contemporary art, check out Red Door Art Gallery. Walking into their welcoming Red Door, you forget for a second that you're in Nigeria."

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Third Mainland Bridge is the longest of three bridges connecting Lagos Island to the mainland, the other are the Eko and Carter bridges. It was the longest bridge in Africa until 1996 when the 6th October Bridge located in Cairo was completed.\nThe bridge starts from Oworonshoki which is linked to the Apapa-Oshodi expressway and Lagos-Ibadan expressway, and ends at the Adeniji Adele Interchange on Lagos Island. There is also a link midway through the bridge that leads to Herbert Macaulay Way, Yaba. The bridge was built by Julius Berger Nigeria PLC. The phase one of the project was commissioned by President Shehu Shagari in 1980 and completed by President Ibrahim Babangida in 1990; it measures about 11.8 km in length.\nBy 2006, Many commuters had reported that the Third Mainland Bridge was vibrating noticeably, indicating that it needed urgent attention. As a result, remedial work was commenced on the portions of the bridge at different times, leading to partial closure of the bridge at different times. As at January 2013, this work was completed.\nRecently, there have been rumours of cracks on the bridge. This, however, was denied by authorities. The eight-lane bridge experienced a new look during the last repairing exercise, painting the bridge guide with the colour of Nigeria green, white, green, and also general painting was carried out for a new look. The repair works on the bridge has been completed and was opened on 30 October 2012.\nThe Third Mainland Bridge has very high vehicular traffic on weekdays, as many residents commute to and from the Lagos Mainland to the Island which is the commercial hub of Lagos State. Residents in Ikeja, Agboyi-Ketu, Ikorodu, Isheri, Oworonshoki, Gbagada, Yaba, Maryland and Oshodi. The Third Mainland Bridge is an essential part of Lagos' daily commuting, and as such requires to be constantly renovated. It has also come to be a major Lagos icon, offering different views of Lagos - the Lagos Lagoon, the University of Lagos Waterfront and Makoko, a shanty town built on the Lagos Lagoon.\nOn July 6 2020,it was announced that the bridge will be closed for six months due to repairs.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nIn the 1970s, following the end of Nigeria's civil war, a period of increasing oil price followed and Nigeria went through series of economic upturns. A need for improved infrastructural facilities especially in the capital city of Lagos that had gone through a period of port congestion and then an upward tick in vehicular traffic created the impetus for a third bridge linking the commercial-oriented Lagos Island with the growing urban settlements of mainland Lagos.A contract was awarded for a third mainland bridge in 1976. Construction of the bridge was done in phases. The first phase was contracted to a PGH consortium, a venture consisting, Impresit Girola and Borini Prono, while Trevi Group provided support services for piling. The first phase was designed to be 5 kilometers in length, starting from the Island and ending at Ebute Metta, towards Yaba. The bridge elevates to 3 kilometers above the water and made from pre-stressed reinforced concrete. Foundation piles had varying depths of between 36 and 54 meters and pile diameter is based on potential carrying road, diameters of 1500mm are used for the main bridge crossing the Lagos lagoon and for the slipway and approach roads, pile diameter was between 800mm and 1200mm. The first phase was completed in 1980.The second phase from Ebute-Metta to Oworonshoki was awarded to Julius Berger in Nigeria.\n\n\n== Daily traffic on Third Mainland Bridge ==\nAccording to a traffic report on Third Mainland Bridge in 2002, the number of vehicles in both directions recorded in 12 hours was 180,902 vehicles, which may have doubled or tripled after 16 years.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCoordinates: 6\u00b030\u203200\u2033N 3\u00b024\u203205\u2033E\nSome certain articulated vehicles and trailers have been restricted from using the bridge.",

        "wiki": "Omenka Gallery is a Nigerian contemporary art gallery, which represents Nigerian and international artists at its exhibition space in Lagos.\n\n\n== History ==\nOmenka Gallery was founded in Lagos in 2003 by Nigerian artist, curator and art administrator Oliver Enwonwu. Enwonwu's father, Ben Enwonwu, (1917-1994) was one of Nigeria's leading, 20th-century, modernist artists.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nSince 2003, Omenka Gallery's programme of solo and group exhibitions has introduced new work by established and emerging Nigerian and international artists. Exhibitions, like the 2009 show, A perspective on contemporary Nigerian photography, focused public attention on developing trends in the Nigerian artworld by featuring new talents, like George Osodi  (b.1974), alongside renowned masters such as J.D. \u2018Okhai Ojeikere (1930-2014). Omenka gallery also hosted 'Insanity' the first Hyperrealism group exhibition in Nigeria which featured hyperrealists like Arinze Stanley, Ken Nwadiogbu and Ayo Filade. In the following decade, the gallery's programme developed its international profile, with exhibitions such as Having Travelled Far, which showcased a group of established, Europe-based artists of African heritage: Godfried Donkor (b.1964), Owusu-Ankomah (b. 1956), Manuela Sambo (b. 1964), EL Loko (b. 1950), and Ransome Stanley (b. 1953). The gallery has also participated in international art fairs, including Art15 in London, Art Dubai in the United Arab Emirates\n, and The Armory Show in New York.\n\n\n== List of represented artists ==\nAbass Kelani (b. 1979)\nCedric Nunn (b. 1957)\nDominique Zinkp\u00e8 (b. 1969)\nDuke Asidere (b. 1961)\nEbenezer Akinola (b. 1968)\nGary Stephens (b. 1952)\nIma Mfon (b. 1989)\nJoel Mpah Dooh (b. 1956)\nKimathi Donkor (b. 1965)\nNathalie Mba Bikoro (b. 1985)\nNnenna Okore (b. 1975)\nOwusu-Ankomah (b. 1956)\nJames Iroha Uchechukwu (b. 1972)\nWilliams Chechet (b. 1981)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website for Omenka Gallery",

        "wiki": "Lagos (, US also ; Yoruba: \u00c8k\u00f3) is the most populous city in Nigeria and all of Africa. Lagos is a major financial centre for all of Africa and is the economic hub of Lagos State. The megacity has the fourth-highest GDP in Africa and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports on the continent. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world.Lagos initially emerged as a port city that originated on a collection of islands, which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos Island, Eti-Osa, Amuwo-Odofin and Apapa. The islands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon, while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach, which stretch up to 100 km (62 mi) east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanization, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland, Ajeromi-Ifelodun and Surulere. This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the Island, which was the initial city of Lagos, before it expanded into the area known as the Mainland. This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council, until the creation of Lagos State in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the then Western Region to form the state.Lagos, the capital of Nigeria since its amalgamation in 1914, went on to become the capital of Lagos State after its creation. However, the state capital was later moved to Ikeja in 1976, and the federal capital moved to Abuja in 1991. Even though Lagos is still widely referred to as a city, the present day Lagos, also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\", and officially as \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\" is an urban agglomeration or conurbation, consisting of 16 LGAs including Ikeja, the state capital of Lagos State. This conurbation makes up 37% of Lagos State's total land area, but houses about 85% of the state's total population.The exact population of Metropolitan Lagos is disputed. In the 2006 federal census data, the conurbation had a population of about 8 million people. However, the figure was disputed by the Lagos State Government, which later released its own population data, putting the population of Lagos Metropolitan Area at approximately 16 million. As of 2015, unofficial figures put the population of \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\", which includes Lagos and its surrounding metro area, extending as far as into Ogun State, at approximately 21 million.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLagos was originally inhabited by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba people in the 15th century. Under the leadership of the Oloye Olofin, the Awori moved to an island now called Iddo and then to the larger Lagos Island. In the 16th century, the Awori settlement was conquered by the Benin Empire and the island became a Benin war-camp called \"Eko\" under Oba Orhogbua, the Oba of Benin at the time. Eko is still the native name for Lagos.\nLagos, which means \"lakes\", was a name given to the settlement by the Portuguese. Throughout history, it was home to a number of warring ethnic groups who had settled in the area. Following its early settlement by the Awori nobility, and its conquest by the Bini warlords of Benin, the state first came to the attention of the Portuguese in the 15th century.Portuguese explorer Rui de Sequeira visited the area in 1472, naming the area around the city Lago de Curamo. Another explanation is that Lagos is named after a major port in Portugal\u2014a maritime town that, at the time, was the main centre of Portuguese expeditions down the African coast, Lagos, Portugal.\nIn Britain's early 19th century fight against the transatlantic slave trade, its West Africa Squadron or Preventative Squadron as it was also known, continued to pursue Portuguese, American, French and Cuban slave ships and to impose anti-slavery treaties with West African coastal chiefs with so much doggedness that they created a strong presence along the West African coast from Sierra Leone all the way to the Niger Delta (today's Nigeria) and as far south as Congo. In 1849, Britain appointed John Beecroft Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, a position he held (along with his governorship of Fernando Po) until his death in 1854. John Duncan was appointed Vice Consul and was located at Wydah. At the time of Beecroft's appointment, the Kingdom of Lagos (under Oba Kosoko) was in the western part of the Consulate of the Bights of Benin and Biafra and was a key slave trading port. In 1851 and with pressure from liberated slaves who now wielded political and business influence, Britain intervened in Lagos in what is now known as the Bombardment of Lagos or Capture of Lagos resulting in the installation of Oba Akitoye and the ouster of Oba Kosoko. Oba Akitoye then signed the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos abolishing slavery. The signing of the 1852 treaty ushered in the Consular Period in Lagos' history wherein Britain provided military protection for Lagos.Following threats from Kosoko and the French who were positioned at Wydah, a decision was made by Lord Palmerston (British Prime Minister) who noted in 1861, \"the expediency of losing no time in assuming the formal Protectorate of Lagos\". William McCoskry, the Acting Consul in Lagos with Commander Bedingfield convened a meeting with Oba Dosunmu on 30 July 1861 aboard HMS Prometheus where Britain's intent was explained and a response to the terms were required by August 1861. Dosunmu resisted the terms of the treaty but under the threat to unleash violence on Lagos by Commander Bedingfield, Dosunmu relented and signed the Lagos Treaty of Cession on 6 August 1861.\n\nLagos was declared a colony on 5 March 1862. The remainder of modern-day Nigeria was seized in 1887, and when the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was established in 1914, Lagos became its capital, continuing as such after the country's independence from Britain in 1960. Along with migrants from all over Nigeria and other West African nations were the returnee ex-slaves known as Creoles, who came from Freetown, Sierra Leone, Brazil and the West Indies to Lagos. The Creoles contributed to Lagos' modernisation and their knowledge of Portuguese architecture can still be seen from the architecture on Lagos Island. Since the 19th century, Lagos gradually transformed to a melting pot of Africans and Europeans. Railway links and telephone cables connecting Lagos to London had been established by 1886. Electric street lighting was introduced in the city in 1898. Lagos experienced rapid growth throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a result of Nigeria's economic boom.Before the creation of Lagos State on 27 May 1967, Lagos, which was the country's capital had been administered directly by the Federal Government as a Federal Territory through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs, while the Lagos City Council (LCC) governed the city. Lagos, along with the towns from the then Western region (Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu, Epe and Badagry), were eventually captured to create Lagos State. Lagos city was split into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), while the other towns now make up 13 LGAs in the state. Lagos played the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital until 1976 when the state capital was moved to Ikeja. Lagos was adversely affected during Nigeria's military rule. Also, on 12 December 1991, the seat of the Federal Government was also formally relocated to Abuja. However, Lagos remains the financial centre of the country, and also grew to become the most populous conurbation in the country.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLagos is loosely classified into two main geographical areas\u2014the \"Island\" and the \"Mainland\".\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n==== Island ====\n\nThe Island is a loose geographical term that is used to define the area of Lagos that is separated from the \"mainland\" by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic Ocean, which forms Lagos Harbour. The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected together by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events in Lagos takes place. It also houses most of the upscale residential areas in Lagos. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be in the Island include Lagos Island, Eti-Osa. The major upscale island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include Ikoyi and Victoria Island. Three major bridges join the island to the mainland. They are the Carter Bridge, which starts from Iddo; the Eko Bridge (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the Third Mainland Bridge, which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon.\n\n\n===== Lagos Island =====\n\nLagos Island contains a central business district. This district is characterized by high-rise buildings. The island also contains many of the city's largest wholesale marketplaces (such as the popular Idumota and Balogun Markets). It also has the National Museum of Nigeria, the Central Mosque, the Glover Memorial Hall, Christ's Church Cathedral (CMS) and the Oba's Palace (Iga Idunganran). Another major part of Lagos Island is Marina. It borders around the idumota and Balogun markets and houses major Banking institutions. Though formerly in a derelict condition, Lagos Island's Tinubu Square is a site of historical importance; it was here that the Amalgamation Ceremony that unified the North and South protectorate to form Nigeria took place in 1914.\n\n\n===== Ikoyi =====\n\nIkoyi is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a land fill. Ikoyi is also connected to Victoria Island by Falomo bridge, which carries the main road over Five Cowrie creek. Ikoyi housed the headquarters of the federal government of Nigeria and other buildings owned by the government, including the old federal secretariat complex. The complex today is on reestablishment.In Ikoyi there are military and police barracks, a top-security prison and a federal high court of Nigeria. Ikoyi also has a number of hotels, night clubs, a recreational park and one of Africa's largest golf courses. Originally a middle class neighbourhood, in recent years, it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the upper middle class to the upper class. There are also commercial activities in Ikoyi, which is spotted in an increasing number of offices, banks, and shopping complexes. The commercial section is concentrated in the South-West.\n\n\n===== Victoria Island =====\n\nVictoria Island with its annexe is situated to the south of Lagos Island. It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments are blooming up everywhere.\nAlong with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts of several sizeable shopping districts. On its sea shore along the Atlantic front, there is environmentally reconstructed Bar Beach.\n\n\n===== Iddo =====\nAcross the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called Iddo. Iddo is also a railroad terminus and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland local government area after it was connected to the mainland like a peninsula.\n\n\n==== Mainland ====\nA huge population of Lagosians also live on the Lagos mainland, and most industries are located there. The mainland is known for its music and nightlife, which used to be located in areas around Yaba and Surulere. However, in recent years more night clubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island, Ikate and Lekki Phase 1) the main nightlife attractions. Mainland LGAs include Surulere, Apapa, and Lagos Mainland. Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: Agege, Amuwo Odofin, Mushin, Oshodi-Isolo and Ikeja (site of Murtala Muhammed International Airport and the capital of Lagos State).\nMajor Areas on the mainland include Ebute Metta, Yaba and Ejigbo. Some rivers, like Badagry Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLagos experiences a tropical savanna climate (Aw) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, as there's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season. The wet season starts in April and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in March. The wettest month is June with precipitation total 315.5 millimetres (12.42 in), while the driest month is January with precipitation total 13.2 millimetres (0.52 in).\nLocated near the equator, Lagos has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging 28.3\u201332.9 \u00b0C (82.9\u201391.2 \u00b0F). Lagos shares the seasons of the Southern Hemisphere, with summer highs in March, daily range 32.9\u201324.1 \u00b0C (91.2\u201375.4 \u00b0F), and warm winters in August, ranging 28.3\u201321.8 \u00b0C (82.9\u201371.2 \u00b0F) as the daily average.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nLagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria. The architectural styles in Lagos are diverse and range from tropical and vernacular to colonial European and ultramodern buildings or a mixture. Brazilian style architecture brought by the creoles is evident in buildings such as Water House and  Shitta Bey Mosque. Skyscrapers and most high rise buildings are centered on the islands, while the mainland has some high rise buildings. In recent years, the Lagos State government has renovated existing parks and green areas, with a long-term goal of expansion. Many good quality buildings are interspersed across the city.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, there are Christian churches and temples: Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of Nigeria (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Nigerian Baptist Convention (Baptist World Alliance), The Apostolic Church Nigeria (TACN), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Assemblies of God, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos (Catholic Church) and Muslim mosques such as Lagos Central Mosque in Lagos- island, Wahab Folawiyo Central Mosque in Surulere, Lekki Central Mosque in Lekki, The Syrian Mosque in Ikoyi. There are also various shrines and temples for traditional worshipers scattered across the state and they include several Igbo Igunnuko shrines, Egungun shrines, Eyo Shrines and other various traditional shrines and places of worship. For the 25,000 strong Hindu community, there is an ISKCON temple and three other Hindu temples dotted around the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn terms of administration, Lagos is not a single municipality and therefore has no overall city administration. The geographical city limits of Metropolitan Lagos comprises 16 of the 20 Local Government Areas, which together comprise Lagos State. The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region. The Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi, and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several Local Government Areas (most notably Lagos Island LGA, Lagos Mainland LGA and Eti-Osa LGA).The mainland beyond the Municipality of Lagos, on the other hand, comprised several separate towns and settlements such as Mushin, Ikeja and Agege. In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom, Lagos experienced a population explosion, untamed economic growth, and unmitigated rural migration. This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly, thus forming the present day \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\", also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\". The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them.\nBy 2006, the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State's boundaries and attained a megacity status. This much larger area is referred to as \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\" or \"Lagos Megacity Region\", which is a continuous built up land area of additional 1,535.4 square kilometres (592.8 square miles), comprising sprawls in LGAs situated next to Lagos' eastern and western city limits in Lagos State, and beyond northern limits, spilling into the LGAs in adjoining Ogun State. Ogun State LGAs within Greater Metropolitan Lagos majorly include: Obafemi Owode, Sagamu, Ifo, Ado-Odo/Ota and part of Ewekoro.\n\nToday, the word Lagos most often refers to the urban area, called \"Metropolitan Lagos\" in Nigeria, which includes both the islands of the former municipality of Lagos and the mainland suburbs. Lagos State government is responsible for some of the utilities including roads and transportation, power, water, health and education. Metropolitan Lagos extends over 16 of the 20 LGAs of Lagos State, and contains about 85% of the population of Lagos State, and includes semi-rural areas. Lagos City has a considerable number of high-rise buildings that dominate its skyline. Most of the tall buildings are located in the downtown Central Business District.\nLagos was the former capital city of Nigeria but it has since been replaced by Abuja. Abuja officially gained its status as the capital of Nigeria on 12 December 1991, although the decision to move the federal capital had been made in now Act no. 6 of 1976. Lagos is also home to the High Court of the Lagos State Judiciary, housed in an old colonial building on Lagos Island.\n\n\n=== Census data for Lagos ===\nAlthough the 2006 National Population Census of Nigeria credited the metropolitan area with a population figure of 7,937,932, the figure is at variance with some projections by the UN and other population agencies and groups worldwide. The population figure of Lagos State given by the Lagos State Government is 17,553,924. It was based on claimed conducted enumeration for social planning by the Lagos State Government \"parallel census\" and it believes that since the inhabitants of the metropolitan area of Lagos constitute 88% of the Lagos State population, the population of metropolitan Lagos is about 15.5 million.A rejoinder to Lagos State Government views concluded that Lagos State concealed the fact that the population projection, for Lagos Urban Agglomeration by the UN agencies had been revised downwards substantially as early as 2003. It failed to interpret the two most important and fairly representative and reliable secondary data sets already in public domain, the National Identity Card Scheme and the 2003 Voters Registration figures from INEC. The figures for 2007 Voters Registration by INEC were an act subsequent to the release of the provisional census results and comprehensively corroborate, vindicate and validate the population figures in no uncertain terms.\nAccording to the official results of the 2006 census, there were 8,048,430 inhabitants in Metropolitan Lagos. This figure was lower than anticipated, and has created controversy in Nigeria. Lagos Island, the central Local Government Area and historic centre of Metropolitan Lagos, had a population of 212,700 at the 2006 Census.\n\nAuthorities of Lagos State have attacked the results of the 2006 census, accusing the Nigerian National Population Commission of having undercounted the population of the state. This accusation is denied by the National Population Commission. A study found that research carried out by Africapolis (the African subsidiary of e-Geopolis backed by the Agence fran\u00e7aise de d\u00e9veloppement), in addition to the cross-referencing of official figures with more scientific independent research concluded that the 2006 census figures for Lagos State of about 9 million were valid and that the state's own assessments are inflated.Lagos is, by most estimates, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Lagos is currently experiencing a population increase of about 275,000 persons per annum. In 1999 the United Nations predicted that the city's metropolitan area, which had only about 290,000 inhabitants in 1950, would exceed 20 million by 2010 and thus become one of the ten most populated cities in the world.\n\nThere is a huge spectrum of wealth distribution among the people that reside in Lagos. It ranges from the very wealthy to the very poor. Lagos has attracted many young people and families seeking a better life from all other parts of Nigeria and beyond and this has also contributed to its cosmopolitan status. Some people are leaving Lagos and Nigeria in search of better living conditions, cities like Townsville in Australia are very popular with expats and have services set up to assist people in settling into their new life.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Lagos is a major economic focal point in Nigeria, generating around 10% of the country's GDP. Most commercial and financial business is carried out in the central business district situated on the island. This is also where most of the country's commercial banks, financial institutions and major corporations are headquartered. Lagos is also the major Information Communications and Telecommunications (ICT) hub of West Africa and potentially, the biggest ICT market in the continent. Lagos is developing a 24-hour economy and has also been ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the world. In some parts of Lagos, residents have one of the highest standards of living in Nigeria and in Africa. At the same time, a sizable proportion of the residents live in slums without access to piped water and sanitation.The Port of Lagos is Nigeria's leading port and one of the largest and busiest in Africa. It is administered by the Nigerian Ports Authority and it is split into three main sections: Lagos port, in the main channel next to Lagos Island, Apapa Port (site of the container terminal) and Tin Can Port, both located in Badagry Creek, which flows into Lagos Harbour from the west. The port features a railhead. The port has seen growing amounts of crude oil exported, with export figures rising between 1997 and 2000. Oil and petroleum products provide 14% of GDP and 90% of foreign exchange earnings in Nigeria as a whole.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music and film industry ===\nLagos is famous throughout Africa for its music scene. Lagos has a vibrant nightlife and has given birth to a variety of styles such as Sakara music, Nigerian hip hop, highlife, juju, fuji, Afrobeat, and Afrobeats.Lagos is the centre of the Nigerian movie industry, often referred to as 'Nollywood'. Idumota market on Lagos Island is the primary distribution centre. Many films are shot in the Festac area of Lagos, where the World Festival of Black Arts was held.Iganmu is home to the primary centre for the performing arts and artistes in Nigeria: the National Arts Theatre.\nJames Brown performed in Lagos in 1970. Paul McCartney recorded his fifth post-Beatles album, Band on the Run, in an EMI studio in Lagos in August and September 1973. Other foreign musicians who have also performed in the city include Sean Paul, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Akon, Jarule, Ashanti, Usher, Shaggy, R Kelly, Cardi B, Migos especially during the Star Mega Jam; Shakira, John Legend, Boyz II Men T-Pain, Brian McKnight, JayZ, Mary J. Blige, Beyonc\u00e9, Brandy, Ciara, Keri Hilson and Lauryn Hill, among others.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nAssociation football is Lagos' most popular sport. Prominent Lagos football clubs include Bridge Boys F.C. MFM F.C. and First Bank: both play in Nigeria National League, the second tier of Nigerian football.\n\nThe Nigeria national football team, also known as the Super Eagles, used to play almost all of their home games in Lagos at the National Stadium in Surulere; much later, games were played at the then New Abuja National Stadium in Abuja for sometime; however, games are now mostly played at the newer Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, which is the default home of the Super Eagles. Lagos also hosted the 2nd All-African games in 1973.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLagos, subsequent to the re-modernization project achieved by the previous administration of Governor Raji Babatunde Fashola, is gradually becoming a major tourist destination, being one of the largest cities in Africa and in the world. Lagos is currently taking steps to become a global city. The 2009 Eyo carnival (a yearly festival originated from Iperu Remo, Ogun State), which took place on 25 April, was a step toward world city status. Currently, Lagos is primarily known as a business-oriented and a fast-paced community.Lagos has become an important location for African and \"black\" cultural identity. Many festivals are held in Lagos; festivals vary in offerings each year and may be held in different months. Some of the festivals are Festac Food Fair held in Festac Town Annually, Eyo Festival, Lagos Black Heritage Carnival, Lagos Carnival, Eko International Film Festival, Lagos Seafood Festac Festival, LAGOS PHOTO Festival and the Lagos Jazz Series, which is a unique franchise for high-quality live music in all genres with a focus on jazz. Established in 2010, the popular event takes place over a 3\u20135 day period at selected high quality outdoor venues. The music is as varied as the audience itself and features a diverse mix of musical genres from rhythm and blues to soul, Afrobeat, hip hop, bebop, and traditional jazz. The festivals provide entertainment of dance and song to add excitement to travelers during a stay in Lagos.\nLagos has a number of sandy beaches by the Atlantic Ocean, including Elegushi Beach and Alpha Beach. Lagos also has a number of private beach resorts including Inagbe Grand Beach Resort and several others in the outskirts.\nLagos has a variety of hotels ranging from three star to five star hotels, with a mixture of local hotels such as Eko Hotels and Suites, Federal Palace Hotel and franchises of multinational chains such as Intercontinental Hotel, Sheraton and Four Points by Sheraton. Other places of interest include the Tafawa Balewa Square, Festac town, The Nike Art Gallery, Freedom Park, Lagos and the Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nSome of the famous cuisines in Lagos include indigenous delicacies such as eba and egusi; amala and ewedu; jollof; ofada rice; plantains (locally called dodo); beans; suya (spicy shish kebab or spiced roasted beef), which is consumed in local clubs and bars with a bottle of cold beer; and eba, made from cassava and eaten with soups prepared with vegetables and mixture of spices and herbs. Other cuisines range from local ones like Iyan (pounded yam) made from yam flour, amala; asaro, which is usually eaten with various kind of vegetables; and Egusi (melon soup) to European, Middle-Eastern, and Asian cuisine.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Lagos State Government operates state schools. The education system is the 6-3-3-4 system, which is practised throughout the country (as well as by many other members of the Economic Community of West African States). The levels are Primary, Junior Secondary School (JSS), Senior Secondary School (SSS) and university. All children are offered basic education, with special focus now on the first nine years. Many of the schools in Nigeria are federally funded and usually are boarding schools. A few examples are Federal government college Odogbolu (FGCOdogbolu), Federal government girls college Sagamu (FGGCSagamu) and Federal government college Kano (FGCKano). The state of Lagos has its own federally funded high schools namely Federal government college Ijanikin also known as FGC Lagos, Kings College and Queens College.\nLagos is home to various postsecondary schools, universities and other vocational institutions that are either operated by the government or private entities.\n\n\n=== Vocational schools ===\nInstitute for Industrial Technology (IIT) : founded in 2000, IIT is a technical vocational school for male youth from families with limited resources. Its educational model is based on the Dual Training System.\n\n\n=== Polytechnics ===\nYaba College of Technology (YABATECH) : founded in 1934, the college is Nigeria's first higher educational institution and third in Africa. The college is a center of culture and heritage. Currently it has student enrolment of over 16,000.\nLagos State Polytechnic is a polytechnic comprising more than six schools including private polytechnics and was founded 25 years ago. Its main campus resides at Ikorodu, along Shagamu road.\nLagos City Polytechnic, located at 6/8, Bashiru Oweh Street, Off Simbiat Abiola Road (formerly Medical Road), Ikeja \u2013 This is the first private Polytechnic in Nigeria. It was established in 1990 by Engr. Babatunde Odufuwa. Engr. Odufuwa hails from Oke-Aye in Ijebu North East Local Government Area (I.N.E.L.G) of Ogun State.\nGrace Polytechnic\nWolex Polytechnic\nFederal College of Fisheries and Marine Technology is a monotechnic that offers courses in fisheries technology, general science, marine engineering and nautical science.\nFederal College of Education (tech) Akoka\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nThe University of Lagos (UNILAG) Akoka, is a large institution dating from 1962, with over 55,000 students. It comprises 13 faculties, run by over 4,000 staff.\nLagos State University (LASU) is a multi-campus university established in the year 1983 and owned by the Lagos State government. The main campus is located at Ojo, along the Lagos-Badagry Expressway.\nPan-Atlantic University formerly known as Pan-African University has a business school (LBS), a school of Media and communication (SMC) and an entrepreneurial development center (EDC), specialized in providing short courses for SMEs.

For example, the oldest Nigerian hospital is located in the city as well as West Africa's first air-operated emergency medical service, which commenced in the city. The Lagos healthcare system is generally divided into public and private sectors that provide medical services at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Although the private hospitals are usually more expensive, it does not necessarily translate to better health-care delivery.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nLagos has one of the largest and most extensive road networks in West Africa. It also has suburban trains and some ferry services. Highways are usually congested in peak hours, due in part to the geography of the city, as well as to its explosive population growth. Lagos is also linked by many highways and bridges. A new rail system that is supposed to span the length of the Badagry expressway is currently under construction.\nThe Lagos\u2013Ibadan Expressway and the Lagos\u2013Abeokuta Expressway are the major controlled-access highways in the north of the city and serve as inter-state highways to Oyo State and Ogun State respectively. To the west the congested Lagos\u2013Badagry Expressway serves outlying towns such as Festival Town, which was the location for the 1977 Festival of Black Arts and Culture 77.Lagos's importance as a commercial centre and port and its strategic location have led to it being the end-point of three Trans-African Highway routes using Nigeria's national roads. The Trans\u2013West African Coastal Highway leaves the city as the Badagry Expressway to Benin and beyond as far as Dakar and Nouakchott; the Trans-Sahara Highway to Algiers, which is close to completion, leaves the city as the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.Lagos State has a bus rapid transit (BRT) system; the first phase was completed in February 2008. It is expected to operate along eight routes using specially designated bus rapid transit lanes running through the city, with the aim of expanding to other routes in the future.\nThe first phase of the Lagos BRT runs 19 km (12 mi) through Ikorodu Road and Funsho Williams Avenue up to CMS. After weeks of test runs, operations started on 17 March 2008, six months earlier than planned. Also, the signature color of Lagos state 14-seater bus (known as Danfo) is yellow with a touch of black.\nIt has been estimated that the system will transport about 10,000 passengers in each direction per hour during peak travel times. At these times traffic congestion, called \"Go Slow\", by Lagosians, can be extreme. The LAMATA bus rapid transit corridor covers a distance of about 22 km (14 mi). The system is run by two operators, NURTW Cooperative (Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers) and Lagbus, a Lagos State Government owned Asset Management Company that contributes about 180 high-capacity buses for the implementation of the first phase Mile 12 to CMS BRT Lite system.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nAn extensive urban rail system, Lagos Rail Mass Transit, running through the Lagos metropolis is currently under construction. Several intercity and commuter trains serve Lagos through the Lagos Terminus railway station.\n\n\n=== Ferries ===\nLagos State Ferry Services Corporation runs a few regular routes, for example between Lagos Island and the mainland, served by modern ferries and wharves. Private boats run irregular passenger services on the lagoon and on some creeks.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLagos is served by Murtala Muhammed International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in Africa. The MMIA is Nigeria's premier international air gateway. The airport's history dates back to colonial times, around the time of the Second World War. The current international airport terminal was built and commissioned over 40 years ago, in 1978. The terminal opened officially March 15, 1979. The airport had been known simply as the Lagos International Airport. It was, however, renamed for the late Nigerian Head of State, General Murtala Muhammed, who died in 1976.\nThe airport terminal has been renovated several times since the 1970s but its most radical makeover began in 2013, following the launch of the Federal government's multi-billion naira Remodelling/ Rehabilitation Programme for its airports nationwide. Under the re-modeling work there, by late in 2014, the MMlA lounge area had been expanded to four times its previous size and new passenger handling conveyor systems installed which can handle over 1,000 passengers per hour.\nA second airport, Lekki-Epe International Airport is proposed.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAbike Dabiri, Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission\nAgbani Darego, Miss Nigeria 2001, Semifinalist Miss Universe 2001 and Miss World 2001\nAkinwunmi Ambode, former Governor of Lagos state\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, Governor of Lagos State\nBabatunde Fashola, Former Governor of Lagos and current Minister of Power, Works and Housing\nBode George, Politician\nBola Tinubu, Former Governor of Lagos State\nBuchi Emecheta, novelist\nFunsho Williams, politician and one time aspirant to the office of Lagos state governor\nHakeem Olajuwon, professional basketball player\nIsrael Adesanya, UFC Middle weight champion\nIsrael Idonije, Professional American football player, Chicago Bears 2003\u20132013, Detroit Lions 2013\nNelson Agholor, Professional American football player, Super Bowl 52 Champion with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018\nRilwan Akiolu, Oba (traditional ruler) of Lagos\nToyin Saraki, global health advocate and healthcare philanthropist\nYemi Osinbajo, politician, lawyer and current Vice-President of Nigeria\nYvonne Orji, Actress, Comedian\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\n\nLagos is twinned with:\n Gary, Indiana, United States, since 1991\n Atlanta, Georgia, United States, since 1974\n Bucharest, Romania\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of largest cities\nList of Governors of Lagos State\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLeithead, Alastair (August 2017).

          "I have been three times - partly in the hope that it would get better and that I might have missed something. For a National museum there are so few exhibits and what exists is badly displayed. It could be so much better if someone 'loved' it a bit. History does not seem"

        "wiki": "The Federal Palace Hotel is a 150-room hotel that overlooks the Atlantic Ocean, located in the commercial hub of Victoria Island in Lagos. Established in 1960 as the country's premier international hotel, it was originally owned by the Victoria Beach Hotel, as part of the A. G. Leventis trading group. Considered \"a landmark of the Lagos metropolis\", the hotel is notable for having been the setting for the signing of Nigeria's Declaration of Independence. It has been a Sun International property since 2007.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Federal Palace Hotel is a Sun International property. Sun International \u2013 best known for its Sun City Resort in the North West Province, Rustenburg \u2013 traces its roots back to 1969, when the Southern Sun Hotel Company was created with South African Breweries and Sol Kerzner joining forces.\nWhen Nigeria gained its independence from Britain in 1960, it was in the main boardroom of the newly constructed Federal Palace Hotel that Nigeria's independence declaration was signed. This boardroom is now one of the main features of the hotel's casino. The official celebration of Nigeria's independence took place in the hotel's Independence Hall, which, also in 1977, hosted the summit of Heads of State of the African Union (formerly Organisation of Africa Unity) and the Festival of African Arts and Culture (FESTAC).The Federal Palace Hotel is associated with the Heritage Environmental Programme that serves to recognise and identify environmentally responsible companies and products in Nigeria.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of hotels in Lagos\n Nigeria portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSun International website",

        "wiki": "Lagos (, US also ; Yoruba: \u00c8k\u00f3) is the most populous city in Nigeria and all of Africa. Lagos is a major financial centre for all of Africa and is the economic hub of Lagos State. The megacity has the fourth-highest GDP in Africa and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports on the continent. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world.Lagos initially emerged as a port city that originated on a collection of islands, which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos Island, Eti-Osa, Amuwo-Odofin and Apapa. The islands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon, while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach, which stretch up to 100 km (62 mi) east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanization, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland, Ajeromi-Ifelodun and Surulere. This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the Island, which was the initial city of Lagos, before it expanded into the area known as the Mainland. This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council, until the creation of Lagos State in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the then Western Region to form the state.Lagos, the capital of Nigeria since its amalgamation in 1914, went on to become the capital of Lagos State after its creation. However, the state capital was later moved to Ikeja in 1976, and the federal capital moved to Abuja in 1991. Even though Lagos is still widely referred to as a city, the present day Lagos, also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\", and officially as \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\" is an urban agglomeration or conurbation, consisting of 16 LGAs including Ikeja, the state capital of Lagos State. This conurbation makes up 37% of Lagos State's total land area, but houses about 85% of the state's total population.The exact population of Metropolitan Lagos is disputed. In the 2006 federal census data, the conurbation had a population of about 8 million people. However, the figure was disputed by the Lagos State Government, which later released its own population data, putting the population of Lagos Metropolitan Area at approximately 16 million. As of 2015, unofficial figures put the population of \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\", which includes Lagos and its surrounding metro area, extending as far as into Ogun State, at approximately 21 million.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLagos was originally inhabited by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba people in the 15th century. Under the leadership of the Oloye Olofin, the Awori moved to an island now called Iddo and then to the larger Lagos Island. In the 16th century, the Awori settlement was conquered by the Benin Empire and the island became a Benin war-camp called \"Eko\" under Oba Orhogbua, the Oba of Benin at the time. Eko is still the native name for Lagos.\nLagos, which means \"lakes\", was a name given to the settlement by the Portuguese. Throughout history, it was home to a number of warring ethnic groups who had settled in the area. Following its early settlement by the Awori nobility, and its conquest by the Bini warlords of Benin, the state first came to the attention of the Portuguese in the 15th century.Portuguese explorer Rui de Sequeira visited the area in 1472, naming the area around the city Lago de Curamo. Another explanation is that Lagos is named after a major port in Portugal\u2014a maritime town that, at the time, was the main centre of Portuguese expeditions down the African coast, Lagos, Portugal.\nIn Britain's early 19th century fight against the transatlantic slave trade, its West Africa Squadron or Preventative Squadron as it was also known, continued to pursue Portuguese, American, French and Cuban slave ships and to impose anti-slavery treaties with West African coastal chiefs with so much doggedness that they created a strong presence along the West African coast from Sierra Leone all the way to the Niger Delta (today's Nigeria) and as far south as Congo. In 1849, Britain appointed John Beecroft Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, a position he held (along with his governorship of Fernando Po) until his death in 1854. John Duncan was appointed Vice Consul and was located at Wydah. At the time of Beecroft's appointment, the Kingdom of Lagos (under Oba Kosoko) was in the western part of the Consulate of the Bights of Benin and Biafra and was a key slave trading port. In 1851 and with pressure from liberated slaves who now wielded political and business influence, Britain intervened in Lagos in what is now known as the Bombardment of Lagos or Capture of Lagos resulting in the installation of Oba Akitoye and the ouster of Oba Kosoko. Oba Akitoye then signed the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos abolishing slavery. The signing of the 1852 treaty ushered in the Consular Period in Lagos' history wherein Britain provided military protection for Lagos.Following threats from Kosoko and the French who were positioned at Wydah, a decision was made by Lord Palmerston (British Prime Minister) who noted in 1861, \"the expediency of losing no time in assuming the formal Protectorate of Lagos\". William McCoskry, the Acting Consul in Lagos with Commander Bedingfield convened a meeting with Oba Dosunmu on 30 July 1861 aboard HMS Prometheus where Britain's intent was explained and a response to the terms were required by August 1861. Dosunmu resisted the terms of the treaty but under the threat to unleash violence on Lagos by Commander Bedingfield, Dosunmu relented and signed the Lagos Treaty of Cession on 6 August 1861.\n\nLagos was declared a colony on 5 March 1862. The remainder of modern-day Nigeria was seized in 1887, and when the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was established in 1914, Lagos became its capital, continuing as such after the country's independence from Britain in 1960. Along with migrants from all over Nigeria and other West African nations were the returnee ex-slaves known as Creoles, who came from Freetown, Sierra Leone, Brazil and the West Indies to Lagos. The Creoles contributed to Lagos' modernisation and their knowledge of Portuguese architecture can still be seen from the architecture on Lagos Island. Since the 19th century, Lagos gradually transformed to a melting pot of Africans and Europeans. Railway links and telephone cables connecting Lagos to London had been established by 1886. Electric street lighting was introduced in the city in 1898. Lagos experienced rapid growth throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a result of Nigeria's economic boom.Before the creation of Lagos State on 27 May 1967, Lagos, which was the country's capital had been administered directly by the Federal Government as a Federal Territory through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs, while the Lagos City Council (LCC) governed the city. Lagos, along with the towns from the then Western region (Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu, Epe and Badagry), were eventually captured to create Lagos State. Lagos city was split into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), while the other towns now make up 13 LGAs in the state. Lagos played the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital until 1976 when the state capital was moved to Ikeja. Lagos was adversely affected during Nigeria's military rule. Also, on 12 December 1991, the seat of the Federal Government was also formally relocated to Abuja. However, Lagos remains the financial centre of the country, and also grew to become the most populous conurbation in the country.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLagos is loosely classified into two main geographical areas\u2014the \"Island\" and the \"Mainland\".\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n==== Island ====\n\nThe Island is a loose geographical term that is used to define the area of Lagos that is separated from the \"mainland\" by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic Ocean, which forms Lagos Harbour. The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected together by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events in Lagos takes place. It also houses most of the upscale residential areas in Lagos. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be in the Island include Lagos Island, Eti-Osa. The major upscale island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include Ikoyi and Victoria Island. Three major bridges join the island to the mainland. They are the Carter Bridge, which starts from Iddo; the Eko Bridge (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the Third Mainland Bridge, which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon.\n\n\n===== Lagos Island =====\n\nLagos Island contains a central business district. This district is characterized by high-rise buildings. The island also contains many of the city's largest wholesale marketplaces (such as the popular Idumota and Balogun Markets). It also has the National Museum of Nigeria, the Central Mosque, the Glover Memorial Hall, Christ's Church Cathedral (CMS) and the Oba's Palace (Iga Idunganran). Another major part of Lagos Island is Marina. It borders around the idumota and Balogun markets and houses major Banking institutions. Though formerly in a derelict condition, Lagos Island's Tinubu Square is a site of historical importance; it was here that the Amalgamation Ceremony that unified the North and South protectorate to form Nigeria took place in 1914.\n\n\n===== Ikoyi =====\n\nIkoyi is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a land fill. Ikoyi is also connected to Victoria Island by Falomo bridge, which carries the main road over Five Cowrie creek. Ikoyi housed the headquarters of the federal government of Nigeria and other buildings owned by the government, including the old federal secretariat complex. The complex today is on reestablishment.In Ikoyi there are military and police barracks, a top-security prison and a federal high court of Nigeria. Ikoyi also has a number of hotels, night clubs, a recreational park and one of Africa's largest golf courses. Originally a middle class neighbourhood, in recent years, it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the upper middle class to the upper class. There are also commercial activities in Ikoyi, which is spotted in an increasing number of offices, banks, and shopping complexes. The commercial section is concentrated in the South-West.\n\n\n===== Victoria Island =====\n\nVictoria Island with its annexe is situated to the south of Lagos Island. It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments are blooming up everywhere.\nAlong with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts of several sizeable shopping districts. On its sea shore along the Atlantic front, there is environmentally reconstructed Bar Beach.\n\n\n===== Iddo =====\nAcross the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called Iddo. Iddo is also a railroad terminus and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland local government area after it was connected to the mainland like a peninsula.\n\n\n==== Mainland ====\nA huge population of Lagosians also live on the Lagos mainland, and most industries are located there. The mainland is known for its music and nightlife, which used to be located in areas around Yaba and Surulere. However, in recent years more night clubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island, Ikate and Lekki Phase 1) the main nightlife attractions. Mainland LGAs include Surulere, Apapa, and Lagos Mainland. Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: Agege, Amuwo Odofin, Mushin, Oshodi-Isolo and Ikeja (site of Murtala Muhammed International Airport and the capital of Lagos State).\nMajor Areas on the mainland include Ebute Metta, Yaba and Ejigbo. Some rivers, like Badagry Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLagos experiences a tropical savanna climate (Aw) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, as there's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season. The wet season starts in April and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in March. The wettest month is June with precipitation total 315.5 millimetres (12.42 in), while the driest month is January with precipitation total 13.2 millimetres (0.52 in).\nLocated near the equator, Lagos has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging 28.3\u201332.9 \u00b0C (82.9\u201391.2 \u00b0F). Lagos shares the seasons of the Southern Hemisphere, with summer highs in March, daily range 32.9\u201324.1 \u00b0C (91.2\u201375.4 \u00b0F), and warm winters in August, ranging 28.3\u201321.8 \u00b0C (82.9\u201371.2 \u00b0F) as the daily average.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nLagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria. The architectural styles in Lagos are diverse and range from tropical and vernacular to colonial European and ultramodern buildings or a mixture. Brazilian style architecture brought by the creoles is evident in buildings such as Water House and  Shitta Bey Mosque. Skyscrapers and most high rise buildings are centered on the islands, while the mainland has some high rise buildings. In recent years, the Lagos State government has renovated existing parks and green areas, with a long-term goal of expansion. Many good quality buildings are interspersed across the city.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, there are Christian churches and temples: Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of Nigeria (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Nigerian Baptist Convention (Baptist World Alliance), The Apostolic Church Nigeria (TACN), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Assemblies of God, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos (Catholic Church) and Muslim mosques such as Lagos Central Mosque in Lagos- island, Wahab Folawiyo Central Mosque in Surulere, Lekki Central Mosque in Lekki, The Syrian Mosque in Ikoyi. There are also various shrines and temples for traditional worshipers scattered across the state and they include several Igbo Igunnuko shrines, Egungun shrines, Eyo Shrines and other various traditional shrines and places of worship. For the 25,000 strong Hindu community, there is an ISKCON temple and three other Hindu temples dotted around the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn terms of administration, Lagos is not a single municipality and therefore has no overall city administration. The geographical city limits of Metropolitan Lagos comprises 16 of the 20 Local Government Areas, which together comprise Lagos State. The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region. The Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi, and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several Local Government Areas (most notably Lagos Island LGA, Lagos Mainland LGA and Eti-Osa LGA).The mainland beyond the Municipality of Lagos, on the other hand, comprised several separate towns and settlements such as Mushin, Ikeja and Agege. In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom, Lagos experienced a population explosion, untamed economic growth, and unmitigated rural migration. This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly, thus forming the present day \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\", also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\". The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them.\nBy 2006, the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State's boundaries and attained a megacity status. This much larger area is referred to as \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\" or \"Lagos Megacity Region\", which is a continuous built up land area of additional 1,535.4 square kilometres (592.8 square miles), comprising sprawls in LGAs situated next to Lagos' eastern and western city limits in Lagos State, and beyond northern limits, spilling into the LGAs in adjoining Ogun State. Ogun State LGAs within Greater Metropolitan Lagos majorly include: Obafemi Owode, Sagamu, Ifo, Ado-Odo/Ota and part of Ewekoro.\n\nToday, the word Lagos most often refers to the urban area, called \"Metropolitan Lagos\" in Nigeria, which includes both the islands of the former municipality of Lagos and the mainland suburbs. Lagos State government is responsible for some of the utilities including roads and transportation, power, water, health and education. Metropolitan Lagos extends over 16 of the 20 LGAs of Lagos State, and contains about 85% of the population of Lagos State, and includes semi-rural areas. Lagos City has a considerable number of high-rise buildings that dominate its skyline. Most of the tall buildings are located in the downtown Central Business District.\nLagos was the former capital city of Nigeria but it has since been replaced by Abuja. Abuja officially gained its status as the capital of Nigeria on 12 December 1991, although the decision to move the federal capital had been made in now Act no. 6 of 1976. Lagos is also home to the High Court of the Lagos State Judiciary, housed in an old colonial building on Lagos Island.\n\n\n=== Census data for Lagos ===\nAlthough the 2006 National Population Census of Nigeria credited the metropolitan area with a population figure of 7,937,932, the figure is at variance with some projections by the UN and other population agencies and groups worldwide. The population figure of Lagos State given by the Lagos State Government is 17,553,924. It was based on claimed conducted enumeration for social planning by the Lagos State Government \"parallel census\" and it believes that since the inhabitants of the metropolitan area of Lagos constitute 88% of the Lagos State population, the population of metropolitan Lagos is about 15.5 million.A rejoinder to Lagos State Government views concluded that Lagos State concealed the fact that the population projection, for Lagos Urban Agglomeration by the UN agencies had been revised downwards substantially as early as 2003. It failed to interpret the two most important and fairly representative and reliable secondary data sets already in public domain, the National Identity Card Scheme and the 2003 Voters Registration figures from INEC. The figures for 2007 Voters Registration by INEC were an act subsequent to the release of the provisional census results and comprehensively corroborate, vindicate and validate the population figures in no uncertain terms.\nAccording to the official results of the 2006 census, there were 8,048,430 inhabitants in Metropolitan Lagos. This figure was lower than anticipated, and has created controversy in Nigeria. Lagos Island, the central Local Government Area and historic centre of Metropolitan Lagos, had a population of 212,700 at the 2006 Census.\n\nAuthorities of Lagos State have attacked the results of the 2006 census, accusing the Nigerian National Population Commission of having undercounted the population of the state. This accusation is denied by the National Population Commission. A study found that research carried out by Africapolis (the African subsidiary of e-Geopolis backed by the Agence fran\u00e7aise de d\u00e9veloppement), in addition to the cross-referencing of official figures with more scientific independent research concluded that the 2006 census figures for Lagos State of about 9 million were valid and that the state's own assessments are inflated.Lagos is, by most estimates, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Lagos is currently experiencing a population increase of about 275,000 persons per annum. In 1999 the United Nations predicted that the city's metropolitan area, which had only about 290,000 inhabitants in 1950, would exceed 20 million by 2010 and thus become one of the ten most populated cities in the world.\n\nThere is a huge spectrum of wealth distribution among the people that reside in Lagos. It ranges from the very wealthy to the very poor. Lagos has attracted many young people and families seeking a better life from all other parts of Nigeria and beyond and this has also contributed to its cosmopolitan status. Some people are leaving Lagos and Nigeria in search of better living conditions, cities like Townsville in Australia are very popular with expats and have services set up to assist people in settling into their new life.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Lagos is a major economic focal point in Nigeria, generating around 10% of the country's GDP. Most commercial and financial business is carried out in the central business district situated on the island. This is also where most of the country's commercial banks, financial institutions and major corporations are headquartered. Lagos is also the major Information Communications and Telecommunications (ICT) hub of West Africa and potentially, the biggest ICT market in the continent. Lagos is developing a 24-hour economy and has also been ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the world. In some parts of Lagos, residents have one of the highest standards of living in Nigeria and in Africa. At the same time, a sizable proportion of the residents live in slums without access to piped water and sanitation.The Port of Lagos is Nigeria's leading port and one of the largest and busiest in Africa. It is administered by the Nigerian Ports Authority and it is split into three main sections: Lagos port, in the main channel next to Lagos Island, Apapa Port (site of the container terminal) and Tin Can Port, both located in Badagry Creek, which flows into Lagos Harbour from the west. The port features a railhead. The port has seen growing amounts of crude oil exported, with export figures rising between 1997 and 2000.

Lagos also hosted the 2nd All-African games in 1973.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLagos, subsequent to the re-modernization project achieved by the previous administration of Governor Raji Babatunde Fashola, is gradually becoming a major tourist destination, being one of the largest cities in Africa and in the world. Lagos is currently taking steps to become a global city.

The levels are Primary, Junior Secondary School (JSS), Senior Secondary School (SSS) and university. All children are offered basic education, with special focus now on the first nine years. Many of the schools in Nigeria are federally funded and usually are boarding schools. A few examples are Federal government college Odogbolu (FGCOdogbolu), Federal government girls college Sagamu (FGGCSagamu) and Federal government college Kano (FGCKano). The state of Lagos has its own federally funded high schools namely Federal government college Ijanikin also known as FGC Lagos, Kings College and Queens College.\nLagos is home to various postsecondary schools, universities and other vocational institutions that are either operated by the government or private entities.\n\n\n=== Vocational schools ===\nInstitute for Industrial Technology (IIT) : founded in 2000, IIT is a technical vocational school for male youth from families with limited resources.

For example, the oldest Nigerian hospital is located in the city as well as West Africa's first air-operated emergency medical service, which commenced in the city. The Lagos healthcare system is generally divided into public and private sectors that provide medical services at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Although the private hospitals are usually more expensive, it does not necessarily translate to better health-care delivery.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nLagos has one of the largest and most extensive road networks in West Africa. It also has suburban trains and some ferry services. Highways are usually congested in peak hours, due in part to the geography of the city, as well as to its explosive population growth. Lagos is also linked by many highways and bridges. A new rail system that is supposed to span the length of the Badagry expressway is currently under construction.\nThe Lagos\u2013Ibadan Expressway and the Lagos\u2013Abeokuta Expressway are the major controlled-access highways in the north of the city and serve as inter-state highways to Oyo State and Ogun State respectively. To the west the congested Lagos\u2013Badagry Expressway serves outlying towns such as Festival Town, which was the location for the 1977 Festival of Black Arts and Culture 77.Lagos's importance as a commercial centre and port and its strategic location have led to it being the end-point of three Trans-African Highway routes using Nigeria's national roads. The Trans\u2013West African Coastal Highway leaves the city as the Badagry Expressway to Benin and beyond as far as Dakar and Nouakchott; the Trans-Sahara Highway to Algiers, which is close to completion, leaves the city as the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.Lagos State has a bus rapid transit (BRT) system; the first phase was completed in February 2008. It is expected to operate along eight routes using specially designated bus rapid transit lanes running through the city, with the aim of expanding to other routes in the future.\nThe first phase of the Lagos BRT runs 19 km (12 mi) through Ikorodu Road and Funsho Williams Avenue up to CMS. After weeks of test runs, operations started on 17 March 2008, six months earlier than planned. Also, the signature color of Lagos state 14-seater bus (known as Danfo) is yellow with a touch of black.\nIt has been estimated that the system will transport about 10,000 passengers in each direction per hour during peak travel times. At these times traffic congestion, called \"Go Slow\", by Lagosians, can be extreme. The LAMATA bus rapid transit corridor covers a distance of about 22 km (14 mi). The system is run by two operators, NURTW Cooperative (Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers) and Lagbus, a Lagos State Government owned Asset Management Company that contributes about 180 high-capacity buses for the implementation of the first phase Mile 12 to CMS BRT Lite system.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nAn extensive urban rail system, Lagos Rail Mass Transit, running through the Lagos metropolis is currently under construction. Several intercity and commuter trains serve Lagos through the Lagos Terminus railway station.\n\n\n=== Ferries ===\nLagos State Ferry Services Corporation runs a few regular routes, for example between Lagos Island and the mainland, served by modern ferries and wharves. Private boats run irregular passenger services on the lagoon and on some creeks.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLagos is served by Murtala Muhammed International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in Africa. The MMIA is Nigeria's premier international air gateway. The airport's history dates back to colonial times, around the time of the Second World War. The current international airport terminal was built and commissioned over 40 years ago, in 1978. The terminal opened officially March 15, 1979. The airport had been known simply as the Lagos International Airport. It was, however, renamed for the late Nigerian Head of State, General Murtala Muhammed, who died in 1976.\nThe airport terminal has been renovated several times since the 1970s but its most radical makeover began in 2013, following the launch of the Federal government's multi-billion naira Remodelling/ Rehabilitation Programme for its airports nationwide. Under the re-modeling work there, by late in 2014, the MMlA lounge area had been expanded to four times its previous size and new passenger handling conveyor systems installed which can handle over 1,000 passengers per hour.\nA second airport, Lekki-Epe International Airport is proposed.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAbike Dabiri, Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission\nAgbani Darego, Miss Nigeria 2001, Semifinalist Miss Universe 2001 and Miss World 2001\nAkinwunmi Ambode, former Governor of Lagos state\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, Governor of Lagos State\nBabatunde Fashola, Former Governor of Lagos and current Minister of Power, Works and Housing\nBode George, Politician\nBola Tinubu, Former Governor of Lagos State\nBuchi Emecheta, novelist\nFunsho Williams, politician and one time aspirant to the office of Lagos state governor\nHakeem Olajuwon, professional basketball player\nIsrael Adesanya, UFC Middle weight champion\nIsrael Idonije, Professional American football player, Chicago Bears 2003\u20132013, Detroit Lions 2013\nNelson Agholor, Professional American football player, Super Bowl 52 Champion with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018\nRilwan Akiolu, Oba (traditional ruler) of Lagos\nToyin Saraki, global health advocate and healthcare philanthropist\nYemi Osinbajo, politician, lawyer and current Vice-President of Nigeria\nYvonne Orji, Actress, Comedian\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\n\nLagos is twinned with:\n Gary, Indiana, United States, since 1991\n Atlanta, Georgia, United States, since 1974\n Bucharest, Romania\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of largest cities\nList of Governors of Lagos State\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLeithead, Alastair (August 2017).

        "wiki": "Lekki Conservation Centre (LCC) is a 78-hectare (190-acre) Natural Resource Conservation in Lekki, Lagos State.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe centre was established in 1990 to serve as biodiversity conservation icon and environment education centre. The facility was built by the Chevron Corporation for the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF), as a reserved sanctuary for the rich flora and fauna of the Lekki Peninsula. The company has since provided annual funding for the management of the centre.\nTo start the conservation project, three potential areas were surveyed in 1987 by NCF technical team in partnership with the defunct Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperative. Thereafter, Lekki area was chosen to establish the demonstration site for the conservation project. Locating the conservation project on Lekki Peninsula informed the name of the project \u2013 Lekki Conservation Centre. The Centre was established by the Nigerian Conservation Foundation to protect the wildlife and mangrove forests of Nigeria's South-West coastline from the threat of urban development.\n\n\n=== Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) ===\nThe NCF is a non-governmental organisation dedicated to sustainable development and nature conservation. It also serve as an area of biodiversity conservation and environmental awareness center. The foundation aims to preserve Nigeria's species and ecosystems, promote sustainability when using natural resources and advocates actions that minimise the impact on the environment and prevent resource wastage.  NCF has worked tirelessly to raise environmental awareness and promote responsibility. The center is located along the Lekki-Epe Expressway in the Lekki Peninsula, opposite Chevron.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe reserve area which covers a land area of 78 hectare is located on Lekki Peninsula, next to the Lekki Lagoon, and near the Lagos Lagoon. It protects the wetlands of the Lekki peninsula which consists of swamp and savannah habitats. Approaching the reserve, there's a boulevard of coconut trees which leads to a well laid out car and Visitors Park. It is endowed with an abundance of plant and animal life. Its huge tract of wetlands is set aside for wildlife viewing. Raised walkways enable viewing of animals like monkeys, crocodiles, snakes and various birds. There is also a conservation center and a library.\nThe wetlands are managed by the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, and it now includes a figure-of-eight system of footpaths, with hiking trails and stepping stones to cross waterways. A trail boardwalk was constructed in 1992 to enrich tourists view of the vast resources of the nature reserve which is encapsulated on a mangrove terrain. Side attractions along the trail includes swamp outlook, bird hide, rest stops and the tree house. The 1.8 km nature trail behind the foremost main buildings is connected by two wooden tracks. A sturdy wooden track leading to the nature trail, reveals an expansive stretch of marshland and savannah grassland teeming with wildlife, as well as rich aquatic flora and fauna. There's also a tree house which is a twenty-one meters-high tree platform where one can have a panoramic view of the picnic area, reserve, visitor's center and children's playground among the trees. The bird hide overlooks a swamp/marsh which is home to crocodiles and monitor lizards. The nature reserve traverses a mosaic of vegetation types: secondary forest, swamp forest and Savanna grassland. Several bird species can be seen here and this It is also popular site for school excursions. The mammal life, although mostly nocturnal is sometimes seen. Small reptiles, and a range of snakes and lizards are also found here. Amphibian life includes a wide range of endangered species. There is a cone-shaped structure which functions as the auditorium for lectures, conferences and seminars. \nAt first glance, there are rare collections of striking pictures of endangered species of animals as well as plants prescribed in glass stands around the oval hall.\nEfforts have been made to save different types of animals, reptiles and birdlife from extinction. The endangered species of animals includes bush bucks, crocodiles, mona monkeys, squirrels, snakes, crocodiles, monitor lizards, duikers, giant rats and hogs. While the trees hosts mona monkeys and other species of monkeys, the open grasslands are home to bushbucks, maxwell's duikers, giant rats, hogs, mongooses, chameleons, squirrels and an impressive variety of birdlife. Park rangers are also available as guides. Lekki Conservation Centre has the Longest Canopy walkway in Africa.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of national parks of Nigeria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Nigerian Conservation Foundation\".",

          "One of the few places in Lagos where nature can still be felt undisturbed much. Friendly staff and not expensive even for family outings. Make sure you have a bottle of water with you.

          "It was cool seeing the monkeys monkey around. The bridges were sturdy, if you're brave enough, you should definitely try the canopy walk, if not, there's no shame because you can still have a good time",

          "Pretty long canopy walk was a nice workout. it was quite clean and pretty for nice pictures. The display of wild animals is somewhat lacking though... Lots of monkeys but very little else. The park at the end of the tour is also underwhelming. Overall, for Lagos and Nigeria standards, was a nice visit and not too expensive.",
          "Its alright. The high light was the high canopy walk if you are adventurous.The family park needs more attention. No functioning games for adults or kids...just the people selling trying to make you buy there food. No fun activity in the park",
          "Beautiful place but needs a lot of TLC. Guests are dropping their trash in marshes. The Chess and Checkers area is in disarray. Many of the pieces are broken. The fish pool was very dirty and you could barely see the fish. The Canopy walk was a wonderful experience. The walkways are in serious need of repairs.",
          "If you love the outdoors, the Lekki conservation center provides a great experience. From a canopy forest walkway to a savanna picnic area with fish ponds, you're sure to have a great time",
          "The wooden trail was quite uneven but the management is reconstructing it through out March and the first few days in April. There is a fish pond with lots of scaly fish(not sure of the exact type). There was fresh coconut water, soft drinks and barbecue for sale, but all the refresh were 4 times the normal amount.",

          "Good place for an adventure. However, I feel the place needs maintenance if not, it will just be like one of those places. Just before the main canopy walk, the wooden walk way is already broken in some parts and needs fixing.\n\nAsides this, it is a very  lovely place to go on an adventure",
          "The canopy walk is the scariest and the most fun part of the conservation centre. It consist of seven stages. There is also a good place for picnic with family and friends. \nBeware of the monkeys though especially when you have food with you",

          "This is my favourite spot in Lagos. It is very beautiful and definitely worth paying a visit to. The staff are super friendly, the monkeys are hilarious. I promise you'll not have a single dull moment. Ensure you wear comfortable outdoor \u2026",
          "Nice place to explore. Beautiful environment if you love nature. You can be sure of the pure air you breathe in. Canopy walk was a bit scary but really nice to try. It's fun\ud83d\ude01. Adorable monkeys\ud83e\udd23",

          "A lovely place to visit to relive the effect of the deep rain forest or mangrove swamps. It's a place to show kids what's like before the concrete jungle took over most places. However there are not so many animals as may be expected. You generally see the monkeys all over the place.",
          "It's a pretty cool place with lots of greens & really nice scenery. \n\nI learnt you can't move around with meals because of the monkeys as you'd be their target as they try to snatch it away from you.\n\nIf you are to be walking on the Walkway, you'd be scared (or not), but it is totally safe.",
          "The Lekki Conversation Centre is a beautiful place. You would love the place if you are the kind of person that loves nature. The Officials were friendly but at first,I was delayed for some minutes due to congestion on the canopy walkway. \u2026",
          "The place is amazing. Taking the walk on canopy walkway at such hight is so thrilling and been the longest in Africa is interesting. But there no so many animals there. Activities in the family park are not that rich and fun. \nThe canopy walk make it all worth it!",
          "I love my experience here, a friend had a birthday brunch close to the fish pond the view was superb that was my first time there and I went back for the canopy walk (the longest in Africa, I guess) and I was scared but i made it through, the service was awesome.",

          "Very good place to hangout with friends and family..There's no parking space outside the gate as a result causes traffic around the neighborhood..There are species of monkeys only found in the Lekki conservation Centre..",

          "Could've Been Better. The Staff Did a Poor Job Communicating What We Could and Could Not Do with a 5yr old. The Staff Was Not the Most Professional. Sent Us on a Wild Goose Chase. We Were Disappointed. The Unguided Tour is a Joke. No \u2026",

          "Nice place for an outing.. try to go in morning so that you can see the birds and animals in open. The whole thing takes around 2 hours . Canopy walk is nice ...",
          "This was a fun experience, which allowed you to enjoy the tranquillity of nature in the hustle and bustle of the city.",
          "It's a nice place to get away from the busy and noisy Lagos city, frequented by many locals. Entry was 2000N incl. canopy walk. You have to wait for a guide to take you in but you can stay inside on your own afterwards. The canopy walk is a bit scary but worth it. Great views",
          "Beautiful canopy walk. Unfortunately, the place was riddled with litter. Plastic bottles everywhere. You'd think/hope that at least a conservation area would be kept clean. Alas, this was not the case.",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful conservation centre for all age but the suspension bridge may not be suitable for kids which is the main fun I had the game reserved have lots of games to play but their is room to add more fascinating games thanks",
          "It's okay - monkeys are around and the footbridge is good. N2,000. The guide was interesting and helpful.",
          "When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a peacock in the assembly area for our tour. On the way out, we saw a large turtle. The walkway is a bit rickety, but safe enough. We saw monkeys and a python on the walk. Unfortunately, toward the end the walkway was nonexistent;",
          "You get a perfect experience how the jungle is like. There is a lot to discover. Take the canopy walk, it is so much fun. There is also a family park where you can get local food and some entertainment.",
          "The park is set in nice forest area with monkeys and other small wildlife. There is a good walkway through the forest that leads to the canopy walk ( additional 1500N to walk across)the canopy walk is a good experience. There is a family park area with dome games etc and was a",
          "Very easy hike through the last jungle/mangrove in the Lagos area. Very pretty and peaceful. The canopy walk is a bit scary!!",
          "A place that definitely deserves a stop if you are in Lagos. Well preserved area with free animals to be seen. Kids loved it.",
          "Extremely interesting and exciting to be able to climb into the trees to get birds eye views of the surrounding area. Pleasant information centre.",

          "Going into L ekki conservation and taking the walk you can escape the noise and bustle of the Lagos city life. Submerge in the sounds and peace of nature. Monkeys and tree climbing will refresh your soul. More Dr was than animals still a place to get in touch with nature in a",
          "Decent experience visiting this place. Around 2 Hours well spent. Canopy Bridges are good and great fun. You can also play chess which is designed on the floor with 16 Big pieces. Good place for nature lovers.",
          "Felt like we were in a jungle and it was nice to see the monkeys play. The walk around the conservation centre itself was nice and the canopy walk was something I\u2019ve never done before. If you want to have a rush of adrenaline, this is the place to go. Just be a note of warning,",
          "The highlight is the canopy walk (if you're really scared of heights then, maybe not). Better in the dry season and with sunglasses.",
          "This conservation is a motivation for everyone especially nature lovers. The dedication of the founders and volunteers could be easily noticed. It is great to be sensitive to the need to preserve nature in a very urbanized society like Lagos, Nigeria. The people in the office",
          "A really serene place it is. Cool and expansive. The rope walk is a really nice touch. Customer service can be improved though but the environment just makes it a really lovely place to spend the day with a loved one",
          "I dropped off my teenage children and the friends for a meet up here. Was really surprised at my fine. Nature!!!",
          "Metropolitan Lagos can be stressful. Lufasi Nature Park a natural, calm and relaxing environment with lots leisure activities to make your visit worthwhile. It's right in the heart of town, along Lekki Expressway. You can't miss your way and if you do, Lagosians are warm and",
          "We walked for about 1km before we reached the tree house and beyond. Although we didn\u2019t get to see many animals as envisaged, the kids were happy feasting after the long walk. I must say the monkeys there grabs anything and everything from your hand. They also seek attention",
          "Perfect choice to spend a couple of hours in nature . You'll really enjoy the 401-metre long canopy walkway.",
          "This place is a nice haven, enveloped in lush green forest from all the hustle And bustle of Lagos. The entry fee was cheaper than I expected it to be and it\u2019s more than fair for all that is available on site. Getting to the top of the bridge was quite challenging and the view",
          "If you live in Lagos, which I have for nearly 3 years, Lekki Conservation Centre is a good occasional get-away. What it offers is mostly a respite from the trash, filth and chaos that is the bulk of Lagos. Takes about an hour to totally absorb, but not an endouring encounter.",
          "My friends and I braved Lagos traffic to get to the spot and we weren\u2019t disappointed. It was a little weird how they had everyone buy tickets and wait for about 30 min to assemble a group then go together as a group down the boarded walkway to the canopy walk. Once you arrive at",
          "I will never forget this place coz this was the first place I go out with the love of my life we have a lots of fun lots prof picks and memories too I will never forget this place and this day",
          "On my second-to-last day in Lagos, I decided to visit this Lekki Conservation Center. It was so much better than I expected! You walk in an actual jungle, with monkeys jumping all around you, and snakes and crocodiles in the water underneath. The view is spectacular, and it is",
          "It was a decision of our driver to go in this place unknown to us. Wonderfull experience in the wilde. monkeys, lizards, turtles, give show of themselves. No possible to see snakes and crocodiles also from the fantastic canopy bridge, but a great experience.",
          "Got there early in the morning at 8.40. Told to wait a few minutes before tour starts. 1 hour passes, 2 hours pass, starts raining. 3 hours waiting I had to give up and leave. Poor service. When you get there early I expect to leave not wait around until for hours until it",
          "You will meet for sure dozens of monkeys, squirrels and if you are lucky you will see turtles as old as 92 years old, monitor lizards, snakes, crocodiles and more. I happened to see most of them expect crocodiles. The canopy walkway, known to be the longest in Africa, is also a",
          "I had a very pleasant surprise since we arrived; monkeys, peacocks and a giant turtle. Green everywhere and a fantastic canopy experience. Our guide, Chidi was very professional and friendly. Definetely a must try if you are in Lagos. 100% Recommended.",
          "I think the story behind it is what I find most wonderful and makes the experience that much more special. According to locals it was conserved as the Island was built (hence the name) and has been this way since before the Island\u2019s existence. The animals run wild and free and",
          "I arrived early Sunday morning before the Sunday rush and had a private tour around the park. James was very informative and made this a very enjoyable experience. Remember this is not a zoo and do not expect to see many animals. However, there are plenty of monkeys, birdlife",
          "The over jungle walkway is spectacular, it is just a shame there were not so many animals to see, however, the 2 old tortoises fighting was something i had never seen before.",
          "It is a nice place to visit and see the monkeys and reptiles. however if your guide is lazy they can ruin it for you. I had a good, fun tour guide and the experience was great. it is not expensive about \u00a34. and it is even cheaper if you don't want to go on the shaky walkway. (i",
          "A must go for everyone. One of the gems in Lagos and Nigeria. The canopy walk was scary but competent worth it. Would do it again.",
          "Go early as it gets very hot in the afternoon and very humid. It's a nice walk and there is a few monkeys to see, a peacock and a tortoise. Other than that there is two carp ponds. The ponds are cloudy and require cleaning. The wooden walkway has a large number of loose boards,",
          "This quiet park is in the middle of Lagos' chaos. This is how all Lagos used to be long time ago. It's an intact jungle with lots of animals. Monkeys are friendly and are not afraid of you, so you can take pictures very closely. The park also features the longest canopy walk in",
          "When you need to feel a natural atmosphere, Alot of things to explore in the this natural habitat filled with uncaged animals. The major fun there is the Canopy walk and the Tree house climbing.",
          "This is a really interesting site, particularly, for kids and teenagers interested in wildlife. Lots to see and not too much distance to cover. The canopy bridge is a must - in my opinion ! Really good value for money and the tour guide was very helpful.",
          "Lekki Conservation Centre is so good. Lots of wildlife, cool calm atmosphere and of course the longest canopy walk in Africa. The canopy walk is for people 14 yes and above. Staff were friendly, grounds were clean and we loved that we saw the natural side to Lekki, inclusive of",

          "Totally natural,it was great being able to walk through that deep natural swamp filled with wild life.",
          "Nice and quiet place. Very good for conservationists. Don't see as many animals as you'd like because they typically hide in their natural habitats. Best to get a good Tour guide from the place. Don't carry food around in public because of the monkeys. The canopy walk is also a",
          "If you are looking for a place so close to nature you need to be at Lekki Conservation Centre. It will afford you a 20 minutes walk, with monkeys in their natural habitat, swampy area and there is Canopy walk or alternatively, you can climb about 40 steps on the tree house. I",
          "The canopy walk is really cool. The surrounding area, a littered park and some tragic looking fish ponds, is pretty shabby once you finish the walk but I definitely recommend doing the canopy. It is pretty high up so not for fraidy cats. Also check the age limit before you head",
          "A lushy green Conservation area. The conservation is divided into three parts. 1) The lushy green mangrove area 2) the canopy 3) the games cum picnic area. Entry is N3000 (N1000 for each area). We did not go to the picnic area so paid N2000 each.The entrance fee includes a",
          "A group of us visited here to kill some time during our trip to Lagos. It was a fun experience, mainly for the tree top climb. We wanted to experience the canopy walk, but the line was way too long as it was a busy day. Don\u2019t come here expecting to see a ton of different",
          "This was quite an amazing trip. A bit of a drive to get there so do plan it as a day out The board walk through the mangrove was really quite surreal. in Lagos where everything is built up it was refreshing to be surrounded by nature. some of the boards were broken so do be",
          "The Lekki Conservation Centre is a nature lover\u2019s dream, you can view a detailed account and pictures of my day at curlyhairandairfare.com. In a major city like Lagos, a nature reserve serves as the perfect escape from the urban into the wilderness. The conservation center is a",
          "Went there about 10 years ago and recently last year. Back then there was a tree house, has fun climbing up and leaving notes on the tree bark. it was sort of run down then with some planks missing on the walk way but the whole park has been renovated and in good shape. Great",
          "We went with a group of 7 friends. We had so much fun. There\u2019s a lot of walking until you get to the canopy walk. The canopy walk itself is really fun as a group. Lovely to be surrounded by so many trees. I thought there were going to be more animals visible, but it really is",
          "I visited the LCC on a Sunday afternoon with my family and enjoyed it! A couple cheeky monkeys visible, peacocks and tortoises. Apparently, there may be snakes or crocodiles present but I did not see any during my visit (thank goodness). Walking on the walkway was the highlight,",

          "On entering, One's greeted with some of nature's finest animals (Peacocks, Monkeys and Tortoise) roaming about freely. the long walk in the woods is also breathtaking, although it could seem boring. the Bridgewalk is definetely the highlight of this place, scary but fun (if",
          "There are two options; the Nature walk where you go through the park and end at the family picnic area. The Canopy walk where you climb the longest canopy walk in Africa and also end at the family picnic area. We saw some monkeys (one snatched a biscuit from a kid who was not",
          "Visited on a Saturday with some friends and had a great time. Enjoyed seeing the monkeys and other animals including the giant tortoises. The canopy walkway is well maintained, the forest walkway not so well, but the one which needs to be secure was! Our guide was very",
          "Not very great except for a off on a Sunday for a couple of hours. Need to walk at least 4 kms inside, but very pleasant. Beware of the monkeys so take food in closed packs as you don't get anything inside . You may carry water and food from outside.",
          "The place is suppose to be the best but the people managing it doesn't seem to understand what a conservation center should be like. only monkeys and tortoise were the animals there. i do not like the whole setup.",
          "If you are a nature lover and enjoy the walks without distraction, this is the perfect place to be. Get to see the beauty of the rainforest and the animals living in it, experience the wonders of natures in a quiet relaxing way while hiking a trail snaking around the most",
          "The plave stole our heart with its unique view and nice design and will caught your attention when you see how clean and organise it is there and how animals are freely wandering around. Plus our tour guide was the best.",
          "Despite the huge grant to this facility, It is always one complain or another. They keep showing Nat Geo wide channel at the reception, giving visitors a wrong impression about what to expect. My last team of clients (Russians) complained that they only saw monkeys obviously",
          "Though did not see much animals except monkeys and squirrels. The visit was still memorable especially the canopy walk. The canopy walk is the major attraction. I climbed the tree house with my son and with both of us sitting up there was something that will linger a long time.",
          "This was not an extraordinary experience. This place has potential to create more exciting experiences but it is very under-utilized. Only saw a couple of monkeys in the swamp, no other creatures. Some of planks on the wooden walk way in the swamp were rotten and dangerously",
          "It was a good experience! Firstly, it's easy to miss the entrance to the centre and have to go make a U-turn. Entry and welcoming was quite poor. We walked through the gate with no one there to tell us what to do, where to pay or if we could even go in. We wondered in blindly.",
          "Not much animals. A few games. Entry and tours are very affordable. Tour guides are friends. And lovely pictures can be taken.",
          "I have been to this site a total of four times. Every time, there is something new to see. The tree house has been rebuilt and is beautiful. It is lovely to just take a walk through the trees with monkeys for company or experience the thrill of the canopy walkway. The play area",
          "Easily accessible with a good trek. A lot of monkeys and an amazing hanging bridge that allows views of the park.",
          "Having read about the Conservation Center, it was on top of my to do list in Lagos. Visited with 4 kids and a baby: teenagers and a young one. I was happy to see the warm welcome into the center, we paid the gate fee (2k for an adult and 400 Naira per kid), and then we had to",
          "Now I will remember this trip not because of the ambience but because of company. Maintenance is zero around there though there are human size games and a pond but all that is just not properly kept",
          "Great way to get out of the fast pace of Lagos. I wish there was more emphasis on informing guests about ecosystem and safety. We weren\u2019t tethered to anything and we climbed at our own risk. It was fun, it was different, and an enjoyable family activity",
          "Took my three boys on a fun day outing. We saw monkeys that were very friendly, saw the 10 year old turtles, and walked on the improved wooden path. Rangers were very friendly and informative. The new hanging bridge was meant for adults only, maybe next time we will experience I",
          "This place is amazing , staff members are friendly and helpful the canopy walk in itself was scary and some areas looked like the wanted to break but it was an adventure:",
          "I spent a day here a few weeks ago, and there is much here that needs work. The canteen was a hot mess, the area after the canopy walk for a bit games and picnic needed quite a bit of clean up. Compared to a good number of local tourist spots, this is one of the better",
          "Great example of local conservation efforts and the canopy walk was just spectacular. Great sightings of birds and afterwards a little party at one of the rondavels which are available for group visits.",
          "We have visited the Lekki Conservation Centre twice now. It is such a treat to walk around in nature, when you have the hustle & bustle of Lagos mere minutes away. They make constant effort to maintain the wooden walkways, and have introduced a tree house - which was an exciting",
          "Great excursion for locals and tourists, especially given that it's located in the middle of the Island.",
          "Well planned wooden tracks all around the swamp. Few tree top view points adds tot he charm. There are some crocodiles as well and a observation point for them. Its not that you will have a never seen before feeling here, but yeah away from the busy Lagos ..its definitely a",

          "If you a a lover of nature, this should be a must visit once when you are in Lagos. The Canopy walk is the high point of this place. At some point, it seemed as if I was was going to fall. However, it was just an adrenaline spiking venture. The house on the tree was also quite",

          "You will fall in love with nature here-given the fact that Lagos is such a metro, spaceless crowded city, it's to the credit of the founders of this place that they thought of this-for the future. Unless you are prepared to sleep there, you might not see too many animals but you",
          "Okay, so lets start with the Plus: We visited as a family (2 families to be exact) so we had little children and it offered an entirely different experience from the buzz and noise that is often associated with lagos. The walk through the \"forest\" was long; a welcome",
          "You should try the Canopy walk...which is one of the best adventure i have ever had. Get ready to walk for a while though when you enter the forest, before you get to the Canopy walk. If you enjoy nature walks and environment..this is your go to.",

          "Probably not suitable for children. If you are scared of heights, don't do it. The game area is super awesome. There's is a life size Chess board, Ludo, Snake and ladder and many more games. They also have a fish pond, monkeys, peacocks and tortoise.",

          "This is not a good activity for families with young children. The wooden \"trail\"/path is not always sturdy. Besides monkeys, you will see one or two tortoises, some fish in murky pools and a few peacocks...That's about it. We were a bit disappointed. However, this may be a fun",
          "The Lekki Conservation centre is well worth the visit. The walkway is well maintained and it was wonderful to see what the whole of Lagos would have looked like before the city was built. The staff are all friendly and helpful. If you can locate the bar in the middle of the",
          "The Lekki Conservation Centre is a fantastic tourist spot if you're looking for to kill a few hours in Lagos. It's about 20 mins from Victoria Island (without traffic) and relatively close to the Nike Art Gallery so definitely a convenient location for the tourist traveller.",

          "This has got a very nice canopy walk from which you can sight lots of animals and birds. If you have fear for heights think twice about the canopy walk because it is pretty long and high.",
          "We visited as a large family unit with young children and teens. The monkeys were both a major attraction and the source of lots of screaming specially when you carry a plastic bag with you! They can smell food from a mile off as my son learnt when clutching food during the walk",
          "We had so much fun there. walking on the wood path towards the hanging bridge. Was not expecting it to be as big as it was and it was a lovely surprise. Overcame my fear of hights and enjoyed an amazing view. Bumped in to some monkeys on the way too and even managed to climb up",
          "My family went to this place based on other reviews and we were so glad we did. We did the canopy walk, which was fantastic. One poor soul discovered he was afraid of heights, so he wasn't able to complete the canopy walk, but my family did. There' a beautiful view of the",

          "Lekki Conservation Centre is a nice place to escape the business of the city. It is pretty cheap to get in, I think it was only a couple of thousand naira. We were took on a tour with a group of about ten other people. The guide was really friendly and gave us the chance to feed",
          "My friends and I spent one Saturday at Lekki conservation center and I was surprised by time passed away. The Capony walk to park is a definite must - no shortcuts. No as high as the one in Ghana but definitely longer",

          "I first visited center with friends and bf in 2003 and the experience was awesome. First time ever I saw peacocks who seemed to enjoy our food more than we did. Growing up in the city it was amazing to find such natural surroundings. The trek was great, monkeys were funny but",
          "We have been to the conservation centre on a couple of occasions. we enjoy the trek round the conservation on the wooden platform constructed as a walkway on the swamp. Just be sure to take some water along because the trek is long and tiring. you will have a couple of places",
          "I love this place it was great. If you love nature and history this is the place for you. The guides will tell you the history of Lagos. They describe how this once swamp land was transformed to LAGOS the economic center for the Giant of Africa, Nigeria. The tour is a walking",
          "Went yesterday to have a family picnic and had a nice time. While the management is making some efforts at maintenance, it is striking that some of the recreational structures remain out of order. Yet in Lagos, there is hardly a better place to have peace and quiet with",

          "It was a nice experience being so close to nature. It was a gorgeous and surreal to be in the mist of all of that beauty especially if you are from a city and don't see this often. The canopy is a must if you aren't afraid of heights and don't mind it being a little wobbly.",
          "A great day out for family. Lots of wildlife and got great pics of the monkeys. It would be a good idea I think if they had an optional Lekki conservation bus as part of the admission package to take people from the mainland there, as it is a bit far. This could also be a good",
          "Having left Nigeria at a young age, I never got a chance to learn about the natural habitat prior to it becoming a metropolitan city. A visit to the conservation area changed this and although we didn't get to see all the potential animals (due to them not wanting to be seen),",

          "It's has nice serene,lovely atmosphere and the nature makes you want to stay for even a longer period but there's a need to add other side attractions. The restaurant there can do better and more animals need to put there for more attraction.",
          "This place got such good reviews, I had to check it out for myself. The centre has multiple guides who are eager to tell you about the animals and the conservation programs. The canopy suspension bridges are well worth the walk; you truly feel like you're above the trees.",

          "Had fun even though it was in a quiet and kind of stressful way. Didn't see much except for the monkeys and tilapia fish. Most of the fun was taking the canopy walk. The canopy walk is one-way then you take some wooden bridge back, I was disappointed because I thought we would",
          "I saw the conservation centre on trip adviser and thought it would be a nice place to visit. The place is nice and clean and the walk is a nice walk talk. The guides and staf are very friendly. I was, however, disappointed in that we hardly saw any wildlife. There were a few",

          "This place was exciting. Not a lot of animals to spot apart from monkeys, peacocks and some birds. Children under 12 can not use the canopy walk, so take that into consideration when going as you might have to split ways if in a group. The venue is a great place to hang out for",
          "A lovely location that makes you forget you are in the center of a busy city. The new walkway is a lovely addition for the more adventurous travellers. Children really enjoyed the experience. Walkway is a bit worn and could use an update but otherwise no issues",

          "People go there in anticipation of dangerous snakes or crocodiles (thinking..well, it's africa isn't it?). Yes it is africa, but thisplace is in the heart of a developed city. Plus it is not a zoo. So No none of such. There are lots of peacocks, turtles, monkeys and birds.",
          "First of all, don't go here expecting to see lots of animals. It will end in disappointment. I've been several times over the years even once as a child, and the most I've ever seen is the ubiquitous peacock, some birds, a monkey and some snakes and lizards. There are apparently",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Ikeja is the capital of Lagos State in southwestern Nigeria. Its population, as of 2015, is 861,300. Prior to the emergence of military rule in the early 1980s, Ikeja was a well planned, clean and quiet residential and commercial town with shopping malls, pharmacies and government reservation areas. The Murtala Mohammed International Airport is located in Ikeja. Ikeja is also home to Femi Kuti's Africa Shrine and Lagbaja's Motherland, both venues for live music. Its Ikeja City Mall is the largest mall on the Lagos State mainland. Ikeja also has its own radio station, broadcasting both in English (Eko FM) and in Yoruba (Radio Lagos).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name of Ikeja is said to be an abbreviation from Ikorodu and Epe Joint Administration. It was originally settled by the Awori people, and the area was raided for slaves until the mid-19th century. Early in the 20th century it became an agricultural hinterland for Lagos. The opening of the Lagos-Ibadan railway in 1901 and the growth of Lagos as a port transformed Ikeja into a residential and industrial suburb of that city. In the mid-1960s an industrial estate was established, and in 1976 Ikeja became the capital of Lagos state.\n\n\n== Government and infrastructure ==\nThe Local Government administrative headquarters of Ikeja are located within the Ikeja Local Government premises. As of June 2019, the Chairman (Mayor) of Ikeja's local government is Engr. Mojeed Balogun.The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has its headquarters in Ikeja on the grounds of Murtala Muhammad Airport. The Accident Investigation Bureau of the Nigerian government is headquartered in Ikeja. The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has its head office in Aviation House on the grounds of the airport; this was formerly just the Lagos office.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nSeveral airlines have their head offices situated in Ikeja. Arik Air's head office is in the Arik Air Aviation Centre on the grounds of Murtala Muhammed Airport. Aero Contractors has its head office on the grounds of Murtala Muhammed Airport. Overland Airways has its head office in Ikeja. Other airlines with head offices in Ikeja include Associated Aviation and Dana Air. In addition, Virgin Atlantic has its Nigerian office in \"The Place\" in Ikeja.At one point, Nigeria Airways had its head office in Airways House. Before it was dissolved, Afrijet Airlines had its head office in the NAHCO Building on the grounds of the airport. Bellview Airlines had its headquarters in the Bellview Plaza. Other now-defunct airlines with head offices in Ikeja include Air Nigeria (formerly Nigerian Eagle and Virgin Nigeria Airways), on the 9th Floor of Etiebets Place, Sosoliso Airlines, and ADC Airlines.A slum in Ikeja was recently selected by C. J. Obasi as a production location for his upcoming Nollywood thriller, Ojuju.Ikeja also has a main market area called Ipodo Market. This market contains many shops and makeshift stalls where merchants display and sell produce, meat, fish, grains, and other groceries.\n\n\n== Communities ==\nDistricts in the city include:\n\nAnifowose\nOregun\nOjodu\nOpebi\nAkiode\nAlausa\nAgidingb\nOgba\nMagodo\nMaryland\nOnigbongbo\nGovernment Reserved Area, Ikeja\n\n\n== Computer Village ==\n\nIkeja is home to a large computer market, popularly known as Otigba. Begun in 1997 as a small market of only 10 shops, the current market now has well over 3000. While most vendors provide the expected computer sales and repair services, it is also possible to find sales and repair services for various types of office equipment and electronic devices.By 2019, the little shops at Computer Village had grown to multiple-storey shopping malls. Many of the single-floor buildings have been developed into larger buildings, housing several shops that distribute and repair mobile phones, laptops, printers and other electronic devices. Nearly all the major Nigerian banks have branches around the market.\nAs the market is unplanned, it has experienced difficulties in its growth, with some local residents expressing frustration at the market's expansion. Traffic around the area has become very congested, and it can be almost impossible to find a place to park. Furthermore, the electrical infrastructure, which was already unreliable, has become overloaded by the new market, which requires significant amounts of electricity to demonstrate working computer products to potential customers.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nRailway stations in Nigeria\nEko Hospital\nSurulere\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Lagos (, US also ; Yoruba: \u00c8k\u00f3) is the most populous city in Nigeria and all of Africa. Lagos is a major financial centre for all of Africa and is the economic hub of Lagos State. The megacity has the fourth-highest GDP in Africa and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports on the continent. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world.Lagos initially emerged as a port city that originated on a collection of islands, which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos Island, Eti-Osa, Amuwo-Odofin and Apapa. The islands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon, while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach, which stretch up to 100 km (62 mi) east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanization, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland, Ajeromi-Ifelodun and Surulere. This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the Island, which was the initial city of Lagos, before it expanded into the area known as the Mainland. This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council, until the creation of Lagos State in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the then Western Region to form the state.Lagos, the capital of Nigeria since its amalgamation in 1914, went on to become the capital of Lagos State after its creation. However, the state capital was later moved to Ikeja in 1976, and the federal capital moved to Abuja in 1991. Even though Lagos is still widely referred to as a city, the present day Lagos, also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\", and officially as \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\" is an urban agglomeration or conurbation, consisting of 16 LGAs including Ikeja, the state capital of Lagos State. This conurbation makes up 37% of Lagos State's total land area, but houses about 85% of the state's total population.The exact population of Metropolitan Lagos is disputed. In the 2006 federal census data, the conurbation had a population of about 8 million people. However, the figure was disputed by the Lagos State Government, which later released its own population data, putting the population of Lagos Metropolitan Area at approximately 16 million. As of 2015, unofficial figures put the population of \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\", which includes Lagos and its surrounding metro area, extending as far as into Ogun State, at approximately 21 million.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLagos was originally inhabited by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba people in the 15th century. Under the leadership of the Oloye Olofin, the Awori moved to an island now called Iddo and then to the larger Lagos Island. In the 16th century, the Awori settlement was conquered by the Benin Empire and the island became a Benin war-camp called \"Eko\" under Oba Orhogbua, the Oba of Benin at the time. Eko is still the native name for Lagos.\nLagos, which means \"lakes\", was a name given to the settlement by the Portuguese. Throughout history, it was home to a number of warring ethnic groups who had settled in the area. Following its early settlement by the Awori nobility, and its conquest by the Bini warlords of Benin, the state first came to the attention of the Portuguese in the 15th century.Portuguese explorer Rui de Sequeira visited the area in 1472, naming the area around the city Lago de Curamo. Another explanation is that Lagos is named after a major port in Portugal\u2014a maritime town that, at the time, was the main centre of Portuguese expeditions down the African coast, Lagos, Portugal.\nIn Britain's early 19th century fight against the transatlantic slave trade, its West Africa Squadron or Preventative Squadron as it was also known, continued to pursue Portuguese, American, French and Cuban slave ships and to impose anti-slavery treaties with West African coastal chiefs with so much doggedness that they created a strong presence along the West African coast from Sierra Leone all the way to the Niger Delta (today's Nigeria) and as far south as Congo. In 1849, Britain appointed John Beecroft Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, a position he held (along with his governorship of Fernando Po) until his death in 1854. John Duncan was appointed Vice Consul and was located at Wydah. At the time of Beecroft's appointment, the Kingdom of Lagos (under Oba Kosoko) was in the western part of the Consulate of the Bights of Benin and Biafra and was a key slave trading port. In 1851 and with pressure from liberated slaves who now wielded political and business influence, Britain intervened in Lagos in what is now known as the Bombardment of Lagos or Capture of Lagos resulting in the installation of Oba Akitoye and the ouster of Oba Kosoko. Oba Akitoye then signed the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos abolishing slavery. The signing of the 1852 treaty ushered in the Consular Period in Lagos' history wherein Britain provided military protection for Lagos.Following threats from Kosoko and the French who were positioned at Wydah, a decision was made by Lord Palmerston (British Prime Minister) who noted in 1861, \"the expediency of losing no time in assuming the formal Protectorate of Lagos\". William McCoskry, the Acting Consul in Lagos with Commander Bedingfield convened a meeting with Oba Dosunmu on 30 July 1861 aboard HMS Prometheus where Britain's intent was explained and a response to the terms were required by August 1861. Dosunmu resisted the terms of the treaty but under the threat to unleash violence on Lagos by Commander Bedingfield, Dosunmu relented and signed the Lagos Treaty of Cession on 6 August 1861.\n\nLagos was declared a colony on 5 March 1862. The remainder of modern-day Nigeria was seized in 1887, and when the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was established in 1914, Lagos became its capital, continuing as such after the country's independence from Britain in 1960. Along with migrants from all over Nigeria and other West African nations were the returnee ex-slaves known as Creoles, who came from Freetown, Sierra Leone, Brazil and the West Indies to Lagos. The Creoles contributed to Lagos' modernisation and their knowledge of Portuguese architecture can still be seen from the architecture on Lagos Island. Since the 19th century, Lagos gradually transformed to a melting pot of Africans and Europeans. Railway links and telephone cables connecting Lagos to London had been established by 1886. Electric street lighting was introduced in the city in 1898. Lagos experienced rapid growth throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a result of Nigeria's economic boom.Before the creation of Lagos State on 27 May 1967, Lagos, which was the country's capital had been administered directly by the Federal Government as a Federal Territory through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs, while the Lagos City Council (LCC) governed the city. Lagos, along with the towns from the then Western region (Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu, Epe and Badagry), were eventually captured to create Lagos State. Lagos city was split into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), while the other towns now make up 13 LGAs in the state. Lagos played the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital until 1976 when the state capital was moved to Ikeja. Lagos was adversely affected during Nigeria's military rule. Also, on 12 December 1991, the seat of the Federal Government was also formally relocated to Abuja. However, Lagos remains the financial centre of the country, and also grew to become the most populous conurbation in the country.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLagos is loosely classified into two main geographical areas\u2014the \"Island\" and the \"Mainland\".\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n==== Island ====\n\nThe Island is a loose geographical term that is used to define the area of Lagos that is separated from the \"mainland\" by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic Ocean, which forms Lagos Harbour. The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected together by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events in Lagos takes place. It also houses most of the upscale residential areas in Lagos. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be in the Island include Lagos Island, Eti-Osa. The major upscale island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include Ikoyi and Victoria Island. Three major bridges join the island to the mainland. They are the Carter Bridge, which starts from Iddo; the Eko Bridge (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the Third Mainland Bridge, which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon.\n\n\n===== Lagos Island =====\n\nLagos Island contains a central business district. This district is characterized by high-rise buildings. The island also contains many of the city's largest wholesale marketplaces (such as the popular Idumota and Balogun Markets). It also has the National Museum of Nigeria, the Central Mosque, the Glover Memorial Hall, Christ's Church Cathedral (CMS) and the Oba's Palace (Iga Idunganran). Another major part of Lagos Island is Marina. It borders around the idumota and Balogun markets and houses major Banking institutions. Though formerly in a derelict condition, Lagos Island's Tinubu Square is a site of historical importance; it was here that the Amalgamation Ceremony that unified the North and South protectorate to form Nigeria took place in 1914.\n\n\n===== Ikoyi =====\n\nIkoyi is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a land fill. Ikoyi is also connected to Victoria Island by Falomo bridge, which carries the main road over Five Cowrie creek. Ikoyi housed the headquarters of the federal government of Nigeria and other buildings owned by the government, including the old federal secretariat complex. The complex today is on reestablishment.In Ikoyi there are military and police barracks, a top-security prison and a federal high court of Nigeria. Ikoyi also has a number of hotels, night clubs, a recreational park and one of Africa's largest golf courses. Originally a middle class neighbourhood, in recent years, it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the upper middle class to the upper class. There are also commercial activities in Ikoyi, which is spotted in an increasing number of offices, banks, and shopping complexes. The commercial section is concentrated in the South-West.\n\n\n===== Victoria Island =====\n\nVictoria Island with its annexe is situated to the south of Lagos Island. It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments are blooming up everywhere.\nAlong with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts of several sizeable shopping districts. On its sea shore along the Atlantic front, there is environmentally reconstructed Bar Beach.\n\n\n===== Iddo =====\nAcross the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called Iddo. Iddo is also a railroad terminus and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland local government area after it was connected to the mainland like a peninsula.\n\n\n==== Mainland ====\nA huge population of Lagosians also live on the Lagos mainland, and most industries are located there. The mainland is known for its music and nightlife, which used to be located in areas around Yaba and Surulere. However, in recent years more night clubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island, Ikate and Lekki Phase 1) the main nightlife attractions. Mainland LGAs include Surulere, Apapa, and Lagos Mainland. Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: Agege, Amuwo Odofin, Mushin, Oshodi-Isolo and Ikeja (site of Murtala Muhammed International Airport and the capital of Lagos State).\nMajor Areas on the mainland include Ebute Metta, Yaba and Ejigbo. Some rivers, like Badagry Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLagos experiences a tropical savanna climate (Aw) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, as there's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season. The wet season starts in April and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in March. The wettest month is June with precipitation total 315.5 millimetres (12.42 in), while the driest month is January with precipitation total 13.2 millimetres (0.52 in).\nLocated near the equator, Lagos has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging 28.3\u201332.9 \u00b0C (82.9\u201391.2 \u00b0F). Lagos shares the seasons of the Southern Hemisphere, with summer highs in March, daily range 32.9\u201324.1 \u00b0C (91.2\u201375.4 \u00b0F), and warm winters in August, ranging 28.3\u201321.8 \u00b0C (82.9\u201371.2 \u00b0F) as the daily average.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nLagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria. The architectural styles in Lagos are diverse and range from tropical and vernacular to colonial European and ultramodern buildings or a mixture. Brazilian style architecture brought by the creoles is evident in buildings such as Water House and  Shitta Bey Mosque. Skyscrapers and most high rise buildings are centered on the islands, while the mainland has some high rise buildings. In recent years, the Lagos State government has renovated existing parks and green areas, with a long-term goal of expansion. Many good quality buildings are interspersed across the city.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, there are Christian churches and temples: Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of Nigeria (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Nigerian Baptist Convention (Baptist World Alliance), The Apostolic Church Nigeria (TACN), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Assemblies of God, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos (Catholic Church) and Muslim mosques such as Lagos Central Mosque in Lagos- island, Wahab Folawiyo Central Mosque in Surulere, Lekki Central Mosque in Lekki, The Syrian Mosque in Ikoyi. There are also various shrines and temples for traditional worshipers scattered across the state and they include several Igbo Igunnuko shrines, Egungun shrines, Eyo Shrines and other various traditional shrines and places of worship. For the 25,000 strong Hindu community, there is an ISKCON temple and three other Hindu temples dotted around the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn terms of administration, Lagos is not a single municipality and therefore has no overall city administration. The geographical city limits of Metropolitan Lagos comprises 16 of the 20 Local Government Areas, which together comprise Lagos State. The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region. The Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi, and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several Local Government Areas (most notably Lagos Island LGA, Lagos Mainland LGA and Eti-Osa LGA).The mainland beyond the Municipality of Lagos, on the other hand, comprised several separate towns and settlements such as Mushin, Ikeja and Agege. In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom, Lagos experienced a population explosion, untamed economic growth, and unmitigated rural migration. This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly, thus forming the present day \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\", also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\". The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them.\nBy 2006, the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State's boundaries and attained a megacity status. This much larger area is referred to as \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\" or \"Lagos Megacity Region\", which is a continuous built up land area of additional 1,535.4 square kilometres (592.8 square miles), comprising sprawls in LGAs situated next to Lagos' eastern and western city limits in Lagos State, and beyond northern limits, spilling into the LGAs in adjoining Ogun State. Ogun State LGAs within Greater Metropolitan Lagos majorly include: Obafemi Owode, Sagamu, Ifo, Ado-Odo/Ota and part of Ewekoro.\n\nToday, the word Lagos most often refers to the urban area, called \"Metropolitan Lagos\" in Nigeria, which includes both the islands of the former municipality of Lagos and the mainland suburbs. Lagos State government is responsible for some of the utilities including roads and transportation, power, water, health and education. Metropolitan Lagos extends over 16 of the 20 LGAs of Lagos State, and contains about 85% of the population of Lagos State, and includes semi-rural areas. Lagos City has a considerable number of high-rise buildings that dominate its skyline. Most of the tall buildings are located in the downtown Central Business District.\nLagos was the former capital city of Nigeria but it has since been replaced by Abuja. Abuja officially gained its status as the capital of Nigeria on 12 December 1991, although the decision to move the federal capital had been made in now Act no. 6 of 1976. Lagos is also home to the High Court of the Lagos State Judiciary, housed in an old colonial building on Lagos Island.\n\n\n=== Census data for Lagos ===\nAlthough the 2006 National Population Census of Nigeria credited the metropolitan area with a population figure of 7,937,932, the figure is at variance with some projections by the UN and other population agencies and groups worldwide. The population figure of Lagos State given by the Lagos State Government is 17,553,924. It was based on claimed conducted enumeration for social planning by the Lagos State Government \"parallel census\" and it believes that since the inhabitants of the metropolitan area of Lagos constitute 88% of the Lagos State population, the population of metropolitan Lagos is about 15.5 million.A rejoinder to Lagos State Government views concluded that Lagos State concealed the fact that the population projection, for Lagos Urban Agglomeration by the UN agencies had been revised downwards substantially as early as 2003. It failed to interpret the two most important and fairly representative and reliable secondary data sets already in public domain, the National Identity Card Scheme and the 2003 Voters Registration figures from INEC. The figures for 2007 Voters Registration by INEC were an act subsequent to the release of the provisional census results and comprehensively corroborate, vindicate and validate the population figures in no uncertain terms.\nAccording to the official results of the 2006 census, there were 8,048,430 inhabitants in Metropolitan Lagos. This figure was lower than anticipated, and has created controversy in Nigeria. Lagos Island, the central Local Government Area and historic centre of Metropolitan Lagos, had a population of 212,700 at the 2006 Census.\n\nAuthorities of Lagos State have attacked the results of the 2006 census, accusing the Nigerian National Population Commission of having undercounted the population of the state. This accusation is denied by the National Population Commission. A study found that research carried out by Africapolis (the African subsidiary of e-Geopolis backed by the Agence fran\u00e7aise de d\u00e9veloppement), in addition to the cross-referencing of official figures with more scientific independent research concluded that the 2006 census figures for Lagos State of about 9 million were valid and that the state's own assessments are inflated.Lagos is, by most estimates, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Lagos is currently experiencing a population increase of about 275,000 persons per annum. In 1999 the United Nations predicted that the city's metropolitan area, which had only about 290,000 inhabitants in 1950, would exceed 20 million by 2010 and thus become one of the ten most populated cities in the world.\n\nThere is a huge spectrum of wealth distribution among the people that reside in Lagos. It ranges from the very wealthy to the very poor. Lagos has attracted many young people and families seeking a better life from all other parts of Nigeria and beyond and this has also contributed to its cosmopolitan status. Some people are leaving Lagos and Nigeria in search of better living conditions, cities like Townsville in Australia are very popular with expats and have services set up to assist people in settling into their new life.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Lagos is a major economic focal point in Nigeria, generating around 10% of the country's GDP. Most commercial and financial business is carried out in the central business district situated on the island. This is also where most of the country's commercial banks, financial institutions and major corporations are headquartered. Lagos is also the major Information Communications and Telecommunications (ICT) hub of West Africa and potentially, the biggest ICT market in the continent. Lagos is developing a 24-hour economy and has also been ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the world. In some parts of Lagos, residents have one of the highest standards of living in Nigeria and in Africa. At the same time, a sizable proportion of the residents live in slums without access to piped water and sanitation.The Port of Lagos is Nigeria's leading port and one of the largest and busiest in Africa.

The levels are Primary, Junior Secondary School (JSS), Senior Secondary School (SSS) and university. All children are offered basic education, with special focus now on the first nine years. Many of the schools in Nigeria are federally funded and usually are boarding schools. A few examples are Federal government college Odogbolu (FGCOdogbolu), Federal government girls college Sagamu (FGGCSagamu) and Federal government college Kano (FGCKano). The state of Lagos has its own federally funded high schools namely Federal government college Ijanikin also known as FGC Lagos, Kings College and Queens College.\nLagos is home to various postsecondary schools, universities and other vocational institutions that are either operated by the government or private entities.\n\n\n=== Vocational schools ===\nInstitute for Industrial Technology (IIT) : founded in 2000, IIT is a technical vocational school for male youth from families with limited resources. Its educational model is based on the Dual Training System.\n\n\n=== Polytechnics ===\nYaba College of Technology (YABATECH) : founded in 1934, the college is Nigeria's first higher educational institution and third in Africa. The college is a center of culture and heritage. Currently it has student enrolment of over 16,000.\nLagos State Polytechnic is a polytechnic comprising more than six schools including private polytechnics and was founded 25 years ago.

For example, the oldest Nigerian hospital is located in the city as well as West Africa's first air-operated emergency medical service, which commenced in the city. The Lagos healthcare system is generally divided into public and private sectors that provide medical services at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Although the private hospitals are usually more expensive, it does not necessarily translate to better health-care delivery.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nLagos has one of the largest and most extensive road networks in West Africa. It also has suburban trains and some ferry services. Highways are usually congested in peak hours, due in part to the geography of the city, as well as to its explosive population growth. Lagos is also linked by many highways and bridges. A new rail system that is supposed to span the length of the Badagry expressway is currently under construction.\nThe Lagos\u2013Ibadan Expressway and the Lagos\u2013Abeokuta Expressway are the major controlled-access highways in the north of the city and serve as inter-state highways to Oyo State and Ogun State respectively. To the west the congested Lagos\u2013Badagry Expressway serves outlying towns such as Festival Town, which was the location for the 1977 Festival of Black Arts and Culture 77.Lagos's importance as a commercial centre and port and its strategic location have led to it being the end-point of three Trans-African Highway routes using Nigeria's national roads. The Trans\u2013West African Coastal Highway leaves the city as the Badagry Expressway to Benin and beyond as far as Dakar and Nouakchott; the Trans-Sahara Highway to Algiers, which is close to completion, leaves the city as the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.Lagos State has a bus rapid transit (BRT) system; the first phase was completed in February 2008. It is expected to operate along eight routes using specially designated bus rapid transit lanes running through the city, with the aim of expanding to other routes in the future.\nThe first phase of the Lagos BRT runs 19 km (12 mi) through Ikorodu Road and Funsho Williams Avenue up to CMS. After weeks of test runs, operations started on 17 March 2008, six months earlier than planned. Also, the signature color of Lagos state 14-seater bus (known as Danfo) is yellow with a touch of black.\nIt has been estimated that the system will transport about 10,000 passengers in each direction per hour during peak travel times. At these times traffic congestion, called \"Go Slow\", by Lagosians, can be extreme. The LAMATA bus rapid transit corridor covers a distance of about 22 km (14 mi). The system is run by two operators, NURTW Cooperative (Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers) and Lagbus, a Lagos State Government owned Asset Management Company that contributes about 180 high-capacity buses for the implementation of the first phase Mile 12 to CMS BRT Lite system.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nAn extensive urban rail system, Lagos Rail Mass Transit, running through the Lagos metropolis is currently under construction. Several intercity and commuter trains serve Lagos through the Lagos Terminus railway station.\n\n\n=== Ferries ===\nLagos State Ferry Services Corporation runs a few regular routes, for example between Lagos Island and the mainland, served by modern ferries and wharves. Private boats run irregular passenger services on the lagoon and on some creeks.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLagos is served by Murtala Muhammed International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in Africa. The MMIA is Nigeria's premier international air gateway. The airport's history dates back to colonial times, around the time of the Second World War. The current international airport terminal was built and commissioned over 40 years ago, in 1978. The terminal opened officially March 15, 1979. The airport had been known simply as the Lagos International Airport. It was, however, renamed for the late Nigerian Head of State, General Murtala Muhammed, who died in 1976.\nThe airport terminal has been renovated several times since the 1970s but its most radical makeover began in 2013, following the launch of the Federal government's multi-billion naira Remodelling/ Rehabilitation Programme for its airports nationwide. Under the re-modeling work there, by late in 2014, the MMlA lounge area had been expanded to four times its previous size and new passenger handling conveyor systems installed which can handle over 1,000 passengers per hour.\nA second airport, Lekki-Epe International Airport is proposed.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAbike Dabiri, Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission\nAgbani Darego, Miss Nigeria 2001, Semifinalist Miss Universe 2001 and Miss World 2001\nAkinwunmi Ambode, former Governor of Lagos state\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, Governor of Lagos State\nBabatunde Fashola, Former Governor of Lagos and current Minister of Power, Works and Housing\nBode George, Politician\nBola Tinubu, Former Governor of Lagos State\nBuchi Emecheta, novelist\nFunsho Williams, politician and one time aspirant to the office of Lagos state governor\nHakeem Olajuwon, professional basketball player\nIsrael Adesanya, UFC Middle weight champion\nIsrael Idonije, Professional American football player, Chicago Bears 2003\u20132013, Detroit Lions 2013\nNelson Agholor, Professional American football player, Super Bowl 52 Champion with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018\nRilwan Akiolu, Oba (traditional ruler) of Lagos\nToyin Saraki, global health advocate and healthcare philanthropist\nYemi Osinbajo, politician, lawyer and current Vice-President of Nigeria\nYvonne Orji, Actress, Comedian\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\n\nLagos is twinned with:\n Gary, Indiana, United States, since 1991\n Atlanta, Georgia, United States, since 1974\n Bucharest, Romania\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of largest cities\nList of Governors of Lagos State\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLeithead, Alastair (August 2017).

        "wiki": "Freedom Park is a memorial and leisure park area in the middle of downtown Lagos in Lagos Island, Nigeria which was formerly Her Majesty's Broad Street Prison. It was designed by the Architect Theo Lawson.\nThe Park was constructed to preserve the history and cultural heritage of Nigerians.\nMonuments in the park reveal the Lagos colonial heritage and history of Her Majesty's Broad Street prisons. It was built to commemorate the 50th anniversary independence celebration in October, 2010. The Park serves as a National Memorial, a Historical landmark, a Cultural site, Arts and Recreation centre.\nThe park, which is now a serene abode for individuals, visitors' collective contemplation and interaction is open to the public every day. Today, freedom park has become a venue for diverse social events and recreational entertainment.\n\n\n== History ==\nBroad Street Prison was established after Britain made Lagos a Colony in 1861 (see Lagos Treaty of Cession).The initial prison structure was built in 1882 with mud walls and grass thatch but did not last long because of sabotage from colonial government opponents. According to Theo Lawson, architect of Freedom Park, opponents of British colonialism in Lagos \"kept throwing fire into it and setting it ablaze and so then in 1885 the colonial government imported bricks from England and rebuilt the prison\".The colonial government's expense on the prison in 1882 (\u00a316,000) revealed the government's priority on law and order versus other initiatives such as education which the government spent  \u00a3700 on. The Colonial report for 1898 indicates that 676 males, 26 females, and 11 juveniles were imprisoned at Broad Street prison for the year.\nBroad Street Prison was pulled down in 1979 and was reduced to a dumping ground until the 1990s when plans were drawn up to transform the site into a creative space.\n\n\n== Notable prisoners at Broad Street Prison ==\nHerbert Macaulay\nAnthony Enahoro\nObafemi Awolowo\nMichael Imoudu\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Freedom Park\".",

          "This used to be a fun place to visit but with the development of the Eko Atlantic, the shoreline has suffered a bit. Might take me a while to go back here. Not enough space to play on most days. Not much to do besides whatever you came with and horse rides. TripAdvisor won't let",
          "This beautiful beach was very near to our hotel (Four Points by Sheraton). Your Nigerian vacation should include at least one day at this resort location. We were invited as part of a work outing and had the pleasure of a long walk down secluded end of the beach as well as",
          "Not that this well designed and managed African beach bears any resemblance to the Old Bar Beach, the smell of the salty mighty Atlantic ocean, the loudness of the waves crashing onto the beach is a beautiful, marvellous site to behold. Obviously, we are in Africa, but you can't",
          "I'll rather the Oniru private beaches or even Barracuda beach. One unique thing about Elegushi, it has a great night life. You are allowed to bring drinks in also. Be careful at night and stay as close as possible to the crowd or simply go to the bars around to sit and/or dance.",

          "The Elegushi beach offers a picturesque view of the Atlantic Ocean and offers a tranquil environment for reminiscing and unwinding with the family. But a lot work of work is required on the access road leading to the beach.",
          "Street touts dominating this beach - too suppressing . Water looks and is dirty and dangerous. It is a one time checkbox tick visit with security or strong locals to say you have seen it. Better dont go at all!",
          "I had been to Elegishi beach about 5 years ago and totally loved my experience, little did I know it had deteriorated over the years. This beach is now a dirty place. My friends and I couldn't stand it we had to run out even after paying the gate fee.",
          "I visit the beach as often as possible as the place overlaps my location. I really like the Sunday crowd and the crazy music that send a mix of the wind and the music into your brains..",
          "The beach was clean and beautiful. There were lots of activities. We particularly enjoyed the horse rides. There is need for investments to uptimize experiences there",
          "I was expecting something similar to match the horror stories I'd been told - dirty surroundings and hardened miscreants. I was pleasantly surprised. Whoever is responsible for keeping the grounds clean deserves a thumbs up. The absence of miscreants was a relief, as I didn't",

          "Went on a Sunday had to pay extra 3000 for sea view because i needed to sit as far away from the crowd as possible. The first hut we went into had people exhibiting behaviours kids should not see and you could not see the water from the hut.The food was also overpriced,Not ever",

          "After haggling over the entry price as we visited in the week, we spent two hours walking the length of the beach over and over trying to shake off the touts who harassed us continually. We eventually sat down for a drink, only to be told unless we brought food we would have to",
          "It's fairly stocked with basic facilities. It is noisy with touts everywhere who extort money from you to gain entrance. The water is dirty just like the beach. But it's a nice place to take cool air and relax far away from the noisy Lagos. There are bars for drinks and snacks.",
          "Its a nice place to visit early in the morning when you can take long walks, or play some sports like soccer, or just read a book and meditate with the serene environment.",
          "From the moment you drive through, you meet them! Ready to exploit your money....and they never leave, until you bend to their wishes. The beach itself is so poor. Apart from the feel of nature you get, Elegushi beach is not a great experience overall. Avoid this place please.",
          "I don't understand this so called beach. You are charged an exorbitant price to enter a beach that, quite frankly, isn't nice at all. There isn't anything there, you can't swim. I would not suggest anyone to visit this place.",
          "This is a lovely beach to come and relax. At only N1,000 per person to enter it really isn't bad. There are plenty of refreshments on offer from the beach bar and service comes with a smile. I have been to Elegushi Beach many times and will come back again!",
          "I enjoyed staying in my rented shed and watching endless sea waves. I took time to snap many pictures. The environment was generally friendly but largely unstructured and unorganised. There was little or no presence of security on ground.",

          "Went to this private beach hoping for a quite day. We drove and had to pay 1000N for entrance and parking. We had come here for a quite walk along the beach and just feel the sea breeze. This did not happen as we were inundated by touts and they didn't stop. You got touts",
          "Watch out, the moment they think you are not from here they try to bride you big time. We had to pay over 3000 naira extra for sea view... excuse me? Sea view? What do you expect me to do when your at the beach, close my eyes? Besides that, the moment you arrive a lot of people",
          "A lovely popular beach, youthful vibes, music and food. However, I did come across much nicer beaches in other parts. Still worth a visit.",

          "Nice beach but loud and crowded. Typically packed on the weekends and over festive periods with a lot of traffic getting in. Great fun if you like crowded loud areas. Great waves though",

          "You get a welcome to this beach by some touts who requests an entrance fee. Just a token and not to worry security is okay. Beach line is very cool to walk on and you can sit at the beach bars to have some drinks.",
          "As I was staying not to far away from the beach we decided to drive there. Moma drove to the old entrance to ask if this was the main entrance which they confirmed. We paid entrance fee of 1000 Naira and then we were supposed to follow the motorbike who took us through some back",
          "I had mixed emotions about going to this beach. We went on a Monday because the weekends are the busiest . I wanted to go when the beach was less busy so I could enjoy the natural beauty. Upon our arrival I noticed the beach was empty. I thought we were in the wrong place.",
          "I felt like walking barefoot on a sandy ground so I came to this beach. But from the gate, we were over charged to go in and to sit on chairs, we were overcharged again. Apart from the cool breeze and sandy feeling on my feet, it wasnt a very nice experience.",
          "The beach in itself could be more serene and peaceful if not for the hustlers trying to hustle you to go on horse rides, buy drinks, rent tents and whatnot. I still had a great time with my friends and walked alongside the beach front.",
          "In one word, 'chaotic' would be best in describing my experience at this beach. A lot of unnecessary toll collection from people that could be best described as marabouts. You pay about two different entrance fees to access the beach in addition parking. Then you are constantly",
          "I came here with a group of friends at night time. We had so much fun dancing to great music from the Dj. There are several \"hut-like structures\" here where you can have drinks and a good time.",

          "It was my first time at this beach andit happened that it was at night. Some femal friends asked that we hang out and I though why not; let me give you a treat! They chose the Elegushi beach and said the best time to go there is at night. I was surprised... almost scared. lol",

          "Wow. Imagine! Upon getting to the beach with our UBER car service we paid N1000 each to enter inside. From that very moment about 4 to 6 people flocked and followed my Fiance, and My cousin to the inside of the beach. I absolutely hate it when you cannot get peace and quiet on",
          "I remember going here about 8 years ago and how peaceful and semi clean it used to be. Now, we still pay a fee to get in and the level of uncleanliness is out of this world. What are they using the toll gate fees for?!",

          "My idea of a nice beach is: sun, water, farniente, lounge bars Elegushi is so far away of that: garbages on the sand, loud music, beach boys everywhere, hot and expensive beverages, broken plastic chairs,... my God! The worst beach in Lagos! The paradox is that this place could",
          "Went to this beach twice within the last 6 months. Less crowded than the other regular beaches in Lagos-Lekki area as probably it is lesser known. The Atlantic is a Beauty in the Sunset. The area has an entry fee of 500 NGN per Adult. But the Beach is better than the other",
          "If you are a tout, enjoy smoking marijuana and taking prostitutes home then you will love it. The first time i went my friends and i was summoned with 'body guards', the second time i made the mistake of not having one, although nothing happened to me. I doubt there will be a",
          "if you want to know what the down-town social-life looks like in Lagos, then Elegushi Beach is the place to be. Every night, fun-seekers flock the beach to take beer and grilled fish under the moonlight with the light breeze blowing from the beach. While I'd warn that you be",
          "Busy beach at weekends, variety of bars to choose from, plethora of activities, good parking space, good and variety of music from several points. A fun place overall.",
          "We have been to Elegushi beach several times with friends and also with my children. The road signs are confusing so just look out for a smaller sign at the turning of the road where the school is. There are about 3 signs, the smaller one i think is the middle one so once you",
          "Its a good travel..take a boat cover 30 min journey you will reach the beach ...its a highly attractive beach and center for visit in lagos. Do not forget to collect some momento from the beach . You will enjoy the place",
          "Was in Nigeria and the road signs wiped off the fun from the beginning a lil bit. Then the cost of entry is a bit off normal compared to how much you're gonna spend in there. Hold lots of cash just in case you decide to eat satisfactory dishes. Charcoal grills on the side. make",
          "Sounds very exciting but it will go down once you see the confusing road signs to the beach, in case you take the wrong road to the beach you are sure to get stuck with people patiently waiting for that to happen and they would start negotiating to get you out of it and it can"

Also there are exclusive spots for those seeking premium experience at the beach. The beach gives a beautiful view of the eko Atlantic in the sunset. Hope you catch it!",
          "This Beach is perfect for Photo Shoots, beach strolls, Parties and relaxing with friends. \n\nUnlike most other beaches I have been, the pressure from the water is too much!!!!\n\nIt's  so scary, there were so very few people playing by the \u2026",
          "Been there twice. Cool place. U will have fun",
          "Small nice beach, the parking space is always an issue for the large crowd that visit there. Not enough games and places for kids, more like an adult hangout. Very cool place and it is neat expect for one area that has an open gutter but the place can be avoided",
          "Really a nice place for leisure. Used to be a private beach with fewer crowds before, but now, its so overcrowded especially during festive seasons and public holidays. But it's still a fun place to be. \ud83d\udc4c\n\nAmbience 5\nParking 3\nServices 4 \u2026",
          "I love it here. I get to sit real close to the waters while enjoying drinks alone or with friends. There are lots of bars and restaurants that offer good meals at great prices and gosh the view of the Sun setting over the waters gets me \u2026",
          "my favourite place... girls plenty... everything plenty",
          "I like this beach, the whole place is well organised. The only thing I don't like about it is there is no functional bathroom. I learnt its under construction anyways. Besides that everything looks fine. Its a nice place to take your families to. There are water guards there to ensure no one gets drown. This is fantastic.",
          "Great beach, quieter then elegushi,  if you don't want noise",
          "This private beach is gradually turning into a lake.\nThe construction in and around it have taken away the aquatic life it's known for. The is a barrier opposite the sitting area and more buildings are springing up on the beach.\nThe beach \u2026",
          "Beach vibes is nice, those area boys at the gate complicate things for visitors visiting the beach, there is no functional bathroom so there isnt any decent place to change , the suya that\u2019s being sold at night is very tasty, its a nice place to unwind and hangout with friends.",
          "This place is very popular, organized and easy to locate in the heart of Victoria Island. It is usually jam packed with both human and vehicular traffic. Best to visit before 4pm if you want to experience the beach with less rowdiness. \u2026",
          "The most visited, the most prestigious and most organized private beach on the Island, right in the heart of Victoria Island. Gotta get some sand, sun, ride a horse, then get moist...splash! By the seaside, ordered some suya, soak in the breeze, always packed with a partying crowd...fun always.",

          "Its very beautiful and less noisy than the other most popular ones. \nThough the umbrella space seats are ridiculously bit costly but it can worth it. Many live bands playing although you can choose to tip them or not, barbecue, bars and \u2026",
          "It's actually fun!, the beach club DJ? I'll give him a \ud83d\udcaf\nbut it tends to get over crowded, wouldn't categorize it as a peaceful quiet beach, where you just want to take the breeze in and relax, Also the traffic build up when you are driving out doesn't help either.\nbut I still a swell Time!!",
          "Had a swell time at the beach for moet and Chandon day celebration at the beach. I love the whole set up of the beach, it feels very much as a private beach with so many beach houses and hangout spots. You can have family, friends or lovers \u2026",
          "Beaches in Lagos need to do better. I and my Friends wanted an affordable hangout for the 2nd of January and we decided on Oniru. They knew they masked out their capacity but they kept collecting money from people, getting in we found it \u2026",

          "Beach was cleaner than most but not much activity and DJ of the day was bleh but it was a nice day out. Also those roller coaster looking swings need more protection. Entered one and had my heart in my throat like no protection, 6 guys were \u2026",
          "Horse ride was amazing and a long walk through the beach... It's fun trust me",
          "Okay beach. Entrance fee is N1000 per person while parking is N200 but be prepared to pay for the sitting areas if you plan on using their chairs/umbrellas. Paid N3000 for the plastic chairs(4 or 6 chairs with one table) and the gentleman \u2026",
          "Did you know that the beach is usually lively late at nights?  at this time, the night is colder, the wind stronger yet calm. it is a great time to be at the beach, if you are nocturnal. But for safety reasons, do visit with a friend or friends if you decide to.",
          "This is a good place to hangout with friends, gate fee is 1k per head and 200 for parking. Try to park in the first car park, the inner car park is a sand trap for sedan cars. It is also open 24/7. My major problems with this beach is the lack of public rest rooms and dirt!!!!!",
          "The beach was great, though a bit rowdy for a private beach probably because of the festive season. We had fun though the waves weren't high, was quite low more like a lake than a beach. Also it was quite expensive, to rent a tent I paid 5k.",
          "It was a nice place to spend the evening. The breeze, crowds, beach lovers... Only lacking its environmental works. The water can be clean. Take off the refuse in it and 5start is close",
          "I feel like this beach is overrated. Doesn't even feel private. The few times i've been there, it was crowded and you literally have to pay for almost everything from seats to tables.",

          "This beach is the most active beach in Nigeria. Everywhere crowded, different clubs and bars with music blasting at every angle. \n\nEnough parking space. You may experience alot of traffic at the entrance due to the high rate of vehicular movement in and out of this beach.",
          "I enjoy Oniru beach whenever I go there for events. Entry fee is N1000 per person.",
          "Aside the Moist Beach Bar, there really isn't much more about the beach. It's fairly small and not terribly attractive. Beaches have specific attractions which do not just happen naturally, ironically. Clean beautiful beaches are deliberate \u2026",
          "Its a private beach I.e you have to pay for everything you need. Personally I feel the beach is quite neat and clear water too. It's a beautiful environment where you can have  fun with your friends,partner and family. Make sure you go with enough money and also ensure you have fun.",
          "The beach has only 1 toilet so we had to queue to get in... not sure why we were paying either. Other than that. Great party venue with spacious dance halls and spots for get together.",
          "Very lively environment. Not so easy to access though. There was so much traffic before we could get it, maybe because it was the holiday and a weekend.",
          "It's a secure fun place to be. It's quite fun to be here with lots of activities to partake in. Lots of barbecue, drinks and people to socialise with. It's mad fun over here",
          "Nice front. If you're going for the ocean waves, then this isn't for you as the demarcations have disrupted the ocean flow.\n\nUnlike others, it's less crowded but so many disgustingly overpriced foods, drinks and others. This is even after \u2026",
          "Good beach. Not as neat and organised as its neighbour. However, the night activities are better entertaining. The water is calm as the beach is no longer exposed to the ocean due to the Eko Atlantic City construction. So if you are looking for heavy waves to push you to the shore, you wouldn't get that here.",
          "Safe place to have fun. Clean and ambient atmosphere. Though getting stuffs inside there are quite on the high side for better experience, come with your own enjoyment packages(i believe you know what i mean?)",
          "I had a great time on the beach. The weather was cool so I was very relaxed. I also enjoyed riding the horse along the shore.",
          "It's a cool beach with pleasing view, clean water and exciting things to do such as boat riding, horse riding and many more. \n\nAs at 14th of September 2019 the entrance fee for adult is \u20a61000. Getting seats and around the beach is within \u2026",
          "I love coming here when I want to relax or perhaps hang out. On every occasion I come here, time usually goes by before I notice. You'll be glad to come here on weekends or holidays, but take note there's always a price hike on those days. Better still, you could visit and hang out with work colleagues\ud83d\ude0a...Fun!!!!",
          "Nice beach\nIt's not worth 1000 naira, additionally 200 for parking....",
          "Nice place, the water is neat so you can swim. There are also life guards looking out for people in the water. They've improved a lot in the organization of available space for sit out.. discount is given for groups..discount on gate fees \u2026",
          "This is a cool beach resort that is available all day everyday. There are gazebos that can be used for hangouts/get together(s), there is a high brow private club; you can otherwise sit out at the beach and enjoy the view. Anyway you choose, you are guaranteed to have fun. There are also excellent food choices and music.",
          "Nice place to view the Atlantic, watch the Eko Atlantic sandfilling job as it progresses.  Cool bars and lounges, great parking space, but if visiting during a public holiday, or an holiday weekened, parking outside the Oniru gate is highly \u2026",
          "It's a good place to cool and have fun in the beach water, during the holidays it's always crowded and a lot of children play in the beach water!",
          "The beach was nice. There were tents for visitor, drinks and chops were affordable",
          "Wow the experience was out of this  world. I really love. Thumbs up to the great oniru beach.",
          "Expensive but really beautiful and well done. Great live music on Tuesdays. Nice pool, Good for well-to-do locals and expats alike. The mixologists can do better. A good 'old fashioned' cocktail will be an important start.",
          "It a nice resort,you can fun at it best and a good relaxation.....Best time to visit is week day ,always crowded in weekend's.",
          "The beach is a dump site with refuse everywhere. Traffic in and out of the beach is horrible with zero organization. Only good thing about this beach is Moist Club. Every other thing is a hot mess.",
          "Oniru private beach is indeed a nice place to visit.. So much fun, wonderful environment, cleaning and peace... I recommend this place \ud83d\ude18",
          "Great Location for a fun beach day.\n\n1K entry fee per person.\n\nRelatively clean compared to some other beach locations.\n\nNice place for a party. External drinks are allowed.\n\nGreat sitting spaces and tents (you will have to pay for a canopy and chairs though)",
          "You need a place to relax and enjoy yourself with family. Then you're at the right place.",
          "I like the fun experience and the many cool bars and clubs in the zone. I got to meet some fine folks here, too.\n\nI met some talented folks like a very young rapper and some talking drum players. They made my day there.\n\nHowever, I ended \u2026",
          "The hype about the much upgraded beach is more than value I got. I still prefer the old days of Oniru Beach. 10 years and above. Besides, the beach seat are too expensive. Imagine #5, 000 for a beach I wont take home. Also, the bars there, aside Mist, are dirty and smelling. Stinks like something else. Haba",
          "I love the beach and Oniru is one of a kinda,a really cool place to be when the festivities are over!",
          "Much traffic, smooth road.... Fun place to visit",
          "Beautiful beach. Different kinds and categories of canopies but no matter where you sit, fun is guaranteed. From the Ferris wheel to horseback riding to boat ride. There is a guy that plays beautiful songs with his guitar and local drummers \u2026",
          "Cool beach, fun filled. Chilling ambiance",
          "To be honest it's beach why do we have to pay to enter the beach for God's sake. It doesn't make any sense",
          "Oniru private beach is a very lovely place. The environment is so calm and the ambience is just everything.",
          "Nice beach party experience, but they need to make more efforts to remove dirt from the water.",
          "A bit clean compared to other beach I have been to in Lagos,music,food,entertainment can be found here,be aware of your belongings as there might be pickpockets.",
          "Serene water. Great ambience. Just a thousand naira to get in. Tents cost between 5 and 7k though. So unless you wanna chill on the beach proper with a mat, get your money right.\nGreat with company too. And drinks. *wink.",
          "Nice place if you like the night life....beach side club",
          "It isn't as private as claimed but with friends you'll definitely have fun",

          "Nice and serene environment. Nature glaring at you...",
          "Not the liveliest or cleanest beach I've visited in Lagos. On the plus side, it's usually quiet around the water front, for those who are into it. Night time view is quite okay.",
          "Very lovely waterfront, had mad fun though it was a bit crowded, but I guess it's cuz of the festive season....\ud83e\udd17",
          "A beach that is open for both public and private individuals. Entrance is 1000NGN for an adult. If you are mobile you will be charged extra 200NGN for parking space. Inside the beach, there are lots of things to have fun with. Horse ride, \u2026",
          "I like that there are not too many people here even though I would want even more solitary but you pay for everything, including these pretty seats; that's after the 1k gate fee.\n\nAnyway, I had a good time and that's what matters",
          "It\u2019s just a basic beach, had a gate fee of a 1000 Naira as at the time I visited. Was just glad to reunite with old school mates .",
          "I only spent about 30 minutes but I liked it.\nThe staff I interacted with were very nice.",
          "Best chill beach on the island right now",
          "Nice waterfront chilling, entrance ticket is N1000 ($3)",
          "Good secure environment. Not for kids after 6pm. Good adult hangout. Live music on fridays. Not sure about other days.",
          "Calm, easy access of #1000 but the drinks are on the high. 300% more.\nA place for you to refresh, chill, groove and do what make you ok!",
          "Beautiful place. Not too crowded. Has various spots to chill",
          "The place is average. A nice hang out spot for group of friends. Nothing so \"private\" about the beach. It has a cool ambience and is quite windy. The horse rides tho short are nice.",

          "It's a great beach.. With excellent night life too",
          "Beautiful Scenery but over hyped. The music was wack on a friday night but they have really good drink options that also taste amazing \ud83d\ude09 If you're looking for a groovy place, this is not it. It is more of a \"be by yourself\" kinda place and a lot of segregation too (expats and locals)",
          "Great place for picnics and hangout with goons",
          "They will charge you for seats, be prepared. Their speakers doesn't also get everywhere. So you might need to come with portable speakers. It has nice serene.",
          "Too much people..... Gate fee is 1k and their stuff are freaking expensive.... Just go with your food.. Fun sha!",
          "Beautiful place, poor services from waitress. They told me no smoothie just to get me to buy expensive alcoholic wine and I don't like alcohol",
          "This is night life scene at oniru breach. Lively DJ blasting away good tunes. But to get these lovely seats it cost us about 7k..it quite pricey. But u need to negotiate well. Also, you can get mats and seat on the sand at no cost.\n\nIf you \u2026",
          "Moist Bar is a high end hangout spot. But the beachfront is a good sight to behold",

          "Nice place to hang out with friends.",
          "Once inside Moist Beach, you are amazed and transformed by the ambience. Helpful staff. There is more than enough parking. You however pay to gain access into the private beach and sometimes when parked, you are expected to pay.",
          "To me this is one of my top three beaches in lagos , its always more interesting in the evening towards the midnight depending on how long you want to stay",
          "Oniru is a 24 hours privately owned beach in Lagos Nigeria. It\u2019s owned by Oniru Royal family. \n\nThe entrance fee is 1000 naira per person.\n\nIt\u2019s a cool place for celebrations, events, live shows, family outings, picnic and anything \u2026",
          "Rowdy and probably disorganised in planning.\nHowever its very accessible\nYou should save Lekki toll fare\nImportant fact is, its high point is the later part of the night\nFun place to be during the dark hours.\nYou would pay touts N1000 access fee\nAnd 200 Parking toll.\nFood and drinks are affordable.",
          "Fun!!! The local drummers and the comedians gave an extra exciting touch. It's so lively and not too rowdy. A Sunday evening here takes your mind of the stress of the new week",

          "Low waves of water.. But a good place to have fun",
          "Night time at the beach was beautiful. View was great, I didn\u2019t have to pay for sitting. Drinks were affordable too.... had a really good time catching up with old friends. There\u2019s a gate fee of 1k and parking fee of N200",
          "All night DJ, ample parking space, lots of BBQ, not much in way of general entertainment and some things were kinda over priced like the tables and shade but it's expected.",
          "I'm not sure if, there were just so many people today at the beach because it was the Easter holiday, but there was a crowd. They charged us a thousands naira entry fee at the gate and this was collected in cash by a man and his team who \u2026",

          "Exclusive beach with horses to ride, and games to play. It's spacious for you and your family",
          "Moist has a nice ambience. Most other stops were a bit too noisy.",
          "It's an ok place considering it's in the open..but there's room for a whole lot of improvement regarding standard prices and all..the attendants request for whatever they want. Everything I bought was extremely overpriced",
          "Pretty cool beach. Not as rowdy as Elegushi",
          "Serene. Good food",
          "On a weekday, We paid a 1k entrance free and parasol hire for 2k this included  the use of 5 chairs after serious bartering. The beach is quite serene early hours of the morning till about 11.30am . Most people really start arriving by \u2026",
          "Nice comfortable place with a gate  fee of  #1000 per head. Chair, tables, food and  drinks are sold by different vendors at a higher rate.",
          "It\u2019s a fun place to experience the waves from the beach",
          "Oniru Private beach was the most dirty beach I have ever been to.With all the money we paid,both at the entry point and to sit 1000naira per head ,200naira per car and 5000naira each for table of 6 (we were a party of over 25 people),one \u2026",
          "locating the place was easy using Google Map. The usual crowd makes it a little hard to locate friend who come at different times. In all, it was a good experience, cool weather at the beach with friends, officials as good as expected in Nigeria. Overall a good experience but not perfect, few things could be done better.",
          "It's pretty clean( no litters; if you get a space, the official you paid to, cleans after you)and affordable. The convenience needs to be improved, it's not hygienic and you pay to use it.  I brought my food from home, can't comment on quality or amount of food sold there.",
          "An amazing place to go for a relaxation, and fun time experience",
          "I thought the place was a bit too rowdy. The water was really calm though, not a lot of waves and it seemed relatively safe.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not a place you can go and reflect because of the crowd activity happening all around you, but it\u2019s okay to relax and to hang out with a group of friends.",
          "It was a splendid experience.... It's amazing.",
          "Gate fee is 1k per adult. Children below 10 years are free. They only collect cash, no pos. Parking 500 naira. Lots of touts. Umbrella and chairs was charge 2,500. They allow you to go in with your food and drinks. It's a Nice and clean beach.",
          "Unknown to me there are other bars at Oniru beach besides moist, if you want to bring your own drinks and food, chill by the beach front then go on ahead past moist beyond the barricade, you would have to pay a corkage fee though.",
          "We can spend one evening here. Nice",
          "NOT bad at all. People should learn not to litter though, plastic littered here and there. The water is clean and clear. Crowd grows at night. I had fun and will visit again soon.",
          "Better to go with your food and drinks",
          "Oniru beach is clean and well managed. The sand is safe to walk on barefoot compared to other beaches (like Elegushi). There are many suya huts, horses and jewellery sellers and also quite a lot of clubs. Would recommend for a large family and friends trip.",

The market which is divided into two phases (Phase I and Phase II) contains about 2,383 lock-up shops in a sprawling four-storey building and about 1,251 K-clamps units, banking spaces, 14 food court spaces, eight lifts, two escalators connecting the four floors, 600 parking lots and basic facilities like stable electricity and water supply, equipped fire station, two rams to assist the physically challenged and a cr\u00e8che.Some years after a fire incident that destroyed most part of the market, the Lagos State Government, Stormberg Engineering Limited, and First Bank of Nigeria in a public-private partnership reconstructed the market into a mega shopping plaza as part of plans to turn Lagos into a \"Mega City\".\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nTejuosho market was a middle class conventional market where commodities were sold at a cut-price. The hike in price of stalls after the market was reconstructed has left operators who earn relatively low-income criticizing the state government for its involvement of the private sector into the reconstruction of the market.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of markets in Lagos\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Badagry (traditionally Gbagle) is a coastal town and local government area (LGA) in Lagos State, Nigeria. It is between the city of Lagos and the border with Benin at Seme. As of the preliminary 2006 census results, the municipality had a population of 241,093.Serving as a lagoon and an Atlantic port, Badagry emerged as a commercial center on the West African coast between 1736 and 1851. Its connecting and navigable lakes, creeks and inland lagoons acted as a means to facilitate trade and as asecurity bar for residents.  During the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, the town was a middleman between European traders on the coast and traders from the hinterland.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBadagry is situated on the south-west coast of Nigeria, bordered by the Gulf of Guinea to the south, it is 43 miles southeast of Lagos and 32 miles west of Seme, a border town in Benin Republic. Like Lagos Island, it is on the bank of inland lagoons, a system of creeks, waterways that are navigable to Lagos and Porto Novo. The distance between the lagoon and the ocean varies along the coast, in Badagry, the distance is about a mile. The depth of the lagoon varies according to the season, from highs of 3 meters to lows of a meter. The lagoons have a diverse fish population that includes bonga, croaker, longfin pompano, tilapia and catfish. The lagoon consists of brackish and freshwater with seasonal variability, west of Badagry, Yewa River provides water inflow to the lagoon.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere is a traditional Yoruba narrative that the first settlement within the area was an Awori group originally from Ile-Ife who lived at a nearby settlement. Robin Law, a scholar on West African history, notes an origin that sprouted out of a resettlement for displaced peoples of varied ethnic groups mostly Ogu people and Oyo Yorubas. Another source links the people living at a settlement called Gberefu, an island along the coast.One of the recorded notable events in the history of the town was the acquisition of land by a European trader who was locally known as Yovo Huntokonu. Many sources identify the European to be a Dutch trader called Hendrik Hertogh. Huntokonu, who came from the west, settled in the area after fleeing the wrath of an African chief. He reached the settlement called Apa under the Obaship of Alapa and he was given a farmland to use for trading.\n\n\n=== 1736\u20131840 ===\nHuntokonu set up a trading post on the gifted land ca 1736, and it was after Huntokonu's settlement that Badagry emerged as a slave port, serving principally as an outlet for Oyo and displacing Apa politically and commercially. During this period, political refugees fleeing aggression from king Agaja Trudo migrated to Badagry.  Agaja who was seeking an outlet to the sea  was warring across the coast and the resulting war caused an influx of people living along the coast of Weme, Ouidah, Allada, Jaki, and Popos to settle in Badagry. These group came to be known as Ogu. Each migrant group were affiliated with eight heterogeneous quarters and newly arrived immigrants settled in wards related to their state of origin. Badagry's wards were headed by commercial and political autonomous chiefs thereby creating a fragmented political structure. This flexibility was advantageous for trade but also caused internal instability.Slave trading was not as prominent in Badagry than it was in Bonny, Angola, Ouidah, and Calabar; in 1865, slaves transported out of Badagri were 800, while at Porto Novo, the figure was 1,200, and at Ouidah, up to 5,000 slaves were transported. The peak period of the slave trade in the city state was between 1736 and 1789, but the trade continued into the early nineteenth century, with Portueguese or Brazilian traders taking over from the Dutch.The rise of Badagry on the coast led to hostilities with Ouidah, which combined with Oyo and Lagos to sack the town in 1784. After the destruction, Jiwa, a political refugee from Porto-Novo took over the reins of  most of the political structures between 1784 and 1788.  In ca 1821, Oba Adele was exiled to Badagry , he proved to be a source of leadership, and was able to make Badagry a politically independent state.  The founding of Abeokuta also proved beneficial to Badagry as the former made use of Badagry as an outlet for trading. IAdele was involved with the famous trader, Madam Tinubu and sided with Egba's in their conflict with Ota and Ijebu. Among Adele's  followers from Lagos were Muslims, mostly servants from the Northern region, these group introduced Islam to the Ogu people in the city-state.After the British abolished the slave trade, notable trader Francisco F\u00e9lix de Sousa migrated to Badagry around 1807. Trade in ivory, cloth and palm oil were also important economic activities of residents. Thomas Hutton established a presence in Badagri in 1838, other British traders followed in subsequent years. Unlike in the interior, Badagry's soil  was not suitable for commercial agriculture, but farms were set up in areas surrounding the town. The palm oil trade was of considerable value to Badagry and was an illegal trade in slaves directed by Brazilians. The influence of anti-slave trade raids and cession of Badagry to Britain put a stop to the trade. \n\n\n=== 1840\u20131900 ===\nBadagri's location as a coastal town with links northwards to Abeokuta and Oyo made it a port of entry for emigrants from Sierra Leone and missionaries. Around 1837, a settled Sierra-Leonean emigrant of the Methodist faith wrote a letter requesting a catechist in Badagry. The Methodist already had a missionary party in the Gold Coast, and some members were sent to Badagry. this party was led by Thomas Birch Freeman and Charles DeGraft. The Methodist missionaries first preached under an Agia tree and later erected a make- shift bamboo Church.In 1845, a CMS missionary party arrived Badagry. In the party were Revs, Townsend, Crowther and Gollmer, two teachers from Sierra Leone, some carpenters and wives of the party members. The intention of the part was to keep on moving to Abeokuta but as a result of the death of Sodeke, a chief in Abeokuta, they were delayed at Badagry. The party stayed in Badagry for a year and a half, building a mission house with two levels.However, Christian proselytism in the first half of the nineteenth was not successful in Badagry partly as a result of a civil between 1851- 1854 and also as a result of the Lagos becoming a colony. In the years between the founding of the colony of Lagos and colony of Nigeria, Badagry lost influence to Lagos.In 1863, wary of French influence in Porto-Novo, colonial Lagos signed a treaty of cession with Badagry chiefs.The Congress of Berlin in 1884\u20131885, led to the displacement of the Gbe ethnolinguistic groups in the area, with especially the Badagry-Ogu ethnic group falling under the British rule, and marginalized through being removed from the rest of the ethnoliguistic group.\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nThe city-state of Badagry was divided into eights wards with each having a traditional head. These are Ijegba (Akran), Asago (Bala), Ganho (Agoloto), Posuko (Possu), Boeko (Mobee), Ahoviko (Wawu), Ahwanjigo (Jengen), and Wharakoh.\n\n\n== Twentieth century ==\nBetween 1953 and 1965, Badagry was a divisional headquarters for an area composed of Badagry, Amuwo-Odofin, Ojo and Ajeromi-Ifelodun. When Lagos State was created in 1967, it became one of the five administrative zones of the state.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nA number of festivals are celebrated in Badagry, these are the Ajido Zangbeto cult, Igunnuko festival and Badagry diaspora and heritage festivals. The native language of Badagry is Ogu,a dialect of Aja and similar to the Fon language, an Aja sub-group that is spoken in Porto-Novo.Ancient Bagary had a traditional religion close to vodou and various traditional places of worship. Shrines were located in different quarters of the town including Nabruku at Ijegba, Vlekete at Posuko and Mathe at Adariko. In modern Badagry, adherents of Islam and Christianity populate the town.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe major economic activities in Badagry include, fishing, trading and tourism. Badagry's closeness to the sea and its historical past with the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and missionaries attracts tourists to the town. A pre-fabricated house built by Thomas Birch Freeman is considered by some as the first storey building in Nigeria while Freeman's Methodist Church is the first settlement of Christian missions in Nigeria.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBadagry Festival\nMowo, Badagry\nVelekete Slave Market\n\n\n== Photo gallery ==\nImportant places in Badagry\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Iga Idunganran is the Official Residence of the Oba of Lagos, situated on Lagos Island. It is also a tourist attraction.\n\n\n== History ==\nDating back to the 15th century, the Lagos Island was originally owned by the island's first inhabitant Chief Aromire, an Ile-Ife nobleman, who used it as a fishing post and pepper farm. The ancient palace was initially built in 1670 for Oba Gabaro (1669-1704). It was later refurbished by the Portuguese, with materials \u2014 especially tiles \u2014 brought in from Portugal.and the modern part was completed and commissioned on 1 October 1960 by the Prime Minister of Nigeria, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. Recently modernized by the late Oba Adeniji Adele II and Oba Adeyinka Oyekan II, it underwent additional modernization in 2007/8 by the present Oba Akiolu in conjunction with the Lagos State government and the Nigerian Museum.Iga Idunganran has served as an administration centre, the island's market and hosted the Eyo festival.\n\n\n== Name derivation ==\nIGA, derived from the Oyo/Ife Yoruba language GAA meaning Royal Home or Palace, IDUN means land, place or sound of while IGANRAN is the Yoruba word for pepper. Iga Idunganran therefore translates to mean the palace built on a pepper farm, Aromire having used the land previously as a farm.\n\n\n== The ancient tombs ==\nAll the Obas of Lagos before Oba Akitoye are buried in Benin City. Oba Akitoye was the first Oba of Lagos to be buried within the modern palace. All Obas except Sanusi Olusi and Kosoko are buried at Iga Idunganran.\n\n\n== The ancient shrines of Iga-Idunganran ==\nThese include:\n\n\n=== Esu ===\nEsu (pronounced \u00c9shu) can be found at the exit gate of the Palace. Esu was brought from Benin. It is also known by many other names, the most prominent of which is the devil which was borrowed from Christianity. The Oba and his chiefs prayed at this shrine to ward off danger to Lagos (and later Nigeria generally) in times past. They also prayed there prior to leaving the palace for any private or official function to ward off evil. Moreover, before going out, the Oba is supposed to visit this shrine in order to be told how his journey will be. Questions such as whether the journey will be favorable and whether it is safe for the Oba to embark on such a journey would typically be asked.\n\n\n=== Ogun ===\nOgun is the undergod of iron. Though not within the palace per se, there is a small edifice constructed for immediate access in the complex's grounds. The main shrine is situated outside the present walls of the palace, though it still falls under its jurisdiction. It has a priestess who handles its day-to-day running.\n\n\n== Rites ==\nSpecial rites/prayers are performed every sixteen days in the palace, usually by the Araba of Lagos, Chief Ajanaku, though the Oba does on occasion use other traditional priests and priestesses depending on the priority and the occasion, and the perceived spiritual prowess of such people. Some of the items necessary for performing these rituals are bitter kola, kola-nuts, alligator pepper, palm oil, schnapps or any plain gin, chickens, pigeons, goats or rams and anything else the Ifa oracle may decree, short of a human life.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPresidential Lodge, former presidential palace in Lagos\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nNigerians Abroad\nHistory of Lagos\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Lagos (, US also ; Yoruba: \u00c8k\u00f3) is the most populous city in Nigeria and all of Africa. Lagos is a major financial centre for all of Africa and is the economic hub of Lagos State. The megacity has the fourth-highest GDP in Africa and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports on the continent. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world.Lagos initially emerged as a port city that originated on a collection of islands, which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos Island, Eti-Osa, Amuwo-Odofin and Apapa. The islands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon, while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach, which stretch up to 100 km (62 mi) east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanization, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland, Ajeromi-Ifelodun and Surulere. This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the Island, which was the initial city of Lagos, before it expanded into the area known as the Mainland. This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council, until the creation of Lagos State in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the then Western Region to form the state.Lagos, the capital of Nigeria since its amalgamation in 1914, went on to become the capital of Lagos State after its creation. However, the state capital was later moved to Ikeja in 1976, and the federal capital moved to Abuja in 1991. Even though Lagos is still widely referred to as a city, the present day Lagos, also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\", and officially as \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\" is an urban agglomeration or conurbation, consisting of 16 LGAs including Ikeja, the state capital of Lagos State. This conurbation makes up 37% of Lagos State's total land area, but houses about 85% of the state's total population.The exact population of Metropolitan Lagos is disputed. In the 2006 federal census data, the conurbation had a population of about 8 million people. However, the figure was disputed by the Lagos State Government, which later released its own population data, putting the population of Lagos Metropolitan Area at approximately 16 million. As of 2015, unofficial figures put the population of \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\", which includes Lagos and its surrounding metro area, extending as far as into Ogun State, at approximately 21 million.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLagos was originally inhabited by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba people in the 15th century. Under the leadership of the Oloye Olofin, the Awori moved to an island now called Iddo and then to the larger Lagos Island. In the 16th century, the Awori settlement was conquered by the Benin Empire and the island became a Benin war-camp called \"Eko\" under Oba Orhogbua, the Oba of Benin at the time. Eko is still the native name for Lagos.\nLagos, which means \"lakes\", was a name given to the settlement by the Portuguese. Throughout history, it was home to a number of warring ethnic groups who had settled in the area. Following its early settlement by the Awori nobility, and its conquest by the Bini warlords of Benin, the state first came to the attention of the Portuguese in the 15th century.Portuguese explorer Rui de Sequeira visited the area in 1472, naming the area around the city Lago de Curamo. Another explanation is that Lagos is named after a major port in Portugal\u2014a maritime town that, at the time, was the main centre of Portuguese expeditions down the African coast, Lagos, Portugal.\nIn Britain's early 19th century fight against the transatlantic slave trade, its West Africa Squadron or Preventative Squadron as it was also known, continued to pursue Portuguese, American, French and Cuban slave ships and to impose anti-slavery treaties with West African coastal chiefs with so much doggedness that they created a strong presence along the West African coast from Sierra Leone all the way to the Niger Delta (today's Nigeria) and as far south as Congo. In 1849, Britain appointed John Beecroft Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, a position he held (along with his governorship of Fernando Po) until his death in 1854. John Duncan was appointed Vice Consul and was located at Wydah. At the time of Beecroft's appointment, the Kingdom of Lagos (under Oba Kosoko) was in the western part of the Consulate of the Bights of Benin and Biafra and was a key slave trading port. In 1851 and with pressure from liberated slaves who now wielded political and business influence, Britain intervened in Lagos in what is now known as the Bombardment of Lagos or Capture of Lagos resulting in the installation of Oba Akitoye and the ouster of Oba Kosoko. Oba Akitoye then signed the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos abolishing slavery. The signing of the 1852 treaty ushered in the Consular Period in Lagos' history wherein Britain provided military protection for Lagos.Following threats from Kosoko and the French who were positioned at Wydah, a decision was made by Lord Palmerston (British Prime Minister) who noted in 1861, \"the expediency of losing no time in assuming the formal Protectorate of Lagos\". William McCoskry, the Acting Consul in Lagos with Commander Bedingfield convened a meeting with Oba Dosunmu on 30 July 1861 aboard HMS Prometheus where Britain's intent was explained and a response to the terms were required by August 1861. Dosunmu resisted the terms of the treaty but under the threat to unleash violence on Lagos by Commander Bedingfield, Dosunmu relented and signed the Lagos Treaty of Cession on 6 August 1861.\n\nLagos was declared a colony on 5 March 1862. The remainder of modern-day Nigeria was seized in 1887, and when the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was established in 1914, Lagos became its capital, continuing as such after the country's independence from Britain in 1960. Along with migrants from all over Nigeria and other West African nations were the returnee ex-slaves known as Creoles, who came from Freetown, Sierra Leone, Brazil and the West Indies to Lagos. The Creoles contributed to Lagos' modernisation and their knowledge of Portuguese architecture can still be seen from the architecture on Lagos Island. Since the 19th century, Lagos gradually transformed to a melting pot of Africans and Europeans. Railway links and telephone cables connecting Lagos to London had been established by 1886. Electric street lighting was introduced in the city in 1898. Lagos experienced rapid growth throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a result of Nigeria's economic boom.Before the creation of Lagos State on 27 May 1967, Lagos, which was the country's capital had been administered directly by the Federal Government as a Federal Territory through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs, while the Lagos City Council (LCC) governed the city. Lagos, along with the towns from the then Western region (Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu, Epe and Badagry), were eventually captured to create Lagos State. Lagos city was split into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), while the other towns now make up 13 LGAs in the state. Lagos played the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital until 1976 when the state capital was moved to Ikeja. Lagos was adversely affected during Nigeria's military rule. Also, on 12 December 1991, the seat of the Federal Government was also formally relocated to Abuja. However, Lagos remains the financial centre of the country, and also grew to become the most populous conurbation in the country.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLagos is loosely classified into two main geographical areas\u2014the \"Island\" and the \"Mainland\".\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n==== Island ====\n\nThe Island is a loose geographical term that is used to define the area of Lagos that is separated from the \"mainland\" by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic Ocean, which forms Lagos Harbour. The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected together by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events in Lagos takes place. It also houses most of the upscale residential areas in Lagos. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be in the Island include Lagos Island, Eti-Osa. The major upscale island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include Ikoyi and Victoria Island. Three major bridges join the island to the mainland. They are the Carter Bridge, which starts from Iddo; the Eko Bridge (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the Third Mainland Bridge, which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon.\n\n\n===== Lagos Island =====\n\nLagos Island contains a central business district. This district is characterized by high-rise buildings. The island also contains many of the city's largest wholesale marketplaces (such as the popular Idumota and Balogun Markets). It also has the National Museum of Nigeria, the Central Mosque, the Glover Memorial Hall, Christ's Church Cathedral (CMS) and the Oba's Palace (Iga Idunganran). Another major part of Lagos Island is Marina. It borders around the idumota and Balogun markets and houses major Banking institutions. Though formerly in a derelict condition, Lagos Island's Tinubu Square is a site of historical importance; it was here that the Amalgamation Ceremony that unified the North and South protectorate to form Nigeria took place in 1914.\n\n\n===== Ikoyi =====\n\nIkoyi is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a land fill. Ikoyi is also connected to Victoria Island by Falomo bridge, which carries the main road over Five Cowrie creek. Ikoyi housed the headquarters of the federal government of Nigeria and other buildings owned by the government, including the old federal secretariat complex. The complex today is on reestablishment.In Ikoyi there are military and police barracks, a top-security prison and a federal high court of Nigeria. Ikoyi also has a number of hotels, night clubs, a recreational park and one of Africa's largest golf courses. Originally a middle class neighbourhood, in recent years, it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the upper middle class to the upper class. There are also commercial activities in Ikoyi, which is spotted in an increasing number of offices, banks, and shopping complexes. The commercial section is concentrated in the South-West.\n\n\n===== Victoria Island =====\n\nVictoria Island with its annexe is situated to the south of Lagos Island. It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments are blooming up everywhere.\nAlong with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts of several sizeable shopping districts. On its sea shore along the Atlantic front, there is environmentally reconstructed Bar Beach.\n\n\n===== Iddo =====\nAcross the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called Iddo. Iddo is also a railroad terminus and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland local government area after it was connected to the mainland like a peninsula.\n\n\n==== Mainland ====\nA huge population of Lagosians also live on the Lagos mainland, and most industries are located there. The mainland is known for its music and nightlife, which used to be located in areas around Yaba and Surulere. However, in recent years more night clubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island, Ikate and Lekki Phase 1) the main nightlife attractions. Mainland LGAs include Surulere, Apapa, and Lagos Mainland. Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: Agege, Amuwo Odofin, Mushin, Oshodi-Isolo and Ikeja (site of Murtala Muhammed International Airport and the capital of Lagos State).\nMajor Areas on the mainland include Ebute Metta, Yaba and Ejigbo. Some rivers, like Badagry Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLagos experiences a tropical savanna climate (Aw) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, as there's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season. The wet season starts in April and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in March. The wettest month is June with precipitation total 315.5 millimetres (12.42 in), while the driest month is January with precipitation total 13.2 millimetres (0.52 in).\nLocated near the equator, Lagos has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging 28.3\u201332.9 \u00b0C (82.9\u201391.2 \u00b0F). Lagos shares the seasons of the Southern Hemisphere, with summer highs in March, daily range 32.9\u201324.1 \u00b0C (91.2\u201375.4 \u00b0F), and warm winters in August, ranging 28.3\u201321.8 \u00b0C (82.9\u201371.2 \u00b0F) as the daily average.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nLagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria. The architectural styles in Lagos are diverse and range from tropical and vernacular to colonial European and ultramodern buildings or a mixture. Brazilian style architecture brought by the creoles is evident in buildings such as Water House and  Shitta Bey Mosque. Skyscrapers and most high rise buildings are centered on the islands, while the mainland has some high rise buildings. In recent years, the Lagos State government has renovated existing parks and green areas, with a long-term goal of expansion. Many good quality buildings are interspersed across the city.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, there are Christian churches and temples: Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of Nigeria (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Nigerian Baptist Convention (Baptist World Alliance), The Apostolic Church Nigeria (TACN), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Assemblies of God, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos (Catholic Church) and Muslim mosques such as Lagos Central Mosque in Lagos- island, Wahab Folawiyo Central Mosque in Surulere, Lekki Central Mosque in Lekki, The Syrian Mosque in Ikoyi. There are also various shrines and temples for traditional worshipers scattered across the state and they include several Igbo Igunnuko shrines, Egungun shrines, Eyo Shrines and other various traditional shrines and places of worship. For the 25,000 strong Hindu community, there is an ISKCON temple and three other Hindu temples dotted around the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn terms of administration, Lagos is not a single municipality and therefore has no overall city administration. The geographical city limits of Metropolitan Lagos comprises 16 of the 20 Local Government Areas, which together comprise Lagos State. The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region. The Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi, and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several Local Government Areas (most notably Lagos Island LGA, Lagos Mainland LGA and Eti-Osa LGA).The mainland beyond the Municipality of Lagos, on the other hand, comprised several separate towns and settlements such as Mushin, Ikeja and Agege. In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom, Lagos experienced a population explosion, untamed economic growth, and unmitigated rural migration. This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly, thus forming the present day \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\", also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\". The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them.\nBy 2006, the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State's boundaries and attained a megacity status. This much larger area is referred to as \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\" or \"Lagos Megacity Region\", which is a continuous built up land area of additional 1,535.4 square kilometres (592.8 square miles), comprising sprawls in LGAs situated next to Lagos' eastern and western city limits in Lagos State, and beyond northern limits, spilling into the LGAs in adjoining Ogun State. Ogun State LGAs within Greater Metropolitan Lagos majorly include: Obafemi Owode, Sagamu, Ifo, Ado-Odo/Ota and part of Ewekoro.\n\nToday, the word Lagos most often refers to the urban area, called \"Metropolitan Lagos\" in Nigeria, which includes both the islands of the former municipality of Lagos and the mainland suburbs. Lagos State government is responsible for some of the utilities including roads and transportation, power, water, health and education. Metropolitan Lagos extends over 16 of the 20 LGAs of Lagos State, and contains about 85% of the population of Lagos State, and includes semi-rural areas. Lagos City has a considerable number of high-rise buildings that dominate its skyline. Most of the tall buildings are located in the downtown Central Business District.\nLagos was the former capital city of Nigeria but it has since been replaced by Abuja. Abuja officially gained its status as the capital of Nigeria on 12 December 1991, although the decision to move the federal capital had been made in now Act no. 6 of 1976. Lagos is also home to the High Court of the Lagos State Judiciary, housed in an old colonial building on Lagos Island.\n\n\n=== Census data for Lagos ===\nAlthough the 2006 National Population Census of Nigeria credited the metropolitan area with a population figure of 7,937,932, the figure is at variance with some projections by the UN and other population agencies and groups worldwide. The population figure of Lagos State given by the Lagos State Government is 17,553,924. It was based on claimed conducted enumeration for social planning by the Lagos State Government \"parallel census\" and it believes that since the inhabitants of the metropolitan area of Lagos constitute 88% of the Lagos State population, the population of metropolitan Lagos is about 15.5 million.A rejoinder to Lagos State Government views concluded that Lagos State concealed the fact that the population projection, for Lagos Urban Agglomeration by the UN agencies had been revised downwards substantially as early as 2003. It failed to interpret the two most important and fairly representative and reliable secondary data sets already in public domain, the National Identity Card Scheme and the 2003 Voters Registration figures from INEC. The figures for 2007 Voters Registration by INEC were an act subsequent to the release of the provisional census results and comprehensively corroborate, vindicate and validate the population figures in no uncertain terms.\nAccording to the official results of the 2006 census, there were 8,048,430 inhabitants in Metropolitan Lagos. This figure was lower than anticipated, and has created controversy in Nigeria. Lagos Island, the central Local Government Area and historic centre of Metropolitan Lagos, had a population of 212,700 at the 2006 Census.\n\nAuthorities of Lagos State have attacked the results of the 2006 census, accusing the Nigerian National Population Commission of having undercounted the population of the state. This accusation is denied by the National Population Commission. A study found that research carried out by Africapolis (the African subsidiary of e-Geopolis backed by the Agence fran\u00e7aise de d\u00e9veloppement), in addition to the cross-referencing of official figures with more scientific independent research concluded that the 2006 census figures for Lagos State of about 9 million were valid and that the state's own assessments are inflated.Lagos is, by most estimates, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Lagos is currently experiencing a population increase of about 275,000 persons per annum. In 1999 the United Nations predicted that the city's metropolitan area, which had only about 290,000 inhabitants in 1950, would exceed 20 million by 2010 and thus become one of the ten most populated cities in the world.\n\nThere is a huge spectrum of wealth distribution among the people that reside in Lagos. It ranges from the very wealthy to the very poor. Lagos has attracted many young people and families seeking a better life from all other parts of Nigeria and beyond and this has also contributed to its cosmopolitan status. Some people are leaving Lagos and Nigeria in search of better living conditions, cities like Townsville in Australia are very popular with expats and have services set up to assist people in settling into their new life.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Lagos is a major economic focal point in Nigeria, generating around 10% of the country's GDP. Most commercial and financial business is carried out in the central business district situated on the island. This is also where most of the country's commercial banks, financial institutions and major corporations are headquartered. Lagos is also the major Information Communications and Telecommunications (ICT) hub of West Africa and potentially, the biggest ICT market in the continent. Lagos is developing a 24-hour economy and has also been ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the world. In some parts of Lagos, residents have one of the highest standards of living in Nigeria and in Africa. At the same time, a sizable proportion of the residents live in slums without access to piped water and sanitation.The Port of Lagos is Nigeria's leading port and one of the largest and busiest in Africa. It is administered by the Nigerian Ports Authority and it is split into three main sections: Lagos port, in the main channel next to Lagos Island, Apapa Port (site of the container terminal) and Tin Can Port, both located in Badagry Creek, which flows into Lagos Harbour from the west. The port features a railhead. The port has seen growing amounts of crude oil exported, with export figures rising between 1997 and 2000. Oil and petroleum products provide 14% of GDP and 90% of foreign exchange earnings in Nigeria as a whole.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music and film industry ===\nLagos is famous throughout Africa for its music scene. Lagos has a vibrant nightlife and has given birth to a variety of styles such as Sakara music, Nigerian hip hop, highlife, juju, fuji, Afrobeat, and Afrobeats.Lagos is the centre of the Nigerian movie industry, often referred to as 'Nollywood'. Idumota market on Lagos Island is the primary distribution centre. Many films are shot in the Festac area of Lagos, where the World Festival of Black Arts was held.Iganmu is home to the primary centre for the performing arts and artistes in Nigeria: the National Arts Theatre.\nJames Brown performed in Lagos in 1970. Paul McCartney recorded his fifth post-Beatles album, Band on the Run, in an EMI studio in Lagos in August and September 1973. Other foreign musicians who have also performed in the city include Sean Paul, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Akon, Jarule, Ashanti, Usher, Shaggy, R Kelly, Cardi B, Migos especially during the Star Mega Jam; Shakira, John Legend, Boyz II Men T-Pain, Brian McKnight, JayZ, Mary J. Blige, Beyonc\u00e9, Brandy, Ciara, Keri Hilson and Lauryn Hill, among others.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nAssociation football is Lagos' most popular sport. Prominent Lagos football clubs include Bridge Boys F.C. MFM F.C. and First Bank: both play in Nigeria National League, the second tier of Nigerian football.\n\nThe Nigeria national football team, also known as the Super Eagles, used to play almost all of their home games in Lagos at the National Stadium in Surulere; much later, games were played at the then New Abuja National Stadium in Abuja for sometime; however, games are now mostly played at the newer Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, which is the default home of the Super Eagles. Lagos also hosted the 2nd All-African games in 1973.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLagos, subsequent to the re-modernization project achieved by the previous administration of Governor Raji Babatunde Fashola, is gradually becoming a major tourist destination, being one of the largest cities in Africa and in the world. Lagos is currently taking steps to become a global city. The 2009 Eyo carnival (a yearly festival originated from Iperu Remo, Ogun State), which took place on 25 April, was a step toward world city status. Currently, Lagos is primarily known as a business-oriented and a fast-paced community.Lagos has become an important location for African and \"black\" cultural identity. Many festivals are held in Lagos; festivals vary in offerings each year and may be held in different months. Some of the festivals are Festac Food Fair held in Festac Town Annually, Eyo Festival, Lagos Black Heritage Carnival, Lagos Carnival, Eko International Film Festival, Lagos Seafood Festac Festival, LAGOS PHOTO Festival and the Lagos Jazz Series, which is a unique franchise for high-quality live music in all genres with a focus on jazz. Established in 2010, the popular event takes place over a 3\u20135 day period at selected high quality outdoor venues. The music is as varied as the audience itself and features a diverse mix of musical genres from rhythm and blues to soul, Afrobeat, hip hop, bebop, and traditional jazz. The festivals provide entertainment of dance and song to add excitement to travelers during a stay in Lagos.\nLagos has a number of sandy beaches by the Atlantic Ocean, including Elegushi Beach and Alpha Beach. Lagos also has a number of private beach resorts including Inagbe Grand Beach Resort and several others in the outskirts.\nLagos has a variety of hotels ranging from three star to five star hotels, with a mixture of local hotels such as Eko Hotels and Suites, Federal Palace Hotel and franchises of multinational chains such as Intercontinental Hotel, Sheraton and Four Points by Sheraton. Other places of interest include the Tafawa Balewa Square, Festac town, The Nike Art Gallery, Freedom Park, Lagos and the Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nSome of the famous cuisines in Lagos include indigenous delicacies such as eba and egusi; amala and ewedu; jollof; ofada rice; plantains (locally called dodo); beans; suya (spicy shish kebab or spiced roasted beef), which is consumed in local clubs and bars with a bottle of cold beer; and eba, made from cassava and eaten with soups prepared with vegetables and mixture of spices and herbs. Other cuisines range from local ones like Iyan (pounded yam) made from yam flour, amala; asaro, which is usually eaten with various kind of vegetables; and Egusi (melon soup) to European, Middle-Eastern, and Asian cuisine.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Lagos State Government operates state schools. The education system is the 6-3-3-4 system, which is practised throughout the country (as well as by many other members of the Economic Community of West African States). The levels are Primary, Junior Secondary School (JSS), Senior Secondary School (SSS) and university. All children are offered basic education, with special focus now on the first nine years. Many of the schools in Nigeria are federally funded and usually are boarding schools. A few examples are Federal government college Odogbolu (FGCOdogbolu), Federal government girls college Sagamu (FGGCSagamu) and Federal government college Kano (FGCKano). The state of Lagos has its own federally funded high schools namely Federal government college Ijanikin also known as FGC Lagos, Kings College and Queens College.\nLagos is home to various postsecondary schools, universities and other vocational institutions that are either operated by the government or private entities.\n\n\n=== Vocational schools ===\nInstitute for Industrial Technology (IIT) : founded in 2000, IIT is a technical vocational school for male youth from families with limited resources. Its educational model is based on the Dual Training System.\n\n\n=== Polytechnics ===\nYaba College of Technology (YABATECH) : founded in 1934, the college is Nigeria's first higher educational institution and third in Africa. The college is a center of culture and heritage. Currently it has student enrolment of over 16,000.\nLagos State Polytechnic is a polytechnic comprising more than six schools including private polytechnics and was founded 25 years ago. Its main campus resides at Ikorodu, along Shagamu road.\nLagos City Polytechnic, located at 6/8, Bashiru Oweh Street, Off Simbiat Abiola Road (formerly Medical Road), Ikeja \u2013 This is the first private Polytechnic in Nigeria. It was established in 1990 by Engr. Babatunde Odufuwa. Engr. Odufuwa hails from Oke-Aye in Ijebu North East Local Government Area (I.N.E.L.G) of Ogun State.\nGrace Polytechnic\nWolex Polytechnic\nFederal College of Fisheries and Marine Technology is a monotechnic that offers courses in fisheries technology, general science, marine engineering and nautical science.\nFederal College of Education (tech) Akoka\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nThe University of Lagos (UNILAG) Akoka, is a large institution dating from 1962, with over 55,000 students. It comprises 13 faculties, run by over 4,000 staff.\nLagos State University (LASU) is a multi-campus university established in the year 1983 and owned by the Lagos State government. The main campus is located at Ojo, along the Lagos-Badagry Expressway.\nPan-Atlantic University formerly known as Pan-African University has a business school (LBS), a school of Media and communication (SMC) and an entrepreneurial development center (EDC), specialized in providing short courses for SMEs. Lagos Business School (LBS) is the most famous of them all, awarding world-class MBA and EMBA. The School of Media and Communication is also known for its pragmatic communication courses in the field of journalism, media and marketing. SMC awards BSc., MSc., and PHD in social science courses. Founded in 1996 and awarded University status in 2002.  The University also places some emphasis on the study of art, running the Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art.\nNational Open University of Nigeria is the first open university in Nigeria; it is located on Ahmadu Bello Way, Victoria Island, Lagos.\nCaleb University is a private university located at Imota, Lagos.\nLagos State College of Health Technology (LASCOHET) is an institution that runs health courses such as Health Information Management, Pharmacist Tech, Medical Laboratory Tech, Community Health Extension and Environmental Health Technology; it is located in Yaba.\nLagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM), Ikeja\nLagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba-Mushin, Lagos.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nLagos has many hospitals and medical facilities, some of which have accomplished feats in Nigeria's medical history. For example, the oldest Nigerian hospital is located in the city as well as West Africa's first air-operated emergency medical service, which commenced in the city. The Lagos healthcare system is generally divided into public and private sectors that provide medical services at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Although the private hospitals are usually more expensive, it does not necessarily translate to better health-care delivery.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nLagos has one of the largest and most extensive road networks in West Africa. It also has suburban trains and some ferry services. Highways are usually congested in peak hours, due in part to the geography of the city, as well as to its explosive population growth. Lagos is also linked by many highways and bridges. A new rail system that is supposed to span the length of the Badagry expressway is currently under construction.\nThe Lagos\u2013Ibadan Expressway and the Lagos\u2013Abeokuta Expressway are the major controlled-access highways in the north of the city and serve as inter-state highways to Oyo State and Ogun State respectively. To the west the congested Lagos\u2013Badagry Expressway serves outlying towns such as Festival Town, which was the location for the 1977 Festival of Black Arts and Culture 77.Lagos's importance as a commercial centre and port and its strategic location have led to it being the end-point of three Trans-African Highway routes using Nigeria's national roads. The Trans\u2013West African Coastal Highway leaves the city as the Badagry Expressway to Benin and beyond as far as Dakar and Nouakchott; the Trans-Sahara Highway to Algiers, which is close to completion, leaves the city as the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.Lagos State has a bus rapid transit (BRT) system; the first phase was completed in February 2008. It is expected to operate along eight routes using specially designated bus rapid transit lanes running through the city, with the aim of expanding to other routes in the future.\nThe first phase of the Lagos BRT runs 19 km (12 mi) through Ikorodu Road and Funsho Williams Avenue up to CMS. After weeks of test runs, operations started on 17 March 2008, six months earlier than planned. Also, the signature color of Lagos state 14-seater bus (known as Danfo) is yellow with a touch of black.\nIt has been estimated that the system will transport about 10,000 passengers in each direction per hour during peak travel times. At these times traffic congestion, called \"Go Slow\", by Lagosians, can be extreme. The LAMATA bus rapid transit corridor covers a distance of about 22 km (14 mi). The system is run by two operators, NURTW Cooperative (Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers) and Lagbus, a Lagos State Government owned Asset Management Company that contributes about 180 high-capacity buses for the implementation of the first phase Mile 12 to CMS BRT Lite system.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nAn extensive urban rail system, Lagos Rail Mass Transit, running through the Lagos metropolis is currently under construction. Several intercity and commuter trains serve Lagos through the Lagos Terminus railway station.\n\n\n=== Ferries ===\nLagos State Ferry Services Corporation runs a few regular routes, for example between Lagos Island and the mainland, served by modern ferries and wharves. Private boats run irregular passenger services on the lagoon and on some creeks.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLagos is served by Murtala Muhammed International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in Africa. The MMIA is Nigeria's premier international air gateway. The airport's history dates back to colonial times, around the time of the Second World War. The current international airport terminal was built and commissioned over 40 years ago, in 1978. The terminal opened officially March 15, 1979. The airport had been known simply as the Lagos International Airport. It was, however, renamed for the late Nigerian Head of State, General Murtala Muhammed, who died in 1976.\nThe airport terminal has been renovated several times since the 1970s but its most radical makeover began in 2013, following the launch of the Federal government's multi-billion naira Remodelling/ Rehabilitation Programme for its airports nationwide. Under the re-modeling work there, by late in 2014, the MMlA lounge area had been expanded to four times its previous size and new passenger handling conveyor systems installed which can handle over 1,000 passengers per hour.\nA second airport, Lekki-Epe International Airport is proposed.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAbike Dabiri, Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission\nAgbani Darego, Miss Nigeria 2001, Semifinalist Miss Universe 2001 and Miss World 2001\nAkinwunmi Ambode, former Governor of Lagos state\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, Governor of Lagos State\nBabatunde Fashola, Former Governor of Lagos and current Minister of Power, Works and Housing\nBode George, Politician\nBola Tinubu, Former Governor of Lagos State\nBuchi Emecheta, novelist\nFunsho Williams, politician and one time aspirant to the office of Lagos state governor\nHakeem Olajuwon, professional basketball player\nIsrael Adesanya, UFC Middle weight champion\nIsrael Idonije, Professional American football player, Chicago Bears 2003\u20132013, Detroit Lions 2013\nNelson Agholor, Professional American football player, Super Bowl 52 Champion with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018\nRilwan Akiolu, Oba (traditional ruler) of Lagos\nToyin Saraki, global health advocate and healthcare philanthropist\nYemi Osinbajo, politician, lawyer and current Vice-President of Nigeria\nYvonne Orji, Actress, Comedian\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\n\nLagos is twinned with:\n Gary, Indiana, United States, since 1991\n Atlanta, Georgia, United States, since 1974\n Bucharest, Romania\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of largest cities\nList of Governors of Lagos State\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLeithead, Alastair (August 2017).

        "wiki": "Lagos (, US also ; Yoruba: \u00c8k\u00f3) is the most populous city in Nigeria and all of Africa. Lagos is a major financial centre for all of Africa and is the economic hub of Lagos State. The megacity has the fourth-highest GDP in Africa and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports on the continent. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world.Lagos initially emerged as a port city that originated on a collection of islands, which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos Island, Eti-Osa, Amuwo-Odofin and Apapa. The islands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon, while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach, which stretch up to 100 km (62 mi) east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanization, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland, Ajeromi-Ifelodun and Surulere. This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the Island, which was the initial city of Lagos, before it expanded into the area known as the Mainland. This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council, until the creation of Lagos State in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the then Western Region to form the state.Lagos, the capital of Nigeria since its amalgamation in 1914, went on to become the capital of Lagos State after its creation. However, the state capital was later moved to Ikeja in 1976, and the federal capital moved to Abuja in 1991. Even though Lagos is still widely referred to as a city, the present day Lagos, also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\", and officially as \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\" is an urban agglomeration or conurbation, consisting of 16 LGAs including Ikeja, the state capital of Lagos State. This conurbation makes up 37% of Lagos State's total land area, but houses about 85% of the state's total population.The exact population of Metropolitan Lagos is disputed. In the 2006 federal census data, the conurbation had a population of about 8 million people. However, the figure was disputed by the Lagos State Government, which later released its own population data, putting the population of Lagos Metropolitan Area at approximately 16 million. As of 2015, unofficial figures put the population of \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\", which includes Lagos and its surrounding metro area, extending as far as into Ogun State, at approximately 21 million.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLagos was originally inhabited by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba people in the 15th century. Under the leadership of the Oloye Olofin, the Awori moved to an island now called Iddo and then to the larger Lagos Island. In the 16th century, the Awori settlement was conquered by the Benin Empire and the island became a Benin war-camp called \"Eko\" under Oba Orhogbua, the Oba of Benin at the time. Eko is still the native name for Lagos.\nLagos, which means \"lakes\", was a name given to the settlement by the Portuguese. Throughout history, it was home to a number of warring ethnic groups who had settled in the area. Following its early settlement by the Awori nobility, and its conquest by the Bini warlords of Benin, the state first came to the attention of the Portuguese in the 15th century.Portuguese explorer Rui de Sequeira visited the area in 1472, naming the area around the city Lago de Curamo. Another explanation is that Lagos is named after a major port in Portugal\u2014a maritime town that, at the time, was the main centre of Portuguese expeditions down the African coast, Lagos, Portugal.\nIn Britain's early 19th century fight against the transatlantic slave trade, its West Africa Squadron or Preventative Squadron as it was also known, continued to pursue Portuguese, American, French and Cuban slave ships and to impose anti-slavery treaties with West African coastal chiefs with so much doggedness that they created a strong presence along the West African coast from Sierra Leone all the way to the Niger Delta (today's Nigeria) and as far south as Congo. In 1849, Britain appointed John Beecroft Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, a position he held (along with his governorship of Fernando Po) until his death in 1854. John Duncan was appointed Vice Consul and was located at Wydah. At the time of Beecroft's appointment, the Kingdom of Lagos (under Oba Kosoko) was in the western part of the Consulate of the Bights of Benin and Biafra and was a key slave trading port. In 1851 and with pressure from liberated slaves who now wielded political and business influence, Britain intervened in Lagos in what is now known as the Bombardment of Lagos or Capture of Lagos resulting in the installation of Oba Akitoye and the ouster of Oba Kosoko. Oba Akitoye then signed the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos abolishing slavery. The signing of the 1852 treaty ushered in the Consular Period in Lagos' history wherein Britain provided military protection for Lagos.Following threats from Kosoko and the French who were positioned at Wydah, a decision was made by Lord Palmerston (British Prime Minister) who noted in 1861, \"the expediency of losing no time in assuming the formal Protectorate of Lagos\". William McCoskry, the Acting Consul in Lagos with Commander Bedingfield convened a meeting with Oba Dosunmu on 30 July 1861 aboard HMS Prometheus where Britain's intent was explained and a response to the terms were required by August 1861. Dosunmu resisted the terms of the treaty but under the threat to unleash violence on Lagos by Commander Bedingfield, Dosunmu relented and signed the Lagos Treaty of Cession on 6 August 1861.\n\nLagos was declared a colony on 5 March 1862. The remainder of modern-day Nigeria was seized in 1887, and when the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was established in 1914, Lagos became its capital, continuing as such after the country's independence from Britain in 1960. Along with migrants from all over Nigeria and other West African nations were the returnee ex-slaves known as Creoles, who came from Freetown, Sierra Leone, Brazil and the West Indies to Lagos. The Creoles contributed to Lagos' modernisation and their knowledge of Portuguese architecture can still be seen from the architecture on Lagos Island. Since the 19th century, Lagos gradually transformed to a melting pot of Africans and Europeans. Railway links and telephone cables connecting Lagos to London had been established by 1886. Electric street lighting was introduced in the city in 1898. Lagos experienced rapid growth throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a result of Nigeria's economic boom.Before the creation of Lagos State on 27 May 1967, Lagos, which was the country's capital had been administered directly by the Federal Government as a Federal Territory through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs, while the Lagos City Council (LCC) governed the city. Lagos, along with the towns from the then Western region (Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu, Epe and Badagry), were eventually captured to create Lagos State. Lagos city was split into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), while the other towns now make up 13 LGAs in the state. Lagos played the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital until 1976 when the state capital was moved to Ikeja. Lagos was adversely affected during Nigeria's military rule. Also, on 12 December 1991, the seat of the Federal Government was also formally relocated to Abuja. However, Lagos remains the financial centre of the country, and also grew to become the most populous conurbation in the country.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLagos is loosely classified into two main geographical areas\u2014the \"Island\" and the \"Mainland\".\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n==== Island ====\n\nThe Island is a loose geographical term that is used to define the area of Lagos that is separated from the \"mainland\" by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic Ocean, which forms Lagos Harbour. The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected together by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events in Lagos takes place. It also houses most of the upscale residential areas in Lagos. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be in the Island include Lagos Island, Eti-Osa. The major upscale island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include Ikoyi and Victoria Island. Three major bridges join the island to the mainland. They are the Carter Bridge, which starts from Iddo; the Eko Bridge (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the Third Mainland Bridge, which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon.\n\n\n===== Lagos Island =====\n\nLagos Island contains a central business district. This district is characterized by high-rise buildings. The island also contains many of the city's largest wholesale marketplaces (such as the popular Idumota and Balogun Markets). It also has the National Museum of Nigeria, the Central Mosque, the Glover Memorial Hall, Christ's Church Cathedral (CMS) and the Oba's Palace (Iga Idunganran). Another major part of Lagos Island is Marina. It borders around the idumota and Balogun markets and houses major Banking institutions. Though formerly in a derelict condition, Lagos Island's Tinubu Square is a site of historical importance; it was here that the Amalgamation Ceremony that unified the North and South protectorate to form Nigeria took place in 1914.\n\n\n===== Ikoyi =====\n\nIkoyi is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a land fill. Ikoyi is also connected to Victoria Island by Falomo bridge, which carries the main road over Five Cowrie creek. Ikoyi housed the headquarters of the federal government of Nigeria and other buildings owned by the government, including the old federal secretariat complex. The complex today is on reestablishment.In Ikoyi there are military and police barracks, a top-security prison and a federal high court of Nigeria. Ikoyi also has a number of hotels, night clubs, a recreational park and one of Africa's largest golf courses. Originally a middle class neighbourhood, in recent years, it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the upper middle class to the upper class. There are also commercial activities in Ikoyi, which is spotted in an increasing number of offices, banks, and shopping complexes. The commercial section is concentrated in the South-West.\n\n\n===== Victoria Island =====\n\nVictoria Island with its annexe is situated to the south of Lagos Island. It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments are blooming up everywhere.\nAlong with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts of several sizeable shopping districts. On its sea shore along the Atlantic front, there is environmentally reconstructed Bar Beach.\n\n\n===== Iddo =====\nAcross the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called Iddo. Iddo is also a railroad terminus and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland local government area after it was connected to the mainland like a peninsula.\n\n\n==== Mainland ====\nA huge population of Lagosians also live on the Lagos mainland, and most industries are located there. The mainland is known for its music and nightlife, which used to be located in areas around Yaba and Surulere. However, in recent years more night clubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island, Ikate and Lekki Phase 1) the main nightlife attractions. Mainland LGAs include Surulere, Apapa, and Lagos Mainland. Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: Agege, Amuwo Odofin, Mushin, Oshodi-Isolo and Ikeja (site of Murtala Muhammed International Airport and the capital of Lagos State).\nMajor Areas on the mainland include Ebute Metta, Yaba and Ejigbo. Some rivers, like Badagry Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLagos experiences a tropical savanna climate (Aw) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, as there's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season. The wet season starts in April and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in March. The wettest month is June with precipitation total 315.5 millimetres (12.42 in), while the driest month is January with precipitation total 13.2 millimetres (0.52 in).\nLocated near the equator, Lagos has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging 28.3\u201332.9 \u00b0C (82.9\u201391.2 \u00b0F). Lagos shares the seasons of the Southern Hemisphere, with summer highs in March, daily range 32.9\u201324.1 \u00b0C (91.2\u201375.4 \u00b0F), and warm winters in August, ranging 28.3\u201321.8 \u00b0C (82.9\u201371.2 \u00b0F) as the daily average.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nLagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria. The architectural styles in Lagos are diverse and range from tropical and vernacular to colonial European and ultramodern buildings or a mixture. Brazilian style architecture brought by the creoles is evident in buildings such as Water House and  Shitta Bey Mosque. Skyscrapers and most high rise buildings are centered on the islands, while the mainland has some high rise buildings. In recent years, the Lagos State government has renovated existing parks and green areas, with a long-term goal of expansion. Many good quality buildings are interspersed across the city.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, there are Christian churches and temples: Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of Nigeria (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Nigerian Baptist Convention (Baptist World Alliance), The Apostolic Church Nigeria (TACN), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Assemblies of God, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos (Catholic Church) and Muslim mosques such as Lagos Central Mosque in Lagos- island, Wahab Folawiyo Central Mosque in Surulere, Lekki Central Mosque in Lekki, The Syrian Mosque in Ikoyi. There are also various shrines and temples for traditional worshipers scattered across the state and they include several Igbo Igunnuko shrines, Egungun shrines, Eyo Shrines and other various traditional shrines and places of worship. For the 25,000 strong Hindu community, there is an ISKCON temple and three other Hindu temples dotted around the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn terms of administration, Lagos is not a single municipality and therefore has no overall city administration. The geographical city limits of Metropolitan Lagos comprises 16 of the 20 Local Government Areas, which together comprise Lagos State. The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region. The Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi, and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several Local Government Areas (most notably Lagos Island LGA, Lagos Mainland LGA and Eti-Osa LGA).The mainland beyond the Municipality of Lagos, on the other hand, comprised several separate towns and settlements such as Mushin, Ikeja and Agege. In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom, Lagos experienced a population explosion, untamed economic growth, and unmitigated rural migration. This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly, thus forming the present day \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\", also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\". The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them.\nBy 2006, the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State's boundaries and attained a megacity status. This much larger area is referred to as \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\" or \"Lagos Megacity Region\", which is a continuous built up land area of additional 1,535.4 square kilometres (592.8 square miles), comprising sprawls in LGAs situated next to Lagos' eastern and western city limits in Lagos State, and beyond northern limits, spilling into the LGAs in adjoining Ogun State. Ogun State LGAs within Greater Metropolitan Lagos majorly include: Obafemi Owode, Sagamu, Ifo, Ado-Odo/Ota and part of Ewekoro.\n\nToday, the word Lagos most often refers to the urban area, called \"Metropolitan Lagos\" in Nigeria, which includes both the islands of the former municipality of Lagos and the mainland suburbs. Lagos State government is responsible for some of the utilities including roads and transportation, power, water, health and education. Metropolitan Lagos extends over 16 of the 20 LGAs of Lagos State, and contains about 85% of the population of Lagos State, and includes semi-rural areas. Lagos City has a considerable number of high-rise buildings that dominate its skyline. Most of the tall buildings are located in the downtown Central Business District.\nLagos was the former capital city of Nigeria but it has since been replaced by Abuja. Abuja officially gained its status as the capital of Nigeria on 12 December 1991, although the decision to move the federal capital had been made in now Act no. 6 of 1976. Lagos is also home to the High Court of the Lagos State Judiciary, housed in an old colonial building on Lagos Island.\n\n\n=== Census data for Lagos ===\nAlthough the 2006 National Population Census of Nigeria credited the metropolitan area with a population figure of 7,937,932, the figure is at variance with some projections by the UN and other population agencies and groups worldwide. The population figure of Lagos State given by the Lagos State Government is 17,553,924. It was based on claimed conducted enumeration for social planning by the Lagos State Government \"parallel census\" and it believes that since the inhabitants of the metropolitan area of Lagos constitute 88% of the Lagos State population, the population of metropolitan Lagos is about 15.5 million.A rejoinder to Lagos State Government views concluded that Lagos State concealed the fact that the population projection, for Lagos Urban Agglomeration by the UN agencies had been revised downwards substantially as early as 2003. It failed to interpret the two most important and fairly representative and reliable secondary data sets already in public domain, the National Identity Card Scheme and the 2003 Voters Registration figures from INEC. The figures for 2007 Voters Registration by INEC were an act subsequent to the release of the provisional census results and comprehensively corroborate, vindicate and validate the population figures in no uncertain terms.\nAccording to the official results of the 2006 census, there were 8,048,430 inhabitants in Metropolitan Lagos. This figure was lower than anticipated, and has created controversy in Nigeria. Lagos Island, the central Local Government Area and historic centre of Metropolitan Lagos, had a population of 212,700 at the 2006 Census.\n\nAuthorities of Lagos State have attacked the results of the 2006 census, accusing the Nigerian National Population Commission of having undercounted the population of the state. This accusation is denied by the National Population Commission. A study found that research carried out by Africapolis (the African subsidiary of e-Geopolis backed by the Agence fran\u00e7aise de d\u00e9veloppement), in addition to the cross-referencing of official figures with more scientific independent research concluded that the 2006 census figures for Lagos State of about 9 million were valid and that the state's own assessments are inflated.Lagos is, by most estimates, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Lagos is currently experiencing a population increase of about 275,000 persons per annum. In 1999 the United Nations predicted that the city's metropolitan area, which had only about 290,000 inhabitants in 1950, would exceed 20 million by 2010 and thus become one of the ten most populated cities in the world.\n\nThere is a huge spectrum of wealth distribution among the people that reside in Lagos. It ranges from the very wealthy to the very poor. Lagos has attracted many young people and families seeking a better life from all other parts of Nigeria and beyond and this has also contributed to its cosmopolitan status. Some people are leaving Lagos and Nigeria in search of better living conditions, cities like Townsville in Australia are very popular with expats and have services set up to assist people in settling into their new life.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Lagos is a major economic focal point in Nigeria, generating around 10% of the country's GDP. Most commercial and financial business is carried out in the central business district situated on the island. This is also where most of the country's commercial banks, financial institutions and major corporations are headquartered. Lagos is also the major Information Communications and Telecommunications (ICT) hub of West Africa and potentially, the biggest ICT market in the continent. Lagos is developing a 24-hour economy and has also been ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the world. In some parts of Lagos, residents have one of the highest standards of living in Nigeria and in Africa. At the same time, a sizable proportion of the residents live in slums without access to piped water and sanitation.The Port of Lagos is Nigeria's leading port and one of the largest and busiest in Africa. It is administered by the Nigerian Ports Authority and it is split into three main sections: Lagos port, in the main channel next to Lagos Island, Apapa Port (site of the container terminal) and Tin Can Port, both located in Badagry Creek, which flows into Lagos Harbour from the west. The port features a railhead. The port has seen growing amounts of crude oil exported, with export figures rising between 1997 and 2000. Oil and petroleum products provide 14% of GDP and 90% of foreign exchange earnings in Nigeria as a whole.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music and film industry ===\nLagos is famous throughout Africa for its music scene. Lagos has a vibrant nightlife and has given birth to a variety of styles such as Sakara music, Nigerian hip hop, highlife, juju, fuji, Afrobeat, and Afrobeats.Lagos is the centre of the Nigerian movie industry, often referred to as 'Nollywood'. Idumota market on Lagos Island is the primary distribution centre. Many films are shot in the Festac area of Lagos, where the World Festival of Black Arts was held.Iganmu is home to the primary centre for the performing arts and artistes in Nigeria: the National Arts Theatre.\nJames Brown performed in Lagos in 1970. Paul McCartney recorded his fifth post-Beatles album, Band on the Run, in an EMI studio in Lagos in August and September 1973. Other foreign musicians who have also performed in the city include Sean Paul, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Akon, Jarule, Ashanti, Usher, Shaggy, R Kelly, Cardi B, Migos especially during the Star Mega Jam; Shakira, John Legend, Boyz II Men T-Pain, Brian McKnight, JayZ, Mary J. Blige, Beyonc\u00e9, Brandy, Ciara, Keri Hilson and Lauryn Hill, among others.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nAssociation football is Lagos' most popular sport. Prominent Lagos football clubs include Bridge Boys F.C. MFM F.C. and First Bank: both play in Nigeria National League, the second tier of Nigerian football.\n\nThe Nigeria national football team, also known as the Super Eagles, used to play almost all of their home games in Lagos at the National Stadium in Surulere; much later, games were played at the then New Abuja National Stadium in Abuja for sometime; however, games are now mostly played at the newer Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, which is the default home of the Super Eagles. Lagos also hosted the 2nd All-African games in 1973.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLagos, subsequent to the re-modernization project achieved by the previous administration of Governor Raji Babatunde Fashola, is gradually becoming a major tourist destination, being one of the largest cities in Africa and in the world. Lagos is currently taking steps to become a global city. The 2009 Eyo carnival (a yearly festival originated from Iperu Remo, Ogun State), which took place on 25 April, was a step toward world city status. Currently, Lagos is primarily known as a business-oriented and a fast-paced community.Lagos has become an important location for African and \"black\" cultural identity. Many festivals are held in Lagos; festivals vary in offerings each year and may be held in different months. Some of the festivals are Festac Food Fair held in Festac Town Annually, Eyo Festival, Lagos Black Heritage Carnival, Lagos Carnival, Eko International Film Festival, Lagos Seafood Festac Festival, LAGOS PHOTO Festival and the Lagos Jazz Series, which is a unique franchise for high-quality live music in all genres with a focus on jazz. Established in 2010, the popular event takes place over a 3\u20135 day period at selected high quality outdoor venues. The music is as varied as the audience itself and features a diverse mix of musical genres from rhythm and blues to soul, Afrobeat, hip hop, bebop, and traditional jazz. The festivals provide entertainment of dance and song to add excitement to travelers during a stay in Lagos.\nLagos has a number of sandy beaches by the Atlantic Ocean, including Elegushi Beach and Alpha Beach. Lagos also has a number of private beach resorts including Inagbe Grand Beach Resort and several others in the outskirts.\nLagos has a variety of hotels ranging from three star to five star hotels, with a mixture of local hotels such as Eko Hotels and Suites, Federal Palace Hotel and franchises of multinational chains such as Intercontinental Hotel, Sheraton and Four Points by Sheraton. Other places of interest include the Tafawa Balewa Square, Festac town, The Nike Art Gallery, Freedom Park, Lagos and the Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nSome of the famous cuisines in Lagos include indigenous delicacies such as eba and egusi; amala and ewedu; jollof; ofada rice; plantains (locally called dodo); beans; suya (spicy shish kebab or spiced roasted beef), which is consumed in local clubs and bars with a bottle of cold beer; and eba, made from cassava and eaten with soups prepared with vegetables and mixture of spices and herbs. Other cuisines range from local ones like Iyan (pounded yam) made from yam flour, amala; asaro, which is usually eaten with various kind of vegetables; and Egusi (melon soup) to European, Middle-Eastern, and Asian cuisine.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Lagos State Government operates state schools. The education system is the 6-3-3-4 system, which is practised throughout the country (as well as by many other members of the Economic Community of West African States). The levels are Primary, Junior Secondary School (JSS), Senior Secondary School (SSS) and university. All children are offered basic education, with special focus now on the first nine years. Many of the schools in Nigeria are federally funded and usually are boarding schools. A few examples are Federal government college Odogbolu (FGCOdogbolu), Federal government girls college Sagamu (FGGCSagamu) and Federal government college Kano (FGCKano). The state of Lagos has its own federally funded high schools namely Federal government college Ijanikin also known as FGC Lagos, Kings College and Queens College.\nLagos is home to various postsecondary schools, universities and other vocational institutions that are either operated by the government or private entities.\n\n\n=== Vocational schools ===\nInstitute for Industrial Technology (IIT) : founded in 2000, IIT is a technical vocational school for male youth from families with limited resources. Its educational model is based on the Dual Training System.\n\n\n=== Polytechnics ===\nYaba College of Technology (YABATECH) : founded in 1934, the college is Nigeria's first higher educational institution and third in Africa. The college is a center of culture and heritage. Currently it has student enrolment of over 16,000.\nLagos State Polytechnic is a polytechnic comprising more than six schools including private polytechnics and was founded 25 years ago. Its main campus resides at Ikorodu, along Shagamu road.\nLagos City Polytechnic, located at 6/8, Bashiru Oweh Street, Off Simbiat Abiola Road (formerly Medical Road), Ikeja \u2013 This is the first private Polytechnic in Nigeria. It was established in 1990 by Engr. Babatunde Odufuwa. Engr. Odufuwa hails from Oke-Aye in Ijebu North East Local Government Area (I.N.E.L.G) of Ogun State.\nGrace Polytechnic\nWolex Polytechnic\nFederal College of Fisheries and Marine Technology is a monotechnic that offers courses in fisheries technology, general science, marine engineering and nautical science.\nFederal College of Education (tech) Akoka\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nThe University of Lagos (UNILAG) Akoka, is a large institution dating from 1962, with over 55,000 students. It comprises 13 faculties, run by over 4,000 staff.\nLagos State University (LASU) is a multi-campus university established in the year 1983 and owned by the Lagos State government. The main campus is located at Ojo, along the Lagos-Badagry Expressway.\nPan-Atlantic University formerly known as Pan-African University has a business school (LBS), a school of Media and communication (SMC) and an entrepreneurial development center (EDC), specialized in providing short courses for SMEs. Lagos Business School (LBS) is the most famous of them all, awarding world-class MBA and EMBA. The School of Media and Communication is also known for its pragmatic communication courses in the field of journalism, media and marketing. SMC awards BSc., MSc., and PHD in social science courses. Founded in 1996 and awarded University status in 2002.  The University also places some emphasis on the study of art, running the Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art.\nNational Open University of Nigeria is the first open university in Nigeria; it is located on Ahmadu Bello Way, Victoria Island, Lagos.\nCaleb University is a private university located at Imota, Lagos.\nLagos State College of Health Technology (LASCOHET) is an institution that runs health courses such as Health Information Management, Pharmacist Tech, Medical Laboratory Tech, Community Health Extension and Environmental Health Technology; it is located in Yaba.\nLagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM), Ikeja\nLagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba-Mushin, Lagos.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nLagos has many hospitals and medical facilities, some of which have accomplished feats in Nigeria's medical history. For example, the oldest Nigerian hospital is located in the city as well as West Africa's first air-operated emergency medical service, which commenced in the city. The Lagos healthcare system is generally divided into public and private sectors that provide medical services at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Although the private hospitals are usually more expensive, it does not necessarily translate to better health-care delivery.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nLagos has one of the largest and most extensive road networks in West Africa. It also has suburban trains and some ferry services. Highways are usually congested in peak hours, due in part to the geography of the city, as well as to its explosive population growth. Lagos is also linked by many highways and bridges. A new rail system that is supposed to span the length of the Badagry expressway is currently under construction.\nThe Lagos\u2013Ibadan Expressway and the Lagos\u2013Abeokuta Expressway are the major controlled-access highways in the north of the city and serve as inter-state highways to Oyo State and Ogun State respectively. To the west the congested Lagos\u2013Badagry Expressway serves outlying towns such as Festival Town, which was the location for the 1977 Festival of Black Arts and Culture 77.Lagos's importance as a commercial centre and port and its strategic location have led to it being the end-point of three Trans-African Highway routes using Nigeria's national roads. The Trans\u2013West African Coastal Highway leaves the city as the Badagry Expressway to Benin and beyond as far as Dakar and Nouakchott; the Trans-Sahara Highway to Algiers, which is close to completion, leaves the city as the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.Lagos State has a bus rapid transit (BRT) system; the first phase was completed in February 2008. It is expected to operate along eight routes using specially designated bus rapid transit lanes running through the city, with the aim of expanding to other routes in the future.\nThe first phase of the Lagos BRT runs 19 km (12 mi) through Ikorodu Road and Funsho Williams Avenue up to CMS. After weeks of test runs, operations started on 17 March 2008, six months earlier than planned. Also, the signature color of Lagos state 14-seater bus (known as Danfo) is yellow with a touch of black.\nIt has been estimated that the system will transport about 10,000 passengers in each direction per hour during peak travel times. At these times traffic congestion, called \"Go Slow\", by Lagosians, can be extreme. The LAMATA bus rapid transit corridor covers a distance of about 22 km (14 mi). The system is run by two operators, NURTW Cooperative (Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers) and Lagbus, a Lagos State Government owned Asset Management Company that contributes about 180 high-capacity buses for the implementation of the first phase Mile 12 to CMS BRT Lite system.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nAn extensive urban rail system, Lagos Rail Mass Transit, running through the Lagos metropolis is currently under construction. Several intercity and commuter trains serve Lagos through the Lagos Terminus railway station.\n\n\n=== Ferries ===\nLagos State Ferry Services Corporation runs a few regular routes, for example between Lagos Island and the mainland, served by modern ferries and wharves. Private boats run irregular passenger services on the lagoon and on some creeks.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLagos is served by Murtala Muhammed International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in Africa. The MMIA is Nigeria's premier international air gateway. The airport's history dates back to colonial times, around the time of the Second World War. The current international airport terminal was built and commissioned over 40 years ago, in 1978. The terminal opened officially March 15, 1979. The airport had been known simply as the Lagos International Airport. It was, however, renamed for the late Nigerian Head of State, General Murtala Muhammed, who died in 1976.\nThe airport terminal has been renovated several times since the 1970s but its most radical makeover began in 2013, following the launch of the Federal government's multi-billion naira Remodelling/ Rehabilitation Programme for its airports nationwide. Under the re-modeling work there, by late in 2014, the MMlA lounge area had been expanded to four times its previous size and new passenger handling conveyor systems installed which can handle over 1,000 passengers per hour.\nA second airport, Lekki-Epe International Airport is proposed.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAbike Dabiri, Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission\nAgbani Darego, Miss Nigeria 2001, Semifinalist Miss Universe 2001 and Miss World 2001\nAkinwunmi Ambode, former Governor of Lagos state\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, Governor of Lagos State\nBabatunde Fashola, Former Governor of Lagos and current Minister of Power, Works and Housing\nBode George, Politician\nBola Tinubu, Former Governor of Lagos State\nBuchi Emecheta, novelist\nFunsho Williams, politician and one time aspirant to the office of Lagos state governor\nHakeem Olajuwon, professional basketball player\nIsrael Adesanya, UFC Middle weight champion\nIsrael Idonije, Professional American football player, Chicago Bears 2003\u20132013, Detroit Lions 2013\nNelson Agholor, Professional American football player, Super Bowl 52 Champion with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018\nRilwan Akiolu, Oba (traditional ruler) of Lagos\nToyin Saraki, global health advocate and healthcare philanthropist\nYemi Osinbajo, politician, lawyer and current Vice-President of Nigeria\nYvonne Orji, Actress, Comedian\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\n\nLagos is twinned with:\n Gary, Indiana, United States, since 1991\n Atlanta, Georgia, United States, since 1974\n Bucharest, Romania\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of largest cities\nList of Governors of Lagos State\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLeithead, Alastair (August 2017).

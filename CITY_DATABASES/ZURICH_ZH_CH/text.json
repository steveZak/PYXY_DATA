        "wiki": "Z\u00fcrich (Alemannic German: Z\u00fcri; French: Zurich; Italian: Zurigo; Romansh: Turitg) is the largest city in Switzerland and the capital of the canton of Z\u00fcrich. It is located in north-central Switzerland at the northwestern tip of Lake Z\u00fcrich. As of January 2020 the municipality has 434,335 inhabitants, the urban area (agglomeration) 1.315 million (2009) and the Z\u00fcrich metropolitan area 1.83 million (2011). Z\u00fcrich is a hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Both Zurich Airport and railway station are the largest and busiest in the country.\nPermanently settled for over 2,000 years, Z\u00fcrich was founded by the Romans, who, in 15 BC, called it Turicum. However, early settlements have been found dating back more than 6,400 years (although this only indicates human presence in the area and not the presence of a town that early). During the Middle Ages, Z\u00fcrich gained the independent and privileged status of imperial immediacy and, in 1519, became a primary centre of the Protestant Reformation in Europe under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli.The official language of Z\u00fcrich is German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Z\u00fcrich German.\nMany museums and art galleries can be found in the city, including the Swiss National Museum, the Kunsthaus and newer Theater 11 in Oerlikon. Schauspielhaus Z\u00fcrich is one of the most important theatres in the German-speaking world.Z\u00fcrich is among the world's largest financial centres despite having a relatively small population. The city is home to many financial institutions and banking companies. Many of Switzerland's research and development centres are concentrated in the Greater Z\u00fcrich area and the low tax rates and canton funding subsidies attract overseas companies to set up their headquarters or finance treasury services in the city.Monocle's 2012 \"Quality of Life Survey\" ranked Z\u00fcrich first on a list of the top 25 cities in the world \"to make a base within\". In 2019 Z\u00fcrich was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Geneva and Basel.\n\n\n== Name ==\nIn German, the city name is written Z\u00fcrich, and pronounced [\u02c8tsy\u02d0r\u026a\u00e7] in Swiss Standard German. In Z\u00fcrich German, the local dialect of Swiss German, the name is pronounced without the final consonant, as Z\u00fcri [\u02c8tsyri], although the adjective remains Z\u00fcrcher(in) [\u02c8tsyrx\u0259r(\u026an)]. The city is called Zurich [zy\u0281ik] in French, Zurigo [dzu\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0261o] in Italian, and Turitg [tu\u02c8rit\u0255] (listen) in Romansh.\nIn English, the name used to be written as Zurich, without the umlaut. Even so, standard English practice for German names is to either preserve the umlaut or replace it with the base letter followed by e (i.e. Zuerich). It is pronounced  ZEWR-ik, and more recently sometimes also with /ts/, as in German.The earliest known form of the city's name is Turicum, attested on a tombstone of the late 2nd century AD in the form STA(tio) TURICEN(sis) (\"Turicum tax post\").  The name is interpreted as a derivation from a given name, possibly Gaulish personal name T\u016bros, for a reconstructed native form of the toponym of *Tur\u012bcon. The Latin stress on the long vowel of the Gaulish name, [t\u028a\u02c8ri\u02d0k\u00f5\u02d0], was lost in German [\u02c8tsy\u02d0r\u026a\u00e7] but is preserved in Italian [dzu\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0261o] and in Romansh [tu\u02c8rit\u0255]. The first development towards its later, Germanic form is attested as early as the 6th century with the form Ziurichi. From the 9th century onward, the name is established in an Old High German form Zuri(c)h (857 in villa Zurih, 924 in Zurich curtem, 1416 Z\u00fcrich Stadt). In the early modern period, the name became associated with the name of the Tigurini, and the name Tigurum rather than the historical Turicum is sometimes encountered in Modern Latin contexts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nSettlements of the Neolithic and Bronze Age were found around Lake Z\u00fcrich. Traces of pre-Roman Celtic, La T\u00e8ne settlements were discovered near the Lindenhof, a morainic hill dominating the SE - NW waterway constituted by Lake Zurich and the river Limmat. In Roman times, during the conquest of the alpine region in 15 BC, the Romans built a castellum on the Lindenhof.  Later here was erected Turicum (a toponym of clear Celtic origin), a tax-collecting point for goods trafficked on the Limmat, which constituted part of the border between Gallia Belgica (from AD 90 Germania Superior) and Raetia: this customs point developed later into a vicus. After Emperor Constantine's reforms in AD 318, the border between Gaul and Italy (two of the four praetorian prefectures of the Roman Empire) was located east of Turicum, crossing the river Linth between Lake Walen and Lake Z\u00fcrich, where a castle and garrison looked over Turicum's safety. The earliest written record of the town dates from the 2nd century, with a tombstone referring to it as to the Statio Turicensis Quadragesima Galliarum (\"Z\u00fcrich post for collecting the 2.5% value tax of the Galliae\"), discovered at the Lindenhof.In the 5th century, the Germanic Alemanni tribe settled in the Swiss Plateau. The Roman castle remained standing until the 7th century. A Carolingian castle, built on the site of the Roman castle by the grandson of Charlemagne, Louis the German, is mentioned in 835 (in castro Turicino iuxta fluvium Lindemaci). Louis also founded the Fraum\u00fcnster abbey in 853 for his daughter Hildegard. He endowed the Benedictine convent with the lands of Z\u00fcrich, Uri, and the Albis forest, and granted the convent immunity, placing it under his direct authority. In 1045, King Henry III granted the convent the right to hold markets, collect tolls, and mint coins, and thus effectively made the abbess the ruler of the city.Z\u00fcrich gained Imperial immediacy (Reichsunmittelbar, becoming an Imperial free city) in 1218 with the extinction of the main line of the Z\u00e4hringer family and attained a status comparable to statehood. During the 1230s, a city wall was built, enclosing 38 hectares, when the earliest stone houses on the Rennweg were built as well. The Carolingian castle was used as a quarry, as it had started to fall into ruin.Emperor Frederick II promoted the abbess of the Fraum\u00fcnster to the rank of a duchess in 1234. The abbess nominated the mayor, and she frequently delegated the minting of coins to citizens of the city. The political power of the convent slowly waned in the 14th century, beginning with the establishment of the Zunftordnung (guild laws) in 1336 by Rudolf Brun, who also became the first independent mayor, i.e. not nominated by the abbess.\nAn important event in the early 14th century was the completion of the Manesse Codex, a key source of medieval German poetry. The famous illuminated manuscript \u2013 described as \"the most beautifully illumined German manuscript in centuries;\" \u2013 was commissioned by the Manesse family of Z\u00fcrich, copied and illustrated in the city at some time between 1304 and 1340. Producing such a work was a highly expensive prestige project, requiring several years work by highly skilled scribes and miniature painters, and it clearly testifies to the increasing wealth and pride of Z\u00fcrich citizens in this period.\n\n\n==== Archaeological findings ====\nA female who died in about 200 B.C found buried in a carved tree trunk during a construction project at the Kern school complex in March 2017 in Aussersihl. Archaeologists revealed that she was approximately 40 years old when she died and likely carried out little physical labor when she was alive. A sheepskin coat, a belt chain, a fancy wool dress, a scarf and a pendant made of glass and amber beads were also discovered with the woman.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nOn 1 May 1351, the citizens of Z\u00fcrich had to swear allegiance before representatives of the cantons of Lucerne, Schwyz, Uri and Unterwalden, the other members of the Swiss Confederacy. Thus, Z\u00fcrich became the fifth member of the Confederacy, which was at that time a loose confederation of de facto independent states. Z\u00fcrich was the presiding canton of the Diet from 1468 to 1519. This authority was the executive council and lawmaking body of the confederacy, from the Middle Ages until the establishment of the Swiss federal state in 1848. Z\u00fcrich was temporarily expelled from the confederacy in 1440 due to a war with the other member states over the territory of Toggenburg (the Old Z\u00fcrich War). Neither side had attained significant victory when peace was agreed upon in 1446, and Z\u00fcrich was readmitted to the confederation in 1450.\n\nZwingli started the Swiss Reformation at the time when he was the main preacher in the 1520s, at the Grossm\u00fcnster. He lived there from 1484 until his death in 1531. The Z\u00fcrich Bible, based on that of Zwingli, was issued in 1531. The Reformation resulted in major changes in state matters and civil life in Z\u00fcrich, spreading also to a number of other cantons. Several cantons remained Catholic and became the basis of serious conflicts that eventually led to the outbreak of the Wars of Kappel.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the Council of Z\u00fcrich adopted an isolationist attitude, resulting in a second ring of imposing fortifications built in 1624. The Thirty Years' War which raged across Europe motivated the city to build these walls. The fortifications required a lot of resources, which were taken from subject territories without reaching any agreement. The following revolts were crushed brutally. In 1648, Z\u00fcrich proclaimed itself a republic, shedding its former status of a free imperial city. In this time the political system of Z\u00fcrich was an oligarchy (Patriziat): the dominant families of the city were the following ones: Bonstetten, Brun, B\u00fcrkli, Escher vom Glas, Escher vom Luchs, Hirzel, Jori (or von Jori), Kilchsperger, Landenberg, Manesse, Meiss, Meyer von Knonau, M\u00fclner, von Orelli.\n\nThe Helvetic Revolution of 1798 saw the fall of the Ancien R\u00e9gime. Z\u00fcrich lost control of the land and its economic privileges, and the city and the canton separated their possessions between 1803\u201305. In 1839, the city had to yield to the demands of its urban subjects, following the Z\u00fcriputsch of 6 September. Most of the ramparts built in the 17th century were torn down, without ever having been besieged, to allay rural concerns over the city's hegemony. The Treaty of Z\u00fcrich between Austria, France, and Sardinia was signed in 1859.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nZ\u00fcrich was the Federal capital for 1839\u201340, and consequently, the victory of the Conservative party there in 1839 caused a great stir throughout Switzerland. But when in 1845 the Radicals regained power at Z\u00fcrich, which was again the Federal capital for 1845\u201346, Z\u00fcrich took the lead in opposing the Sonderbund cantons. Following the Sonderbund war and the formation of the Swiss Federal State, Z\u00fcrich voted in favour of the Federal constitutions of 1848 and of 1874. The enormous immigration from the country districts into the town from the 1830s onwards created an industrial class which, though \"settled\" in the town, did not possess the privileges of burghership, and consequently had no share in the municipal government. First of all in 1860 the town schools, hitherto open to \"settlers\" only on paying high fees, were made accessible to all, next in 1875 ten years' residence ipso facto conferred the right of burghership, and in 1893 the eleven outlying districts were incorporated within the town proper.\n\nExtensive developments took place during the 19th century. From 1847, the Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn, the first railway on Swiss territory, connected Z\u00fcrich with Baden, putting the Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof at the origin of the Swiss rail network. The present building of the Hauptbahnhof (the main railway station) dates to 1871. Z\u00fcrich's Bahnhofstrasse (Station Street) was laid out in 1867, and the Z\u00fcrich Stock Exchange was founded in 1877. Industrialisation led to migration into the cities and to rapid population growth, particularly in the suburbs of Z\u00fcrich.\nThe Quaianlagen are an important milestone in the development of the modern city of Z\u00fcrich, as the construction of the new lake front transformed Z\u00fcrich from a small medieval town on the rivers Limmat and Sihl to an attractive modern city on the Z\u00fcrichsee shore, under the guidance of the city engineer Arnold B\u00fcrkli.In 1893, the twelve outlying districts were incorporated into Z\u00fcrich, including Aussersihl, the workman's quarter on the left bank of the Sihl, and additional land was reclaimed from Lake Z\u00fcrich.In 1934, eight additional districts in the north and west of Z\u00fcrich were incorporated.\nZ\u00fcrich was accidentally bombed during World War II.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\n\nThe blue and white coat of arms of Z\u00fcrich is attested from 1389 and was derived from banners with blue and white stripes in use since 1315. The first certain testimony of banners with the same design is from 1434. The coat of arms is flanked by two lions. The red Schwenkel on top of the banner had varying interpretations: For the people of Z\u00fcrich, it was a mark of honour, granted by Rudolph I. Z\u00fcrich's neighbours mocked it as a sign of shame, commemorating the loss of the banner at Winterthur in 1292. Today, the Canton of Z\u00fcrich uses the same coat of arms as the city.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City districts ===\n\nThe previous boundaries of the city of Z\u00fcrich (before 1893) were more or less synonymous with the location of the old town. Two large expansions of the city limits occurred in 1893 and in 1934 when the city of Z\u00fcrich merged with many surrounding municipalities, that had been growing increasingly together since the 19th century. Today, the city is divided into twelve districts (known as Kreis in German), numbered 1 to 12, each one of which contains between one and four neighborhoods:\n\nKreis 1, known as Altstadt, contains the old town, both to the east and west of the start of the Limmat. District 1 contains the neighbourhoods of Hochschulen, Rathaus, Lindenhof, and City.\nKreis 2 lies along the west side of Lake Z\u00fcrich, and contains the neighbourhoods of Enge, Wollishofen and Leimbach.\nKreis 3, known as Wiedikon is between the Sihl and the Uetliberg, and contains the neighbourhoods of Alt-Wiedikon, Sihlfeld and Friesenberg.\nKreis 4, known as Aussersihl lies between the Sihl and the train tracks leaving Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof, and contains the neighbourhoods of Werd, Langstrasse, and Hard.\nKreis 5, known as Industriequartier, is between the Limmat and the train tracks leaving Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof, it contains the former industrial area of Z\u00fcrich which has gone under a large-scale rezoning to create upscale modern housing, retail and commercial real estate. It contains the neighborhoods of Gewerbeschule, and Escher-Wyss.\nKreis 6 is on the edge of the Z\u00fcrichberg, a hill overlooking the eastern part of the city. District 6 contains the neighbourhoods of Oberstrass and Unterstrass.\nKreis 7 is on the edge of the Adlisberg hill as well as the Z\u00fcrichberg, on the eastern side of the city. District 7 contains the neighbourhoods of Fluntern, Hottingen, and Hirslanden. These neighbourhoods are home to Z\u00fcrich's wealthiest and more prominent residents. The neighbourhood Witikon also belongs to district 7.\nKreis 8, officially called Riesbach, but colloquially known as Seefeld, lies on the eastern side of Lake Z\u00fcrich. District 8 consists of the neighbourhoods of Seefeld, M\u00fchlebach, and Weinegg.\nKreis 9 is between the Limmat to the north and the Uetliberg to the south. It contains the neighbourhoods Altstetten and Albisrieden.\nKreis 10 is to the east of the Limmat and to the south of the H\u00f6nggerberg and K\u00e4ferberg hills. District 10 contains the neighbourhoods of H\u00f6ngg and Wipkingen.\nKreis 11 is in the area north of the H\u00f6nggerberg and K\u00e4ferberg and between the Glatt Valley and the Katzensee (Cats Lake). It contains the neighbourhoods of Affoltern, Oerlikon and Seebach.\nKreis 12, known as Schwamendingen, is located in the Glattal (Glatt valley) on the northern side of the Z\u00fcrichberg. District 12 contains the neighbourhoods of Saatlen, Schwamendigen Mitte, and Hirzenbach.Most of the district boundaries are fairly similar to the original boundaries of the previously existing municipalities before they were incorporated into the city of Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe City Council (Stadtrat) constitutes the executive government of the City of Z\u00fcrich and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of nine councilors, each presiding over a department. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the City Council. The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. The mayor (German: Stadtpr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election by a system of Majorz while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. Any resident of Zurich allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. In the mandate period 2018\u20132022 (Legislatur) the City Council is presided by mayor Corine Mauch. The executive body holds its meetings in the City Hall (German: Stadthaus), on the left bank of the Limmat. The building was built in 1883 in Renaissance style.\nAs of May 2018, the Z\u00fcrich City Council is made up of three representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party, one of whom is the mayor), two members each of the Green Party and the FDP (Free Democratic Party), and one member each of GLP (Green Liberal Party) and AL (Alternative Left Party), giving the left parties a combined seven out of nine seats. The last regular election was held on 4 March 2018.\n\nClaudia Cuche-Curti is Town Chronicler (Stadtschreiberin) since 2012, and Peter Saile is Legal Counsel (Rechtskonsulent) since 2000 for the City Council.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe Municipal Council (Gemeinderat) holds the legislative power. It is made up of 125 members (Gemeindrat / Gemeinder\u00e4tin), with elections held every four years. The Municipal Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the City Council and the administration. The sessions of the Municipal Council are held in public. Unlike those of the City Council, the members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession but are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Z\u00fcrich allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The legislative body holds its meetings in the town hall (Rathaus), on the right bank of the Limmat opposite to the City Hall (Stadthaus).The last election of the Municipal Council was held on 4 March 2018 for the mandate period of 2018\u20132022. As of May 2018, the Municipal Council consist of 43 members of the Social Democratic Party (SP), 21 The Liberals (FDP), 17 members of the Swiss People's Party (SVP), 16 Green Party (GPS), 14 Green Liberal Party (GLP), 10 Alternative List (AL), and four members of the Evangelical People's Party (EVP), giving the left parties an absolute majority of 69.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the SPS which received 25.6% (-6) of the vote. The next four most popular parties were the GPS (20.9%, +9.7), GLP (15.7%, +6.4), SVP (13.7%, -4.3), the FDP (11.8%, -2.2), the AL (4%, new), and the CVP (3.5%, -0.2). In the federal election, a total of 110,760 voters were cast, and the voter turnout was 47.7%.In the 2015 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the SPS which received 31.6% of the vote. The next four most popular parties were the SVP (18%), the FDP (14%), the GPS (10.7%), the GLP (9.2%). In the federal election, a total of 114,377 voters were cast, and the voter turnout was 46.2%.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\n\n==== Twin towns and sister cities ====\nZ\u00fcrich is partnered with two sister cities: Kunming and San Francisco.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nZ\u00fcrich is situated at 408 m (1,339 ft) above sea level on the lower (northern) end of Lake Z\u00fcrich (Z\u00fcrichsee) about 30 kilometers (19 mi) north of the Alps, nestling between the wooded hills on the west and east side. The Old Town stretches on both sides of the Limmat, which flows from the lake, running northwards at first and then gradually turning into a curve to the west. The geographic (and historic) centre of the city is the Lindenhof, a small natural hill on the west bank of the Limmat, about 700 m (2,300 ft) north of where the river issues from Lake Z\u00fcrich. Today the incorporated city stretches somewhat beyond the natural confines of the hills and includes some districts to the northeast in the Glatt Valley (Glattal) and to the north in the Limmat Valley (Limmattal). The boundaries of the older city are easy to recognize by the Schanzengraben canal. This artificial watercourse has been used for the construction of the third fortress in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe municipality of Z\u00fcrich has an area of 91.88 km2 (35.48 sq mi), of which 4.1 km2 (1.6 sq mi) is made up of Lake Z\u00fcrich. The area includes a section of the northern Swiss Plateau. The banks of the Limmat constitute the densest part of the city. The river is oriented in the southeast\u2013northwest direction, with the flat valley floor having a width of two to two to three kilometres (1.2 to 1.9 miles). The partially channeled and straightened Limmat does not flow in the central part of the valley, but always along its right (northeastern) side. The Sihl meets with the Limmat at the end of Platzspitz, which borders the Swiss National Museum. The Limmat reaches the lowest point of the municipality in Oberengstringen at 392 m (1,286 ft) above sea level.\n\nOn its west side, the Limmat valley is flanked by the wooded heights of the Albis chain, which runs along the western border. The Uetliberg is, with 869 m (2,851 ft) above sea level, the highest elevation of the surrounding area. Its summit can be reached easily by the Uetlibergbahn. From the platform of the observation tower on the summit, an impressive panorama of the city, the lake, and the Alps can be seen.\nThe northeast side of the Limmat valley includes a range of hills, which marks the watershed between the Limmat and the Glatt. From the northwest to the southeast, the height of the mostly wooded knolls generally increases: the Gubrist (615 m or 2,018 ft), the H\u00f6nggerberg (541 m or 1,775 ft), the K\u00e4ferberg (571 m or 1,873 ft), the Z\u00fcrichberg (676 m or 2,218 ft), the Adlisberg (701 m or 2,300 ft) and the \u00d6schbrig (696 m or 2,283 ft). Between the K\u00e4ferberg and the Z\u00fcrichberg is located the saddle of the Milchbuck (about 470 m or 1,540 ft), an important passage from the Limmat valley to the Glatt valley.\nThe northernmost part of the municipality extends to the plain of the Glatt valley and to the saddle which makes the connection between the Glattal and Furttal. Also, a part of the Katzensee (nature reserve) and the B\u00fcsisee, both of which are drained by the Katzenbach to Glatt, belong to the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZ\u00fcrich has, depending on the definition used, an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but in the higher areas it is defined as a humid continental climate (Dfb, using 0 \u00b0C isoterm) with warm summers and four distinct seasons. Decisive for the climate of Z\u00fcrich are both the winds from westerly directions, which often result in precipitation and, on the other hand, the Bise (east or north-east wind), which is usually associated with high-pressure situations, but cooler weather phases with temperatures lower than the average. The Foehn wind, which plays an important role in the northern alpine valleys also has some impact on Z\u00fcrich.The annual mean temperature at the measuring station of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology in Z\u00fcrich-Fluntern (556 m[1,824 ft] above sea level on the slope of the Z\u00fcrichberg, 150 m[490 ft] above the level of the city centre) is 9.3 \u00b0C (48.7 \u00b0F). The lowest monthly mean of daily minimum temperature are measured in January with \u22122.0 \u00b0C (28.4 \u00b0F) and the highest monthly mean of daily maximum temperature are measured in July with 24.0 \u00b0C (75.2 \u00b0F). On average there are 74.9 days in which the minimum temperature is below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) (so-called frost days), and 23.7 days in which the maximum temperature is below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) (so-called ice days). There are on average of 30 so-called summer days (maximum temperature equal to or above 25 \u00b0C [77 \u00b0F]) throughout the year, while so-called heat days (with maximum temperature equal to or above 30 \u00b0C [86 \u00b0F]) are 5.8 days.The average high temperature in July is 24.0 \u00b0C (75.2 \u00b0F) and average low temperature is 14 \u00b0C (57.2 \u00b0F). The highest recorded temperature in Z\u00fcrich was 37.7 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F), recorded on July 1947, and typically the warmest day reaches an average of 32.2 \u00b0C (90.0 \u00b0F).Spring and autumn are generally cool to mild, but sometimes with large differences between warm and cold days even during the same year. The highest temperature of the month March in 2014 was on the 20th at 20.6 \u00b0C (69.1 \u00b0F) during a sunny afternoon and the lowest temperature was on the 25th at \u22120.4 \u00b0C (31.3 \u00b0F) during the night/early morning. Record low of average daily temperatures in March since 1864 is \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F) and record high of average daily temperatures in March is 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). Record low of average daily temperatures in October is \u221216 \u00b0C (3 \u00b0F) and record high of average daily temperatures in October is 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).Z\u00fcrich has an average of 1,544 hours of sunshine per year and shines on 38% of its potential time throughout the year. During the months April until September the sun shines between 150 and 215 hours per month. The 1,134 millimetres (44.6 in) rainfall spread on 133.9 days with precipitation throughout the year. Roughly about every third day you will encounter at least some precipitation, which is very much a Swiss average. During the warmer half of the year and especially during the three summer months, the strength of rainfall is higher than those measured in winter, but the days with precipitation stays about the same throughout the year (in average 9.9\u201312.7 days per month). October has the lowest number (9.9) of days with some precipitation. There is an average of 59.5 so-called bright days (number of days with sunshine duration greater than 80%) through the year, the most in July and August (7.4, 7.7 days), and the least in January and December (2.7, 1.8 days). The average number of days with sunshine duration less than 20%, so-called cloudy days, is 158.4 days, while the most cloudy days are in November (17.8 days), December (21.7 days), and January with 19 days.\n\n\n=== Climate protection ===\nThe city is among the world-leaders in protecting the climate by following a manifold approach. In November 2008 the people of Z\u00fcrich voted in a public referendum to write into law the quantifiable and fixed deadline of one tonne of CO2 per person per annum by 2050. This forces any decision of the executive to support this goal, even if the costs are higher in all dimensions. Some examples are the new disinfection section of the public city hospital in Triemli (Minergie-P quality \u2013 passive house), the continued optimisation and creation of public transportation, enlargement of the bicycle-only network, research and projects for renewable energy and enclosure of speed-ways.\n\n\n=== Urban area ===\nThe areas surrounding the Limmat are almost completely developed with residential, industrial, and commercial zones. The sunny and desirable residential areas in the hills overlooking Z\u00fcrich, Waidberg and Z\u00fcrichberg, and the bottom part of the slope on the western side of the valley on the Uetliberg, are also densely built.\nThe \"green lungs\" of the city include the vast forest areas of Adlisberg, Z\u00fcrichberg, K\u00e4ferberg, H\u00f6nggerberg and Uetliberg. Major parks are also located along the lakeshore (Z\u00fcrichhorn and Enge), while smaller parks dot the city. Larger contiguous agricultural lands are located near Affoltern and Seebach. Of the total area of the municipality of Z\u00fcrich (in 1996, without the lake), 45.4% is residential, industrial and commercial, 15.5% is transportation infrastructure, 26.5% is forest, 11%: is agriculture and 1.2% is water.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nPublic transport is extremely popular in Z\u00fcrich, and its inhabitants use public transport in large numbers. About 70% of the visitors to the city use the tram or bus, and about half of the journeys within the municipality take place on public transport. Within Z\u00fcrich and throughout the canton of Z\u00fcrich, the ZVV network of public transport has traffic density ratings among the highest worldwide. When adding frequency, which in Z\u00fcrich can be as often as seven minutes, it does become the densest across all dimensions. Three means of mass-transit exist: the S-Bahn (local trains), trams, and buses (both diesel and electric, also called trolley buses). In addition, the public transport network includes boats on the lake and river, funicular railways and even the Luftseilbahn Adliswil-Felsenegg (LAF), a cable car between Adliswil and Felsenegg. Tickets purchased for a trip are valid on all means of public transportation (train, tram, bus, boat). The Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (commonly abbreviated to ZSG) operates passenger vessels on the Limmat and the Lake Z\u00fcrich, connecting surrounding towns between Z\u00fcrich and Rapperswil.\n\nZ\u00fcrich is a mixed hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof (Z\u00fcrich HB) is the largest and busiest station in Switzerland and is an important railway hub in Europe. There are between 350,000 and 500,000 commuters daily making use of this central network node \u2013 a significant figure in comparison to Z\u00fcrich's population. With regard to the number of trains daily entering and leaving a single railway station, Z\u00fcrich HB is the world's most frequently served railway station, with nearly 3,000 trains every day. Among the 16 railway stations (and 10 additional train stops) within Z\u00fcrich's city borders, there are five other major passenger railway stations. Three of them belong to the ten most frequented railway stations in Switzerland: Stadelhofen, Oerlikon, Altstetten, Hardbr\u00fccke, and Enge. The railway network is mainly operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS), but Z\u00fcrich is also served by major EuroCity trains from the neighbouring countries and is a destination for both French/Swiss (TGV Lyria) and German (ICE) high-speed trains, as well as by Austrian RailJet.\n\n\n=== Zurich Airport ===\nZurich Airport is located less than 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) northeast of the city in Kloten. Zurich Airport has its own railway station, which is located underground. It is directly connected to Z\u00fcrich and most of the major Swiss cities. Zurich Airport is served by more than 60 passenger airlines from around the world. It is also served by one cargo airline and is a hub for Swiss International Air Lines. There is also an airfield in D\u00fcbendorf.\n\n\n=== Road traffic ===\nThe A1, A3 and A4 motorways pass close to Z\u00fcrich. The A1 heads west towards Bern and Geneva and eastwards towards St. Gallen; the A4 leads northwards to Schaffhausen and southwards to Altdorf connecting with the A2 towards Chiasso; and the A3 heads northwest towards Basel and southeast along Lake Z\u00fcrich and Lake Walen towards Sargans.\n\n\n=== Bicycle transport ===\nIn 2012, the city council launched a program to improve the city's attractiveness for bicycle traffic. The so-called \"Masterplan Velo\" is part of the superordinate framework Stadtverkehr 2025 which shapes the future of the different means of transport. Research revealed that infrastructure and the social environment are essential factors in improving a city's appeal to bicycle traffic. Three main goals are specified: First, the modal share of bicycle traffic should be enhanced to twice the value of 2011 by 2015. Second, cyclists' safety should be improved to lower the overall accident risk. Third, cycling should be established as an everyday means of transport with a special focus on children and young people.\nIn terms of infrastructure, the city aims to build up a network of distinctive bicycle routes in order to achieve these objectives. At a final stage, the network will consist of main routes (Hauptrouten) for everyday use and comfort routes (Komfortrouten), with the latter focussing on leisure cycling. Additional measures such as special Velostationen providing bike related services are expected to help to further improve the quality. One of the key projects of the system is a tunnel beneath the tracks of the main railway station planned to combine a main connection with staffed possibilities where commuters can leave their bikes throughout the day. Apart from infrastructural measures, further approaches are planned in the fields of communication, education and administration.\nHowever, these efforts cause critique, mainly due to postponing. The institution of the bike tunnel at the main railway station, originally planned for 2016, is currently (2016) delayed to at least 2019. Pro Velo, a nationwide interest group, has publicly questioned whether the masterplan already failed. The critique aims at badly governed traffic management at construction sites, missing possibilities to park bikes in the city as well as rather diffident ambitions. In response, the responsible city department points to the big investments made every year and mentions ongoing discussions that would finally lead to even better results.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nThere are 415,367 people living in Z\u00fcrich (as of 31 December 2018), making it Switzerland's largest city. Of registered inhabitants (in 2016), 32% (133,473) do not hold Swiss citizenship. Of these, German citizens make up the largest group with 8% (33,548), followed by Italians 3.5% (14,543). The population of the city including suburbs totals 1.19 million people. The entire metropolitan area (including the cities of Winterthur, Baden, Brugg, Schaffhausen, Frauenfeld, Uster/Wetzikon, Rapperswil-Jona and Zug) has a population of around 1.83 million people.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe official formal language used by: governmental institutions, print, news, schools/universities, courts, theatres and in any kind of written form is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, while the spoken language is Z\u00fcrich German (Z\u00fcrit\u00fc\u00fctsch), one of the several more or less distinguishable, but mutually intelligible Swiss German dialects of Switzerland with roots in the medieval Alemannic German dialect groups. However, because of Z\u00fcrich's national importance, and therefore its existing high fluctuation, one can hear all kinds of Swiss German dialects spoken by its inhabitants and commuters. As of the December 2010 census, 69.3% of the population speaks diglossic Swiss German/Swiss Standard German as their mother-tongue at home. Some 22.7% of inhabitants speak Standard German in their family environment (\"at home\"). Dramatically increasing, according to the last census in 2000, 8.8% now speak English. Italian follows behind at 7.1% of the population then French at 4.5%. Other languages spoken here include: Croatian and Serbian (4.1%), Spanish (3.9%), Portuguese (3.1%) and Albanian (2.3%). (Multiple choices were possible.) Thus 20% of the population speak two or more languages at home.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nBefore the Protestant Reformation reached Z\u00fcrich, it was de jure and de facto Roman Catholic.\nThe Protestant Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli made Z\u00fcrich both a theological centre and a stronghold of Protestantism in Switzerland. Another Swiss city with a comparable status was Geneva, the so-called Protestant Rome, where John Calvin and his Protestant Reformers operated. Z\u00fcrich attracted other influential Protestant Reformers like Heinrich Bullinger. Zwingli translated the Bible (Z\u00fcrich Bible) into the local variety of German and introduced the Reformation by winning support of the magistrates, the princess abbess Katharina von Zimmern and the largely peasant population of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich. The canton unanimously adopted the Reformed tradition as represented by Zwingli. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants tormented the Swiss Confederacy. Zwingli died for political and religious reasons by defending the Canton of Z\u00fcrich in the Battle of Kappel. Bullinger took over his role as the city's spiritual leader.\nIn 1970, about 53% of the population were Swiss Reformed, while almost 40% were Roman Catholic. Since then both large Swiss churches, the Roman Catholic Church and Swiss Reformed Church, have been constantly losing members, though for the Catholic Church the decrease started 20 years later in around 1990. Nevertheless, for the last twenty years both confessions have been reduced by 10% to the current figures (census 2010): 30% Roman Catholic and 26% Swiss Reformed (organized in Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich). In 1970, only 2% of Z\u00fcrich's inhabitants claimed to be not affiliated with any religious confession. In accordance with the loss by the large Swiss churches, the number of people declaring themselves as non-affiliated rose to 17% in the year 2000. In the last ten years, this figure rose to more than 25%. For the group of people, being between 24 and 44 years old, this is as high as one in every third person.5% of Z\u00fcrich's inhabitants are Muslims, a slight decrease of 1% compared to the year 2000. The Mahmood Mosque Z\u00fcrich, situated in Forchstrasse is the first mosque built in Switzerland.The population of Jewish ethnicity and religion has been more or less constant since 1970 at about 1%. The Synagoge Z\u00fcrich L\u00f6wenstrasse is the oldest and largest synagogue of Z\u00fcrich.Nearly one tenth of the city's population are members of non-state-recognized Christian denominations (for example the Eastern Orthodox Church).More than 2% of Z\u00fcrich's population account for non-monotheistic religions (such as Buddhism or Hinduism).\n\n\n=== Social ===\nThe level of unemployment in Z\u00fcrich was 3.2% in July 2012. In 2008, the average monthly income was about CHF 7000 before any deductions for social insurances and taxes. In 2010, there were 12,994 cases (on average per month) of direct or indirect welfare payments from the state.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nMost of Z\u00fcrich's sites are located within the area on either side of the Limmat, between the Main railway station and Lake Z\u00fcrich. The churches and houses of the old town are clustered here, as are the most expensive shops along the famous Bahnhofstrasse. The Lindenhof in the old town is the historical site of the Roman castle, and the later Carolingian Imperial Palace.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nGrossm\u00fcnster (Great Minster) According to legend, Charlemagne discovered the graves of the city's martyrs Felix and Regula and had built the first church as a monastery; start of current building around 1100; in the first half of the 16th century, the Great Minster was the starting point of the Swiss-German Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger; declared by Charlemagne imperial church; romanesque crypt, romanesque capitals in the church and cloister; choir windows by Augusto Giacometti (1932) and Sigmar Polke (2009), bronze doors by Otto M\u00fcnch (1935 and 1950).\nFraum\u00fcnster (Women's Minster) Church of a former abbey for aristocratical women from southern Germany which was founded in 853 by Louis the German for his daughter Hildegard; first church built before 874; the romanesque choir dates from 1250\u201370; the church enjoyed the patronage of kings and had the right of coinage from Z\u00fcrich to the 13th century; after the Reformation, church and convent passed into the possession of the city; the most important jewelry \u2013 in addition to the largest organ in the canton with its 5,793 pipes and 92 stops \u2013 are color windows: the window in the north transept of Augusto Giacometti (1945), the five-part cycle in the choir (1970) and the rosette in the southern transept (1978) are by Marc Chagall; also the church of Z\u00fcrich's largest choir with 100 and more singers.\nSt. Peter romanesque-gothic-baroque church built on remains of former churches from before the 9th century; with the largest church clock face in Europe built 1538; baptismal font of 1598, baroque stucco; individual stalls from the 15th century from city repealed monasteries with rich carvings and armrests; Kanzellettner (increased barrier between the nave and choir with built-pulpit) of 1705 pulpit sounding board about 1790; rich Akanthus embellishment with Bible verse above the pulpit; 1971 new crystal chandelier modeled according 1710 design; organ in 1974 with 53 stops; Bells: five from 1880, the largest, A minor, without clapper weighs about 6,000 kg (13,228 lb); fire guard in the tower to the Middle Ages to 1911.\nPredigerkirche is one of the four main churches of the old town, first built in 1231 AD as a Romanesque church of the then Dominican Predigerkloster nearby the Neumarkt.

Later in 1890, the theatre was re-built as an ornate building with a neo-classical architecture. The portico is made of white and grey stone ornamented with the busts of Wagner, Weber and Mozart. Later, busts of Schiller, Shakespeare and Goethe were also added. The auditorium is designed in the rococo style. Once a year, it hosts the Z\u00fcrcher Opernball with the President of the Swiss Confederation and the economic and cultural \u00e9lite of Switzerland. The Ballet Z\u00fcrich performs at the opera house.\nThe Schauspielhaus Z\u00fcrich is the main theatre complex of the city. It has two d\u00e9pendances: Pfauen in the Central City District and Schiffbauhalle, an old industrial hall, in Z\u00fcrich West. The Schauspielhaus was home to emigrants such as Bertolt Brecht or Thomas Mann, and saw premieres of works of Max Frisch, Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt, Botho Strauss or Elfriede Jelinek. The Schauspielhaus is one of the most prominent and important theatres in the German-speaking world.The Theater am Neumarkt is one of the oldest theatres of the city. Established by the old guilds in the Old City District, it is located in a baroque palace near Niederdorf Street. It has two stages staging mostly avantgarde works by European directors.\nThe Z\u00fcrcher Theater Spektakel is an international theatre festival, ranking among the most important European festivals for contemporary performing arts.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nThe traditional cuisine of Z\u00fcrich consists of traditional fare, reflecting the centuries of rule by patrician burghers as well as the lasting imprint of Huldrych Zwingli's puritanism.

There are authentic amusements: bars, punk clubs, hip hop stages, caribbean restaurants, arthouse cinemas, Turkish kebabs and Italian espresso-bars, but also sex shops or the famous red-light district of Z\u00fcrich.\nIn the past ten years new parts of the city have risen into the spotlight.

In Z\u00fcrich it is represented by the ZSC Lions. The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) officiating as head organisation for ice hockey leagues worldwide is based in Z\u00fcrich as well.\nCycling is a popular sport as well as a mean of transport in Z\u00fcrich. Cycling routes are generally marked with red and white signs and the yellow lanes are exclusively meant for cyclists. Also hiking trails are well marked with yellow signs, which give the hiker the probable time it will take them to reach their destination. There are specific maps available for hiking and walking trails throughout Switzerland. Some of the most accessible walks in the Z\u00fcrich area are the Uetliberg and the Z\u00fcrichberg. The Offene Rennbahn otherwise known as the Oerlikon Velodrome deserves a special visit on any Tuesday evening in the summer, for cyclists there are chances to see time trial champions or local Swiss national cyclists challenging other amateurs in a variety of races including Madison or Keirin events.\nAs many as 30 clubs and 7 indoor curling facilities can be found in the greater Z\u00fcrich area. The curling season starts in early September and continues until the end of April.\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nWeltklasse Z\u00fcrich, sometimes referred to as the one-day Olympics, is a prestigious one-day athletics meet held annually at the Letzigrund Stadium.

The race is held on 1 January each year and the start takes place at midnight exactly.\nZ\u00fcrich was one of six venues of the 1954 FIFA World Cup and one of eight venues of the UEFA Euro 2008. The Euro 2008 games were held in the Letzigrund Stadium. Work on the new Letzigrund was completed in exceptionally quick time and the stadium opened in August 2007 just one year after the demolition of the old arena.Z\u00fcrich hosted the UCI Track Cycling World Championships six times at the Oerlikon Velodrome. The first time was in 1929 and the last time in 1983.\nSince 2013, the international Openair Literatur Festival Z\u00fcrich takes place annually in Zurich, presented by Literaturhaus Z\u00fcrich and Kaufleuten.\nZ\u00fcrich also hosted the 1998 World Ice Hockey Championships.

          "My kids loved every moment, we have seen animals we didn't know exist ,we have to come back here when kids are bigger",
          "It was cold and wet and still we had such a great afternoon visiting the zoo. I\u2019m always worried about zoos and keeping animals in captivity but here they really look after them and the enclosures are excellent and massive! They care about animal conservation and there are lots",
          "It\u2019s purely for family visiting but not for friends gathering there. Variety of animals except there were no giraffes.",
          "Two Swiss friends and I visited Zurich Zoo. It was interesting how it was laid out using the surrounding woodland, sectioned off for the different animals habits. There is a rain forest and an elephant enclosure, both well worth a visit. Plenty of eating places, we enjoyed",
          "A really good zoo, lots of animals to see. We really enjoyed the elephant swimming, their enclosure is amazing. The zoo has great theming, a lovely cafe and plenty of seating areas.",
          "The Zurich zoo is a very large and laid out well. We went primarily to visit the rain forest area as a culminating activity to a unit of study. Short of visiting an actual rain forest, Zurich does a great job of simulating the flora and fauna. We spent a good deal of time",
          "Have a great day at the zoo, the kids enjoyed it, and so did we. a large selection of animals from all continents. Which is unusual for a zoo in Europe. There is also a children's party, a playground. We spent the whole family almost all day at the zoo. It was great",
          "This GeoZoo is really worth to visit especially in winter time. There are lots of animals from all around the world which are worth to visit. Construction of real place of living and its nice decoration for different species of the animals is exiting and being concerned about",
          "I really like the Zoo Zurich it has a nice and not too big selection of animals including some very lovely koalas. Most of the enclosure seems spacious to me and my impression is that animals are in good condition as well. Every now and then they have volunteers explaining",

          "Very much enjoyed Zoo Zurich! It was quite larger than expected but the habitats were natural and well kept. Facilities were plenty although food is pricey. Bus from the city centre was super easy and just a short walk from the stop. A wonderful way to spend a nice day,",
          "Loved it, very immersive, you can observe some freely roaming animals walking around you. Cafe food was yummy. It\u2019s a combined botanical garden and zoo. Highly recommended.",
          "What an amazing couple of hours we spent here! There are so many enclosures to see and it is a great day for all. Even my teenager had a good time, a quick tram journey too (tram #6 ) from Zurich central",
          "We are not \"Zoo People,\" have mixed feelings about animals in captivity; but we had an extra day in Zurich and we were done exploring downtown. So we took the tram up to the Zoo. The zoo is a very nice surprise. Large enclosure but still could see the animals. Walk through",
          "Loved this zoo. It was clean and you could really tell the animals were cared for. The lay out was good and easy to navigate which is something not all zoos have. The food was really good but slightly expensive. Seating at the restaurant was difficult because it was cold and",
          "I do not know about you, but there are times when I need to get some time alone and find peace and tranquility. The Zurich Zoo has carried me through some very tough times, and even though I full-heartedly support watching all those magnificent animals in the wild, many people",
          "We only had one day to do any sightseeing in Zurich and my wife really wanted to see the penguins. They do indeed have penguins and I think it was worth going just for that. We spent a couple hours wandering the other exhibits. The elephant dome was pretty interesting, and we",
          "I've been to quite a few zoos around the world. The San Diego zoo was quite impressive. But I must say, the Zurich Zoo is a gem of a place. I never would have thought to go to the Zoo in Zurich. But ladies and gentlemen...boys and girls... it is a year-round treat. The gorilla",
          "Went to Zurich zoo for the afternoon, plenty of animals to see , very clean and well organized. Zurich zoo app is perfect help about direction and information .",
          "My husband and I went while in Zurich and it was fantastic! The exhibits really let you up close with the animals and designed so well. The lunch in the cafeteria was very good! They had a large cafeteria with salad bar, grill, plenty of options. Dining hall overlooked the",
          "A nice zoo with plenty to see. You could definitely spend all day here. Would be nice to go back when the Sahara part is open in 2020. It is very big so lots of walking but that didn\u2019t bother us.",
          "Every ZOO where there are penguins is great, here you can visit also a large tropical greenhouse. A beautiful way how to spend a Sunday afternoon :-)",
          "The Zoo is Zurich's most popular attraction, especially with children. It is one of the largest and best kept facility in Europe, and it is easily accessible by car and/or tram. Highlights are: - the Masoala Hall, a huge greenhouse enclosing a Madagascar jungle complete with",

          "Taking the tram no. 6 from main station to the Zoo is a breeze. Signage inside the Zoo are clear and will guide you to all the different species. At the same time, is very educational too in terms of conservation and how to cut wastage etc only if you know the language. Do",
          "We decided to visit the zoo because we love zoos and because a number of locals (including hotel staffers) had told us that it was great. We went with no particular expectations, but quickly discovered that this is truly a wonderful zoo. Much like the Zoo and Safari",
          "we love it but we had rainy weather but so.nice nice place to visit , clean organised interested. Next time we wish to come on summer",

          "I not a big fan of zoos, but we decided to pay the Zoo of Z\u00fcrich a visit. And it was really great. The zoo is pretty big, because the animal pens are big, which I think is great. The variety of animals present is also impressive. We were unluky to be there on a rainy and cold",
          "Small zoo with some tidy spaces and enclosures. Animals well kept and in good condition. Well worth the money and easy to get to using tram 6 from the main station. Food in the restaurant was excellent quality and not too expensive for the area.",

          "We are not often thinking to visit the zoo although we live close to it. But if we are there we are always excited about the nice trails, interesting animal houses, for example the elephant or monkey house and the incredible hall with a Madagaskar rain forrest. This is a must if",
          "That was a great experience expect for some animals hiding and I could not see them in their cage...",
          "Highlights of the zoo are the elephants (especially watching them feed up close behind the glass windows) the gorillas, one male and two female lions, a tiger. Spent a lot of time seeing the different species of monkeys. Good playground for kids. Pretty good selection of",
          "In the recent years many changes have been made to enlarge the spaces for the animals and finding them might be tricky. I love to stroll through the zoo with the camera in order to shoot some good pictures or just observe the different animals (and people looking at them).",

          "Most of the exhibits here were good but a lot of the animals were away/not on show and I did feel sorry for a couple of the animals as they seemed to not have much room or freedom in their enclosure.",
          "Large enclosures for the animals, beautiful expansive grounds with so much to cover that you need a few days to see everything, the Zurich Zoo is a fabulous destination. Always a pleasure to visit with the kids.",
          "My wife and I are \"zoo tragics\" having visited hundreds of zoos in many countries. Zurich zoo is up there with the best we have experienced. A wide range of species, in well maintained natural enclosures. We spent 6 hours and still didn't see everything, especially the",
          "We were in Switzerland for our honeymoon and decided to check out the zoo as we love going to zoos back home in the US. We spent about 3 hours in the zoo and saw everything. This zoo is large and the atmosphere is very natural. We loved the large, natural look to the exhibits.",

          "Zurich zoo is one of the best zoo I have seen till date, it is very well maintained and my 5 year old daughter had good time seeing the Lion, Tiger, Elephant and the green house, she was super excited in the shop and the merchandise was of wide variety",
          "Well worth a visit with lots of animals to see ! The Elephants and penguins are a highlight and my daughter was also blown away by the sea otters. But one of the biggest standouts was the food in the restaurant just up from the main entrance- it was fantastic I wish that",
          "I love this Zoo and I was very happy to be able to take my 3yr old to it. The zoo is quite amazing and there are some of the animals I can't believe are housed here. They have Kola Bears and a great prime mate area. The Most amazing was this incredible indoor rain forest that is",
          "The zoo is so huge like you really would need a map and they had a lot of different species. It\u2019s family and children friendly i would recommend to pack your own food because they don\u2019t have to much choices and everything there is expensive.",
          "The zoo is no longer only the sad place where you can visit animals in a cage. Most of the animals are in a large habitat and there is information for kids of all ages. It makes for a memorable experience for the children and they usually cannot stop talking about it until the",
          "This is a great place to visit. The open spaces, layout, and exhibits are really well done. Plus, peacocks stroll the grounds. If you are looking for an activity that the whole family can enjoy - this is it.",
          "I like zoos and think they have an important role in conservation. This zoo is the best one I have been to and we agreed as a family. The elephant enclosure was magnificent. Next year there will be an African Savannah feature and we'd come back to Z\u00fcrich just for that.",

          "This is the most diverse zoo I have been to. I spent 4 hours there, and still regret that I came too late. I saw sea animals, wild animals, from lots of places all over the world. The most impressive one was the botanic garden. Just a small comment: I don't think this place is",
          "My daughter and me have been there during the Easter holiday. We broked the tickets online and with this were able to skip the regular line to save time. The Zoo is on a hill so this was hiding the overall picture of the park. It is much bigger than it appears from the",
          "This is a great zoo regardless of time of year! In the winter at 1:30pm they have a penguin parade, where the penguins march through the visitors outside of their enclosure. The rainforest is also a great place to visit in the winter. Summer is beautiful in Zurich and there are",
          "the Zurich zoo is one of the most animal friendly zoos I ever visited. and they are permanently enlarging areas to get a better habitat for the animals. the Masoala hall is a must! a precious jungle with chameleons etc. in a huge glass house, and you can wonder around freely.",

          "We\u2019ve been to zoos in many countries across Asia, Europe and the US but the Zurich Zoo (after 2 visits) still stands out.

          "I am not a big fan of zoos. But the Zurich Zoo really has something for everyone. If you like animals, there is a very impressive elephant exhibit. But if the thought of animals in captivity bothers you, there is an absolutely stunning, magnificent arboretum of tropic plants",
          "This is a place for families. The animals are well kept even if the penguins parade was a bit sad to watch. They were not happy at all",
          "I loved this zoo! It was beautiful! It sits on top of a hill with great views of the city. It was nice to interact closely with some of the animals. You can bring your own drinks/food. Get your tickets online to avoid the madness on a Sunday.",
          "I\u2019m not such a big fan of animals behind fences not in their own habitat. I must say that this zoo surprised me. It was very wide spread so you got the feeling that the animals had a good amount of space in there area. I liked what they have done for the elephants. They are",
          "Decided to visit the zoo on sunday, a day before easter monday. We got there 10mins before 10am hoping to make it to animal feeding. Spent time waiting in line to pay for parking and hence missed elephant swim at 10-10:15am. However, there were other events from 10:15-10:45. It",

          "The zoo was an extremely fun experience and had great variety of animals. Personally, the best part was getting to see the llamas which were very adorable. Be sure to not miss the llamas and give them a pet. The llamas were very receptive to humans and would willingly put",

          "The best zoo I have ever been to, totally recomend if visiting zurich. The animals are happy and the fences are very limited, some are even open spaces you can go in. Get there on the bus 6, it leaves you outside the zoo. Best planned for a sunny day and definitely invest a",
          "If I lived there, I think I'd buy a yearly pass to this place. Considering Switzerland is such an expensive country, this attraction is such a reasonable price and good value for money. Even Canadian museums cost this much and aren't nearly as good. The penguins greeted me",

          "We visited as a family with young adults. We enjoyed getting very close to several animals. We spent 4 hours and still didn\u2019t see it all. We liked the \u201chuman geography\u201d component with the furnished huts nestled in among the animals that we could peek inside.",

          "Zoo is located 20 min from central station. It's located on the hill, so you can expect to walk a lot up to the hill and down, what is not easy with small kids. There're a lot of nice animals, like elephants, lions, tigers and so on. Additionally I recommend to visit terrarium.",
          "For me Zurich Zoo was ok. I think it was because there were too many people and the weather was too much hot. The animals like Lion and Tiger didn't showed up because the weather was hot and there was too much noise in the Zoo. Anyway if you are in Zurich. You will have a good",
          "I visited the Zoos of London, Berlin, Vienna, New York. But the Zoo of Zurich certainly doesn't have to fear comparison. Most Animals have modern zoo enclosures, especially the elephants. The Masoala Hall, a rain forest environment, is very beautiful (and hot [35 \u00b0C]).",

          "I love zoos and this one is great! The natural environment is fantastic and the animals are given plenty of space to move about or hide from annoying humans if they choose to -and this is what they did the sunny but cold day when we visited ! We were rewarded with the",
          "I was expected more , many animals are not their but they are working. Information signs are not descriptive . I got confused to reach some animals. Price is high if compared to what you got",
          "One of better options for kids in Zurich. Although the animals are kept in captive but the habitants built there are nice and very close to their actual ones.",
          "We had heard that Zurich Zoo is excellent, and it definitely is. Especially good for younger kids, but adults will like it as well. Tropical jungle area and elephants area especially good.",
          "Looked through the details on the website and while it seemed reasonable, the actual zoo was so much better. The elephant enclosure is amazing and the exotic animal house is great. Used the tram to get here, but there was plenty of parking when we arrived.",
          "This zoo is no ordinary zoo, they have the most beautiful habitats for the animals. Normally I don't like to see animals held captive but this zoo really takes loving care of the creatures. It was an amazing experience.",
          "a real great variety of animals in the zoo. kids having fun and the animals are happy. perfect day trip with kids.",
          "I have been to the zoo about 5 times, and it is always a treat..spring, summer and fall, I have not been there in winte",
          "We covered the whole museum in 2 hours. It was not big but had variety of animals like lion, elephant, tiger, owls, gorilla, monkeys and some more. It looked like there is some expansion in process to increase the size to bring in more animals. Kids liked it.",
          "The zoo had a large range of wildlife. The highlight without a doubt are the 4 elephants with the baby elephant running around happy. There are many more amazing animals. The only negative aspect i noticed was that the descriptions were only in German and no English but that's",
          "We are glad we included a visit to the zoo in our 2 days in Zurich. The Gorilla exhibit, camels , snow leopards are some of the animals not seen at the Singapore Zoo. It was a snowy day on our visit, and it seems so surreal to see the animals ( snow owl, snow leopard, king",
          "On the day when we visited the Zoo was snowing alot so was a little restricted what to see. Still made the visit OK and enjoyable. Well equipped and nice to see animals which have decent space to roam around.",
          "We went to the zoo on a beautiful sunny day and had a great time. Beautiful surroundings and animals.",
          "The zoo is nice but pricey! I feel bad for the animals because their space is not large enough for them, however it does make them easier to view. I really enjoyed the penguins because they just stand there as if they want to be seen, so you get plenty of good photos with them.",
          "Made sure to stop and visit the Zoo. Was very nice, lots of walking, but able to get up close and see the animals really well. Gift shop and cafe very good too.",
          "In the past couple of years they invested a lot in renovating or building new which makes the Zoo much more attractive .. and they are not finished yet. It as perfect place for a day with kids (and adults) ..",
          "My kids (2 and 8 y.o.) had a great time in various zoo departments, although it was quite cold. You can take your own snacks as well as buy them on the spot.",
          "We were a little worried about visiting in such cold weather as thought a lot of the animals would be hiding away in the warm. This was true for some but the zoo is set up that you can get the most of it in the cold too. We had a Zurich card so we got there on the tram and got",
          "My 19 year old daughter and I visited Zurich Zoo and had a great time. Fantastic range of species. Our favourite ones were the large penguins, elephants and flamingos. As a lady with disabilities I was pleasantly surprised by a reduced rate entry ticket and helpful staff member",
          "We were in Zurich Zoo in February 2017. The Zoo is very poor: there are no many interesting animals. I was in lot of Zoo in Europe, but this Zoo is worst I've ever seen.",
          "A great day out at the zoo! Very well kept. There was an area like a big tent with lemurs swinging around you. Was lovely to be so close to them!",
          "A very well organized and easy to access zoo with plenty of nicely presented animal. It is nice even in wintertime if there is some sunshine. Do not miss the Elefanr park - it is worth to see the building itself - and the Masoala - a piece of tropical forest.",
          "Wonderful day spent a the zoo. But the daily penguin walk made our day. There were about 12 Kings all out strutting thier stuff.",
          "We live in Zurich, so we have been to the Zoo many times with the kids, but we even go now without the kids. The Swiss being Swiss, the zoo is very nicely kept and held to the highest standards both for the animals and the visitors. They have many departments, but for us, the",
          "We needed 6,5 hours to see everything, including entertainments for children (slides, tarzan, ice-cream:)). We liked, that almost all animals are not inside the cages! And there is a Panda!!) but red..) but we never saw him before)) and veery big tortoise, lion and two lioness,",
          "We got to see the Zurich Zoo during our short trip to Switzerland and it\u2019s worth the visit. Kids loved especially the Thai elephants and of course much more. Spare half a day, you will not be disappointed.",
          "Not only have many of the animals and their environments been studied here by some of the most renowned scientists, but some of the environments like the Masoala Hall are absolutely unique and give one an impression of places we are most likely never to visit. Great, animal",
          "This zoo is located on a hill and easily reachable by public transport. It has a lot of visitors, even on days with not so good weather. The two best items are the Masoala tropical hall and the Elephant House. Make sure to walk the entire Masoala Hall - at the end you come to a",
          "So many animals in their almost original habitat. Great for familys, good walking ways, also for wheelchairs.",
          "We spent a leisurely Sunday morning at the Zoo Zurich and it was quite enjoyable. Because it was morning some of the animals were not quite ready to start their day but we still were able to see what we wanted to see. Some of the indoor exhibits can make it challenging to get",
          "Me, my wife and my little baby (1 year old) enjoyed everyplace in this zoo. The aquarium at the beginning of the zoo was our favorite. The zoo has lots of information about each animal/ species. If you have children, you must not miss this place.",
          "This must be the best zoo in the world. All the animals look so well and well cared for. Even the goats didn't smell. We saw the elephants swim through the glass window which gives onto their pool, that is well worth the visit alone. So many animals to see, what an incredibly",
          "I was involved in a research work during the construction phase and have see how the work was done. It was amazing to see what they were for a new house for Elephants!",
          "its a very relaxing visit. at first i was a bit apprehensive as we were just me and my wife , no small kids with us, but it s a pleasant excursion. there are construction works going on - it seems they are building something huge for giraffes . the amazon forest was",
          "The zoo is very nice and wonderful for children. Nothing outstanding, however, there are two large projects under construction which in my opinion will take this from average to very good.",
          "We love Zoo and we check Zoo in every country/city we visit on vacations. There are a lot of different animals, attractions (trains, quizzes, playgrounds for children) and places where you can sit down and rest. Various kinds of food provided, including vegetarian.",
          "I don't reall approve of zoos, but as they go, this is one of the best, impeccably clean and attractive, with well-kept animals. A really nice day out, with or without kids!",
          "This zoo provided a very full day of entertainment for us during a weekend stay in Zurich. The elephant house was amazing and the enclosure for the bears was also spectacular in it's expanse and natural feel. These are some of the best conditions and environments I've see at a",
          "Zurich Zoo is a good place to visit esp if you have kids with you as they and you can experience the real time animals, birds, fish aquarium, etc...There is so much to do and see in the Zoo that you can spend hours. You have a mini train which can take you around a part of the",
          "The Zurich Zoo is a very nice place to go if you find at least three hours of time for a visit! The Masoala rainforest hall and the brandnew elephant place are absolutely amazing. Beside these two highlights you find tons of other animals, great decoration and many wonderful",
          "Great attractions with rain forest setup,... variety of wildlife,.. elephant show,... Lots of birds and creatures,... No discount with Swiss pass, but never mind...",
          "This zoo is very close up and personal. Like with any zoo there is some interactive pieces and demonstrations which are all in German. The food is heavily priced as is the drinks- so if you can bring your own lunch/ snacks. Lack of personnel around to stop children and adults",
          "A great place to spend a day with the family. There are so many things to see and do. A day is not enough to see everything that the Z\u00fcrich Zoo has. Really a place to come back again and again.",
          "Nice attractions. Great variety of wildlife. There is an indoor and outdoor elephant exhibit. Lots of birds and creatures running free in the rain forest exhibit. Several areas are under remodeling and construction. It drizzled the day we were there. Purchase an umbrella",
          "We spent about half a day viewing the animals at this delightful zoo. The displays were well done and they house a large collection of animals. In general, the terrain is a bit hilly. We ate lunch in the Zoo Cafe just outside of the main entrance which was a pleasant oasis of",
          "This zoo is beautiful, especially when you come with young children. So many animals, beautiful sights!",
          "worth to visit and I think it is a must do for families with children. Animals are healthy and feel like they are free. there is no cage and each animal has enough space.",
          "I've only been to San Diego Zoo, LA Zoo and this one. This one is definitely my favorite. You can get so close to the animals, and some even wander the grounds. We had a great time, definitely worth the visit.",
          "To be honest I'm not a zoo fan and therefore very critical while visiting one. But Zurich zio is really nice it is clean and mostly seems that animals are feeling comfortable. Really fantastic is the masola hall! Only thing I didn't like was the ape house really small and ild",
          "I've been going to the Zoo Zurich for about 20 years, and I'm always happy to go back. One of my favourite things about this zoo, is that over the years you can see them constantly making improvements to animal husbandry and the whole zoo experience for the visitors. The zoo",
          "I visit the zoo with my two kids who really have nice time in the zoo and be very close to the animals. My kids was surprised to see the elephant so close and see other animals like the spiders, birds, snakes and monkeys Wonderful place to visit and I recommend to all ages",
          "You think that you can visit a zoo almost everywhere. And, yes, you probably can. But 'vive la difference' at the zoo in Zurich. Zurich's zoo offers its inhabitants a characteristic life as closely as possible. It's wonderful to be able to watch elephants, penguins, monkeys,",
          "The zoo in z\u00fcrich is full of surprises! You are very close to the animals!! The Masoala Hall is amazing!! You feel as in the jungle really! The new elephant place is beautiful! Can eat at restaurant altes kl\u00f6sterli!!",
          "Zurich Zoo is a beautiful zoo, it has many outdoor and indoor enclosures and easy to navigate by foot. I particularly wanted to visit the elephant park in the zoo because I love elephants and I was not disappointed. The enclosure is big and you can see the elephants inside and",
          "Fantastic zoo in Zurich with a lot of different animals. Got there right as it opened and it wasn't very packed and was able to get around pretty easy. Would recommend this zoo to anyone traveling and needs a couple hour break. Food was good inside the zoo as well. Only downside",
          "We went to zurich zoo last night and were unfortunately disappointed. I felt sorry for many of the animals as I don't think they had enough space. There were many animals people keep in or around farms in nicer environments (llamas, alpacas, deer). It would be nice if the zoo",
          "We took the tram to the top of Uetliberg (as everything in Zurich, not cheap!) and then hiked for about three hours to Albispass. The trail is very well marked and maintained with small restaurants on the way. The views of the lake, the city, and the Alps were fantastic! From",
          "We visited in Aug 2017 on a beautiful sunny day. Easy tram no. 6 from Zurich main train station then at the zoo tram stop you walk slightly uphill for 5 mins to the zoo. The day all if a sudden turned into thunder and lightening and torrential rain and we got soaked as not",
          "Always a pleasure for citizens and a must for every tourist. Sometimes a little longer line to get in but always worth it. The Animals always have enough space and get everything they need. The Zoo is diversified with a lot of different areas and animals. Its kind of separated",
          "If you are visiting Zurich this is a must. This zoo is increbible, with enclosures that keep the animal and animal's wellbeing in mind. The elephant enclosure is amazing, with a pool and lower viewing windows for when they swim. The marine reef tanks are huge and spectacular",
          "The zoo is rather small but worth visiting, especially the moneys there. The price is like in the USA, around 26 franks.",
          "We visited the Z\u00fcrich zoo last week and had a good time\u2026 not a great time. The zoo was very accessible via Tram, so we were able to easily get to the zoo and back for a reasonable price. The zoo itself is quite large and hilly... Great for those who want the exercise but it may",
          "... Life in a zoo jungle ... ... let yourself be inspired by the atmosphere, convinced by the many options of attractions and impressed by the very wide range offered  ... one doesn't get out of the amazement! ... fish feeding time is the best way to encounter the wonders of",

          "Unfortunately I agree with most of the 'terrible' reviews and am so surprised this concrete, overpacked, expensive zoo scores so well! Parents, grandparents and all children were totally underwhelmed and disappointed with today's expensive and tiring excursion- just read a few",
          "With little kids along, visiting any zoo is usually fun for us. We had a good time today at the Zurich zoo. We recommend it to any family with small kids. Don't have high expectations, as it is expected some animals would be hiding and you won't get to see them. Overall, this",
          "You need a lot of time to see everything in this zoo. It feels like the focus really is on the animals and they are constantly making a better living for the different animals. Different species that belongs together (in real life) are sharing spaces. The Masoala rain forest is",
          "We really looked forward to visit this place, purchased online tickets many month in advance but what a disappointment this place turned out to be! fist off, none of their animal description is provided in english! the staff working when asked about it acts aloof about it this",
          "We love the Zoo Zurich! Especially with kids it is a really nice place to walk around and spend half a day watching all kind of animals. If you want to save some money bring your own food, because there are a lot of picnic places to sit and eat. Also do not miss the Masoala",
          "What an amazing spot to spend a day in Zurich! We recently visited with three children, ages 14 months, 3 1/2, and 5 1/2. Each child found something different to thoroughly enjoy. The oldest was enchanted with the huge pigs and the Bat Pavilion. The three year old was mesmerized",
          "It's a big ZOO, with many animals. I strongly recommend making a visit on a rainy day or a day in the week. On holidays and weekends there are really many many people there, the animals are mostly hiding and frustrated from the crowd. It's ironic, because the crowd mostly",
          "Really a great place to hang in the weekends... perfect with children. And a lot of animals to see. Prices are high... as it doesn't surprise me for Zurich... Really nice new area with the elephants...",
          "I've been to many zoos around the world and I was excited to visit what is reputed to be top ten. Unfortunately ths zoo misses the mark in the way the animals are kept and treated. The zoo is extremely large and has more than enough space but the cages are small. They seem to be",
          "It is always very nice to go to zoo and especially to the zoo in the z\u00fcrich. Afterword you know that it was the right decision.",
          "The zoo is a wonderful place to visit! Especially the elephant and the rainforest house are spectacular. You easily can spent three hours in the zoo without seeing everything! Come and see yourself:)",
          "A good value day out. Plenty to see, large enclosures and very well kept. There is enough for a full days young kids entertainment. We took our own food as we heard food was expensive in the zoo, and so it was. Take Tram 5 which stops vitually outside the entrance. Get the kids",
          "Just like any other zoo there is plenty to see and do, souvenir is fantastic. There is a caf\u00e9 on site too.",
          "It was recommended to us by some friends to visit the zoo. We went in the afternoon and spent about 4-5 hours there. It was fairly hot, but low humidity. Be ready to walk! A train is offered to take you around if you want to walk less. We just decided to get some exercise. There",
          "This is a lovely zoo, but very honestly I prefer the Basel zoo. Zurich zoo has many animals and a nice restaraunt and play area for kids with a lovely theme that makes them feel like ants among huge blades of grass!!",
          "We have visited many zoo's in Europe, Asia and America and this was by far the best one! The place is located on a mountain with a view to the Zurichsee. The park is huge and it seems that the animals have enough space to move around. Many of them got even to move free in the",
          "I was there on Sunday with family its a nice place for family trip i enjoy my sunday with family in zoo childern was happy have to do much there",
          "The zoo is easy to get to by tram. Tickets for the tram are purchased from a machine at the stop and can be read in english. The zoo is very spread out and quite hilly. Some enclosures were uninhabited and some under construction. Complimentary transport would be ideal from",
          "Went with my son, mainly to see the snow leopards. Was happy to see them & understand the work the zoo does in general",
          "I go several times a year to this Zoo. it is really well done and animals are treated superwell. If you travel with children: do it! there are plenty of playgrounds for them. Food in Restaurants are always very delicius. do not Forget to check times, when the animal are feeded,",
          "It was nice but we thought it was way to expensive for what we saw. We didnt see all the animals tho the weather was really nice. We like the Basel Zoo more.",

          "We visited the zoo on a trip to Z\u00fcrich and loved it. There were a range of animals around including Lions and a Red Panda as well as Penguins and a range of different fish. There were some places to buy snacks around the zoo as well as a really nice restaurant. There were",
          "Its an enormous spaced zoo. Pros: 1. New animals to see (Reason being: I hail from the mystic lands of India) 2. They have Master Shifu.... 3. Well within the city limits 4. Exceptional maintenance 5. Few birds were not in any confinement, in natural habitat. Cons: 1. Few",
          "the Z\u00fcrich zoo is one highlight you can do with your family and visit even if the weather is not on best conditions.. there is lots to see and a fun day.. even a recomondation if you want to do a trip as couple..",

          "So, Zoo is non traditional - animals are not looks like prisoners in cages, they are on the freedom :) Use a tram 6 to get there. Take care about your time - you need 3 to 6 hours to spend there. Remember that Zurich Zoo doesn't included in SwissPass. Just in case.",
          "I've been to many good zoos (The Bronx Zoo, San Diego Zoo, Smithsonian Zoo, the Zoo in Vienna). I found the Zurich Zoo a wonderful experience. Most animals are in areas without fences of cages due to the ingenious use of natural and electronic barriers. The settings have a much",
          "It is just always wonderful to visit the Zoo. Also if it is raining since there are indoor areas. Rain jacket to get from one indoor area to the other is recommended.",
          "I come here reguraly. Great for Familys with small children or the bigger childern among us. The zoo has great places for the animals but my personal favorite is the greenhouse where the fruiteating bats, Lemuren ( species of monkeys) and different types of lizards, ducks and",
          "If you like zoos, you will love this one. The layout and views of the animals are great. Many of the enclosures allow you to see the animals without glass and from many different angles. The tortoise exhibit was one of our favorites interestingly. There are about 7 different",
          "One of the best zoo's I have visited. Great selection of animals. Family friendly Beware the Site is hilly but this adds to the interest in not knowing which animals were round the next corner. Enclosures for animals well thought out, providing sun and shade to animals but also",
          "We took our family which consisted of two small children to the zoo. Everyone loved it! The zoo was very clean and family friendly.",
          "Zoo was big and spacious with special zones like the Masoala tropical rainforest dome, elephant park, mongolian steppe, zoolino, etc. Lots of animals to see, but some were probably in hiding from the sun and heat. It's clear that much planning and thought have gone into the",
          "Zoo is amazing. one of the best, richest zoos i ever visited in my life. When i'm saying richest i mean flora and fauna. I suggest everyone to visit the place and enjoy amazing aura of the happiness.",

          "The place is mostly under construction and animals were out of site. The only interesting section was related to elephants.",
          "The Zoo is very well done and interesting for its visitors - especially the places which are made new in the last few years are amazing...Elefants house, Tigers and many more... Always worth a visit...just be aware of the very high prices especially for all food and beverage",

          "I've come to this Zoo for lots of times since I was a little boy...my first visit was probably more than 30 years ago. I remember it was always a hard choice between the Zurich Zoo and the Basel Zoo. Mostly we went to one this year and the other one the following year. But in",
          "I must say, I'm always dubious of visiting zoos abroad as I've heard a few horror stories! Thankfully, this zoo was wonderful! We had pre booked tickets online and it was very easy to park and get into the zoo. It was really quiet which was nice so it meant we could take as long",
          "My husband volunteers at the zoo in Toledo, Ohio, and we are both very interested in seeing as many other zoos as possible. This one was by far the best we've ever seen. The enclosures were very large and the enrichment for the animals was wonderful. While all zoos still keep",
          "In our opinion the best zoo in the world! Between the elephants, rhinoceros, toucans, monkeys penguins and more ....there is the long slide down the mountain But the best part is that you can see the Lions face to face and upclose There is also a cool playground a penguins",

          "We have 1 baby of 2.5 years old and 1 little girl of 5.5 years old. They enjoyed a bit of animal seeing and the other half of the time they spent at playgrounds. The playgrounds are really well designed and interesting for kids. They have a shop selling stuffed animals and they",
          "Visited this place , took tram 10 from HB . Took 20 minutes . It is better if you enough time at your disposal , that way you can go at your own pace rather than be in a hurry . Plenty of enclosure space for animals . A good variety including bear but limited numbers . Must see",
          "loved the new elephant enclosure - with restaurant attached. Everything is very spaced out so quite tiring day. Lovely to be able to ride a pony (additional charge) As with eveything in Switzerland its expensive and the shop is high priced but great day out with family. Get the",

          "This zoo is verry diverse! The elephant house is huge and all enclosures are pretty big. Prices are high but verry moderate for Swiss people. Verry nice as a family trip!",
          "One of the best zoos I ever visited. Enclosures are spacious and a lot of thought is invested in the welfare of the animals. The elephant exhibit is a special treat, also do not miss the Masoala rain forest.",

          "I'm not a great fan putting animals in zoos, but with family with small kids you do want to show the children this. Zurich Zoo build a few new homes, the animals got a huge new place, more like a parc for them selves and it does feel like the people but the animals a bit more",

          "Beautiful spaces for most animals, it's like you're on a safari (which includes not seeing all the animals, but when you see them, you spotted them). Hopefully the monkeys are next with getting a bigger space.",

          "Went in April 2017 and the baby elephant was of course the highlight! Allow plenty of time, my partner and i spent 3.5hrs there quite comfortably. Reasonable admission prices for Switzerland and the enclosures are well suited for the natural habitat for each animal. Tram 6",
          "Zoo Zurich is a very good Zoo. Animals seems happy and active and we could see everything in close distance. There also was just couple months earlier born an elephant baby, which was really great too see live! Restaurant was also ok, with a lot of lunch options. We had our",
          "We just spent a fantastic night at the Zoo - sleeping in outside tents: ----- What do animals do at night when all the people have left the zoo? Find out on a night expedition and get to know another side to the zoo. The program includes: Night trip through the Masoala",
          "Good zoo next to fifa headquarters there is a direct train to there named Zoo! Not huge but fun for kids",
          "Getting to the zoo from the center of Z\u00fcrich is easy. There is a direct tram service or one can drive there as there is plenty of parking space available. The zoo has so much to see that it is advisable to choose in advance what one wants to experience. If an animal must exist",
          "Fun and interesting animals but we expected more especially because the entrance price was so big. Great for a family trip on a sunny day.",
          "Zurich Zoo is high above Zurich and offers many highlights both for individuals as for families with kids. One of the highlights is the elephant group, that just got a young members 1 1/2 month ago. A place to see is also the Masoala Rainforest Hall, a very professional re-built",
          "The zoo facilities are great, al animals are healthy, happy, the staff is very friendly, and the tropical jungle area is simply amazing.",
          "I have visited zurich zoo but unfortunately I found it not a special zoo. Vienna zoo is much biger and better and more well organized than zurich zoo. Of course there were something intresting like various type of frogs which were so beautiful and colorful and the other good",
          "You have to visit there once at least. You can feel the nature there. A complete selection of animals you can see there.",
          "The zoo is located close to the outskirts of the city, but there are couple of trams reaching the location. The zoo in itself is somewhat \"luck-based\" type of destination. You have to check weather forecast to have a pleasant stay. Plus from what I have understood, it is also",
          "I really like the philosophy of Zurich Zoo. Not to show as many animals as possible but to create an environment that gives them a lot of room. Zurich zoo creates an environment for visitors that helps to slow down and relax. I love to observe the animals and take the time to do",
          "Clean, well maintained and funny Zoo. It's located outside of the city and it's very green and sunny around. There is a very good Italian restaurant nearby.",
          "I've visited many Zoos in the UK and in Europe, this is possibly the worst one I've been too. The organisation of the Zoo is not great with few signposts to help find your way around including a map that isn't the most informative either. Plus I think I saw 1 member of staff",
          "This zoo is great in every season. In winter (Nov-March) you can watch the penguins on a short \"parade\" outside of their enclosure (temperature must be below 10\u00b0C/50\u00b0F). The animals live in different areas which replicate their natural habitats as closely as possible. The",
          "I thought that the ZOO Zurich will be impressive but I was a little bit disappointed. Comparing with other ZOOs from Germany I can say that is under that ones. The animals don't have enough space, the aquarium is very small, etc. Masoala space is the best part and I have never",
          "So much to do and see for our twin 3.5 year old boys. The animals are well taken care of and the place is lovely. Many zoos are too small and a bit sad. But this zoo is absolutely great. Our boys love the playground as well. Three hours is a good amount of time for a visit.",
          "It\u00b4s not only about animals, you really feel different cultures, locations etc. Masoala always super interesting",
          "I love a Zoo and this has everything you normally get in a Zoo. Baby elephants, penguins, Zebras, Monkeys. Great for a family day out. There are some inside enclosures but probably best on a non rainy day.",
          "The Zurich zoo is one of the most beautiful and biggest zoos that i was ever The zoo is in the end of the city the is a Beautiful view of the forest in the zoo there is very nice animals and the zoo is very clean",
          "The place is nice and well planned. Also organized and very clean. Lots of animals to see. Can be visited for 3 to 4 hours. The tropical place is unique.",
          "In the forest, a big space with all kind of animals, places for kids to see all kind of attractions related with the life of many birds and animals, playground and restaurants \"in the nature\". Beautiful futuristic building for the elephants, great place for monkeys, a large area",
          "It has been such an amazing day at the zoo. We're a young funny couple and we haven't stop seeing things all day and still at closing time we could have stayed longer. We've enjoyed every activity like watching the Elephants, touching the snakes, seeing the penguins and lions",
          "Just love to visit the Zurich Zoo with it's beautifully designed building for the elephants (by the way there is just a newborn elephant to see). This Zoo on a hill about 20 minutes by tram from the main station suits the whole family for a few hours.",
          "Zoo is very well maintained and neat and clean. Animals too are maintained well . So natural and calm zoo. So nice to see bug animals near us",
          "Great Zoo but when you see an elephant rocking back and forth due to it not coping with the environment it is unsettling",
          "Really lovely zoo with plenty of animals to see and great natural feel to the zoo. Was also very pleased with the amount of space and the scenery given to the animals :)",
          "We had the opportunity of having an Ap\u00e9ro Riche at the new Elephant House of the Zurich Zoo. Spectacular views on the Elephants from the first floor while endulging savoury snacks from Thailand and Indian kitchen. Well worth the visit !",
          "It's a really nice ZOO, big and has beautiful animals which are also very well taken care of. My favorites are wolves, but to see them you have to invest a bit of patience and sometimes a bit wait because they are quite protected from disturbance by the crowd, and Masoala is as",
          "For non Swiss earners the entry is getting very steep compared to German alternatives now that the little one is six years old. Yet it is a beautiful zoo which is ever improving its displays for the animals which show little signs of stressed behavior. I especially appreciate",
          "The new Elephant enclosure is great! Get up close and personal with the animals. If you're in Zurich for the annual \"Night at the Museum\", definately hit up the Zoo!",
          "Very nice place to be with the kids Needs full day to cover the full area. All places are even wheelchair accessible. Restaurant is also nice",
          "Very easy to get to the zoo, catch the number 6 tram on bahnhoffe strasse near hotel St Gotthard. The stop for the zoo is at the end of the line. Follow the foot prints approximately 5 minutes to the zoo. As i was there during the end of winter some of the animals were",
          "Myself and my boyfriend were on a skiing holiday in Switzerland and decided to take a day trip to Zurich. The weather was cold and the ground was covered in snow! However, the weather did not effect our visit. We thoroughly enjoyed our day at the zoo. All staff were friendly and",
          "Visited over the weekend with my wife and two year old son. Although it was winter , we had a great time. It was a sunny saturday and most of the animals were out. It is kind of hilly which makes it harder to push the stroller. However it is very accessable with the tram and",
          "We just went to the zoo on the weekend and really had a great time with the kids birthday. It's such a beautiful experience walking through masoalahalle. The tropical rainforest of Madagascar in the middle of winter when its -5 degrees outside. The new elephant building is also",
          "Zurich Zoo is the best zoo in Europe bar none. The animal enclosures are carefully design to cater to the wellbeing of the animal as well as to the visitors. My personal highlights are the snow leopard exhibit, the giant tortoises and the Masoala Rainforest hall. Keep a look out",
          "Absolute must see. The Zoo is clean and well maintained and there is an array of activities for the children. I would visit at least once a week when I lived in Zurich and would highly recommend working this place into your stay.",
          "A Super Experience - spent an entire day at the Zoo. There are lots of animals and enclosures to keep us busy. The animals look in very good shape - ample space in their cages. Only hitch is that internal travel is a bit tiring - with young kids. Also, it is easy to reach by",
          "Had a blast there. Easy to cruise around, just follow the arrows and you will reach whatever you are looking for. The Thai area is awesome with those cute elephants and you must try the food from that kiosk out there. Their thai food is awesome Dont miss any of the animals.",
          "The Zurich Zoo is great, the cages give the animals considerable space and everything is attended with attention to detail and in the most respectable fashion possible. In winter, less animals can be spotted as they stay in warmer, indoor areas. It's great to spend a day at the",
          "very nice Zoo, a lot to do and see. Great infrastructure and a lot of different animals. You can spend a lot of time as a couple, business or for sure as a family. Food is very good and you have a lot of restaurants and coffee to go. From the main station Zurich it takes only",
          "This used to be a zoo with a small feel, lots of big animals in small cages. Now they have gotten rid of the sad Polar Bear, expanded the Bear cages so it is often hard to see them, and are working on Elephants & other animals now. Nice Tropical Forest environment.",
          "I am in the Zoo a few times a month. I am very happy with the changes to the \"fishy\" department. The window glass is now all the way to the floor so small children can see a lot more and grandmother does not have to lift them all the time. Also I lost my favourite scarf a week",
          "This is quite an amazing place to visit, especially if you have kids with you. A wide range of flora, fauna and animals. The Masoala rainforest is a star attraction. They're planning to upgrade massively with Australia (2017) and two other regions slated for launch in 2020 and",
          "We had some time to kill before heading on our flight home so we decided to pop to the zoo. We spent about two/three hours and we managed to see everything there. The zoo is super clean and the enclosures are all large and open for the animals which is really nice. The main",
          "A visit at the Zurich zoo is an excellent choice for families with kids. The access is easy from the city, or you can take your car with you and park there. The zoo is big, clean and well organised. But what I liked most is the fact that it is built according to the needs of the",
          "I loved the zoo. they have sea lions, penguins, flamingos and much more. There was a variety of snakes and detals of those are fascinating. do visit",
          "I liked it very much. Especially, aquariums and elephants' place. Other places are good as well. There is a lot if interesting snakes, you can even touch some of them :)",
          "The fairly new Elephant House is such a beautiful accommodation for these gentle creatures. We love the buffet at the Thai Reastaurant in the Elephant House, it gives you the best views of the animals, especially in the colder season.",
          "We visited the Zurich Zoo primarily for my soon. But I must Admit I had a gala time too Meeting the Flamingos, Penguins, Sea Lion for the first time..",
          "Zoo Z\u00fcrich is well worth a visit. Plan some time here as there is so much to see and do. Walk with the penguins in winter, laugh at the elephants' antics, enjoy a leisurely Sunday brunch. Don't leave out the fascinating Masoala tropical arena, where, if you're lucky, you will",
          "The Zoo was an unplanned side trip that I'm glad we didn't miss. With a morning left before traveling we dodged raindrops and spent a good 2 hours roaming the up and down layout of this lovely zoo. You can wonder through a rain forest along with the forest inhabitants and",
          "As Zoos go this is a pretty good one and is constantly being improved to give the animals more space. It's spread out over a large area and is a bit hilly and so it also gives you some good exercise. Good restaurant/cafe facilities and good play areas for kids",
          "Large and quite animal friendly zoo. Having a new aquarium with nice variety of fish etc. Birds are either indoor free pr roam totally free, eg peacocks or storks. Penguins parade regularly, when cold making kids happy. The elephants' habitat is of beautiful architecture and",
          "A very nice and maintained Zoo. I specially loved the Masoala-Halle. No so frizzy in the winter time. Restaurants could do better, but this was not the main point of my visit.",
          "A large zoo and great stuff there. The variety of animals is amazing and its worth the while to be there.",
          "Great zoo - well-cared for animals in great surroundings. Reasonably priced to visit - also a super, family friendly restaurant on site.",
          "Just a run of the mill zoo, but it is a great place to spend the day! I was the end of a very long trip when I stopped off here, and it was a great way to cap my trip. Great stuff!",
          "Good Zoo with more space for Animals and quite good amount of collections. They are well taken care. You get to see snow leopard, which is uncommon. Surprised to see Indian lion. You can spend minimum 3hrs there and have to walk a lot. You can take tram(I think it's 6) to reach",
          "Nice Zoo: a lot of space for the animals, variate species of animals and well organised routes. They have a increadible indoor area for the elephants Though running a reasonably entertaning zoo is not hard and all the signs were in German. It is one of the better Zoo I have",
          "i was in z\u00fcrich visiting my sister and decided to take the kids to the zoo. it was a very fun experience with the map, trails, forests, feeding animals etc. i would definitely recommend.",
          "They are currently renewing the z\u00fcrich zoo, so you're gonna be running into a few detours, otherwise the zoo has all the animals you want to see in a zoo, although I thought some of the cages or fenced places were a bit too small for the animals that were inside. There is quite",
          "It's a wonderful zoo, with plenty of space for the animals and Masoala is great. elegant place is new and big. Perfect for families, couples and even Solo.",
          "We had a perfect Sunday brunch at the Zurich zoo in the Thai restaurant. Be early to enjoy the buffet in a private atmosphere and come back fur the lunch (all inclusive) after having visited the animals at the lovely zoo.",
          "The zoo is quite big and it feels good to see how much thought and effort went into providing attractive, well thought and humane enclosures. It was also great to see how the well-being of all the animals is of the utmost importance, even if it means sometimes disappointing",
          "Quite nice, friendly staff and well kept installations. Altough i dont support zoos and other type of cages this place is well organized and the animals seem to be treated in a good way",
          "It's convenient to take the the tram in Zurich up to the zoo. A car works as well, plenty of parking. We were invited by friends. Plan for at least half day. There's quite a lot of walking and the animals are presented by geographical regions. Maybe not so good if it rains, but",
          "Came here on a Sun as everything in Zurich appeared to be closed. Takes 20 mins from Central transport station including a 3 min walk there. There was a huge array of animals/birds/wildlife. One of the better zoos I've been to in the world. Entry was \u00a320.00. Take about 3 hrs",
          "We visited on wet/snowy day but still had a great time with lots to see! The zoo is quite big and you could easily spend hours here, a great mixture of animals and plenty of space to view them all. Our only criticisms would be that it seemed some areas were closed on weekdays",
          "A great way to spend an afternoon in Zurich, especially with kids or teenagers. I love the tropical forest which is especially nice on cold winter days.",
          "This is a big zoo, so make sure you have enough time to walk it through. There is going to be lots of walking. Its a nice zoo with lots of nature everywhere.",
          "It turned out to be better than expected. The zoo is beautifully designed and well maintained. All the animals look very well taken care of. We especially like the Madagasga theme dome, walking inside, we almost forgot we were in Switzerland when walking through all those",
          "This was our second visit to the Zoo - we last went 2 years ago. Not much seemed to have changed. There are lots of different animals to see and we had lunch in the main cafe which was ok if not particularly special. Our kids particularly enjoyed the kids outdoors play area -",
          "Visited the Zoo yesterday as in Zurich for the weekend - AMAZING! Elephant swimming was fantastic to see, alongside Rainforest \"house\" - very interesting and certainly kept us all entertained. We spent 4 hours here, sadly had to leave for the airport, but could have easily spent",
          "Very nice Zoo with lots of variety of animals, attractions and great food options. Reserve at least half a day if not more, there's so much to see. And they are still expanding. Very cool Zoo for Kids and adults.",
          "We received tickets from a friend as a treat - and what a treat it was! Despite the rainy weather we saw most of the animals as the enclosures often have some sheltered viewpoints to them. The elephant enclosure is fabulous - at 11.000 sqm with it's own pool for swimming, a",
          "If you like zoos you should like this one also. It's very well designed and some of the newer exhibits really are cutting edge. Especially the rain forest section, it is a complete habitat recreation and no cages.",
          "Elephant House is new and very nice. Rest of the zoo is old and outdated. Some of the shelters for animals are in so poor conditions that it is sad the animals are still living in them.... Considering it costs 26 francs for an adult to get in, one might think the zoo makes",
          "We spent most of a day at the zoo. It is quite large, so I suggest planning an entire day to really enjoy it. We had a limited time, so we did not get the full experience. Most exhibits had viewing areas from different perspectives. I thought this was great, because at any",
          "Been to the Zurich zoo 10 to 15 times over the last 9 years. I generally hate zoos. but this one seems more caring. Many open air enclosures. Not overstuffed with animals. The animals the have seem well cared for. Nice mix of traditional and nontraditional animals as well as",

          "We went to the zoo today with our 1 yr old, and seriously debated buying the family pass. We're very glad we didn't, and will probably never come back here again. The zoo itself is fine. Well-maintained, large. Animals look as happy as any caged animals ever do... But what",
          "I won't call it the best zoo I have seen..but it was good.It's a huge zoo..you need to walk a lot and can get lost if you don't follow signs or the map.You would need a minimum 3 hrs to just walk through the zoo. If you traveling with small kids don't forget the strollers. .Most",

          "We were only in Zurich for 48 hours to attend a gig so wanted to get as much done as possible. We had planned a morning at the zoo but due to the layout of the zoo then I would say a day is needed to get round it all. We really liked how natural the zoo looked and felt compared",

          "We regularly visit the Zurich zoo being local residents and a family with young kids. The zoo benefits from extensive grounds and wide open spaces, including a huge elephant enclosure and an artificial rain forest. Catering options on site are excellent and there is also a",
          "Great place at outskirts of city, very good info re animals and ecology. Needs to be careful not to become either quality playground or mainstream cute zoo.",
          "Highlights are the elephant house and the tropical Masoala rain forest. Easy to reach by car or tram.",
          "The infrastructure is just insane! It's beautiful and the animals seem happy and well taken care of. Plenty to do with kids. The restaurants are also very nice. There are always new things being built. We are frequent visitors and have the annual card.",

          "The fundamental thing still wrong with it ?it is still a bloody zoo, I went because I was curious for the new Elephant range, it is an improvement but it still is a bloody zoo.",
          "Ticket is not cheap,perhaps 20 Franc,or more,I remember it's really money worth.You can see very good conditioned animals in very natural occasions. You can see Penguin swimming in the water from the glass windows,eat fish when the staff throw it. Elephants power sand over",
          "The zoo itself is nice However please avoid the \"Nachtwandeln\" during the evening/night you will hardly spot any animal as all of the animals sleep at night. And for a 1 hour morning tour in the Zoo prior to public opening hours the proce is too high",
          "Loved this zoo - many excellent exhibits Elephants / Rainforest / Snow Leopards / Spectacled Bears etc (apes not so good!). Well worth a visit we spent easily 6 hours there and could have stayed longer! Friendly staff and good places to eat. Highly recommend a visit - check",
          "I went in the early afternoon, it was relatively busy with lots of young family's and couples. It was nice to stroll around the Zoo at leisurely pace and take in the animals. The reptile house just inside the main gate is not to be missed, nor are the penguins! The elephant",
          "I visited the zoo with my 8-year-old nephew - we both had a great time. There is a lot to see, so it's best to plan enough time. if you want to see everything you'll need a good three hours, including breaks. Or plan your visit according to the animals you want to see. The zoo",
          "Really nicely kept and maintained. A bit expensive as everything in Zurich but worth it. Many animals and a good option to spend 2 to 3 hours. Tram #6 will take you there from the main station. Great for families.",
          "The main thing you notice is the very large and natural habit for the animals. In addition a combinazion of different animals living together makes it interesting. The big tropical hall Massuala is a must to visit.",
          "I loved that most of the animals there have a huge cage and most of them got renovated during the last few years. Especially the masoala hall and the new house for the elephants were quite impressive and absolutely worth a visit.",
          "You could easily spend the entire day here, there's so much to see! Great interactive and informative exhibits that make it fun to learn more about the natural world. They have a rainforest dome like I've never seen before with chameleons and lemurs just hanging out free",
          "The lion was very tired when we were there and the penguins had very little space to roam. I did enjoy the masoala Pavillon however, as you could get up close to colorful monkeys, who at least had some more space than other animals (not nearly enough though). Nice place to go",
          "What a fantastic Zoo !!! Our Grandkids live in Zurich so when we visit we always take them to the Zoo. We bought the Annual Pass...once you go 3 times it's paid for. The Zoo is super clean. The new Elephant Area is huge. We love watching the gorillas. The Zoo has lots of",
          "We had a fully nice day here. Quite big and having a lot of animals I consider Zurich zoo one of the best I have seen. Good explanation even they were not all the time in English. They have good places to eat too. Several restaurants and a lot of kiosk with food and drinks. Do",
          "The zoo was located quite a distance from the central, however, the connectivity of the trains were good and did not find the difficulty travelling to the zoo. had a nice time at the zoo and was very well maintained. Was amazing to see peacocks roaming freely in the zoo along",

          "I am a zoos' fan and I find the Zoo Zurich nice and relaxing. You can really enjoy the spectacle if the animals and hike pretry well. The new area is nice as well and the restaurant inside is better than the oldest one",

          "There was no special animal and the ones that were there most are sleeping or you can hardly see them , no activity, all the guides are in Dutch-no any other language-,doesn't worth the money you spent.",
          "It was a pleasant surprise to visit this place, in fact it was not scheduled at all and it was a last minute decision, it's a wonderful place for kids and very educational, the cleanliness is outstanding and everything is in the right order, animals are from all over the world,",

          "Both enjoyed the day at the zoo, lots of walking and some very interesting exhibits. The zoo was under a LOT of construction and also a few closed exhibits on our visit AUG 16. A few enclosures we thought were a little small but we must remember zoo's play a crucial part in",

          "This Zoo really is fantastic. It treats its animals like first-class guests. Nothing to compare with Zoos I saw in other countries where they kept animals in small cages under miserable conditions. To be honest, in the past I was expecting to see similar Zoo like Z\u00fcrich-Zoo in",
          "Zurich Zoo is bound to the strict animal protection laws in Switzerland and therefore wants to present you animals in their natural habitat. The new attractions like the rainforest hallt (Masoala hall) and the elephant range make this possible. Animals have space and visitors",

          "It's not a San Francisco zoo or Philadelphia zoo, but for Switzerland it's super. Great time love all the animals. It's a short trip from the train station and well worth it. They do a great job there and my kids and wife thoroughly enjoy it.",
          "The Zurich Zoo really has made a lot of changes in the past few years. The new elephant park is amazing, the Mazuala hall always impressive and also the other animals are more than worthwhile a visit.",

          "It is very big zoo.. There are lot of kinds of animals, the areas at the zoo are divided to \"worlds\", like african animals or Savannah and cetera... There are many places to eat and to rest, at each world the food and the gift shop are adapted. U can take a \"train tour \" to each",
          "A huge Zoo, well worth a visit! Reasonably priced, especially if you look under 25. Full of huge range of animals and expanding all the time. I especially liked the elephants. The animals look well taken care of and have lots of space. It is best to have a plan of which",

          "Rather long distances to walk between the elephants and the lions, but still a fun way to use up a spare afternoon",
          "I ve been there with my family. Ist a bautifoul place to be on Sunday or Saturday at evenning. I recomend.",
          "It is definitely one of the best zoos I've ever been to. It is very clean and the animals don't look \"sad\" as in other zoos. My favorite part was the elephant park which is themed as Thailand, and the Masoala rainforest which actually feels like a real jungle and where you can",
          "Nice day out the zoo is getting much better and they are starting to get more variety of animals. The new elephant exhibit is brilliant!",
          "As far as zoo's go this was a great experience! As an American \"germ a phobe\" parent/ I was super concerned about cleanliness of overall park. It was super easy to get to, & clean! Parking was easy to navigate. Lines were manageable but might be best to buy online if possible",
          "This zoo is very big and has a huge amount of animals in very nice \"cages\". All the zoo is devided into different regions of the world according to the animals origins and you'll get all kind of food from those regions. There are also many facilities for kids all through the",
          "If nothing else, go for the elephant exhibit which is themed around Thailand. The elephant house is essentially a 270 degree exhibit where you can see the elephants while they're inside, including a sunken area where you can see them swimming. The coolest part of the entire zoo",
          "Beautiful Zoo, where most of the animals seem to have enough space and great treatment. Very much enjoyable with kids in young age",
          "This Zoo is from the good ones I have visited with my children. I had the chance to see the lions, tigers and leopards through glass-walls. You can see also, elephants, Gorillas, types on monkeys, Lamas, Camels, Zebras and many other animals. Also there was a section for",
          "The zoo in general is fine, and it's green and organised. However, the experience was marred by seeing the gorillas and orangutans in their small, indoor and mentally unstimulating cages. I understand that the gorillas will have a better living arrangement in 7 years time, until",
          "My be this Zoo is for families with small children, because everywhere was families with strollers, with children who even is to young to understand where they are. I did look forward to visit Zurich Zoo, but what a disappointment. First tickets was very expensive, second there",
          "I took the number 6 tram which stops near the zoo with only a five min walk to get there. I think this is well worth a visit housing the biggest gorilla and orangotangs I have ever seen. There is so much to see so you need a day to cover all. There is also a number of places to",
          "I'm not a big fan of wild animals behind fences, but went with a friend and her kid. It was great for the little one and we enjoyed ourselves as well. Some of the enclosures are tiny, but I think they're working on it. Quite expensive",
          "The zoo is very large, diverse, very clean and interesting. We were all very happy and enjoyed it a lot. The elephant presentation and the penguin feeding time was great to watch and enjoyable for everyone. Not only for kids, also a great outing for adults. The tropical house is",
          "Really nice zoo. Very well made with options for food and drink. All animals and birds were great to see. Lots of walking though do comfortable shoes is must. They also expanding it. The zoolino area is nice for kids where they can go inside and play with the goats. Liked it and",

          "Zurich Zoo is quite large with many animals and a lot to see. It has three distinct areas: main zoo, elephant park, and a tropical dome. You can easily spend half to a full day walking around and watching these wonderful animals so allow plenty of time when visiting the place.",
          "Only a 25 minute tram ride from our hotel and we were there. Cost about $35 canadian each to get in so not terrible. Lots of trees for shade as you walk thru as it was very hot on this day. Lots of expansion going on so it will be even more impressive in the years to come.",
          "We visited the zoo today, I have an 8 year old and a teenager, the zoo was ok for half a day out, price was \u00a356 which for a family wasn't too bad. Two things disappointed me, the first being none of the information about the animals was in English, I like to read about the",
          "Nothing to see.. Very normal and boring, even the kids got bored I don't advice you to put it in your tourist plan There is not much animals to see. I think more rest areas should be distributed here and there",

          "We had sometime to spare hence we decided to visit the Zoo. But it turned out to be a major disappointment. An entry of CHF 30 approx is not at worth it. we could have done much better somewhere else with this amount and time in hand. Extremely average zoo. Think before you go",
          "It is a nice Zoo for people who have not been to Indian or African wildlife area. However, those who have seen Indian and African wildlife can skip as they may not find it that interesting. Also Zoo requires minimum half a day to see it thoroughly.",
          "Yes, my headline is correct... Zurich Zoo has been given accolades for being \"in the forefront of animal welfare\". However, they tie up a horse carcass for the Tigers to play with and tear to shreds. The horses serve as a type of entertainment for tigers/ lions and barbarians-",
          "Zurich Zoo offers its visitors a great way to see animals in a 'close to natural' environment. The Zoo has invested a lot of energy and money to improve the conditions under which the animals live, and the result is stunning. Enjoy Masoala Hall, a tropic hall with a trail, see",

          "Its not the best zoo I have been to, but its far from the worst. The rainforest habitat was excellent with free range lizards, monkeys, lemurs all over the place. The elephant enclosure was huge and the animals looked healthy and happy. It's easy to exit the zoo when you are",
          "Simply put, this zoo is great, especially with young children. We stayed in downtown Zurich and took the tram from the Opera house up to the zoo. It's a short walk from the station, and we bought tram and zoo tickets at a SBB station so we went straight to the entrance. No",
          "The zoo z\u00fcrich is one of the most progressive zoos in the world, regarding animal welfare. New enclosures are built continously and the get wider with a more natural environment. If you like zoos in general, you definitively have to see this one in partucular!",

          "We were lucky to visit on a sunny day and so I made the walking enjoyable. The enclosures are big for all animals they all seemed happy and a lot were playing. We took the tram from central and arrived in approx 15 minutes which was great. I took us about 4 hours to see",

          "We toured the zoo with our 1 year old and enjoyed it. It's not very large compared to other well-known zoos, but is well laid out and maintained. The day was hot so we didn't stay as long as we could have, but 90 minutes was enough to see most of the highlights. Some of the"

          "What a wonderful zoo! This place has a fantastic variety of different animals and habitats. You can spend hours here. Great place to visit for kids and adults alike. I wish we had gotten here a little earlier as the line to get in took a little while but it was worth the wait.",
          "The zoo itself is actually a good place. But the parking spots are so narrow not even small cars can park next to each other without scratching their doors.",
          "You need to come again, again and again. There's not enough time to see it all and enjoy. Highly recommended.",
          "A nice zoo overall, I actually left a little disappointed. The enclosures don't appear to have thought out to allow for the best viewing of the animals. We managed to leave the zoo without having seen any of the large animals (tigers, \u2026",

          "It was okay.\nI guess that I am spoiled by the Zoo in Copenhagen which is so much better!!\nZurich zoo didn't live up to all its hype for me...\nI really don't understand why Zurich zoo is considered the best in Europe.",
          "The zoo itself is amazing! Huge area, plenty of space for all the different kind of animals. Staff is inspiring and will provide you with all the possible information if you want to know something. Be aware this zoo is so great, it is overfilled with people at any given time.",

          "Best (and only?) Zoo in this area. Quite large. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Loved it. Great day out with the kids. Wide range of animals, several playgrounds and nice clean facilities. Train and tram right up to about 500m away. Super day out.",
          "Lovely place, you can spend the whole day here and not getting bored. Only 5 min walk from Train station to the main Entrance and it's only animals but very lovely gardens/flowers/trees.",
          "Nice zoo.",
          "It's huge! Can easily spend 4-5 hours exploring it. Many food stalls inside, spread across the area. Favourite parts were seeing gorillas and walking across the rain forest.",
          "It's a great place for both little and big ones. Lots to do ona a sunny or rainy day. We love it.",
          "Unfortunately, the monkey cage is too small. \nVery big soft ices! (Beware your pants;)",

Good for family and kids.\nRestaurants available for foodies",
          "Every year, we go to the zoo almost 10x. We like the petting zoo for kids, elephant aea, Masoala rain forest, the penguin and aquarium section, the Australian area and almost all places inside. We also love their playground and we either eat at their restaurant or bring our own. I have two small kids and both love the zoo.",

          "It was good . Animals was actually their compared to other zoos",
          "This is a wonderful zoo with lots of animals to see. It is very hilly and not especially shaded in some parts, I went on a cloudy day which was perfect.",
          "We didnt get to see many animals.. The encloser wasnt that big so u would think they are in there but no sign of some like the snow leopard... Place is clean and easy to get around. Also a tram takes u right there from the central.",

          "The Zoo was awesome! Even though it was raining it was great!",
          "Nice and family friendly. Also has a big restaurant. Not many animals I'd expect to see (e.g. no giraffes, elephants, hippos, etc.). Try visiting earlier in the day, otherwise most animals are sleeping.",

          "A lot of effort goes into conservation and it\u2019s noticeable in their themed areas. \n\nThe masoala is fantastic and so is the elephant enclosure. The new savannah area is set to almost double the area of the zoo in 2020, for which I\u2019m very excited!",

          "Excellent place to spend the afternoon",
          "As a Biology student, this is one of my favourite places in Zurich. While ticket prices could be considered high, you get a lot of value out of your visit and it is incedibly satifsying to see, what they are able to do with their budget. \u2026",
          "Best zoo in many countries I have been. Get close encounter comfortably with animals close to nature. Themes like Australia, Thai, parrots, goats, apes and many. Still expanding new themes. Just visited 70% cause tired. Best suitable for children and adults as well.",
          "Great place to go in any weather I think .. especially the rainforest of Madagascar which offers an indoor restaurant where you can sit next to a tropical pond behind a glass .. you can really imagine urself to be in a different geographical location",
          "I am not a big fan of zoos because I think animals should not be kept in captivity for human entertainment, however this one is quite nice compared to what I\u2019ve seen abroad. I was invited here for a business apero, which was quite nice and the food was delicious.",
          "We all loved it. Park is big so it might take whole day if you want to see everything. Prepare for good shoes.",
          "I loved it here. I found many penguins I could draw live, I found all the wild animals that I wanted, most of all: I found a really cute Swiss boy there who shouted me a warm coffee. This turns out to be a romantic spot for couples, and an \u2026",

          "Very nice Zoo and one of the best I ever visited \nHighly recommended for families and you can spend a full day in it.",
          "Tragic. Poorly designed. Too much foliage to allow you to see the animals clearly. Don't go on the Masoala express as all it does is take you down to the elephant enclosure and then have to pay again to get back. The animal enclosures are far too small.",
          "It is such a beautiful zoo. We love it and spend so much time here. Sometimes we go 3 times in a week and there is always something impressive and interesting to see.",
          "One of the best zoo in the world. Any family should particularly spend time in the interactive farm called \"zoolino\" - a space made for kids",
          "This zoo is awesome! I definitely recommend it to anyone staying in the Z\u00fcrich area. There's plenty of restaurants, beautiful animals, and a wonderful tropical rainforest with hundreds of different species  moving around you. You are also allowed to bring your own food.

          "Excellent place for a day out with kids. Entry ticket is expensive and food is well also expensive. 4.50 for a small coke is robbery",

          "Zoo Z\u00fcrich is, if you\u2018re ever in Zurich, a must visit.\nThe zoo itself is amazing on its own. But with the masoala rainforrest, it has one of the most fascinating places that you can explore yourself in zurich. It\u2018s a very magical experience to enter the masoala hall in the zoo. That in my opinion is a true \u201ebig city jungle\u201c",

          "I'm not a massive fan of zoos in general, but I have frequented Zoo Z\u00fcrich with the entire family so many times that I lost count. Like many modern zoos, Zoo Zurich tries to create an environment that does not stress out animals and focuses \u2026",

          "I visited the zoo for the first time. The concept of building a zoo within the nature and not in the city with all of the animals caged has really impressed me. A  must go place, to relax and enjoy the nature and the animals.",

          "Wonderful zoo, great compounds, always in expansion, so much to see, a day visit is almost not enough.\nThe rain forest exhibition (\"Masoala\") is my favorite, free range animals inside, so it even sounds like the rain forest. Haven't seen something like this (and that big) before.",
          "What's not to love about a zoo as well kept as the Zurich one?",
          "One of the best zoos I had met",
          "Awful place. Zoo are always bad I believe but the way they keep the penguines in this one is horrible. The entry is extremly expensive. You have to pay expensive prices for water. Th place is wide and you have to pay to commute with the little train. It was disapointing and sad to see the animals in such conditions",
          "Treetop walk was really good, highlight of the day.",
          "Extremely impressed. Very nice experience and a nice day out with my kids. The animals have way more space than in some zoos I've been to in the US or the UK.",
          "Best zoo I\u2019ve ever visited. They do really care for the well-being and confort of the animals. Respect them totally. Amazing, amazing place.",

          "The elephants are wonderful.",
          "worth the visit, count at least four hours to be able to see everything",
          "It is a very good place to visit. Easily can spend a whole day there. Unfortunate that the parking ticket is only valid up to 6 hours on weekdays.",
          "The garden is beautiful but most of the animals were asleep",
          "Pretty big zoo! we were a bit disappointed because some animals are not there, but had a great time nonetheless",
          "Really a beautiful place to stay and spend time with the family!",
          "Excellent way to spend the day when the weather's agreeable.",
          "Always worth a visit.",
          "The animals are so close you can almost touch them! And many have no fences! Large variety and many things to see and do, can easily take one full day out! We liked the penguins, kangaroos, gorillas and elephants the most.",
          "Great variety of animals and an active lion who was roaring so loudly the glass was vibrating. Interactive penguins who would follow children across the aquarium glass and chimps and gorillas. It is a whole day visit if the objective is to see all the exhibits.",
          "One of the best designed zoos in the world.",
          "I loved the zoo. My son loved it also. It was also a nice view",
          "Loved going to Zoos since a small boy, Z\u00fcrich Zoo is very modern, they try very hard to look after their animals. Put good shoes on, lots of walking needed to see everything. Both of my grandchildren love it.",
          "A great place to spend the day with the little ones. Buy the tickets online to beat the queues, also make sure to plan your tour around the many activities they have - like feeding or riding the animals.\nSome of the smaller bars do not take card so make sure to bring cash and water",
          "Great zoo! Had lovely time, definitely will come back. Suggest to bring your own food as the chose in local food points is very small and prices are very high.",
          "A great day out",
          "A must visit when in the area of Zurich. Relaxing and enjoying for young and old",
          "A bit too boring.",
          "Dont miss the rainforest exhibit",
          "Lion and tiger always hide\nElephants mostly hidden\nThey are not interesting to keep animals show for guests",

          "Amazing zoo with a lot of animals.",
          "+A lot of attractions\n+clean toilets\n\n-no parkinspace on Weekends\n-food was bland\n-pricy 4,50 chf for water ?\n\nBest is to bring your own drinks and food",

          "Fantastic experience",
          "I loved  the animals there, the habitats were very impressive, specially the elephants'",
          "A bit expensive for entrance fees, but quite interesting and big Zoo. Lions and tigers were tired tho :D",
          "Best zoo in Switzerland",
          "Amazing zoo. There is a very wide variety of animals, all treated with care. They have built some amazing structures. I particularly recommend the elephant section. And apparently there is soon going to be a whole new savannah area. A must for families with kids but not only. Absolutely recommended",
          "Top top",
          "A very nice experience... but I would recommend to be visited in the spring or in the summer.",
          "Very cool zoo, well maintained and several great exhibits.",
          "What a fantastic zoo. I find most zoo just sad but this is really well made. Lots of places to explore activities for children and cafes for adults. They have thighs like Pinguins walks and feeding animals so check out the timetable ahead. \u2026",
          "Nice Zoo, great for kids to discover animals. Be prepared to walk as it is quite big and there are some hills ( take your stroller if your child can not walk long distances)",
          "My favoorite place in Z\u00fcrich! I have an annual card and I just love going back. I super recommend this for friends and family!",
          "It is beautiful zoo with wide variety of animals. There are 2 restaurants, cafe and many food and coffee stands, so it is quite convenient for a whole day family event.\nIn the morning the number of visitors is significantly smaller, so if you don't like crowded places avoid going around lunch time.",
          "Excellent day out with the kids",
          "Lovely zoo with many unique and intriguing animals and habitats. My kids loved the creative playgrounds as well. We spent most of the day there and had. A great time. It was a highlight of our trip to Zurich.",
          "Terrific Zoo above Z\u00fcrich. As with so much else to do with this city, these facilities are more than one can expect for a town this size. Highly recommended.",
          "Huge zoo, tropical house is great, no giraffe...",
          "Time for parking is only 6 hours, so you have to leave early. You are not so welcome to Zurich Zoo",
          "Amazing for kids and adults alike. Lots of animals, a beautiful location and nice playgrounds too. We got the annual pass and it's easily worth it.",
          "A very big zoo with many many different animals. It's quite a walk if you want to see the entire zoo. The only bad thing were some of the enclosures where you couldn't see a thing. Overall a good zoo",
          "Lots of fun",
          "Latest hit: Koalas and the Australian park. Zoo ideal for a relaxed 3-4 hours in a group with kids as well. A bit of walking comes with it. Zoo offers snacks and water/drinks, not a lot of healthier food though. Parking can be tough on busy days, better use the tram line 6 that goes very close to the entrance.",
          "Amazing exhibit and good conditions for animals. quite expensive to enter",
          "Good place",
          "I don\u2019t know how people r giving 5 stars .. it\u2019s is such a boring one.. very steep so it was difficult to walk . Tourists should not waste time in this zoo but local people could enjoy . The best zoo I have ever seen is in Singapore.",
          "Was here for a private event and I didn't realize how big the zoo is! Wow! Totally worth it, wish animals had a bit more space",
          "It is a nice zoo but do not forget to check out if the animals you like to see / show to you kids are not on vacation. Every time we go there as a family , many animals are on vacation.",
          "Super cool Zoo. Very big with a lot of things to do. Shame I'll most likely never be back as I'm from New York, but in 2019 a giraffe area will be full complete. Very affordable and fun time, worth a go of it.",
          "The environment seemed quite humane and natural. And there were quite a few surprises.",
          "Greatest Zoo I know!",
          "It was really nice,  it is a perfect place  to spend good time in family the week end.",
          "Biggest zoo in Switzerland. Must go if you travel to zurich with children. The whole family will love the trip. Enjoy.",
          "Zoo Z\u00fcrich Z\u00fcrichbergstrasse 221, 8044 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland: The best zoo to be seen. Had never imagined. This zoo is no ordinary zoo, they have the most beautiful habitats for their animals. In this zoo, the animals are not held captive in \u2026",
          "Its a nice zoo. Good size to spend a couple hrs. With kids i think you will  be able to spend all day. But with friends ur done in a couple hours. Not bad tho! Did enjoy the visit. Amd they have  verry beautiful animals and nice cages.",
          "Perfect for kids, no matter how the weather is. The animals seem to have enough space, except the apes maybe, and they are very well taken care of.",
          "A great experience. Good to see the Indian Bengal Tiger",
          "My favourite",
          "I am disappointed. Most of the exhibits are too small and the animals are depressed. It is more like a garden, you just walk through a very nice garden full of trees and plant, but you cannot see any animals, because the exhibits are covered in \"green\" walls.",
          "Love this Zoo! I strongly recommend the yearly pass since there is so much to see that you'll want to come on many occasions.\n\nHighlights for me and my kid were: elephant dome, play area, petting the goats, etc.",
          "Beautiful place",
          "I love going to the zoo. It is a perfect place to go on a not too sunny day and only been there with kids but am sure it's also very nice to explore on your own. The new Australia area with the koala bears is really nice. There are also \u2026",
          "It's a nice park for a family walk, but as a zoo could definitely be better. Some times the animals can not be easily (or at all) detected. The infrastructure for some animals cold be even closer to their natural environment and their needs (e.g. freezing monkeys is not the best thing to see in a zoo). Tickets cost 26 CHF for adults.",
          "Lot's of fun for family and friends, definately a whole day activity, with cool events and shows, you won't get bored. However the food is quite expensive so bring your own snacks",
          "Pretty good zoo. Impressed by the size of most of the enclosures, it's got a pretty good selection of animals, and some very nice settings where you can see the animals close up without cages.",
          "Worth the money. Very well maintained. Ticket cost around 25 CHF. Time schedule for feeding if various animals is given and it\u2019s fun to watch especially chimps.",
          "Magical. It was snowing and freezing but one of the best zoos I have been to. Totally bias given the beauty of the landscape and the snow. But was a great experience overall.",
          "One of the best zoos I've been to - Worldwide. Plan to spend at least 3 to 4 hours here. You can buy tickets in advance and print them out, saving time and hassle at the entrance. Drinks are expensive (almost 5 CHF for a small bottle), so \u2026",
          "Amazing, took about four hours. Best zoo I've ever been too. Animals were all up and active and seemed happy! Well maintained, not overly crowded! Great day!",
          "Great for kids, adults... and animals :) It covers a lot of land so a whole day is not too much to see all the areas.",
          "Nice place to visit - take good shoes and lot of time \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Great place to spend a day with the familiy.\n\nDuring the week there are parking spaces close by. On busy weekends take public transport to avoid to search for an open space for hours.\n\nThe zoo has a few nice playground for the kids and a \u2026",
          "Lots of animals in very well done closures.",
          "Zoo is an evergreen place to go with family. The zoo really give the feeling of being very well curated and clean. The masoala tropical Forest is my favorite part with camaleonte literally crossing roads and the treetop walkway.",
          "The zoo of Zurich is definitely top of the world.\nI love how they are slowly moving from the traditional lame cages of a typical zoo to open spaces were animals can freely roam.\nThe Masoala jungle is just impressive allowing you to hunt for \u2026",
          "This Zoo is more for older kids and grown ups. I like that the compounds are bigger but you need to walk far and have only small spots where you can observe the animals. There are chances that you don't see the animals. For kids this can be \u2026",
          "Lot of different animals to see. Recommended for kids as well.",
          "It was raining so we didn't really walk around,  however the cafeteria was lovely and the staff very friendly.  The gift shop was also lovely",
          "I loved the penguins! I was a bit disappointed with the wildlife animals such as lions, tigers and elephants, since they were confined in very small places. In other hand, they have beautiful species there. Loved the monkeys and the flamingos. If you have an afternoon to spare, it is a very nice visit.",
          "Z\u00fcrich zoo is one of the most humane zoos I know. It's green, it's nice, the animals have proper space to move in and just generally don't look miserable, but rather quite at ease and well cared for. The zoo is constantly expanding and improving, so it's actually worth paying it a repeated visit.",
          "Nice zoo and peaceful ......lots of animals to see",
          "+\nPenguin Parade during winter at 13:30.\nHuge place, and continuing to expand, with new extension in 2020.\nWalked 3 hours and didn't even finish it all.",
          "Lovely place, well conceived for families with outdoor kids facilities, a small train, great caffetteria.",
          "The Zurich zoo is great. We have an annual pass which becomes worth it after only 3 or 4 visits. We live 20 minutes (by public transport) from the zoo so it's a great way to fill a morning/afternoon or whole day. The animal enclosures are \u2026",
          "Iove It I can remember going there every weekend with my parents. Till this day I like to go there. Would recommend for anyone that likes anlimals.",
          "Becoming more animal friendly with remodeled cages. Almost walking in a park feeling. Educational for kids.",
          "Into the wild",
          "A beautiful zoo in zurich. Nice to visit with children. There are wide variety of animals along with an aquarium.",
          "Good place.\nLess option of food",
          "Children really enjoyed the place. Specially the aquarium part. But I think, there should be few more animals.",
          "Very nice zoo that is definitely worth seeing it's a nice place to walk usually not crowded or busy I would not put it at the top of my list but is worth a visit if you are in Switzerland in Zurich kids will love it however. There is a nice \u2026",
          "Elephants are great. Small fences. Close to animals. Huge Tiger",
          "A must see when you have kids. Not only the animals - the playgrounds are great fun, as well. Be prepared to walk, the zoo is big (which is good as it also means that the animals have more space). We got an annual pass (family), really worth it when you have a LO who wants to go basically every day.",
          "Parking was full and had to park far away. Additionally, the parking machine does not accept notes or other currency",
          "Interesting place. Not much information in English though. The Zoolingo or petting zoo is probably the most interesting especially during feeding time.",
          "Lovely and much space for the animals.",
          "Small enough to not be overwhelmed but large enough to keep you busy for the better part of the day. Plenty of indoor exhibits for cold/wet days. The penguin parade in the winter is a favorite. We love how the zoo is decorated and the layout of small paths that makes my kid feel like he is exploring the wilderness.",
          "One of the best zoos in Switzerland. Great with kids. Get a Subscription, otherwise expensive.",
          "Really nice themed zoo. The tropical forrest hall is awesome and the new elephants cage also. Really enjoyed my time here!",
          "So natural animal world",
          "We will never get tired of this place! A must if you live or pass by Zurich",
          "Animal enclosures are huge, and the zoo itself spans a large area- we were exhausted at the end of the day! But we had a lot of fun, especially with the elephants, which was a separate building. There was even a mini rainforest!",
          "Very large and well maintained",
          "Best zoo I have ever visited. Well worth the experience. Just wish their information plaques also included English names and translations, but guess there is an app for that anyway \ud83d\udc4d",
          "It's a little difficult on a cold, rainy day, but still we had a good time seeing the animals and interacting with the staff. Its entrance is just a little walk from the end of the No. 6 Zoo tram. The snack bar offered stew and a grilled sausage that was better than we expected.",
          "It's great for full or half day a familly trip in any weather conditions.",
          "Highly recommend the penguin walk! I liked that I saw a few different animals being released for walks; the zoo seems quite humane to their animals (with the exception of the ape exhibits - those seemed too small)",
          "We all like to see a zoo every now and then. The Z\u00fcrich Zoo shows adequate hygiene and care for their animals of which they also have a large variety. I really like the updated information plates that they have in the aquarium are where \u2026",
          "Very nice place for refreshments and entertainment.",
          "This is an amazing zoo, the rainforest alone was worth the visit. The winding pathways and hidden shortcuts made the experience more fun for the kids. We had a great visit.",
          "Decent zoo, but nothing really special. A lot of construction at the moment to improve leaving of animals and visitor experience",
          "Was suprised that in a cold country animals are taken good care",
          "Great place to spend an afternoon.  Even if it\u2019s rainy there are enough indoor attractions to keep you occupied for several hours.  And if it\u2019s not raining the playgrounds are alone are worth a visit.  We have yearly passes and I find they \u2026",
          "Great zoo to visit. Alittle expensive to enter but if you're in Zurich it's worth it.",
          "One of the best zoo's that I have been to. Very family friendly, good place to take your kids for some educational and quality time.",
          "Good i like it",
          "Place is big and nice",
          "Great zoo, perfect family day out. Bring a picnic, prices are steep.",
          "Not a huge zoo, but they have all the \"Staples\" that you would expect to see at a zoo. Our 2 year old definitely enjoyed herself.  \n\nA huge Savannah exhibit is under construction, to be finished by 2020. I guess that will be interesting to visit.",
          "Z\u00fcrich Zoo has come a long way to now be one of the best. Animals have very large natural habitats to roam around. Visitors are \"guests\" with them. Check out the elefants or kangaroo. More in the works.",
          "A lovely experience on a fine sunny March Sunday with a funny penguin parade and lots of other beautiful animals. Would recommend for a day out with the kids!",
          "Beautiful zoo. Penguin parade was awesome.",

          "Even when it is crowded,you can enter the zoo easily by buying mobile tickets on their website.The place really is gigantic, tons of stuff to do and beautiful animals and environments! Definitely a must do",
          "One of the best zoos I've ever been to, always finding new things every visit.",
          "Zoo is getting bigger and bigger every year fantastic zoo",
          "Nice",
          "It was very cold outside, and thus many animals were inside. However, there were a lot of spacious places to visit inside. Aquarium, Rain forest and elephants were the highlights for me.\nDidnt make that many pictures though",
          "Always worth a visit",
          "Not the biggest zoo, but pretty cool. They have like 3-4 species of big cats, a whole place for australian animal, giant tortoises and most importantly capybaras :). Was about 20 chf if im not mistaken",
          "Penguins are sooooooooo cute! I spent seven weeks there for animal ecology course and I just love this zoo, especially the aquarium. Nice place to visit!",

          "Wonderful place for every one special for children! Try one time ...",
          "Awesome zoo. Definitely plan to spend the whole day! We loved the play grounds. They were great for breaks. Only complaint from my 6 year old son is that he didn't get to see the wolves (his favorite animal). We might have to come back after 2020 when the Lewa Savanna is done. We also loved the peacocks and chickens walking around.",
          "The Zoo was a great experience, both indoor and outdoor. It might get pretty chilly in the winter, but in mid-November it was still nice enough to walk around comfortably. \n\nIt felt more like you were intruding on the animals\u2019 living space, \u2026",
          "Visited many zoo.\nI find this one as one of the best in Europe.\nWorth visiting.. Also has butterfly \nNice experience of tropical forests. \nHuge\nGood for family outing \nCost around 14 bugs. Much less for kids",

          "Last year we visited the Valencia Biopark and I thought that is the most beautiful zoo, but I was wrong. The most beautiful zoo is Zurich Zoo. And they have tigers.",
          "Top",
          "Great zoo and the animals seem happy. On the expensive side, but this is Switzerland. Getting food can be tricky around peak hours although there are a few options. I wish the bathrooms were a bit more tidy (again, what did I expect at peak \u2026",
          "This is our first visit to Zurich zoo and I am comparing this with my previous Zoo visits in India UK and Singapore. \n\nVery compact but covers most animals, was expecting Polar Bear and Panda which was a bummer for my Son. But we enjoyed \u2026",

          "I am obsessed with zoos and this has been one of the best ones in Europe! Do not miss the rainforest, such a unique experience. Alsuch a variety of animals and very well done enclosures, very natural and spacious. I did skip the ape house \u2026",
          "Great Zoo to spend a Sunday with your family. Try the brunch at the elephant site, you'll will enjoy it for sure.",
          "Great zoo, treats animals well, and always growing",
          "Tickets can be pricey but its worth it. Amazing variety of animals in their native environment. Plenty of fun activities in the park, loads of restaurants and vendors. It's good fun for the entire family, but weekends are to be avoided if you are a tourist,since it can get very crowded.",
          "The new elefantpark and rainforest are my favorites.",
          "As far as zoos go, this is a nice one. With the expansion plan going on (a large Savana-type area is set to open in 2020), it might even be great. But compared to Munich zoo, which is the best I've ever visited, it pales in comparison - the \u2026",

His impressive architecture with dozens of towers, courts and his astonishing park on a peninsula between the rivers Sihl and Limmat has become one of the main sights of the Old City District of Zurich.\nThe exhibition tour takes the visitor from prehistory through ancient times and the Middle Ages to the 20th century (classic modern art and art of the 16th, 17th and 18th century is settled mainly in the Kunsthaus Museum in a different part of the city of Zurich). There is a very rich section with gothic art, chivalry and a comprehensive collection of liturgical wooden sculptures, panel paintings and carved altars. Zunfthaus zur Meisen near Fraum\u00fcnster church houses the porcelain and faience collection of the Swiss National Museum. There are also: a Collections Gallery, a place where there are Swiss furnishings being exhibited, an Armoury Tower, a diorama of the Battle of Murten, and a Coin Cabinet showing 14th, 15th, 16th century Swiss coins and even some coins from the Middle Ages.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nThe boats of the Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft start their round trips (Swiss National Museum\u2013Wollishofen\u2013Z\u00fcrichhorn) on the Limmat through the city of Z\u00fcrich at the Swiss National Museum.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Landesmuseum Z\u00fcrich at Wikimedia Commons\n\nNational Museum Zurich",

          "As a local we visited for a temporary exhibition (Games). The set-up and all pieces were put together nicely and entertaining. We will definitively come again to see the standard museum section ...",
          "Very informative! A beautiful museum in heart of Zurich. Must see for first time visitor! Great for children also, interactive display s!",
          "This museum is worth a visit. It tells the history of Switzerland and Zurich. It has many artifacts that is well presented, both in a traditional way and with more modern multi media.",
          "Amazing museum to visit !! They present a big part from the history of s Seiterland in a very nice and professional way.",
          "I do not choose museums very often when I only have a short time in a city. I went here right as it opened on a Sunday. Every exhibit was beautifully presented in a light, expansive setting. I especially liked how they used modern technology to augment the exhibits. Spent 2",
          "The combination of the old, \u201ctraditional\u201d building and the new building is a great success. The architecture alone is worth visiting the museum. There are a lot of interesting exhibitions, for me the most interesting was Swiss history from the early days to the present. In",
          "The museum was undergoing some renovation, so had to walk long distance to some exhibits. On the whole, nice place to visit if you have time to spare to view some interesting exhibits like the country\u2019s history & achievements. Nicer if it\u2019s free \ud83d\ude0b",
          "Excellent architecture & visually stunning Illuminarium light festival! Memorable winter experience!",
          "this places will need 3-4 hours. I really like the way the items are showcased and inflammation are extracted",
          "The museum has several permanent exhibitions and severyal termporary exhibitions. We saw one on \"Indian textiles\" - a great combination of Indian history, its economic development during the colonial times, the involvement of Swiss trading and manufacturing companies in the",
          "For a first-time visitor to Switzerland I think this is a must see. The historical story is very well told and illustrated in the key languages.I learnt a lot about the history of the Swiss which explains their rather quaint attitude to modern life. Coffee shop is OK",
          "The museum is well designed with good displays. I can't say that there were any stellar items but the museum has an extensive collection of good artifacts, plus very well executed special displays.",
          "During winter holidays time, after dark they offer a show, open air, in the museum yard, for some 15chf or so. It's a sort of cartoon story, full of colour, that lasts almost one hour and they broadcast it on the museum walls, Very well designed and performed.",
          "We rocked up and had no expectations accept we were interested in Swiss history. The friendly staff suggested an English speaking tour. So we had a quick browse through on section then moved to the tour. As it happened we were the only couple on the tour. So by accident we had",
          "The building alone is a work of art! Be prepared to stay and explore the museum for a day. So much artifacts and knowledge to digest. The best part, it\u2019s located at the heart of the city\u2014walking distance from the train station!",
          "We stoppedby chance at this exceptional museum located right next to the train station. the exhibits were so interesting and compelling that we stayed almost the entire day. Do check the West wing as well as the exhibit about Zurich that includes an uncanny collection of objects",
          "Enjoyable, easy to walk around within the museum and easy to find as is right in the middle of the city, exhibitions are well explained using the current medias, must visit when in Zurich...",
          "Such an impressive museum I\u2019d say is the best in Zurich I recommend it to everybody as one of the best experiences",
          "Well documented history of Zurich in a fantastic building, The captions were in English.We used Zurich Card to gain entry.",
          "This is not a large museum. It briefly covers history of Switzerland. It may be worth to spend 1-2 hours time for a walk. But if you have already visited the history in other museum in Switzerland, better not to go.",
          "I was impressed with the number and types of exhibits. The Madonna and Child, one of the few works to survive the iconoclasm of 1524, was in good condition. There was a great collection of field guns including the 1620's light cannon consisting of leather-clad copper tubes.",
          "Loved the history of Switzerland, really made our trip even better. Highly recommend, cost was 10 Swiss franks",
          "Landesmuseum is located at just a short walk from the Zurich central train station. It has an extensive collection of several artifacts related to Swiss history and culture. Certainly would very highly recommend visiting this museum to anyone seeking an insight into Swiss",
          "I only had an hour available and concentrated on the history of Switzerland over the last 300-400 years section (One area of 9 to choose from). Only 10f and well worth it. Staff were helpful and covered all my questions. Lockers available for (refundable) 2f",
          "Very modern and innovative exhibit in the foyer about Switzerland. It's worth visiting the museum just for this part. Also has some Roman and other artefacts, and a rotational exhibit. It is included with the Swiss Pass and it is worth spending a little time to learn more",
          "A small history museum. There is one area devoted to Swiss history, one area devoted to Indian cotton making with several videos on cotton making and the dyeing process. Very interesting. Another area had items from the BC to about 800 AD. The museum is not easy to maneuver",
          "The Landesmuseum provides the visitor with a thoughtfully laid out exhibit on the history of the country, its formation and its culture. It is convenient if you are in Zurich, just beside the main train station, and you can cover it in 2-4 hours. Information is available in",
          "The Swiss National Museum or landesmuseum is located directly behind the train station. The historic original building is gorgeous and stunning. Besides this building, there is a modern addition also. It is 10 CHF to enter. Free for children under 16. Closed on Monday, it",
          "This museum is located near the Rail Station and is easy to access and experience. It provides a wonderful overview of Swiss history. There is also a nice section that would be of interest to school age children and adults alike. There are clean bathrooms and a nice",
          "This museum has several different sections, but the section that makes it worthwhile is the History of Switzerland. The history is presented in an understandable and interesting way with text in English, German, French, and Italian. It's broken up by century, with the major",
          "Some very interesting exhibits (eg history of Zurich) but major installation of decorative arts underway so much is closed off. Check what you want to see before going.New installation opens around mid October (I think). Also some sort of building works and possibly roadworks",
          "Landesmuseum is one of the top tourist attraction in Zurich. It is located just next to Zurich Train Station. We reached here at 9.30 in the morning but we were told that it opens from 10 AM to 5 PM. Since we had to take our walking tour we could not see it. The exterior was",
          "Located directly across from the Zurich HB. Museum has lovely paintings and art displays. Museum is a couple of floors. Nice way to learn about Swiss history.",
          "This museum is extremely well laid out and creates excellent exhibits. However, unless you are interested in the specific exhibit at the time, it may not be of interest to you and it is not an historical museum. It is on the Swiss Pass.",
          "Yes, they present some interesting artefacts and helps tourists appreciate swiss history. But having to back up all the exhibits when visiting a museum is a first for me. Especially not recommended when bringing a toilet trained toddler. It took such a long walk to get to the",
          "If you like the history and you want to know more about Swiss history you can visit and enjoy. The building is spectacular",
          "A very well presented museum, showing the history of Switzerland, quite often with interaction. However, when I visited, they evidently were doing renovations, which meant quite a bit of walking between the different parts of the exhibitions. But still worth a visit",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this museum. The displays were thoughtful, respectful, and very well designed. The interactive sections were a wonderful compliment to the display items. The construction that was happening while we were there made it somewhat confusing to",
          "They were doing some major renovations so not sure if it\u2019s always that way but museum was split into 5 easy to see sections which we comfortably saw in a few hours. Was actually nice as many of the museums in Europe have so much great stuff you can\u2019t see it all. This one was",
          "This museum may not seem impressive from the outside, but is quite modern in the inside. We were lucky to get there just before the free guided tour, which was great with showing us the highlights. Great for a rainy day.",
          "This is one of my personal favorite museums. It is in a beautiful historical building. It really well done and is consistently being improved. I recommend it to anyone visiting Z\u00fcrich even on a train layover (literally on the other side of the street on the right of the",
          "Beautiful museum If you\u2019re interested in history then this is definitely for you All about Zurich Usually no queues but if your groups around you\u2019re best to get tickets for peak times ( July- September )",
          "The museum has lots of information about the history and geography of Switzerland. Most of this has English translations. It's a shame that a whole floor of the museum was under construction but I'm sure it will be great when finished.",
          "Beautiful museum, interactive, interesting, 2 hours of great excitement and real pleasure. I recommend as must see in Zurich.",
          "We enjoyed our visit here, & we learned a great deal about Switzerland. Much of it is interactive as well. My teenager enjoyed that aspect. I highly recommend a visit to this museum.",
          "The nation building story begins in the 1400s and continues to present day. Information about events and artifacts is in several languages. Some things we learned: why and how they choose democracy, what they mean by equality and how they pursue it; why they chose neutrality and",
          "I will be the first to say we did not visit but we did see it on several occasions. It was one of the few landmarks you could make out from the top of Uetliberg. It was a very impressive building that I wish I had had more time to visit.",
          "The museum has such a wide variety of fascinating exhibits you could spend a few days there. It depicts the history of Switzerland and early Europe. The age of many of the artefacts was astounding. The 20th century\u2019s exhibits were really interesting as I could relate to many of",
          "I was awed and spent a long time in the exhibit on the political history of Switzerland. It was intensely interesting and answered many questions. And it has certain frankness about Switzerland's history and its current challenges.",
          "I had a very enjoyable experience here and it accommodates many people in terms of the topics covered and the interactivity available. The exhibits range from pre-history to modern days and there is interesting information accompanying each artifact. The interactivity is one of",
          "There are works going on around and in this museum. We were fascinated to find that with the refurbishment they had provided a kind of transportable passage from one area to another around the outside of the museum's 2nd floor I think. Lots of people and school groups",
          "If you like history, this is totally worth the price of admission. Had technology I had never experienced before in a museum. Across the main train station. Free if you have a Zurich card",
          "We arrived at the museum at around 15:00 and we spent two very enjoyable hours wandering around. An amazing exhibition was the \"scapegoat\". We didn't see everything in the museum because the closing time was 17:00. If ever we are back in Zurich, we would almost certainly come",
          "located just next to the main railway station (Hauptbahnhof), the Landesmuseum hosts a permanent and several temporary exhibitons on the history of Zurich and Switzerland. the new build annex is worth the visit also for its architecture. the old part looks old, but it is not.",
          "My knowledge in museum is not that much, but I found this museum really informative, modern and technologically advanced. It wasn\u2019t boring at all. You could spend a whole day. In fact when we went to buy the ticket, the lady at the counter suggested we could go out and come",
          "We had not the time to see it all, but the exhibition on swiss history was fine. The restaurant is also a nice place to take a break.",
          "I expected a lot from this museum. The building is impressive, the contents less so. It doesn\u2019t really draw you in and is in parts, simply confusing. The staff seemed disinterested and lacked that enthusiasm that one gets in the great museums. I gave up in the end.",
          "I love museums. But this one was a chaotic jumble from the moment I was given a map. The presentation of Swiss history felt sanitized and lacked depth. I entered two exhibits from the back end because directions were so confusing. The exhibit labels were often difficult to",
          "This is very good museum in the centre in front of the main railway station .You need more than an hour here for a quick look.",
          "This is a big museum. The building is big and tall.The exhibits good.This is in front of the main railway station.",
          "Work on an addition and renovations has made the Museum challenging to visit. However, there is a new permanent exhibit using Point Cloud technology that engulfs the viewer in the story of Zurich. My friends and I arrived at the Landesmuseum late one afternoon. The ticket seller",
          "The exhibition on Switzerland\u2019s history is well worth a visit, it is made in a very interactive and mosern way with lots of detailed info if you wish to. Divided per time periods, its easy to follow and leads you through the developments. Plan up to 2 hours, there is a nice cafe",
          "We saw here the exhibition of Swiss history. It is incredibly well made, you can load an app over the free wifi and listen to the audioguide for free. There is a lot of information next to the exhibits and also audio-visual explanations. Price was 10 Francs for adults and 8 for",
          "We were so disappointed at our whole experience when visiting this museum. The highlight was the well appointed museum shop which was excellent. The museum has very large rooms that appeared cold and uninviting, and largely empty. There was no apparent flow to the place and",
          "We visited this museum with high hopes after seeing excellent museums in London and Amsterdam. We wanted to get a good overview of Swiss history, and Zurich in particular. We allowed ourselves 4 hours to visit, as we generally find museums fascinating. The first problem in this",
          "My husband and I visited the museum on a 2 day stopover in Zurich. We received free admission with the ZurichCard we purchased for public transit. The museum was different than we expected - it has fewer exhibitions and less history than anticipated. That being said - we very",
          "This completely renovated museum is not big but is a sensational introduction to Swiss History and culture. Up to date media is used to guide the visitor of all ages through the main details of the Swiss people and its country. Not to miss!",
          "The outside of the museum is nice looking next to the river. The inside is fairly big but only 20% of it has something to exhibit. It is 10 Franc to enter but not much interesting to see. That is the worst national museum I had ever seen. There are some permanent exhibition in a",
          "The swiss national museum is located in a very beautiful building and they have built a new one behind it. Inside you have two different museums: one is free and the other is not. It is on work now and it doesn't have a lot of things. Very expensive for what they offer at the",
          "Content wise I was able to understand the history and spirit of Zurich or even Switzerland. Calvin, Red Cross, voting rights to women in 1971. But from the form perspective, they could do more and better. Maybe it is this protestant spirit or as I read in other reviews it is",
          "We were a bit disappointed to find out that a huge part of the museum was closed for preparation of new exhibits. It was January, and we knew that on this trip a lot of places would be closed for that reason. But so much of this museum was closed! However, we did see the the",
          "Swiss National Museum first which is just a few hundred meters from the bus station. Entrance was 8 Swiss francs and the museum hold objects from the prehistoric times up to the renaissance including an exhibition on modern day immigrants at the end. Particularly nice was the",
          "The Museum is promising, but they are restoring some part of the museum and now they only have a small part from the 1918 public protests, the hippy/pease revolution of the 60 dees and geology of Switzerland. I would recommend waiting for the finish of the restoration. P.S.",
          "Swiss National Museum is displayed the beautiful garden and chateau. Visiting Zurich without seeing it is absolutely worthless. Had a great informative day.",
          "Not too much to see but overall interesting. It tells a general history of Switzerland. The cafe is way overpriced but it is a big museum with interactive activities that are intriguing.",
          "I had a few hour layover in Zurich and wanted to see/learn about the history of Switzerland. The permanent collection, that according to the guide book explains all that, is closed for renovations (after leaving the museum I saw a sign in German, which I do not speak, that",
          "Visited the museum with the family on a snowy/rain Sunday. The museum is housed in a very nice building just across the main train station so access could not be easier. Everything is very clean, organised and well displayed as expected (although some more english labels would",
          "So beautiful inside of a spectacular castle. With iPads you could interact with Suisse country and its history. Interesting exhibition about the strikes of 1918 and the Suisse during 1968. Reccomended. If you have the zurich transportation card you enter for free.",
          "I think the Swiss National Museum has the potential to be an amazing museum. They have lots of interactive parts to their exhibits that really capture your attention and draw you in. My problem is that there is a general lack of focus around national history, despite it being",
          "We were in Zurich for 3 days and the last day was very cold. Kids didn\u2019t want to walk too much so we decided to go to the Landesmuseum as we read was very nice for kids and offered interactive activities. What we read was totally true, not only is very interesting (besides the",
          "I went to the Swiss national museum on christmas day as not much else was open. To the guided tour highlights of the museum. Loved every item that was included in this tour had a significant part of Swiss history to tell. Afterwards walked around the museum myself and with",
          "When I arrived in Z\u00fcrich, I realised that I knew almost nothing about Switzerland (other than the essentials). A visit to the Landesmuseum fixed that. It isn\u2019t flashy - the exhibits focus on quality rather than quantity. I think they\u2019ve struck a good balance between artefacts",
          "My wife and went to the museum because it was raining and we had admission included in our city pass. We were pleasantly surprised at how well this museum traces the history of Switzerland and its contributions to Europe and then the world. There are interactive displays",
          "Landesmuseum contains so many history and stuff about Zurich. It includes food, culture, famous people, history, room style and so on. I learned a lot here. I strongly suggest visitors who visit Zurich first time should spend a morning or a afternoon here to under the place you",
          "We were hoping for some kind of linear story - taking us through the centuries, in chronological order, explaining what happened, in what order, so that we could understand how Switzerland became what is today. Instead what we got was a load of random stuff making it really hard",
          "This is the most futuristic museum I\u2019ve been to, to date. The exterior architecture looks like a building from Hogwarts. The museum has interactive displays that are adult and kid-friendly. My favorite was the interactive book and the iPads attached to displays that slide in",
          "My boyfriend and I had about a 6 hour layover in between flights and decided to get out and explore as much as we could. We walked around Banhofstrasse - hit a cafe for some coffee and brioches and then went to the museum. Honestly for $10 it was great. We were surprised by the",
          "The museum is under construction and didn't really have any exhibits that told much about Swiss history. Their main exhibits where about a strike in 1918 and a 2nd exhibit about 1968 and the trends and issues of the times. We were hoping for information on the history of the",
          "Museum visiting hours is 10 am to 5 pm and it has free entry for those who have Zurich Card. I have reached there half an hour before the closing museum and I just walk around in 30 minutes. I found nothing much interesting inside the museum.",
          "One of the worst museum waste of time I have encountered. We were expecting a fantastic place and had alloted a large piece of time to view, kept looking for something of interest. Left and went outside to enjoy Zurich. I think 75% of the museum had to be closed for viewing",
          "\u20ac8 with student discount. Really wasn't worth it. Spent about 40 minutes in there and expected more in a big city museum. Regret going there to be honest, didn't miss anything if you skipped it. Bits on history of the city on one section and then I don't even know What the other",
          "We found ourselves with several hours to kill when our flight out of Zurich was delayed, and noticed that this museum was right across the street from the main train station, where we would be leaving for the airport. What a lucky break for us! The first surprise, and treat,",
          "We visited this museum on our final day in Zurich, its easily located opposite Zurich HB. The layout was very well constructed and the museum pieces were displayed to a high standard. Some of our highlights were the interactive books, 3D telescope and interactive Swiss History",
          "Personally, I found the section on History slightly disappointing. While having learnt some new facts, in general, I found the exhibition quite boring with lots of reading to be done and few really catch-eyeing displays... The contents could have been much more interesting.",
          "We were glad we visited the museum and thankful, there were English translations. However, there wasn\u2019t a consistent flow to the museum. So, we had to keep re-orienting ourselves. There is an elevator if you have mobility issues as there are plenty of stairs.",
          "We were in Zurich for a whirlwind 2 days, we had a few hours before our train to our next destination so this attraction was perfect. Neither of us have ever been to Switzerland so this was a wonderful way to experience some interactive exhibits and learn about the history. The",
          "We spent a couple of hours at the national museum. Due to construction, some parts of the building were not open and the displays were a little bit disjointed. Altogether the museum was good and worth the time. All of the displays offered English text along with the standard",
          "Admission to this museum is free with a Z\u00fcrich Card. Located directly across the street from the Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof. A great place to visit, especially if the weather outside is not cooperative. Houses some very ancient artifacts as well as recent history items. A great way",
          "We decided to spend an afternoon at the Swiss National Museum and this was an afternoon well spent. We particularly liked the temporary food exhibition and the permanent Swiss history and Archeological sections, which provide great insight. I would recommended the former of the",
          "We where just waking around and stumbled on this museum. Along with Swiss history they have some pop art. Plan on a couple of tovsee all the exhibits. If you have time it is worth a look.",
          "Take yourself or go with friends or family to visit this great museum. Learn about swiss tradition firts hand.",
          "Lots of good insights into Swiss history, geography and its political system. I learnt things that put the everyday experiences of a tourist in Switzerland into a new light. All in a very nice space with good technology enhancements. Shed a bit of light also onto the trade offs",
          "Please do visit this place if you are a tourist in Zurich this place will give you a deep insight about the history of Switzerland",
          "Interesting, but a huge part of museum is closed for construction. Architecture is great. In the financial part, there's several references to how America undermined their great banking secrecy (that allows dictators and crooks to hide their ill gotten gains)",
          "Interesting place, would recommend to anyone. Cool things to see , so if you ride by, go take a look, totally worth your time",
          "Amazing to read about women getting the vote in the 1970s. The signs were in English. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Museum was nice to visit. Had some Interesting facts on Zurich. Would definitely recommend. Staff are really friendly too",
          "I went in the museum as I had a few hours of spare time in which it was raining outside, so for that purpose it worked very well! The museum was OK- they didn't have too much in there and what they had was on lots of different areas so if you are interested and have time it is",
          "This museum is now part of the National museum,and the entrance is through this museum.So to all intents and purposes they are one.",
          "The building itself is beautiful inside and out. Ongoing renovations--that will continue for some time--made some areas inaccessible and required long walks through internal detours. Some of the exhibits were what you'd expect in the national museum of Switzerland, but others",
          "This is without doubt one of the strangest museums I have ever visited.There is no plan,no indication of where to look for anything.There is a lot of hands on displays but the y do not compensate for the incoherence of the display.Still I did learn more about the shameful",
          "The staff was not particularly helpful in guiding us for the best experience or really saying anything to us. The museum exhibits are oddly displayed and most of the information was in German. Perhaps had we taken a tour it would have been more enjoyable. As it was, it was",
          "Reasonable price for the experience, as the range of exhibits are varied and interesting, especially the interactive ones which are a definite plus if you are visiting as a family. There is something for everyone and as a tourist, it gave me a good insight into Switzerland's",
          "A large part of this museum is devoted to special exhibitions, which we had not come to see, and we had difficulty finding the permanent exhibits (perhaps we're just stupid) but a helpful guide explained that it is in fact two buildings joined into one and it is easy to get lost",
          "Fairytale Castle in the middle of the city, is under going refurbishment and not a great show of artifacts but it can be fun for kids for how is structured and Interactive. Good activity for a couple of hours of you are i twrested on Swiss history or you have kids",

          "The exhibits are well designed and present the history of Switzerland from BC to AD times. There are many artifacts dating from pre-10,000 BC. Information is presented in English as well as German. There is so much to learn and see in a short visit.",
          "The Landesmuseum is just opposite the Zurich railroad station - cross the road, and you are there. It is housed in an old, but well preserved, building. A horse carriage near the museum attracts many for a photo session. The museum spreads to many floors. The news photographs",

          "After returning from Rapperswil via train we got attracted to see this museum by the train station. And wow it was amazing, it was a mixture of art, history, and what Zurich/Switzerland is about! A must see if you visit Z\u00fcrich!",
          "The building is located next to the train station, and it looks like a castle. The surprising fact is that it has always been a national museum. It is very well planed and they have top technology to make history interesting. They have like 3 permanent settings and 3 temporary",
          "The Swiss National Museum or Landesmuseum is right next to the central train station. It is as good as any I've been to and provides a state of the art interactive experience. There are large displays that outline the different periods in swiss history dating to the stone age",

          "I did spent a long time learning a lot about Switzeralnd. There is good collection and I would love to visit again",
          "As prominent, world museums this one is lack-luster. I found the exhibits a bit disjointed and not overly informative. They have incorporated technological aspects nicely - e.g. sliding touch screen over exhibit pieces to get more information. However, I felt like I didn't",
          "The museum is about Swiss geography, culture, history, food, money, clothes, art and so on. It is designed in a really inventive way",

          "This is a great museum with something for everything. We got in with the Z\u00fcrich Card, but it would be worth the Fr. 10 per person if you have to pay. There was a great exhibition about Swiss food.",
          "Not a retrospective of the festival at all, but an homage to the festival's founder. Which would be fine if that was how it was billed. But this is a poorly assembled bunch of memorabilia and not worth the time or money. This is basically the contents of Claude Nobs's garage.",

          "My wife and I visited while we were in Zurich for the weekend. We both loved the museum and spent around 2.5 hours here, but could hsve easily spent longer. It is only 10CHF entry and is open on a Sunday, when most other places are shut. All of the displays have various language",

          "If you are visiting One museum in Zurich, this is The One. It needs 2-3 hours to be able to see the contents of the museum. Painting, Fashion, Industry, History.... nearly every thing you want to know about the Swiss heritage. A day visit to remember.. Enjoy.",
          "We had a morning to kill before returning to the US and decided, since it was Sunday and most things are closed, to pay the Swiss National Museum a visit. Hey, I get it, the Swiss are not exactly considered to be the most exciting people in the world so we went with a little",

          "We found the museum enjoyable with its use of simple digital technology to make mundane facts more interesting. The museum can take a minimum of 2 hours to view in entirety. A part of it is also under renovation. Some areas are designed to engage children which could be a plus",

          "Really interesting. You can admire amazing ancient documents and diplomas, dresses ... lots of objects and interesting historical news ... But in the bookshop I wasn\u2019t able to find a book in English or French!",
          "I thought this museum was interesting and I could have spent a lot longer reading everything and really soaking it all in. My favorite thing was all the beautiful jewelry and their origins. My husband, however, has the attention span of a fly and was bored out of his mind. He",
          "There are some fantastic uses of technology to display concepts and histories. I did not feel I came away with a better understanding of Switzerland / Zurich. A large exhibition on some religious sight and order. very confusing to navigate.",

          "Spent an hour or so here wandering around. It's a pleasant enough place but have been to better museums. Worth downloading the app when your there for your guide",
          "Really wonderful experience. The museum covers all aspects of Swiss history from religion, demographics, archeology, industry to even topographical evolution and more. To fully see and appreciate this museum you will need around 4 hours. Kids entry was free.",
          "Overall, compared to other country museums...it\u2019s OK. I agree with everyone that it takes about 2-hours to see everything. There\u2019s interactive tablets for English/German/French. Free lockers downstairs (just need to have one franc to hold the locker). Tickets can be",
          "Really interesting museum about the history of Switzerland . The museum is free with the Zurich pass.",
          "A very nice museum, showing the history of Switzerland. It has a combination of the pride of Switzerland plus local archeology. A museum with pictures and exhibits. Highly recommended for those who do not like museums.",
          "This is quite an interesting museum, showing the history of Switzerland from neolithic times and beyond, to the present day. Archeology was very interesting, as was the topography section. We particularly liked the architecture of the building, which also added to the visit.",
          "We spent a couple of hours here and it was free on the Zurich card. It's right next to the main station too. The museum is split into a couple of areas where there are temporary exhibitions and then a few areas of permanent exhibitions. The temporary ones weren't of much",
          "Enjoyed visit. Free for Z\u00fcrichcard holders, I purchased mine from Zurich train station. Otherwise 10CHF",
          "It is a place for family to understand the History of Swiss. The place is huge. It will need sometimes to explore around. It is different from some other museums. Both my kids enjoyed.",
          "We were able to visit this museum, which is very close to the central train station in Zurich. The timing of our visit was convenient, as an English-speaking tour was starting soon after we arrived. Taking this tour allowed us to get oriented to the museum and decide where we",
          "If you after having visited the old city in Z\u00fcrich still have some hours that you don\u2019t know how to kill, then I recommend to spend them at this museum.

          "My husband and I left about 4 hours for this museum but to br honest we were done in about two hours. There are some interesting exhibits and artifacts etc and lots to read but think more could have been made of some famous Swiss people and products. For example very little was",

          "You can tell why the cost to enter is 10 CHF when you see the innovative and creative ways the museum uses technology to teach - although the museum is free with a Zurich Card. While we were a bit museum-d out when we arrived, the exhibits were fun, not too dense but a lot there",
          "I have never been in a museum with so much interactivity, clean crisp displays, and volumes of information made very simple and easy to follow. The displays invite the viewer to step into the history and explore. There is a variety of displays from the secular to the deeply",
          "Great museum although not a huge array of things, however what they did have was extremely interesting. Even having a selection of languages to select from was a plus. They even have a great gift shop",
          "The National Museum was on our list and we were not let down by the historical significance of this museum. Great collection of artworks, and artifacts from early Swiss history. We do not have anything like this in Australia. Spent several hours and could have stayed longer.",
          "we enjoyed our time at the Landesmuseum (National Museum) and of course, there is never enough time to see everything. The special exhibit had to do with the history of the Einsiedeln Abbey and how it changed over the ages. I think there is a story to be probed in how it was",
          "Also known as the Swiss National Museum, Landesmuseum is located right across the Zurich main station. If you have a Swiss Travel Pass, the ticket entry is included. If you have a student ID, you can get 2 Francs off. I first thought it would be more of a natural history museum",
          "Not a bad place to spend a few hours learning about Swiss history.. 10 francs is cheap compared to the rest of the city. Worth seeing if you have a couple hours to burn. I wish there was a little more on the banking and finance history personally but there is some information.",
          "Only had a couple of hours to spend in Zurich and we decided to go to some museums. Spent the day in just this museum as we loved it so much as there was so much to see and learn about. We were there until closing and we still hadn\u2019t seen all the exhibits!",
          "It is just one minute walk from Zurich main station and free with Zurich pass. From Zurich main station just follow the direction to \"Landesmuseum\". The museum is well maintained with lots of history about Switzerland. I have enjoyed a good time there. After completing the visit",

          "It was nice to learn about the history of Zurich and parts of Switzerland across a few different rooms and floors. The section around World War II and the Swiss role with the Soviets was probably the most interesting to see, and the temporary photo exhibition was fascinating.",
          "Perhaps it's because of the major renovation being undertaken, which means that a large section is closed off until 2021, but there really wasn't that much here to appeal to non-Swiss visitors. Signage was poor, especially for anything in English, relegated to the bottom in",
          "Enjoyed the museum very much, thought it was good value for money. The museum also has clean, accessible toilets and a lovely cafe. So even if you don't go through the displays, it is well worth a visit.",
          "Some of the logistics of display were new to me, but the displays could have been more organized. I always feel like it's important to learn the history and culture of the country and people you are visiting. Perhaps too much emphasis is put on immigration.",
          "Entrance cost 10 CHF for adults, I think kids and students have discounts. The first part is really awesome because they incorporated high technology to make everything fun but no pictures nor videos are allowed in this exhibit. Pictures and videos without flashes are allowed on",
          "Incorporating technology & activities, this splendid museum will give you an experience that is both informative and entertaining. I couldn't enjoy to the fullest as I reached just 1 hour before the closing time. I recommend at least 2 hours to experience this place.",
          "The Landesmuseum is one of the best history museums I have visited. Interesting, informative, educational and entertaining at the same time it gives a great overview of Swiss history from Prehistory, to the Romans, to the origins of the country in the Middle Ages, to the",
          "We took the highlights of the museum tour first off and had a wonderful guide who showed us through the museum and pointed out the very special items they had. We couldn't wait to get back into the museum and look more closely at the archaeology section, the history section and",

          "There was seriously something for everyone. Kids were occupied with the interactive technology exhibits. You don't need to spend the whole day here but we ended up doing the new part of the museum in the morning, having a quick and good lunch at the bistro, and then the main",

          "There is not a huge amount to see here - 4 or 5 exhibitions but it's still good for a couple of hours. This being Switzerland, there are large Ipads that contain games etc dotted around (I think they'd be stolen anywhere else!) Museum is confusing to navigate - there was a",
          "We've been to many museum like this one. They have a decent collection, especially of Christian items. I wouldn't recommend going right now because it was confusing to us and most of the people new to the museum on how to get to the different sections. Also, the construction",
          "Very good special and standing exhibitions. Good electronic guides. Take enough time to visit all the exhibitions.",
          "We were not so impressed with this museum. It was not layed out well and we had trouble getting around. The exhibits were sparse. We got in free with the Zurich card orvelse it would have cost 12 Swiss francs each. We stayed less than an hour.",
          "This museum is a good rainy day or hot sunny day activity! The hours were 10-6 and cost $10 CHF per adult! You cannot bring a backpack or large pocketbook that must be checked in the lockers downstairs. The Museum describes the history of Switzerland through the ages with",

          "Located opposite the main train station, the museum offers a good insight into the history of Switzerland and how it evolved over the ages. The displays and presentation are great and the museum is fairly large so you will spend a good 3 hours or so if you want to visit all the",
          "The Swiss view of World history is interesting to say the least. I don't think anywhere else in the world I've ever seen a view. should makes it very clearly why the swiss are not part of the EU and are neutral, their view's do not mesh with the west or east.",
          "The temporary exhibition about the soviet revolution was really well done, and the production value was extremely high.",

          "We stopped in here to see some of the archaeological finds from the area as well as get a sense of the history of Switzerland. We started with an exhibit of modern day Swiss history. The technology in place in this small area was truly outstanding. It's worth a visit to this",
          "My company organized this visit...we had a guided tour. Even if the guide was trying her best to make things interesting it was like a sleeping pill. The tour took more than 1 hr and when it finished I was ready to go to bed. Zzzzzzzz",
          "We spent a couple of hours wandering around the museum. We were quite surprised by how modern the interior of the building is. From the outside we thought we were going into an old building. I enjoyed the display on the history of Switzerland. It is hard to believe that",
          "I spent about 90 minutes here (had a train to catch) after opening on Sunday morning. I was really impressed by the size, quality, and curation of the exhibition on the 1917 Russian Revolutions, with a special focus on connections to Swiss and Switzerland. This was an excellent",
          "Taking a short tour at S.N.M opens a window to swiss, from old days to nowadays.small museum but effective. Thanks to staff and managers for accompanying exhibition for the anniversary of Russian revolution .",
          "An interesting Russian 1917 revolution exhibition on currrently, lots about Lenin in Switzerland. Costume section well presented. Lots of walking between areas as a new section is being built. Lovely building with lockers for your bags/coats. The weather section was a bit basic",
          "A number of museums rightly or wrongly can be a real case of information overload. This is a concise and very informative museum on the history of Switzerland. The exhibition on Lenin and Switzerland was very good and answered a lot of questions. Consistent with the theme of",
          "Tough to get into the flow of the museum as the rooms doubled back on each other, the history was disjointed and it just didn't match up to any other \"National\" museum we've visited. The special exhibition of religious artifacts and tapestry's; however, was well done and worth",
          "I enjoyed it but did not think you should spend a whole afternoon there. For that matter, only go if you have already got the Zurich card to cover your museum admission.",
          "Loved how interactive this place was. British museums have a lot to live up to! Great building, friendly staff and very interesting to look around.",
          "This museum is very interesting and interactive. I was spending a few days in Switzerland to sightsee and realized I should probably actually learn a bit about the country's historu! Really nice exhibits and would be good for families. I especially loved the big interactive map",
          "Swiss National Museum is located directly on the river Limmat, with a park behind it and in close proximity to the main station.",
          "I really recomment a visit to this fantastic museum located just opposite the mail railway station in the heart of Zurich. As an history lover I really enjoyed the very interesting exhibtion \"The Revolution of 1917. Russia and Switzerland.\" (ends June 25th). I did not know that",
          "An excellent museum of Swiss history. Well designed and laid out with strong and interesting English descriptions. Feels very much like a Smithsonian. Was particularly struck by how accessible and fun it would be for children to interact with and learn from \u2013 while still being",
          "We really enjoyed the small cafe in the museum as well! The halls were clean and informative! Definitely worth the stop!",
          "Overall the museum is interesting, but I found the migrants and national history sections lacking in substance and hence a bit boring. The Christmas nativity scenes made by nuns are amazing, the attention to detail is astounding on some of them especially the decoupage scene.",
          "Went on a teacher's trip to the museum organised by our history department 10 Chf to get in and the museum is connected by subway from the main station It was my first time since the recent renovation and the new wing Architecturally the museum ' a mock medieval Castel 'is",
          "What is there not to like? 2 steps from the Hauptbahnhof, near the Spitzplatz park, exceptional religious artifacts, beautiful art, a very cute expo of centuries old dresses and shoes... interesting insights on the historical working life. All inside a huge decorated castle.",
          "This is a wonderful place to learn about the history and culture of Switzerland. They recently opened their extension wing which gives them much more exhibit place. I like the architecture of the original wing more - it is out of a fairy-tale.",
          "Balanced and engaging museum - learned a lot. A pity that part of it was under-construction. Basement level exhibition with tapestries and Zurich-scape is good.",
          "Useful info: entrance 10CHF, it's open from 10 to 5 everyday except Monday. So it is zurich, it is Switzerland... the museum it's not representative for the country, its history and culture. The map of the museum is useless as you cannot use it to understand where you are and",
          "The entrance is about 8 CHF and it is worthy. There are all the moments of Switzerland's culture, from archeological items (with fantastic devices you can interact with) to nowadays, like the integration issue. Visit it!",
          "A cool museum if you are into history. We planned to stay there 1h and we end spending the entire afternoon there and have to leave the museum without having the possibility to finish the visit and now we are planning to come back there to finish it.",
          "The museum is in full restoration mode with concrete halls, steps leading nowhere much, deviations around unknown treasures and general confusion in the \"right \" path to take. Slightly self-conscious Swissness in the exhibition features, which is to be expected in a National",
          "Opposite the Zurich HB Station, this one is handy to spend few hours. Very nicely explained history of Swiss people and some really cool exhibits. Plus they gave some puzzles for children so that they are also occupied and don't get bored",
          "We went to see one of the special exhibitions, that on refugees \"Flucht\". This was quite well done, but the rest of the museum was rather disappointing. It was difficult to find your way around this big \"bunker\", the exhibitions were in some cases modest affairs, reached down",
          "The Swiss National Museum is an outstanding history museum which one should not miss while in Zurich as it is right next to the main train station. The collection is extensive and detailed and of the highest quality!",
          "there is a lot to see and to learn, For kids there is a detective's case, leading the family on a journey of \"investigation\" and discovery. The new extention is certainly an interesting building with amazing architectonial details, but it is a bit more room than content, as a",
          "Located right next door to the main station, large museum undergoing some wider development. Helpful to learn about the swiss including the role in the major world wars and banking. The use of technology to zoom in on exhibits and english language made it engaging",
          "I had a visit on 3rd Jan'17. Nothing as special here but good to visit once as this museum is having nice updates about history, unfortunately majority (or all) of the updates are in French but not in English. There is a park behind this museum which was nice post snow fall as",
          "The museum is huge and is very well organized and interactive. We spent about 2-3 hours here on a very cold day. They have a good variety of displays but honestly I was more impressed by the technology used in the museum than the museum itself. Clever and innovative use of",
          "An excellent overview of the history and demographics of Switzerland. The special exhibits were also excellent. A great starting point either for a quick visit to Zurich or the start of a longer journey through the country.",
          "There are several interesting exhibits but most of artifacts are not \"wow\". It worth to visit it only one time.",
          "It is not a huge museum and it has limited exhibits, but it has a few nice things to see and get an idea of the Swiss history. It is not very expensive, only 10 CHF, so it can be a nice distraction at the end of the most popular shopping street.",
          "I had a weekend in Zurich by myself before flying back home, so I purchased the Zurich Tourist Card which allowed me 72 hours of free public transportation and entrance to more than 50 attractions. I am all about learning the culture so I decided to spend every morning taking in",
          "So I came here for free because of the Z\u00fcrich card. I thought it was fine for an hour. If would have had to pay CHF 10- for this, I would have been disappointed. The content is decent, but not very expansive. We all know the Swiss were (are) neutral, but I've never seen",
          "It is ok just to pass through if you have time , but it offers nothing special nothing amazing just an average museum could be much better.",
          "I can only suggest this museum if you have seen all else in Zurich. It's been renovated last year and the looks are good. But there is nearly no guidance of what there is to see. And the reason for this becomes clear when you start the visit: there is not that much to see. Well,",
          "i love world history,so i like this museum extremely. can we learn about our past. and enjoy culture too.",
          "Went to the musuem to learn about Swiss history. Some exhibits were great, others only ok. In general I learned a lot about Swiss history and saw some cool stuff, learned some neat facts. Worth a visit if you have time but don't spend all day here.",
          "The hours spent here were very enjoyable. From looking at the website and the floor plans, I didn't think no more than few hours were needed, but it is a pretty big museum. We spent 2 hours alone in the European Renaissance section. Very interesting history on Switzerland and",
          "Great exhibits of how the country was form, interesting art and historic pieces and the \"Europa in der Renaissance\" special exhibit was good. The building is beautiful next to a park, where you can take a break and just take in the city.",
          "Behind the train station is this wonderful museum about Swiss culture. It gives you a good perspective on their democracy, anything Swiss produced and products are still in existence today, proudly so. There is a good mix of artefacts and information at each display. Very easy",
          "Near the train station, the museum offers an overview of Swiss history as well as special exhibits. Lockers are available for large bags and jackets. There are guided tours available in English and other languages.",
          "The museum is an astounding, impressive French Renaissance architecture, offering lots of interesting historical exhibitions from ancient time, middle age, up to the 20th century. The place is very accessible from the train station.",
          "Located next to the Zurich railway station. This is a place to visit if you are interested in history of Switzerland.It takes around 3 hours to run through this museum There is also a cafeteria and gift shop in the entrance hall.",
          "I thoroughly enjoy museums during my travels (6 of 7 continents). Most museums I enjoy (not all) and some I love. This falls into the *love* category! What a surprise. It was somewhat of a cool day with sprinkles. It was a spur of the moment decision to go. It is very",
          "Conveniently located next to the main railway station. I had only a couple of hours and it became very obvious this museum and the Swiss history deserves more- will be back. There is also a cafeteria and gift shop in the entrance hall.",
          "Came here late in the afternoon on a whim so a bit late and therefore had to rush a bit but definitely a very worthwhile and affordable attraction in Zurich",
          "I was here last month and the museum is quite big and had a lot of interesting exhibit to see. The museum is a walking distance from the main Zurich station. Just follow the sign direction from the train station and you won't miss it. camera is not allowed in the museum so no",
          "In fall 2016 they have a very thorough, impressive exhibition on the European Renaissance. It's a large, well curated, well explained, interactive and fun exhibition with excellent explanations in English, Italian, French, and German. This museum is free with the Zurich Card so",
          "Loved touring the 2 museums that make up the Swiss National Museum in Zurich. They included the National Museum, and the Rococo rooms holding the collection of faience and porcelain. If you have to pick just one, do the \"Landesmuseum,\" in the main building near the Zurich",
          "located right behind the main train station. Don't miss this one ... in particular on a rainy day. You will need many hours to visit this historical museum .... A must if you stay a few days in town + want to know more about Swiss history, culture and etc. Highly recommendable",
          "The museum is recently renovated. The displays inside, gives anyone an excellent insight and experience on Switzerland culture and history. All the exhibits are well displayed in roomy halls giving any museum visitor the time and place to admirer in great detail. What is so",
          "A special Renaissance exhibit was on loan to this museum this month and it was quite impressive. Photos were not permitted, but the permanent collection allowed photos, and the building itself and architecture were charming. Well worth the visit whilst in Zurich.",
          "I received free admission as part of the Zurichcard I purchased. I learned a great deal about Swiss history. There was always an English translation at each exhibit. It was not large, but enjoyable.",
          "Well worth the time spent. Managed to be just in time for a guided tour which gave a great overview of the museum (took 1 hour) and then spent more time exploring areas we wanted to go back to. The recreation of rooms with highly decorated wooden panels, stained glass windows,",
          "We visited this museum on a rainy Sunday afternoon. At times it was great, the Renaissainc exhibition was interesting, but nothing we hadn't seen elsewhere What I was really interested in was what it means to be Swiss ? Interesting progression from the Celts through the",
          "This museum has a few different sections that aren't really related except for being Swiss. There was a section with mostly classical era art, another for prehistoric artifacts. My favorite area had more modern exhibits that gave a lot of interesting information about how the",
          "This was one of the best museums I've ever visited and I recommend it if you're in Zurich. It's in a central location (opposite the train station) and entry is free with the Zurich card. Expect to spend about 2-3 hours here if you take your time and read the information. You can",
          "This was my third trip to the museum. They have changed some displays, but the overall layout is well done. There is much to be learned about Switzerland and something new every time.",
          "We can learn about history of Swizerland, archaelogy, Europe in the renaissance,in a very evocative building.",
          "Visited new extension building for first time -awesome architecture. Renaissance exhibition very educational and well presented. Great place to spend a few hours.",
          "We saw the special exhibit on the Renaissance in Europe which used items from the museum as well as borrowed artifacts. Descriptions were in German and English. Nice little cafe in the museum.",
          "We visited it before but renovation now is complete and nice blend of old and new. Very interesting on all counts and nice cafe/bistro as well. To many interesting things to go through but would have interest to anyone and nice to learn more about the Swiss. We love Switzerland",
          "I would stress the architecture of the new part 1st. Very cool and modern design that gives good room for the special exhibitions happening there. The museum itself is very loaded and informative. I do like it and it is fun walking around. However the classical suppression of",
          "On my week long visit to Switzerland landed at 6 in morning in Zurich. Since my check in was at 3 in noon so took day pass 24 CHF from tourist information and it included all public transport + 90 minutes of lake cruise + this museum as well. After mu cruise i had something to",
          "The museum is situated in a historic building which is great from inside and outside. There is a permanent exposition of Swithzerland history as well as changing exhibitions.",
          "We were a little surprised with how much we enjoyed this museum. It was well organised and interesting. The museum begins in prehistory and concludes in the modern age. We didn't spend too much time on any one area and moved quickly.",
          "When I went in August 2016, there was a temporary exhibit on the Europe Renaissance period and this seemed to be the main attraction, occupying all the main halls. Although interesting at first, it got a bit boring towards the end. The permanent exhibit on Swiss history was",
          "We enjoyed the temporary exhibit on the Renaissance in Europe. The rooms were laid out expertly with good use of space and a variety of exhibit types to keep it interesting. Some were even interactive. They had some good art (some we recognized from our high school",
          "I saw the Europe in the Renaissance exhibition, it was very broad but lots of interesting pieces. The building is very modern and minimal inside despite the castle like appearance from the outside.The museum shop is full of beautiful things. I enjoyed a quick visit as part of a",
          "The clever display techniques,especially in the Archeology section with its touch screen reader iare superb.If you ever wanted to teach a \"history denier\" the value of a museum,you should start with this one!",
          "It costs CHF 10 per person. We were told to check in our backpacks and purse. The locker costs CHF 1 but you do get it back when you retrieve your stuff. Exhibitions were a mix, some interesting others were quite boring. The place is huge, prepare to spend at least 3 hours",
          "Well this is one of the interesting place I visited in Z\u00fcrich. Most of the things in Switzerland are expensive but I think 10 Swiss Fr.is very worthy to spend for this spot. It is one of the biggest museum I have seen during my stay in Europe.. it's a must to explore and see",
          "This exhibition is very well curated. The collection of objects, chosen to show the spread of ideas, art, skills and political life across Europe during the renaissance has a breadth and depth that might interest anyone. The objects on display are well presented and the",
          "We were at the night of open museums, where you have entrance to all Z\u00fcrich museums and included public transportation \"Museumsnacht\" We spent almost 3 hours and time flies. Different themes and also for kids there is a researcher kit, so they can explore the museum combined",
          "The museum is really big and has a lot of historical pieces but could get a bit boring, especially if traveling with young kids since there aren't any activities for them, but if you are interested in Renaissance Europe this would be the prefect place for you.",
          "This is a beautiful museum featuring Renaissance period artwork and pieces presently. I believe admission was 8 CFP. If you have carry items they make you check them in the downstairs lockers. You'll need a 1 CFP coin to make the lock work. You'll get it back when you re open",
          "Even if you do not have time to go into all of the exhibits, please try to go to this museum. The architecture alone is worth the visit!",
          "Modern museum filled with fantastic history. You will need hours to explore and read the many exhibits",
          "If you have enough time left after seeing all the places in Zurich then I think it is the best places to cool down and know about some history of Swiss and Europa. I suggest you can give a try as it very near to Bahnhof.",
          "10 cf for the entire complex of buildings which house about 6 major exhibits. The newer exhibit on Europe during the Renissance is the highlight, but the armory and prehistoric Switzerland are not to be missed. Right next to the main train station.",
          "We decided to tour the museum since it was in a perfect spot--right beside the Main Train station --- and we were not disappointed! The displays were organized, and interesting. They had a beautiful costume display that dated back to the 1100's. They had a very interesting art",
          "I really like this museum for the fact that they have thought about how to display their artifacts so that you can see them even when there is a crowd. They also have lots of interactive screens, which are in multiple languages, unlike some museums where you cannot read any",
          "we went to see the \"Renaissance in Europe\" exhibit. Extremely well done, instructive and comprehensive. Reasonably priced at 10 sfr. Recommendable place!",
          "This is a very large museum that has an old section and a new section The new section has a wonderful special exhibit on the renaissance in Europe Every thing is marked in several languages including English The rest of the museum has wonderful exhibits on different aspects",
          "Since August 1st, the new building of the Landesmuseum Zurich has been open, with an excellent exhibition about the Renaissance in Europe (1400-1600). I loved the sober concrete architecture that makes the works of art stand out. And I also loved the round windows (like bull's",

          "Free entry to this attraction with the ZurichCard was what initially lured me into this museum, and I'm glad it did. With history that goes back hundreds of years and includes more modern components such as Swiss banking and politics, this museum is a one-stop-shop for all",
          "This building is pretty incredible. From the outside it looks like a huge medieval castle, but the inside is very streamline and modern, with lots of levels and cool port-hole types windows overlooking the gardens outside. It would be fantastic for people who are real",
          "This museum is very good value and worth spending a couple hours in during a visit to Zurich. The entrance fee is covered if you buy the Zurich Card (which I highly recommend doing). As a person with little knowledge of Switzerland I came away with insight into the country's",
          "it is a sort of progressive musim as far as you continue there are lots of things to attract you.stones and paintings are nice and unique and there is enough Information in the electronic Screens beside each work.",
          "Right across the street from the Zurich train station. A great place to spend a couple of hours. The displays were very extensive and interesting. A lot of Swiss history on display.",
          "A good place to spend a misty Friday. Included in the ZurichCard so the ten franc cost is waived. Includes an exhibition on Swiss myths and traditions which was interesting",
          "Good way to spend several hours. Nice items with historical significance. Very nice way to spend an morning or afternoon. Probably best to limit to a few areas of interest, to avoid Museum fatigue.",
          "This is a museum about the history of Switzerland, not an art museum. Also, as English is not a language of Switzerland, you will understand more if you can read French or German. It is literally across the street from the famous Hauptbahnhof, so is an option if you have a few",
          "The muesuem is simple and nothing extraordinary. I sometimes felt there was too much information presented to the viewer in a short area. Also I did not understand the history of Switzerland or of Z\u00fcrich in an interesting manner there, I had to do the historical section twice to",
          "overall the museum has redisplayed some interesting item and done a good job of the information cards. I am not fond of the slide as it gives children the wrong impression of museum etiquette. I especially liked the period rooms.",
          "Even though I had read some disparaging reviews on this museum, I love history and wanted to give it a try. Mistake. It is the most unorganized museum I have ever seen, and I've been to many. No semblance of chronology as to the history of Switzerland, displays were all over",
          "Fantastic museum with great history of Switzerland. Good signage and mixed media made this really interesting. For a rainy day a very nice morning.",
          "What an absolutely fascinating,well researched, curated museum!! The acquisitions and artefacts in every section are indeed most notable!! We only had an hour and a half to spare...clearly not enough time to soak it all in!! Walking from room to room to yet another room made it",
          "It's not that this museum lacked interesting pieces and learning opportunities but rather how the museum curated the collection that was so awful. We entered in hopes of learning more about Swiss National history but left very disappointed. Everything was organized in 3 small",
          "The building promises a lot but although some exhibits are well done, it is difficult to get a clear picture of Swiss history from this museum, especially if you are not fluent in German. The Austrian one in Innsbruck is much better.",
          "If you only have time for one museum, this is it! It is conveniently located next to the central railway station. The building itself which looks like a fairytale castle will entice you to enter. The museum gives you an excellent well-rounded history of Switzerland, from the",
          "The castle, in which this museum is housed, is amazing! Absolutely loved the ceramic fireplaces and wood panelling decor! The opening section provides a wonderful overview of the country's history, but be advised that the English translations are at the bottom of the",
          "It is a museum about Swiss culture, history, manufacture. It gives you a good taste about the country's history and it is a very good choice for a raining day.",
          "Located right outside the main train station, it was easy to find (there are signs in the train station). The museum has something for everyone, from history to science, glassware to textiles, warfare to religion. We visited on a rainy day and had only a few feet to walk from",
          "Pretty good exhibits. Gives a good insight into the Swiss history. Need 2 hours minimum to go through the entire place.",
          "I love museums, and I love history so part of the museum was extremely fascinating. Maybe it's just that the Swiss lack so much of their own history or identity that makes it a little anti-climatic. What I did find extremely interesting was the part of Swiss history I didn't",
          "We spent a cold and rainy summer afternoon at this museum and enjoyed it. Not knowing much about Swiss history, we definitely learned a lot. Not all of the signs have captions in English though, we should have gotten the audio guides. Also, if you get the Zurich Card pass, you",
          "Extensive history of Switzerland up to present day. All items on display are described in German, French, Italian, and English. It was the perfect excursion for a rainy day and is very easy to reach as it is right net to Zurich's main train station. Highly recommend!",

          "The Museum tells the history of Switzerland and is very interesting, exhibits are well arranged and presented.",
          "A beautiful, stately building, so appropriate to be the focal point for Swiss history. It is expansive with sections dedicated to special exhibitions. The wars, how the cantons were formed and slowly grew, along with the power struggles and the religious conflict that shaped new",
          "We visited with our baby on a very wet day. It was interesting to find out more about Switzerland and how Switzerland came about. There was a lot in this museum and too much for us to explore in 1 day, typical of a national museum. However we enjoyed our visit and the stop",
          "a very nice and informative, a lots of english explanation and very clear cut about the swiss political history, tradition and people. located very close to centre and train station. worth to visit!",
          "Interesting museum, with enough English. The political history of Switzerland was most interesting to me. If you head to the top floor of the armor exhibit, you can go into the corner turret and open the windows. Have someone take you picture from the other turret.",
          "This is a huge museum (free with Swiss Travel Pass), so plan your visit by checking the museum's website, especially for special exhibits. We happened to catch a large and very interesting exhibit on Conrad Gessner, Swiss naturalist. Cruise though the exhibits on Swiss history",

          "Beautiful castle style building with modern, recently completed addition. Right across the train station. Don't bother looking for the underground access. We didn't find it until we came back later in the day. Just go up and cross the street. There is too much to see",
          "This museum tells the history of Zurich well and is strongly recommended. I liked the diverse exhibits, from pure history about Zurich and Switzerland to military to even evolution of furniture and home decor. The creaky wooden floors can take a bit of getting use to. Especially",
          "The actual building, structure and architecture was extremely interesting. However, it was not the \"standard\" museum. One entire area was dedicated to furniture with much modern furniture. If you are pressed for time I would skip it. My teenagers were completely board however",
          "History museums are at the bottom of my museum list but this one should be at the top. The exhibits are very creative. It's clear the place is run by top curators who know they are in the 21st century and just happen to have historical pieces as their subject matter. The",
          "Some highlights: rooms from different houses and castles, the political history of Swizerland, that went all the way to the present where you could see how the different political parties fared in the last 50 or so years, fashion from hundreds of years ago to recently. You have",
          "This museum is what European museums would be like if places like the Lourve didn't have stolen goods from other countries. Everything inside is indigenous and devoted to Switzerland only. Honest and simple, just like everything else in Switzerland.",

          "Went here on a rainy morning and spent some happy hours. Started with an hour tour which just touched on a few highlights and then went around on our own. Very well curated collections, an eclectic mix of old and new; politics, history, art, textiles, design. Reminded me of the",
          "The tour was cheap. The museum was long and interesting. There was a lot of various information for everyone who may be interesting in different stuff. The location of the museum is ideal- right by the train station. If you're looking for time to waste or you enjoy museums, go",
          "Until June 19, 2016, there's a special exhibit about Conrad Gessner, a Swiss doctor, botanist, and zoologist. Exhibit was fascinating. Otherwise, we certainly learned a lot about the history of Switzerland--up to modern day. Glad we went.",
          "This is a must do simply because it is across the street from the train station. Don't be tempted to walk across the busy street. Go one level down at the train station and walk thru the tunnel and you will exit at the entrance of the museum. The items from prehistoric times",
          "This Museum was a Great Find since its smack in the Middle Of Zurich. Its Included with your SWISS pass, and has a TON of Information about the History of Switzerland and Zurich. If you have time go Visit.",
          "Really good museum for people of all ages. Display keeps you interested basically all the time. Its location is quite central so easy to reach. The museum tells the history of the country through ages in a very interesting way.",
          "I went there to learn about the history of my new country. The information about what to see where was nowhere and much of the history was only reading that you could do from home. I was not impressed.",
          "Last minute decision to go for walk round, free with city card. Only had an hour and a half before closing time. Very interesting and informative about Swiss history. You could do with a least a couple of hours.",
          "On a rainy day we visited the Swiss National Museum. Although we spent several hours at the museum, we did not do it justice. Free with your Swiss Travel Pass. Very well done section on the history of Switzerland. A must see if you are interested in how Switzerland developed",
          "Visited the museum twice with my family and friends. There is a lot to see and learn about the country and its history, It is great that everything is in several languages- French/German/ English so you can easily understand everything written there. For those, who plan to saty",
          "I would gladly recommend a visit to the museum if you are a first timer in CH and want to know more about the country and the people. There are several expositions and all what I saw was quite interesting. There was an exposition kn migration, on Zurich history, old furniture",
          "The building alone is worth going for. I really enjoyed all the exhibits, especially the clothing near the end. Great museum!!",
          "The museum is dedicated to Switzerland. It covers religious strife, art, the country, it's army and furniture which seems an odd collection, but it works! Allow 2 or 3 hours for a trip, plus cafe time! And, whilst in the museum look out for its collection of ceramic radiators -",
          "The museum has a fascinating collection, which is well presented in creative displays that really enhance the experience. I was impressed with the variety and quality of the exhibits. As an English speaker, I found the placards and other written material to be quite informative.",
          "This museum is right next to the train station. It provides a comprehensive view of Switzerland. It was mist fascinating to see the history of the country. It is an old building. There is a lot of walking. Some descriptions are translated into English.. A great place to",
          "Museum is free with a Zurich Pass so worth checking out. I realized I knew little about Swiss history and politics until I visited this museum. Good fun.",
          "The historical rooms and excellent exhibits further to the back of the museum are worth the entry fee! Do note that Swiss museums and galleries like you to put your coat and bag in a locker, which is a bit annoying... but there it is. Worth a visit.",
          "Do not miss the guided tour otherwise nothing will make sense to you especially if you do not speak german Very very beautiful",
          "We spent several hours walking through this magnificent museum in Zurich and enjoyed every aspect of it from the historical information that was provided, to the manner in which this information was displayed. We could easily have spent longer here to immerse ourselves even",
          "We have been to many museums around the world, and were looking forward to this one. We were disappointed in it for two reasons. It seems very disjointed and there is very little information in English. Most museums give you a handset that you can choose whatever language you",
          "We saw the Conrad Gessner exhibition and it was fascinating. Worth the time if you have some to spare in Zurich.",
          "First of all, I must admit that the national museum has been well maintained and it represents the rich culture of Switzerland. Situated right opposite the Zurich HB main station, this is a must visit for history lovers. If you are booking a Swiss rail pass, chances are that you",
          "The museum does cover Swiss history, however it certainly jumps around quite a bit. Each of the rooms are VERY different from each other, and there is very little attempt to patch the experience together. The bright side is that there is quite a bit of information in English",
          "Good collection of artifacts about Swiss National History. It was under renovation for a while but it seems done now. A good way to spend one of the rainy afternoons in Zurich.",

          "The Museum's building is quite amazing on the outside and inside also. Being near the river and the trainstation is hard to be missed. We were surprised by many items and collection and I recommend this muse for learning more about swiss people. You can visit it for free with a",
          "Museum is very cool insise and also outside. Interesting! We had FREE ENGLISH TOUR. Everything Was perfect - just we expected that it will be for free, but we paid 10 franks. Its not problem, but Its better to explain it more on web.",
          "Really nice displays explaining life in Switzerland during the medieval times. Many rooms explaining about the farmers revolution, the evolution of Swiss banks and displays of arms used in the old times. Would recommend at least 2-3 hrs to enjoy what the museum has display.",
          "There are several level you can actually explore. The museum provides the audio system, so you can hear the story. Be careful not to touch anything, there is an alarm when you get too close. Also a staff will warn you not to touch the armor :)",
          "Nice museum that provides information on Swiss history. Entrance fee is free if you have a Swiss Travel pass. Note there is construction in the front courtyard. Worth the stop if you have the time.",
          "Not as big as the collections of the Museo d'Orsay or Louvre in Paris or the Pitti in Florence. But to be fair, i love their religious items and the armory. Just in left side of the Main train station of Zurich. Highly recommended.",
          "Having toured the museum, I'm still lacking an understanding of Swiss history. Perhaps the confederation makes storytelling difficult. The museum seemed more like a collection of artifacts than anything else.",
          "We visited the national museum on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the DADA movement, born in Zurich. The exhibition provides important milestones and fundamental concepts of DADA. A must for art and culture lovers.",
          "This museum is located very close to the Hauptbahnhof and is hard to miss if you're taking the trams near here. The exterior of the museum is really quite attractive and is worth a stop for a pic or two. I didn't go inside given limited time.",
          "Part of ZurichcArd. Admission is free. Museum with small collection of Zurich and Switzerland history. Not too many artifacts. A lot of Switzerland house fixtures and furniture. Good collection of monarchy collection and clothes.",
          "not too impressive, to be honest, from the outside. but it has a lot to offer from within the museum. I very much enjoyed my trip there.",
          "I was on a business trip and only had 90 minutes before it was closed. And I would like to have more time. I was in Switzerland several times (Geneva, Bern) and thought I knew a lot about this country but a visit to this museum lead me to more reading about Swiss history. The",
          "I love museums and have been to so many all over the world but this one, I do not get. The garden area is under construction which is totally fine with me. Upon arriving I asked the gentleman at the front desk if they have a guide in English please, the answer was \" not really\"",
          "We expected a building with beautiful interior decorations and a number of exhibitions. This unfortunately wasn't the case and, on reflection, the 10CHF per person probably want worth it. In particular, only some of the exhibition boards offered a summary of the artefacts in",
          "The Swiss National Museum is located next to the Hauptbahnhof Zurich. Spent a couple hours here. The building is amazing. It's a large gothic building mixed with earlier and later influences built in 1898. The items in the museum and layout were disjointed and confusing. In",
          "Super exhibition on Swiss history. Really well presented. 60 to 90 mins needed. Lots of surprising discoveries: where does Schweppes come from, where and when the Swiss have fought wars and lots about direct democracy",
          "Highly recommend this museum when visiting Zurich. I loved the exhibits, especially the history of snow sports. Easily accessible, right across from the main hauptbahnhof.",
          "A small museum. Exhibits were interesting but nothing spectacular. Sixteen and under admits free. Student Fr8. Adult Fr10. An affordable way to spend a snowy morning with impatient children.",
          "Informative history on how Switzerland came to be. Easy to get around, a great cross section of history and culture. You can deep dive if you want, but we enjoyed a 2 hour visit.",
          "If you are traveling on a rail pass, most museums waive the entrance fee. But this museum is one you shouldn't miss. It's an especially great rainy day excursion. It's old, quaint interior, and mixed with new traveling exhibits. It tells the Swiss story.",
          "Everything was fantastically displayed with so much thought - I came out with a great understanding of the country and where it has come from.",
          "I was surprised by its collection and also the way it is exposed to the public. Besides the beautiful master pieces of art the interaction with the public through media and videos are great. I recommend a visit indeed",
          "The national museum is right next to the Zurich main railway station, and the Limmat river. Various exhibitions some permanent cover Swiss history and also current topics like land use. In winter there are often light installations on the building itself.",
          "We visited on November 15th Sunday. AS we had Zurich card, admission was free. The location is exactly opposite Zurich HB station and easy to find. It takes about 2 hours minimum and more depending on individual interest and time",
          "The displays in this museum are innovative, unusual, attractive and interesting. For example, many of the historical silver pieces are displayed on rotating discs so that you get to see all the sides. They have selected just enough of each item to give you a flavor of how that",
          "I liked the building itself. Collection is good: from Swiss history, industry, places, religious art, fashion, armory and decoration techniques and industry. Could be improved and has all the potentiality. I discover Alois Carigiet in an EXCELLENT exhibition great museography",
          "It was our last day and a rainy one so decided to venture inside this Museum. My daughter and I found it fascinating. It is a bit of a trek around but I felt it was very well done. There were lots of notes attached to each exhibit in many different languages. I found the",
          "Interesting. Took me 2 hours to wonder through and enjoyed the viewing. Bad experience though. The Bistro is cash only! Ordered my lunch then had to hand it back!! The staff member was so rude about it that it was like she was trying to further embaress me. Just left and went to",
          "There is a new part in construction, and the old part is under reconstruction. But still there is a fantastic photo exhibition about \"Work\" (Arbeit). Open until mid January, definitely not to be missed if you spend some days downtown Switzerland.",
          "This is clearly the worst museum I have ever visited when it comes to its overall organization. There is no chronological logic whatsoever and the \"themes\" displayed together don't make any sense. Why are religion/reform and economy together? Why are the rooms with bronze age",
          "Nice musium. Not very large. There are some new art sections and some parts about the swiss history. Its a nice visit for 2 hours.",
          "This is good for children and the displays are good but this has a small collection and much is under construction or blocked. We enjoyed our 30 minutes here but felt that was all it merited.",
          "Was very bewildered by the way the exhibits are arranged. Not much English explanation available. But it was so much better when there's the English guided tour available for my timing. Enjoyed the visit in the end.",
          "Nice place for a quick browse through to get a sense of moderate collection. very easily accessible from the train station",
          "museum is not big, very near to the mainstation. it's suitable for 1.5~2 hours brief visiting. of course you can spend hours here and have a deeper visit. strongly recommend to rent an audio guidance. it is the best one i have ever experienced. Heidi and her grandpa will lead",
          "Remember to download the mobile application for the museum before you come! Also bring along your earphones! Small museum but filled with interesting treasures. Can be completed within 2 hours, but take your time to appreciate the wonderful architecture and atmosphere of this",
          "We enjoyed the variety of exhibitions - historical rooms recreated, fashion through the ages, old clocks explained, religious art, prehistoric displays, even furniture - most eclectic.",
          "Had a lovely time on a rainy Sunday afternoon in Zurich at the Swiss National Museum. Very reasonable fees (Chf 8 for seniors). Extremely well done exhibits. Under some level of renovation now but wasn't an issue. Favorite part was the weapons exhibit and looking out of the",
          "Worst Museum I have been to. The way it is organised just doesn't make any sense. We could not understand the path, neither why this was so-called Swiss history. Some rooms were only an old room with a piece of furniture inside with absolutely no explanation. I do not recommend",
          "This turned out to be one of the real highlights of our visit to Zurich. We took our time -- there's so much to see and absorb! -- and spent a leisurely three hours at the museum. Galleries weren't crowded, which made viewing a relaxed experience. All of the displays were",
          "It was my first day in Europe, after a long overnight flight from the US and I was exhausted, but I needed to stay awake to conquer jet lag, so instead of taking a nap at my hotel I decided to visit this highly recommended museum, It was worth it, even, as noted above, it is",
          "This museum is near the Central Train Station and although still under restoration it is worth the time to wonder through this historical building and take in the centuries old exhibits. The exhibits are in various rooms throughout the castle, so you need to allow a fair amount",
          "This museum is good value. We visited on a rainy Sunday and spent a good two hours visiting all the main rooms and exhibits. A large extension is under construction which, once open, should further enhance the museum.",
          "During the Protestant Reformation, Zurich was one of the major cities impacted. The beautiful Catholic Churches were stripped of magnificent works for art. Many sold and other just stolen. At some point the Swiss realized what had happen to their history and heritage tied to",
          "We have visited a number of historical museums across Europe and found this one to be strangely organised and not flowing or in logical order. It was a bit all over the shop. There is a photography exhibition on at the moment - Arbeit which was very good. The best part of the",
          "A well-preserved historical building. Located in the city center of Zurich, very close to the main station. Insides the museum, the exhibition is very well organized from the ancient times, industrialization to the present, with a wide range of collections from art (e.g.",
          "Excellent introduction to the country. Great exhibit on the illustrator Alois Carigiet who illustrated the children's classic A Bell For Ursli and was famous for commercial work as well.",
          "Great museum with diverse exhibits. Make sure to take advantage of the headphones located in several places and the brochure with additional information in multiple languages. We went on a Thursday which worked well because we were not able to see all exhibits after 3-4 hours",
          "This building, an old castle, is interesting and is under construction. It's right across the street from the train station, so it's easy to get to from most of the city. It just seemed like a bizarre collection of things, and none of them were that impressive. The",

          "Some friends and I spent a rainy day at the Landesmuseum this week. It is a large collection of random objects - church objects (reliquaries, paintings, iconoclasts, statues), house hold furnishings, women's rings and a rotating exhibit featuring a Swiss children's book",
          "a nice museum showcasing the very best national interests of the country, the museum has a lot of history associated",
          "There are interesting items but there are no common themes to help guide the visitor through collections or make sense of everything here. It is a large museum and one can spend an afternoon looking around, but we walked away very underwhelmed. Another practice that makes this",
          "We visited the Swiss museum because the weather was a bit wet. It was a good choice to fill an afternoon as there is a lot to see. The exhibits often have information in German, French English and Italian. Some have audio commentary available and that is also available in the 4",
          "But- very centrally located, and it has everything on all things. Either culture, machinery, art, money, fashion, .... what ever encompasses a nation. It is very large, you need hours to walk all around, but it can be instead of going to few Museums. For example, you can get all",
          "The museum was nice and had interesting displays. It had, appropriately, a lot of Swiss history. Duh. The displays had German and French text. Only a portion had English as well. It made it a bit challenging. The museum had low lighting and was very muted. This wouldn't",
          "Always a visit worth, it shows the history of Switzerland. You'll find different clothes from different times as well as weapns like swords and knifes. There is alwasy a alternate exhibition as well.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed this museum! It was so interesting. The museum was presented in a really interesting way with displays presented in an artistic way. There are boards you can carry around in each room to explain the displays. I learned so much here and definitely recommend it",
          "For the fascinating exhibits (like stepping into a steampunk fantasy world in many places), this large museum needs at least half a day to fully explore and appreciate... and the entry price was pretty low! Value for money! Visually pleasing props, presentation and aesthetics.",
          "If you're looking for things to do you may as well pop by, the display of arms in the tower is kind of neat. Very hot in the summer (not airconditioned) and kind of hard to navigate though, as far as museums go.",
          "A very traditional museum seeped in the diversity of Swiss history. The Battle of Murten/Morat is document as a decisive turning point in Swiss history. After Murten France more or less abandoned expectations of conquest. Swiss history, because of its diverse ethnicity, is",
          "Beautiful building just near the Bahnhof. Nice collection of items depicting Swiss life at various times in history, including whole rooms transported. Worth 90 minutes to 2 hours. No air conditioning - avoid on hot days as it gets sultry.",
          "A beautiful place to spent 2-3 hours, learning and understanding the history of Switzerland, why it is doing so well! Worthwhile investment of time for all including families and kids. There are paintings, Swiss famous industries, miniatures soldiers, \"safe deposit boxes\" of",
          "Well worth a look as there is a large section on Swiss National history. The guided tour is well worth joining as they speak in depth and give back grounding for there treasured pieces.",
          "When you see one you have seen them all. Or all museums look alike. Not in this case. The Swiss National museum is a unique experience. Not only the structure in which it is housed has a grandeur and charm befitting a museum but the display is very differently done. A wheel",
          "The museum building of 1898 in the historicist style was built by Gustav Gull in the form of the French Renaissance city chateaus. His impressive architecture with dozens of towers, courts and his astonishing park on an island between the rivers Sihl and Limmat has become one of",
          "Interested in the history and old clothes, furniture and instruments and much more?... maybe on a rainy day? Yes go help yourself.",
          "Despite being in a beautiful historic building, with Switzerland being the birthplace of Celtic culture it was unbelievable that the Swiss National Museum is filled to the brim with virtually nothing of interest. As someone who loves history and visits museums wherever I go",
          "The museum can act as a good introduction to the Swiss history. However, what impresses about it is the building itself which can be mistaken for a large church or fortress. Also the tower is impressive. Its location in front of the train station makes it the most easily",
          "Very large museum but definitely worth the walk through. Pretty cheap as well so you really couldn't go wrong!",
          "Good introduction to Switzerland, not memorable, not sure it was the best use of our time. Everyone needs to decide for themselves what is meaningful.",
          "If you are in Zurich, then by all means - go! Even for an hour. It is housed in an old castle/stronghold. It's right by the main train station so that makes it very easy if you are just stopping through. Worth going, don't get me wrong. It's just hard to compete with all of",
          "It was a decent introduction into the history of Switzerland, but I thought that there would be more about the different cantons of the country with more history from those areas. OK stop.",
          "Located in central Zurich, right across the street from the Hauptbahnhof, this is the kind of museum I personally find to be of little or no interest. Of course, there's always the chance that I will be surprised, which is why I even go to such places when traveling. But alas,",
          "Situated in a beautiful building that is part of the experience, it is right in the center of town so no excuse not to visit. I had a ZurichCard so entry was free. Interesting exhibits and most translated for us non-Helvetians who haven't mastered any of the 4 official",
          "The Swiss are proud of their heritage and they have a high standard of living. This musuem reflects the design skills of the Swiss and the progress they have made as a culture. They have huge porcelin stoves with detailed tiles in the same area with an IKEA type of home",
          "The museum has some very nice old rooms to explore that look like they were from a castle. Otherwise, I thought the museum was pretty average. It was on the expensive side, and if you have other things to do in zurich, I would do them. Niederdorfstrasse was what we liked the",
          "We were interested in visiting the Swiss National Museum to gain an instructive overview of Swiss history and culture. While there were many interesting exhibits, the traffic flow of the museum was puzzling at best, maddening at worst.....one would move from a room on subjects",
          "The army collection, which provides many old weapons and dress of soldiers were so interesting and unique. Also collections of traditional dresses were nice to see.",
          "Consider at least 2-3 hours to visit all! There are often temporary exhibitions alongside with permanent ones, regarding the Swiss history: you can find many surprises there, from daily-life objects of the '50s, to the early 1900 skiing equipment. Often explanations are even",
          "Great Museum on great location.It is just next to main rail station in Zurich.I recommending visit but you need about three to four hours.Take time and you will be happy on the end.",
          "We came here on a wet afternoon and spent an informative couple of hours. The museum is located in walking distance from the old town just beyond the main railway station. Firstly the design of the building is very unusual for a museum - looks like an renovated castle. Alas,",
          "We spent total 3 hours in the museum and can't even complete to cover all. allow yourself more time to look around.",
          "Let me preface this review by saying that I have been to hundreds and hundreds of museums and am generally a fan of pretty much any kind. However, the Swiss National Museum is a very special place. I was in Zurich on the back-end of a business trip and walked into the museum on",

          "We spent a rainy Sunday afternoon here, looking for one significant artifact in particular that was associated with a distant relative. The place was abuzz with people, probably more locals than tourists. We were immediately impressed with the beauty of the artifacts, how well",
          "This is a fun place to visit and a chance to see a lot of different aspects of Swiss history. The building itself is worth a trip - it's an old, historic castle and conveniently located near the train station and the Bahnhofstrasse.",
          "The museum shows the complete history of Switzerland and also has a lot of modern expositions. The whole way of presenting the facts in the museum is nice and intersting. The building itself is already a nice construction",

          "This is a good museum with many displays covering many aspects of Swiss history and culture. Parts of it are difficult to navigate and one frankly gets lost. There is also a lack of chronology.",
          "This museum is great. Has a ton of exhibits covering a lot of different aspects of Swiss history. It is a maze to find your way around so a tour might be better. It is under pretty extensive construction so some of the exhibits are closed and much of the architecture is covered",
          "I really enjoyed this Museum housed in a lovely old building right in the centre of Zurich and easily accessible. Very interesting display.",
          "This is a fun museum and very much worth a visit if you have more than a couple of days. (It would not be my first choice, but a strong one all the same.) It is not a museum of fine art, rather room after room devoted to the history of Switzerland. A good place for kids, too.",

          "We spend close to 2 hours in this museum. Big museum, gives a lot of information about the past history, culture and evolution. So you need to be genuinely interested in this, else will get easily bored . There is a lot to understand and absorb from this museum.",

          "The best this about this place is its location, just adjacent to Bahnoff Strasse. You can visit this museum if you have not else to do in Zurich. This museum is good for kids and to know of Swiss history and sceintific development. Not very exicting for grown-ups.",

          "A great museum to visit with the kids on a rainy afternoon. A lot of the exhibits are interactive which is great until you go into the next room and you can\u2019t touch anything. Luckily there are helpful eagle-eyed members of staff on hand to \u2026",

          "Lots of interesting stuff",
          "Probably the least interesting national museum I've seen. Most of the museum is closed for renovations - which makes the price seem even more outrageous - and what's still open is just not that interesting. A lot of the interactive parts \u2026",

          "Great Place to visit, due to its connectivity to public transport and easy to locate even for a tourist! It is right outside the train station! Must spend the whole day here, as there is a lot to see, and please also wear comfortable \u2026",
          "the people and volunteers who work at this museum are very nice people, but the museum is small and frankly does not offer a lot. Also they do not really go over or have a lot in terms of the full history that Zurich has impacted on the world stage.",

          "If you want to learn about swiss history, this is the place to go, from the early days of the helvetica confederation until nowadays history like roger federer successes, going on the swiss house through the 20' century. Really impresive collection in an even more impresive building",

          "The exhibitions in the new space are impressively well done in terms of visual presentation and use of AV and AR technology. On the flip side there seems to be some emphasis of form over function, as the new space and some of the interactive exhibits are hard to discover and navigate.",

        "wiki": "The Grossm\u00fcnster, also spelled Gro\u00dfm\u00fcnster, (German pronunciation: [\u0261\u0281o\u02d0s\u02c8m\u028fnst\u0250]; \"great minster\") is a Romanesque-style Protestant church in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. It is one of the four major churches in the city (the others being the Fraum\u00fcnster, Predigerkirche and St. Peterskirche). Its congregation forms part of the Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich. The core of the present building near the banks of the Limmat was constructed on the site of a Carolingian church, which was, according to legend, originally commissioned by Charlemagne. Construction of the present structure commenced around 1100 and it was inaugurated around 1220.\nThe Grossm\u00fcnster was a monastery church, vying for precedence with the Fraum\u00fcnster across the Limmat throughout the Middle Ages. According to legend, the Grossm\u00fcnster was founded by Charlemagne, whose horse fell to its knees over the tombs of Felix and Regula, Z\u00fcrich's patron saints. The legend helps support a claim of seniority over the Fraum\u00fcnster, which was founded by Louis the German, Charlemagne's grandson. Recent archaeological evidence confirms the presence of a Roman burial ground at the site.\n\n\n== Historical significance ==\n\nHuldrych Zwingli initiated the Swiss-German Reformation in Switzerland from his pastoral office at the Grossm\u00fcnster, starting in 1520. Zwingli won a series of debates presided over by the magistrate in 1523 which ultimately led local civil authorities to sanction the severance of the church from the papacy. The reforms initiated by Zwingli and continued by his successor, Heinrich Bullinger, account for the plain interior of the church. The iconoclastic reformers removed the organ and religious statuary in 1524. These changes, accompanied by abandonment of Lent, replacement of the Mass, disavowal of celibacy, eating meat on fast days, replacement of the lectionary with a seven-year New Testament cycle, a ban on church music, and other significant reforms make this church one of the most important sites in the history of the reformation and the birthplace of the Swiss-German reformation.\n\n\n== Burials ==\nSaints Felix and Regula\nConrad Gessner\nPeter Martyr Vermigli\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe twin towers of the Grossm\u00fcnster are regarded as perhaps the most recognized landmark in Z\u00fcrich. Architecturally, the church is considered Romanesque in style and thus a part of the first pan-European architectural trend since Imperial Roman architecture. In keeping with the Romanesque architectural style, Grossm\u00fcnster offers a great carved portal featuring medieval columns with grotesques adorning the capitals. A Romanesque crypt dates to the 11th and 13th centuries. \nBollinger Sandstein was used for the construction. The two towers were first erected between 1487 and 1492. Originally, they had high wooden steeples, which were destroyed by fire in 1763, following which the present neo-Gothic tops were added (completed 1787). Richard Wagner is known to have mocked the church's appearance as that of two pepper dispensers. The church now features modern stained-glass windows by Swiss artist Augusto Giacometti added in 1932. Ornate bronze doors in the north and south portals by Otto M\u00fcnch were added in 1935 and 1950.The church houses a Reformation museum in the cloister. The annex to the cloister houses the theological school of the University of Zurich.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cloister ==\nThe cloister of former Grossm\u00fcnster Chorherrenstift dates from the late 12th century AD and was part of the canons (Chorherrenstift) which was repealed in 1832, and gave place of the girls' school Carolinum. The cloister was dismantled and integrated into the new building those reconstruction was based on the original elements of the architecture, but includes numerous interpretations. The cloister was renewed in 2009, its sandstone elements were cleaned, and the interior garden redesigned in cooperation with the foundation ProSpecieRara. The compilation of the cultural and historical ornamental plants is inspired by the natural scientist and polymath Conrad Gessner who found his final resting place in the cloister.\n\n\n== Carolinum and Heritage site of national significance ==\nThe cloister of former Grossm\u00fcnster Chorherrenstift dates from the late 12th century AD and was part of the canons (Chorherrenstift) which was repealed in 1832, and gave place of the girls' school Carolinum. The Grossm\u00fcnster church building is owned by the Canton of Z\u00fcrich, and the annex building being the former cloister, however, is in the property of the city of Z\u00fcrich. It is leased to the Theological faculty of the University of Z\u00fcrich since 1976. The as of today faculty building was built by Gustav Albert Wegmann in 1843. Grossm\u00fcnster and Carolinum are listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCarolinum, Z\u00fcrich\n\n\n== References ==\n\nDaniel Gutscher, Das Grossm\u00fcnster in Z\u00fcrich.

          "Definitely worth a visit. The stained glass is beautiful. It\u2019s actually made with cut stones, & thin geodes. Pay to climb the tower for beautiful views. Be warned though, if you\u2019re not in shape you\u2019ll be out of breath.",
          "This church is 1 out of the 3 most important churches in Zurich. Tourists should never miss it. It has so many beautiful statues, besides, the colorful glasses is also very attractive for tourists. Tourists definitely should visit here when stop by Zurich downtown.",
          "The historic importance of this church in the Reformation and the teaching of its pastors Zwingli and Bullinger make this one of the most important sites to visit in Zurich and in world history. In addition, it also has one of the best attractions in the 177 step Karlsturm from",

          "The exterior of the church is a lot better to look at than the inside, however if you pay the admission price (5CHF per person), the views from the top of the tower are beautiful, it\u2019s better to go on a clear day so you can fully appreciate it. Worth a visit, so you can tick",
          "No pictures are allowed inside but in line with the history of the church the interiors are devoid of murals. There is a large statue of Charlemagne below the church which worth a look. The two towers help make this a landmark icon of Zurich but it can get quite crowded inside.",
          "This church was disappointing but free. It\u2019s very old and pretty simple compared to the churches of Paris or Rome. Still worth the visit just to be in a place where Charlemagne once stood.",

          "If you have visited many beautiful churches, you may not feel impressed with this but I find it has a quiet old charm. It\u2019s not a big church but the highlight for me is the climb up the Towers for the view over the city. You only have to pay CHF5 for entry to the towers. You",

          "From the outside, this church looks like a Catholic cathedral, but it's a Protestant church with a simple interior but beautiful stained glass windows. We didn't get to climb the tower which we regret since it was a gorgeous day outside to get a view of the city. Make sure to",
          "The Grossmunster is a beautiful Protestant church in the heart of the old city. The beautiful Stained-glass windows designed by a well known German artist is certainly eye catching. However, my favorite was the climb up the South Tower of a 187 narrow steps which offer",
          "The church was pretty but what we really enjoyed was walking up to the tower ($5 CHF donation) to enjoy the wonderful views. Well worth it and recommend",
          "I have been several times to Zurich, but I had never climbed the tower of the Grossmunster before last week, when my partner and I decided to pay the 5 frank fee and get access to the top of this church, Despite the cloudy day, we were rewarded with beautiful views on the entire",

          "Lovely to take a moment in the church which has a very colourful stained glass window at its west end. You can also buy a ticket to climb the tower. Ingeniously they have lockers under the pews at the back so you don\u2019t have to take your bags up with you which is very helpful as",
          "It costs just CHF 5 per person and the price is well worth it. It is a bit of a climb mind up narrow winding staircases so you need to be fit and agile when you cross paths with someone coming in the opposite direction. The views from the top are well worth the effort.",
          "This is a stunning church that is filled with history. admission is free, tower costs 5 CHF. it is not as stunning as the Fraumunster but still worth a visit!",
          "There is nothing interesting inside. You should pay for entrance to the tower - 5 francs per person, but it is not interesting, do not waste your money.",
          "This reformates church has many attracting details. Nice vitrals, nice architecture, nice History and an amazing organ. Worth visiting!",
          "Beautiful views of Z\u00fcrich from the top of the bell tower. Not much of note inside the cathedral really. Just the standard stained glass windows and the like but the view from the top is enough to warrant a visit. 5 swiss francs for a ticket to the top of the tower and 100% worth",
          "I have seen enough ornate European churches to last a lifetime, but will still often pop in for a peak, particularly if it has an interesting history. In this case, the attraction was the legend that Grossmunster was built on the graves of the city's patron saints, Felix and",

          "I had no idea what to expect entering the church and thought we were just looking around, but paid the 5 frank to climb the viewing tower and was so glad to make the effort (even though timing was a little tight with the church opening at 10am and our hotel checkout at 11).",
          "The church is impressive from the outside and from any point of the city. Not my favorite on the inside, but is worth the visit.",
          "The Cathedral, built during the 13th century features a Romanesque style and is topped by two twin towers. The interior though mostly unadorned, features classic Romanesque-styled architecture. Below ground level, there is the medieval crypt holding a medieval statue of",

          "We found Grossmunster church while walking in Zurich. We walked up a large flight of stairs to find it as there were a large number of people coming down. Unfortunately the reason so many people were leaving was that the church was closing for a practice, so we only got to",
          "Easy climb up a narrow staircase and not too high - and i am terrified of heights. Only issue is same way up and down so always having to stop to let people pass. Great view form the top. Cathedral is beautiful",
          "Interesting place, very beautiful quiet a place for meditation. It should be included in your tour if you have the time. Is not far from the train station.",
          "This is an important landmark church of Zurich, it looks good, but I was more interested of the legend behind building it. Legend goes: there were two brothers who ran off to Zurich for safety after they converted to Christianity. But According to legend, the brothers Felix",
          "Must go up in zurich! we went up not expecting much but was so surprised ! The view is fantastic on a clear day and i expect it would be gorgeous on a snowy day too. Pay 5chf to go up.",
          "A fine example of the church here in Zurich. This place has a crypt that you must visit and had a serenity about it that is wonderful.",
          "Very cramped going up those stairs at the beginning! I suffer with asthma which kicks off with stairs (not usually a problem as I just nip in to one side to calm my breathing) but the first flight of stairs was so tight that we couldn\u2019t move to one side to let other people past",
          "My wife, son, daughter and I visited Grossmunster in Zurich in November 2018. Grossmunster with its two towers dominates the historical center of Zurich. We went inside for a few minutes and the church has very nice stained glass. Grossmunster and Fraumunster are on opposite",
          "5F entry so we didn't go in. No doubt there is history behind the church but charging is ridiculous especially after going into the Notre Dame for free.",

          "We sat and listened to a great mini Orchestra practicing in the vestry, Fantastic sound in that old Church.",
          "Grossmunster is a Zurich landmark towards the end of the Niederdof area. It has some lovely stained glass windows.",
          "The outside of this church is very nice but the inside doesn\u2019t really have anything that stands out to me. One of the twin towers can be climbed after purchasing the tickets which are priced at CHF 5 for adults and CHF 2 for kids. The climb consists of 186 steps if I counted",
          "We stumbled across the churches by chance exploring on our first day. Incredible and beautiful. It\u2019s possible to visit and see inside. Allow at least an hour in each of the churches",
          "If you\u2019ve been wandering into places of worship, especially in Catholic Cantons, you\u2019ll be underwhelmed by this location. We poked our heads in to find a concert being set up. No photos are allowed. Just enjoy it from the outside and be sure to see the brass map in the upper",
          "This was our favorite building in all of Zurich. It is just so majestic and huge, while standing tall on the Limmat river.",
          "Travellers to Europe will always find it hard to avoid churches. They\u2019re everywhere, and their architecture is generally something special. Sadly, I would say that Grossm\u00fcnster is among the less spectacular, visually. It certainly captures the difference between reformed and",
          "As a Reformed Church it is very plain but very peaceful to spend a few moments in contemplation and prayer. The main Church is free to visit but you can pay to climb one of the towers and is worth the charge, a not too strenuous climb gives good views over the lake and city.",
          "It is of course beautiful and good church, but cannot compare with great cathedrals of other European cities. I could not go inside as it was crowded and there was a big queue.",
          "A must see of history buffs, but also for art buffs who like unusual stain glass windows. The agate windows are amazing!",
          "When we arrived there,there was a large group of musicians there playing with their instruments and practicing for their concerts.nice and calm",
          "The inside of the church was strict \u2018no pictures\u2019. And quite honestly, Compared to European catholic cathedrals, there wasn\u2019t much to look at inside this \u2018reformation church\u201d. The hike up to the top was narrow and we had wait several minutes to come down due to a large group",
          "A lot of people were waiting to go and visit inside and apparently one man was standing and saying that its closed for a concert. Come back next day!",

          "Grossm\u00fcnster is the most important religious building, in fact it is the cathedral, located in the city of Zurich. The facade is very beautiful and you can see it from a lot of parts of the city. It has two towers and it is located close to the river. The inner part is also",
          "We try to visit but it was colsed, however it's a great monument and a perfect spot to take a selfie. It\u00b4s near the canal so a nice panorama view such is on a high level.",
          "This is one of the three main churches in the Old Town area of Z\u00fcrich. It is interesting to explore inside and holds a beautiful, fully operational organ. The main draw for most visitors will be the observation deck on one of the towers. If you don\u2019t suffer from claustrophobia,",
          "I could not get inside. Times are not displayed. I had to be content with the outside. A bit disappointing to be right there.Massive and dominates the skyline from the lake. Remember to cross the river before you get to it or you have to walk back.",
          "This church is interesting and the two towers can be seen from just about all parts of the city. It is worth the climb of 13 flights to see the 360 view of the city. Recomend it as a must see.",

          "We spent almost 2 hrs in the cathedral & enjoyed the view outside & inside. Peaceful inside & serene.It is a13th century Munster Cathedral. Red sandstone from the Mountains in neighboring France. Behind the cathedral there is an open terrace that affords views of the Rhine",
          "This church is worth a short visit, they allow you to tour it for free. I enjoyed the stained \"glass\" windows, which are rather unusual and made of rock instead of regular glass. No photos allowed inside the church, so I can't post any here, but I have nice memories. This",
          "We were not sure if it was open then we opened big wooden door to a very great location. Climbed to the tower. Very worthwhile. Great view",
          "If you are accustom to visiting large Catholic cathedrals, you will be disappointed with the \"reformed\" cathedrals in Zurich. They are dull and uninspiring.",
          "modest outside, because it was prohibed to sea inside, because of a festival. you will not lose something if you dont see it",
          "Very beautiful windows and magnificent organ in the gallery. This is a rather austere worship space, typical of much of the reformed churches where historically ornamentation has been stripped. But it makes it a deeper experience of connection with God because nothing gets in",
          "We only saw the concert, so I can\u2019t comment on the rest of the church. Stunningly good sound! Postcards of their windows for sale.",
          "We visited this church and enjoyed it. Free and right in the old town, so its easy to get too. Make sure to go under the alter to see the original statue which has been replaced by a replica on the exterior.",
          "The church was completed in 1220 and is very nice. You can climb to the top of the right tower. It is 200 steps up and down a narrow stair well. Fantastic views from above. Climb is NOT handicap accessible.",
          "I expected more, but the church doesn't have much. They are just trying to get money to go on the steps.",
          "Part of the history of Zurich, good location, nice views and you can climb to the roof if want to have nicer views of the city. On Christmas there is a nice market outside",
          "Grossmunster location is very good and provides best Views in Lucerne. This place is worth a visit for Monument lovers.",

          "Yes, you can go into this church without paying a fee. But then they try to sell you photos and other items from inside...and heaven help you if you take a photograph of your own. I made this mistake, and they get incredibly nasty. I would not recommend going back in here. I",
          "I didn't think the inside of the cathedral is that spectacular or different from any other. However, the climb up the tower gives a very good view over the city and the lake. They have a waiting system where they let only so many people up at a time so it doesn't get very",

          "This church will receive many low reviews due to the lack of decoration, that being said this is still a beautiful church with a lot to offer to those visiting Zurich. This church\u2019s strongest feature is the fantastic view you get from the top of the right spire. It was a",
          "It is frustrating when these places do not allow photos and yet don't have good enough postcard collections on display to make it worth purchasing them. I do recommend going down into the crypt though as it is beautiful and gives you a chance to see the Charlemagne statue",

          "It's ok, but the competition is brutal. Not enough ornamentation to make it a visual standout. There were some interestingly different small stained glass windows, but not wonderful. This is one you can pass by. particularly if you have only one day in Zurich.",
          "We decided to climb to the top of Grossmunster on a day where it was 36 degrees! Given the number of steep winding steps (186 steps in total I believe) it was actually quite difficult! However the views from the top are great. Not sure I would do it again however now I have been",
          "Its nice to visit the church, they provide audio guide (an hour long) with entrance ticket. Its not so easy to go in with young children inside as they will feel bored being too long inside so one should consider that when traveling with a child.",

          "The entrance fee is free unless you want to go up to the tower. You will find here collection of stained glass windows and a crypt. If you have a limited time in Z\u00fcrich visit the Fraum\u00fcster instead. I could skip this church.",
          "It's free so we were happy to check it out. Grossmunster dominates Zurich's skyline so we enjoyed seeing its inside. Due to Zwingli and the Protestant Reformation, it doesn't have all of the details inside of a Catholic Church, but it's stained glass windows are wonderful as",

          "Pretty on the outside but the inside has only a few windows you can enjoy and a statue in the crypt. It\u2019s so highly rated only for the views of Z\u00fcrich from its top and not as a church it self. After having visited the Duomo in Florence I was disappointed.",
          "Went to the Grossm\u00fcnster and climbed the 200 steps to the viewing platform. Cost very reasonable at 2 CHF for senior citizens. Really good views across the city of Zurich.",
          "There is no entrace fee to enter the monastry but if you like to up the dome the price is 5CHF, there are around 168 steps up (the first 55 is a spiral stairs, quite narrow-might be hard for a person who suffers claustrophobia). The view on the top is amazing, you\u2019ll be able to",
          "So great, so Peaceful, holy atmosphere. You will spend more than one hour to be able to grasp the charm of the place. Please do Not miss..",
          "Massive Cathedral with surrounding building that played a vital role in the Protestant Reformation in Zurich. Zwingli and other leaders who followed him.",
          "The church is one of Four Main churches of Zurich. Just opposite to the Womens Church and is in a elevated position. The view of the Old town and the Limmat River is a sight to see from this church. The twin towers of the church is a prominent landmark of zurich. There is a",
          "Probably the best view in Z\u00fcrich. After purchasing a ticket for about \u20ac15 to \u20ac20. The journey begins up a very narrow circular stair case. Try to get up the first part of this stair as fast as you can because the stair is wide enough for one way travel. so if someone is coming",
          "I was expecting a beautiful European church - so the Grossmunster was a bit different. Lovely but not the usual church architecture. It gets converted to a music hall in the evenings so lots of performances take place here",
          "Nice church to visit. Stained glass windows are interesting to see as is the crypt. Good views from the top.",
          "Made quick trip through this attraction. Outside actually looks more beautiful than the inside. Inside is rather bland and actually pretty small.",
          "Impressive in a Calvinistic way - that is, not elaborately decorated with white and gold as with Catholic cathedrals, but sombrely impressive in the Reformist tradition. The crypt is suitably cold and damp, but contains interesting friezes and an original statue of Charlemagne,",
          "A very beautifull church among the rush of central Zurique. Nice place to stop and thanks. I just found it too dark, but indeed fine.",
          "Second of the 3 famous churches in downtown of zurich. You can't miss the twin tower and can explore this place of your own. It is a 12th century church.",
          "The church is unspectacular on the inside but that is not why you go. The views of Zurich from the tower are incredible. Try to time it so that you can stand there and here the church bells from the other churches ringing as you look out. Well worth the 5 francs it cost to",
          "Here with work and had a few hours free time. The views from the tower at Grossm\u00fcnster are breath taking. Well and truly worth the 5 CHF cover charge. A few steps to climb so may not be suitable for some elderly or very young children.",
          "Beautiful place to visit! It was wonderful feeling when you visited them church while your on vacation to thank god! I did city tour!",
          "Plain, austere church, very peaceful and enjoyable just to sit there after all the walking. We are used to the very ornate Spanish churches, this was a welcome change. Small Christmas market nearby and a young lady was getting cigarette butts up from the area outside the bar she",
          "We visited the church. While it is not as elaborate as other churches we have visited it still rates. The windows and interior are excellent. A must see when in Zurich.",
          "Visited this place for winter's chamber orchestra doing early music favourites and some modern Christmas tunes. Great acoustics for orchestra, less so for vocals. As in all churches sight lines can be problematic. Worth doing.",
          "You cannot miss it, it is visible from virtually everywhere in Zurich. The reform has erased most of the early decorations, but the modern windows are worth the visit. If you have the time, check out the small courtyard on the left side of the entrance, a gem of medieval",
          "I was really amazed by the structures of the church.. It is really worth to visit. Specially the big clock on it is really beautiful.",
          "Grossmunster is a church with beauty to behold! The surrounding area is also a gem of views. Really nice experience.",
          "For a small fee, you can walk to the top and have incredible views of Zurich! It is not an easy climb to the top because of the narrow and steep stairs. Well worth it if you are able to climb!",
          "This old church was huge and magnificent. Not ornate like those in Florence, Venice or Rome but impressive with its solid grandeur. Easy to get in. A quiet sanctuary in the midst of a busy city.",
          "Its in the Grossm\u00fcnsterchurch and you can go up the stairs entrance is 5chf arrived on the top you can enjoy the view from the tower and see the oldtown its really nice and a good activity for 30min. Fits for couples friends or also solo.",
          "Great location, lots of walking tours and it is recommend to do it. Amazing feel to walk around the area.",
          "Only 5fr for adults or 2fr for students! Climb up the old stair case and then see a 360 view of Zurich. We went up to watch the sunset and it was absolutely stunning.",
          "The church is significant for the Zurich and the history of Reformation in Switzerland. It is located in the middle of old district, offers a quite resting place for a pause.Stained glass on the windows looks quite interesting. Entrance is free, access to the tower costs 5 CHF",
          "This place is noted for it's stained glass windows by Chagall. Unfortunately, the day we where there you could only see a part of a few of them due to setup for a private event. There is a description and guidebook. Quite frankly from what we could see and the pictures in the",
          "Different stain glass windows to view. Feels quite modern inside. 5chf to go up the tower. There is always a queue as it's the best thing about the church. And provide great views",
          "We climbed all the way up the narrow staircase. It\u2019s just 5 franks....well worth it. But only payable in cash! Be aware! Views are amazing...especially with the fresh snow we had...snow covered mountains and the lake...we would recommend!",
          "Grossmunster propestant church (a former monastery) is historically significant for the (canton of) Zurich, nowadays serving as the most recognized landmark of the city, entrance is free (visit to the towers is at a fee), remarkable entrance doors, quiet and beautifully simple",
          "The historic Grossmunster, which dates back to around 1100, is a Protestant Romanesque church overlooking the Limmat River in Zurich. It is well worth visiting, but visitors should know that photographs are not permitted inside.",
          "The view is definitely worth it. Make sure to bring cash, as they do not take cards. The staircase is very narrow, so it is difficult climbing up and down with people going in opposite directions. It doesn't take too long and there are some landings to stop at if you need to",
          "Be sure to familiarize yourself with Felix and Regula before leaving. From Charlemagne commissioning a church on this site to the Swiss Reformation beginning here, this place has some historical or legendary significance.",
          "Climb to the top of the bell tower\u2014it is a worthy view. The space at the top is a bit cramped but you will have a 360-degree view and it is quite spectacular. The climb up is a bit tiring and daunting but worth it. The cost is about $5. You are unfortunately not allowed to",
          "it seem to me as the Notre Dame in Paris, nice to see it. Thous place in Zurich made me feel like Im in France.",
          "The bronze doors and stained glass by Giacometti are the only reason to view this rather austere church. And, if the weather is good, you can climb up one of the towers for a view of the city.",
          "If you are in Zurich you\u2018re bound to walk around in the old town (\u201eNiederdorf\u201c), where you\u2018ll encounter several objects and views from older days. Be sure to visit Grossm\u00fcnster (\u201ebig minster\u201c) located close to Bellevue on your trip through Zurich. Just get inside, buy a ticket",
          "I was expecting so much history but this church is a basic place of worship with no frills, little curation of artefacts but it does offer a 4CHF walk up 187 steps of the tower and fabulous views across the city.",
          "We had clear blue skies the day we decided to visit the Grossmunster. The interior is nothing spectacular but it's worth to get a ticket up to the tower. There are 189 steps to the top up a very narrow winding stone staircase. But you are rewarded with fabulous views over Zurich",
          "This old church is very nice to visit and sit inside. Open to the public it's not a fancy decorated building yet it holds history inside. Early visits are better as later there seems to be more tours coming through. Once inside you will be nicely surprised.",
          "This is quite the large church. Last time we went it was evening and we hurried for a quick visit. This time we took our time during the day and also visited the Krypt. The stained glass windows are fascinating, especially the one where it is either 2 vases or 2 faces. Events,",
          "This place gets the nickname salt and pepper because the two towers look like salt and pepper shakers. Interesting history to this church",
          "A fantastic example of Swiss construction, however in true Calvinist tradition - the interior leaves much to be desired. Peaceful, yet boring.",
          "You would never guess that the base of the Grossmuenster can go back to around 800 AD. Much was built then on top in the Middle Age and even more is now a result of the later renovations and additions after the last devastating fires. A visit here is worthwhile, but even more if",
          "Beautiful church that is free to visit. The inside is not as extravagant as many other churches but it is still beautiful and peaceful.",
          "Grossmunster is a pleasant church, however not a place where you need to spend more than five minutes at. Once you've seen intensely decorated churches in other cities in Europe than this will seem a bit dull. In a great part of the city, the Old Town.",
          "The simple style of this Protestant church is Roman architecture because it was constructed way back in the 12th century. You would see Charlemagne on one of the towers. You will also see a statue of him in the crypt. The 2 towers were constructed later in the 1480\u2019s The",
          "The Grossmunster is a large Romanesque cathedral, with a sparsely decorated interior. There is an impressive organ, and the stained glass is modern, but done in varying styles. It is a bit difficult to appreciate the windows, but a wander will allow for this. The crypt",
          "I was not entirely impressed with the inside of the church, but the view from the towers is certainly worth the climb!",
          "An austere and beautiful church. Wonderful place to retreat to in busy Zurich. Or to go to listen to beautiful music. Great organ.",
          "The Grossmunster is a beautiful but austere Protestant church and the most visible and recognizable Zurich landmark. Located on a small hill just above the river, it is probably the best example of what happened to Catholic churches with the Reformation - the imposing",
          "Definitely worth the 4or 5 francs to climb the tower here. Beautiful views of the city, the lake and even the Alps in the distance. The stairs are not for the faint of heart, however. In the church itself, be sure to check out the stained-glass windows which are actually made",
          "It's hard to miss this walking around the city, and there was a nice square in front of it which allowed me to take photos. Although it wasn't too clear on how to enter or whether there was an entry fee, so I didn't bother. The sight from the outside and from across the lake was",
          "Worth a short visit to appreciate the windows and if you have the energy, climb the many steps to get a good view from the tower.",
          "You can't take photos inside but you can visit the towers for a price. Quite beautiful inside with some simple rather then extravagant decorations. Very peaceful place to sit, contemplate and look around despite the number of tourists constantly milling around.",
          "We loved having this in many of our photos. The inside was a little bit crowded however. Maybe it was the time we went but it somewhat took away from the atmosphere. Other than that, it was great",
          "Located in the heart of the city, Beautiful olden days doors with carvings and historical. We made a short visit and took pictures of this nice church from outside.",
          "One thing we noticed, in the larger Swiss cities, churches that were impacted by the reformation, now lack most of their original detail, beauty, and design. . Really sad too see, but it's still important historically. The Grossmunster is a perfect example. Beautiful",
          "Here is nice place if you stay front of it near lake to take photo. Around of here is not so much beauty.",
          "Beautiful historic cathedral in the center of Zurich, close to the lake, with beautiful interiors and views",
          "We were wandering around the city and chose to visit this place also. From outside it was great, it has a very very heavy door and inside it looks also charming. It is a place which presents zurich's identity. We didn't choose to visit the tower and view the panorama because one",
          "Inside is not particularly interesting but the views from the tower are stunning. Very cheap too, 4 CHF for adults and 2 for students. Definitely worth the 200 or so steps up the tower. People ascend and descend the same flight of stairs so it can get crowded but I would still",
          "Must see place in Zurich, Beautiful interiors and old town buildings all around, Very well maintained and one of the main tourist attractions and identity of Zurich",
          "This large Church has impressive though plain interior with magnificent stained glass windows ans organ loft. Photography inside not permitted.",
          "Whilst inside the Grossmunster, we happened to read that it is possible to climb the tower. Not very obvious as we have visited before and not seen the entrance. Not the easiest climb. The first section (around one quarter of the way up) is a tight stone spiral of steps. Then",
          "Many steps in order to reach to the top. It is an excellent excersice.The first floors'stairs are sooo roomless. Only one person at a time can pass. If you meet an other person as you climbe up,you have to hug each other in order to pass. After this hard test of the first 4",
          "Entry into the church is free but to climb the 180 odd stairs to the top is only 4 CHF. The views are worth every cent! Just make sure you have a camera! Those who find going up stairs may find it difficult reaching the top as there are so many stairs!",
          "To get together 100 is somehow hard, I find it could be worth a visit for the cathedral visitor nothing more - nothing less!",
          "Any amateur photographers will really enjoy photographing this place, especially at night! It isn't too busy at night so you won't be nudging your way through crowds. The lighting is awesome and you're guaranteed some great shots!",
          "Entrance is free however climbing the 187 narrow steps costs 4 francs. It worth the climb. Very nice view of Zurich...the river, the lake, the streets... dont miss it if you are in Zurich. The church is just facing the town hall, up the road.",
          "They charge a few CHF to climb the church tower which has an amazing city view. About half way up are stone spiral stairs. Then it becomes wooden staircases. At the point the climbing changes there is an AED on the wall. This is a serious climb. Maybe 12 flights. The views are",
          "Great view from one of the many great viewing spots around (go to uetliberg!), but up close not that impressive compared to other famous European churches.",

          "Admittance to Grossmunster is free but there is a minimal charge to climb the 187 narrow stairs of one of the towers. Mesmerizing views of Zurich in every direction. Contemplate in the cloister gardens.",
          "Make sure to go in (and be quiet) donate money to walk to the top, it is probably the tiniest stair case you will ever walk up, squeeze by people coming down or up. The view and the trip up is worth it.",
          "I would recommend climbing the tower to get a panoramic view of the city. It is a lot of steps but worth the climb. Great place to take photos.",
          "This is a very impressive building in a square which we found on a \"walking tour of Zurich\" on-line; starting from Lake Zurich. They say a picture paints a thousand words, so to save myself a thousand or so words in trying to describe this giant Gothic (?) building, I'll just",

          "Entry to the church is free, and the climb to the top of the tower is only CHF 4 (2 for kids) so well worth it. The stairs are extremely narrow and uneven which adds to the fun, but may not be suitable for all visitors. Views from all four corners of the tower when you get up.",
          "The church itself is nothing special, but the windows with stained glass are outstanding and never seen before like that!",
          "The name says it all. The building will show up in about half your pictures in Zurich, but being a Protestant church it lacks some of the razzle-dazzle other European cathedrals have.",
          "Grossmunster is really great place in Zurich town where you can enjoy in lake view, restaurants, events and nice people",
          "Nice gothic style church. Certainly not the extravagant churches you find in other European countries but the stained windows are worth seeing.",
          "I love stopping here and lingering in the feeling of the old world. I love to hear the bells chime and watch the birds fly over the roof top. A must visit.",
          "This was one of my favorite things we did in Zurich! The lift was closed so we climbed the 187 steps to the top and it was so worth it! The views in every direction were amazing - this is a must do!",
          "Went to see the Chagall windows. It was so hot in the church we did not stay long (June). There is an entrance fee.",
          "You wouldn't miss it when walking or doing a tour around Zurich town. It is really big and fortunately, we came inside for a quick view and I have a local with me but I think you need to buy a ticket.",
          "The church interior is nothing special but it is worth it to go up the towers. The interior of the church is quite small so it does not take long to look around anyway. There are quite a lot of stairs up to the top of the towers, the first part is concrete and in a spiral",
          "Historic church in Old Town. Tower climb is worth the small price of admission - one of the best views in Zurich!",
          "One of the 2 or 3 must see churches/sites in Zurich. Special space where Charlagmagne came to visit. Stained Glass is beautiful and gives the other Fraumunster a run for its money. Good luck and enjoy! Also nearby the Modern Art Museum. Good luck and enjoy!",
          "This church is one of the main 4 churches in Zurich and is worth a visit if you are into churches. We arrived when all the bells were chimming so it was very special",
          "Beautiful setting inside and out. There is also a crypt to explore. Make sure you go up the tower for wonderful 360 views if the city. I would argue the best viewpoint from city level. The stairs are a windy and steep so something to be careful of and not suitable for anyone",
          "The church is a wonderful historic space where Zwingli helped birth the reformation. The trip up the tower (not for the out-of-shape) was well worth the cost. The views of the city were spectacular!",
          "The views from the top are awesome. Going up in a very narrow spiraly and steep stairs also adds to the feel of the place (and its only like 2-4 euros to go up).",
          "Grossmunster is a beautiful church with attractive stained glass windows. For a small fee you can climb about 188 stairs to a ledge where you have fine views if the Limmat (river), old town and other architectural delights. There is also a crypt open to the public.",

          "Built between 1170-1230, the great minster sits directly across the Limmat River from Fraumunster, its three-story tall twin towers dominating Zurich's skyline from the west bank. The first thing you notice upon arrival is the Romanesque portal and heavy bronze doors with",
          "Quiet solemn church with wonderful stained glass windows. I want to do more research to learn more. I went with friends and one friend has a family history that links back to one of the founders. You can not take pictures inside, but there are books, postcards, and more that",
          "We did not go to the top. Had a long day of walking and thought better of climbing the steps. the color intensity of stained-glass is wonderful. We also liked the stonework. This is a peaceful and tranquil place to relax, pray, or just enjoy the gorgeous interior.",
          "good cultural and historic place, good for photos, culture and time spend, evening time will be more good as entire area will be shining with lights.",
          "Massive church with a commanding presence for all near it. Definitely one of the camera. Its architecture is interesting and the area immediately around it is typically quiet, which is always nice.",
          "The church is not very well decorated and not as large as I expected based on its name. There are some stained glass windows , but not much else to look at. It is worth a quick visit.",
          "This church is sometimes called a cathedral, but belongs to the Reformed Evangelical Protestant church. It is an impressive sight as it stands looking across the Limmat River at the Old Town. Entry is free, although there is a small charge to climb the 187 steps up the tower",
          "Grossmunster , located in the Grossmunster platz in the historic old town , is indeed a landmark of the city of Zurich. It is a Protestant church , the architecture of which is Romanesque. Particuarly noteworthy are its beautiful stain glass windows and bronze doors. The climb",
          "We sat and just enjoyed the beauty of the stained glass. Not as big as others we have been to, but we enjoyed it.",
          "If you are up for the climb, you won't be disappointed. The views from the tower are simply breathtaking. On a clear day, you can see the whole of Zurich. There's a reason why there are so many pictures on this site of that view. Word of caution - I got yelled at for taking",
          "Impressive church with a big square outside it. It is in the centre of the old city. The towers are huge. It is near the main riverfront.",

          "The Grossmunster is a lovely place to stop as you stroll around Zurich. It's beautiful inside and the best part is climbing up to one of the tall steeples. Make sure you bring a few Francs so you can climb to the top. The views are great!",
          "An important church to see where Zwingli started teaching and the Bible to the commoner. He was one of the early reformers in the Protestant church. John 3:16.",
          "A beautiful old church well worth visiting just off the main river path. After looking at the chapel we went down into the crypt, which was interesting. The best part was climbing up through the tower for a small fee. The view of the city and the lake is fantastic!",
          "One of the tightest staircases I've been in, but the effort to get the top is well rewarded with great views over the city.",
          "You can definitely find the church due to its distinctive towers. We went inside and the different types of stained glass windows were amazing!",
          "The Protestant Reformation was in large part developed in Zurich, through the efforts of Zwingli and others. The Grossmunster church is a great example of the spiritual tradition of Switzerland while at the same time the history of the country.",
          "Didn't get a chance to go inside, however the view and details of this church from the outside were amazing :)",
          "Lovely city cathedral that is just over the river from the main old town, so worth a view just to cross the river and soak in the city. But to do it justice, the cathedral is nice, austere, and has a tower that is worth climbing for views of the city - just be aware the spiral",
          "Do not miss this!!! This was one of the best things we did. Incredible views from the top of the towers of the church. Don't forget to see the crypt underneath the church too. Don't take elderly up the stairs. It's not suitable for anyone who is claustrophobic or with limited",

          "The good thing about this church is that the entry is free. Free pamphlets also provided on the history of this church where building commenced in 1100. It costs CHF4 to gain entry to the 187 stairs that lead to the top of the tower. This is a claustrophobic spiral staircase for",
          "We went during the Spring festivities and the views of all the marchers and musicians along Old Town was unforgettable",
          "The Grossmunster is actually \"gross\" and an unmissable element of Zurich skyline. But the interior do not really add much to what you can appreciate eternally, unless you are interested to climb the tower - less than 200 stairs after all - and enjoy the view fron above. It isnot",
          "This is one of the 4 main churches in Zurich. This place is beautiful. Since we were short in time so didn't get enough time to go the top to see the city. Went with a guide to the outside and got to know about the history of this church. I would recommend to go these places and",
          "If you can handle 200 steps up a narrow stone spiral staircase and some rather scary, well-worn wooden ladders, the view from the top is worth it. Only CHF$4. Thanks so much to Grossmunster church for continuing to allow public access - do it before they close it down for safety",
          "If you know anything about the reformation in Northern Europe, then you'll know the name Zwingli. He preached from this church every weekend, delivering new interpretations of biblical texts. (He also preached from the nearb Fraumunster). Now, in this church you can see some",
          "This church dominates Zurich's skyline and is definitely worth a visit if you are into Gothic churches and buildings. You can climb up the towers to have a fantastic 360 views of Zurich",

          "The only great thing is the view from the tower. CHF4 to climb 160steps up. only 1 way up and down so be paitent when people coming up or going down in a ver narrow spiral steps. You get really fantastic view of Zurich except the top doesn't have a walk around like other church",
          "Grossm\u00fcnster is a main church of zurich out of four. It is a land mark of zurich city which located near limmat river. It is possible to enter the church and go to the top by stairs to see the fantastic and nice view of the zurich city.",

          "Once of the main attraction of the old town is the protestant Twin tower church , its view is simply amazing. Its a worthwhile walk around the town. The Church is simply amazing although you will have to pay to get into the top of the towers from inside the cathedral to get an",
          "The church itself is beautiful, though since it is Protestant and was made more \"plain\" it is not like many of the spectacular cathedrals of Europe. However, the view from the tower is spectacular. Spend the 4 Francs to go to the top and take your time when there. We had a",
          "The architecture is something to see and from the inside the stained glass is magnificent. When in Zurich you should not miss the opportunity.",
          "The church is worth visiting because of its important role in the Swiss Reformation. But that same Reformation left the church a bit plain. The modern stained glass is striking and the views are very good.",
          "A must to visit in Zuerich, to go to see the statue of Karl and have a look to the history behind. Have a look to the concert in this church and read the informations to get value of the history. A must not only to recommand.",
          "There are guide boards by the entrance in lots of languages. The windows are amazing - very modern in an old church setting. There is an interesting crypt with an old statue of Charlamagne under the main alter (new one is on the outside of the building) and a side chapel for",
          "That's one of the landmark buildings of Zurich. Interesting to visit, anyaway you will pass around one way or another",
          "I climbed all the way to the top. Best view in the city. Go on a clear day to make it worth your while.",
          "I went to this church during a visit to Zurich. The church became Protestant in 1523, during the Reformation, and many statues were removed. The inside in fairly plain now, but still worth a visit. Entry is free. This is a very important site for the Swiss - German Reformation.",
          "We went in here firstly to see the stained glass windows, both old and contemporary and then to go up the tower. There are spectacular views from the top, a must do! I also loved the entrance door to the church too with carved panels. Must do!",
          "Cool landmark. Worth it to pay extra to walk up to the top of tower. Views of Zurich from the tower are breathtaking.",
          "Located on the northern/western side of Lemmat, you can walk along the Lemmatquai to the Grossmunster. Its two towers are visible from a distance as they stand tall from in the skyline. They are architecturally flawless from close-up. It's fascinating how the cathedral sits at a",
          "A must if visiting Zurich. The tower costs 4 Swiss Francs per person, and when you get up the stairs you get a wonderful view of Zurich.",
          "If you're going to come to Z\u00fcrich this is a great place to start. It's a beautiful Cathedral with lots of rose windows and is well-kept. There is a two Swiss franc charge to walk up one of the twin towers but it is well worth it. It is a great reminder of what it feels like to",
          "The church itself is iconically Zurich so it's a must to at least see from the outside. Inside, you're not missing much. There are many other beautiful churches that actually do allow photography instead of scolding you like a child for not realizing you weren't suppose to take",
          "The Grossm\u00fcnster is worth a visit. The bronze doors by M\u00fcnch and the Giacometti stained glass windows are impressive. Make sure to go to the crypt to see the statue of Charlemagne. The stained glass windows by Sigmar Polke are beautiful but I felt they were just too modern",
          "Stumbled upon the stairwell to go up to the top of Grossmunster and really enjoyed it! Definitely a good place to see a view of the lovely city, and worth the time and money. We were very happily surprised!",
          "It was a bitterly cold afternoon and it was nice to be inside for awhile. The church is worth a look, but the view from the tower is the real attraction and worth the fee charged to climb it. It is not a hard climb, as far as these things go, and the views are stunning.",
          "It's a great church worth visiting. It's a classical Protestant church so the layout is different. If you are a catholic or orthodox it'll look very different to you than what you are used too (altar, fresques, etc). The entrance is unusual as well (also hard to find).",
          "Grossm\u00fcnster is a great church, very interesting to visit. The entrance is free, and if you want, with few CHFs ,you can \"climb\" to the top of the towers to an amazing sight, a view from above of the city. But I didn't liked that it is not announced that to reach the top there",
          "The church is beautiful and the entry is free. The best thing is that you can go up to the tower and see the city from above! The bad part is that the only way to go to the tower is through the little and High stairs...no one told us that it was hard to go up and come back.",
          "The brothers and sister of our grand-grand- grand father emigrated to Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain, all over West Europe, and of course to Switzerland. But some of our grand- grand- fathers/ -mothers went to North America (USA, Canada) amd Brasil /South America, and to Far",
          "I highly recommend a trip to Grossmunster if you are in Zurich. The church is lovely. You can climb to the top and get a wonderful view of Zurich. The stained glass window are beautiful and there are some guides to both the church and other churches in the city that are good to",
          "Before you reach the top you got 187 stairs to exercise. For kids is a bit dangerous as the stairs are very narrow on a circular stair case but definitely worth going for a good view adults:4CHF kids:2CHF.",
          "It is a beautiful cathedral. Typically Protestant cathedral . You can see inside the stained glass by Augusto Giacometti the Swiss artist added at 1932. You can see it while you walk beside the limmat river.",
          "Take some time in this beautiful church. Climb to the top for unbeatable views of Zurich lake, and Zurich at large. (There is a fee to climb up, it is cash only, ~7 CHF/person and absolutely worth it.) In particular, note the windows: symmetrical patterns of oddly familiar",
          "One of the best things you can during a visit in Z\u00fcrich is visit the tower and the incredible views of the city from there. Highly recommended!!!!",
          "A gorgeous organ, lots of history and the wonderful feel of a worshipping congregation, and if you are able, well worth the climb to see the view of the city and it's surrounds.",
          "Since 2009 Sigmar Polke's windows have decorated the Grossmunster and much as I think this is a lovely and impressive landmark in Zurich, the Polke's windows have to be seen to be believed. The workmanship which has gone into creating these beautiful windows made of finely",
          "This historic church is located in a pedestrian friendly area of Zurich that is convenient to the river, restaurants, shopping, and transportation. The primary activity is climbing the many steps up the narrow winding stairway within one of the towers to an observation area",
          "This is an easy walk from old town and quite an impressive landmark in Zurich .. it was nice to walk around",
          "A Beautiful door leads the middle aisle area with the alter to left and right takes you to the stair case to the top. It is 4 SF to go up. It is very narrow, steep and confined but not very far up. The view is amazing.",
          "The cathedral was the starting point of the Protestant Reformation in Zurich. Climb the tower to admire the incredible view over the city money! Watch the wonderful stained glass windows and large bronze doors made by Augusto Giacometti.",
          "This church is world renown for its unique look with its twin towers and picturesque setting near the river. Our guide told us there is evidence of a Roman cemetery of sorts under this church.",
          "Here is an excellent example of a Reformation era cathedral with a long history. Upon entering, look to the left and right of the doorway to find wooden tablets you can carry around and get descriptions of key points within the cathedral. Note the wall murals within the",
          "We saw the Grossmunster as we were walking around Z\u00fcrich and decided to see what there was to do. It turns out you can go up to the top of the tower and see some pretty nice views. The building is also photo worthy itself so worth checking off your list of things to see while",
          "Loved the sunny views of the city from the top of the tower here. Possibly the best thing I did whilst in the city centre of Zurich. Great views of nearby churches, the river, lake and mountains. Definitely worth the walk up!",
          "It offers a great view of the city from top. It is fairly plain at the inside but it has great windows, those sliced windows are cool.",
          "We were just walking around the old town on our own and saw this church. Saw the interesting door and see if we can go inside. Not very interesting inside and then I saw a couple of guys coming out a small door and wondered about it. Then I saw an arrow pointing Tower sign.",
          "Okay. So there's not too much to see and do in Zurich, especially if you're on a tight budget. Grossmunster is therefore worth a visit as it is a key landmark (both geographically and historically) and entry to the church is free. However, if you'd like to take a hike up the",
          "Not the most interesting church we have visited, especially on the inside as pointed out by many others it is fairly plain inside. The sliced agate windows are some of the more interesting and colourful parts. The old statue of Charlamagne is also worth seeing, and you can not",
          "Not sure if you can go inside, but if you're in Zurich it's worth a walk over just to see it. It's beautiful to see in person",
          "The church is obviously very famous. Is wildly visited but I have to say being in the city center, it didn't stand out on its own. The style is very common over in Europe but misses the mark when talking about grandness of it",
          "The church in itself is pretty impressive, but going up to the towers to take in the view is amazing. Its about 186 steps to the top but its worth it, you do have to pay to go up I think its about 5 francs.",
          "The church can be seen from many parts of Zurich so it is must see. It is free to get in and well worth going inside.",
          "One of the landmark churches of Zurich, it has traditional stained glass windows and a series of modern installations. No admission fee. Worth a visit.",
          "One of the best views in all of Zurich. The climb up the stairs is also neat. Very tight little climb, not for the claustrophobic. Try it at sunset.",
          "Unfortunately photography is only allowed on the outside but it is a beautiful building that is worth a visit if you are in the area.",
          "Nice to see the history of the church and structure, but disappointing at same level that photos are not allowed inside.",
          "After seeing so many cathedrals on our trip this one falls a bit a flat. Reason why is that it is promising on the outside but when you go inside is a bit dull. Visit it anyway and take your own conclusion. We didn't went up the tower because it was full and we had to wait a lot",
          "This was on most to-do but I would say it is something you wouldn't miss. Have a stroll around the compound and take your photos of the exterior. You won't miss much. We were told to pay 2 CHF each and then realized it was for 2 English brochures. It is not a high price, but",
          "Grossmunster is a must visit in Zurich. The church itself offers nothing extraordinary. There is chance to climb up to the tower. There is a 4 chf or euro fee but it is worth it. Stairs are narrow and there are a lot of steps. However, the views are really nice up in the tower.",
          "It looks very impressive from the outside but the inside looks OK. It wasn't impressive to me. But of course you have to visit if you are in Zurich, You can't miss it if you are in the old town.",
          "We attended a wedding here - it's elegantly simply decorated inside, making the stained glass all the more striking. Make sure to take the stairs up to the top of the tower for the best views of Zurich Old Town - there are plenty of points to rest or let others pass so don't",
          "To go up there, you need to climb steps.. but it's pretty landmarks.. the church looks clean, neat, and surrounding area was also good..",
          "Grossmunster is a very nice church from the inside, but not nearly as large as the outside may make you think it would be. Compared to some other larger churches that I've been to across Europe, not sure I'd come back to this one again.",
          "It's a pretty landmark, but not a must-see. Yes, it is old, and yes, if you're in the area, pop in for interest sake; it is pretty with impressive architecture. It does not have wow-factor.",
          "the highlight of the visit was the walk up the winding stairs to the top of the bell tower to the most beautiful views over Zurich.",
          "Zurich is, without a doubt, a beautiful city. But taking the time to go up the steps of the tower at Grossmunster really gives you a 360 degree view of the city! You can see the lake, the canals, the rest of the buildings, and it is absolutely breathtaking! Price is 2 CFH for",
          "This place is average, if you are passing by definitely check it out but don't go out of your way to see it.",
          "You cannot miss this huge protestantic church when in Zurich, because you see it wherever you are in the city. The two towers are very beautiful indeed. Inside, however, it is not as exuberant as im catholic countries, so there is not much too see. You should admire the inside,",
          "beautiful church. make sure to bring cash with you to go to the observation deck because they do not accept credit cards",
          "The building is massive. Inside are remarquable windows by Polke. Architecture strict as per Prostestant religion.",
          "The Grossmunster is located in old town and is easily reachable if you walk through the latter. But Grossmunster should be seen both close up and at a distance to appreciate the size of the entire structure.",
          "A visit to Grossmunster needs to be combined with a visit to Fraumunster, Predigerkirche and St Peters. They together give a wonderful picture of the religious history of Zurich. In Grossmunster you can, and really should, climb the tower for two reasons - the view and the",
          "Zurich really doesnt amaze you regarding architecture and the grossmunster is a more reason to think so.",
          "We visited this place during the Spring season & it was the best time I guess to visit.. Not too hot neither too cold.. Good views around the place makes it a perfect place to be there..",
          "We arrived too late to go up the tower but a visit is worthwhile just for the unusual 'stained glass' windows made by Sigmar Polke from very thin slices of agate. Photography not permitted, unfortunately.",
          "We stopped here as we were wandering through the streets. There is great views from here like everyone is saying. The style of the church is very different that typically we have seen across Europe, concrete inside and out, almost gothic, and no murals. Interesting though to see",
          "After climbing the 187 stairs the views over Zurich were spectacular. I would highly recommend putting this on your itinerary.",
          "The church itself is not too exciting, very gothic, lots of stone, but the stained glass windows are created with wafer thin slices of semi-precious stone so they are quite intriguing... very pretty. The walk to the top is tight and long through round stone steps and loads of",
          "We went here on the off chance and the views were incredible! Well worth the visit, cheap too - a real experience in a great city",
          "It's not a heart pumping church. I was a little disappointed to see it close. You can just pass quickly and go to other part of the city",
          "Zurich\"s cathedral.Gothic style building where Zwigli was talking about reformation.Across from Limmat river.",
          "Walked along the river to this iconic location that is the heart and soul of Zurich. Explored the old church and then crossed the bridge to walk up to a park across the river where there were plenty of opportunities to take beautiful pics of the city and enjoy the views.",
          "Rich history, beautiful stained glass windows and amazing view at the top! At CHF4, you get to climb 187 steep steps up the tower to enjoy excellent views of Zurich. Phenomenal view, definitely worth the climb.",
          "Although I understand the minimalistic approach of the Reformation this building was so stripped vet it was totally unimpressive",
          "Lovely experience visiting this old church. You can climb up very steep steps to get view from the top. Amazing how many roof terraces are in the city centre!",
          "There's been a church on this site since 900, so the history is intoxicating. The stained glass windows are beautiful, the krypt just fascinating and the walk to the top, well it's 187 stairs in a really narrow staircase, so let's call that 'invigorating'.! The view from the top",
          "This is one of three churches that form a triangle in the city of Zurich. Built beginning in the 8th century, it is built on the legendary burial place of Felix and Regula, the patron saints of Zurich. The church, as with so many in Europe, is beautiful with many beautiful",
          "This is the only church I visited that before you can get inside they will require you to give donation. Donation for what I understand is something you will not be obliged to give and you can give no matter how much it maybe whole heartedly.. It's kinda weird.. although it's",
          "It is like an old building it has so many stairs to the top. So if you are in good shape go there and at the end you will have great view on the roofs of Zurich. You can take nice photos from there.",
          "We stumbled upon the Grossmunster walking through the Altstadt of Zurich. What's really unique about this church is the different stained glass in every window. As mentioned in other reviews, there are cards available in different languages to take with you as you walk around",
          "We liked this building very much, lovely central location and beautiful and very unusual stained glass windows. The main doors were designed by Edvard Munch. Do not miss it.",
          "The double towers of Great Minster are Zurich`s old town landmark. According to the legend Charlemagne built the towers at the place where the graves of the city saints Felix and Regula were discovered.",
          "Probably the best place in the town for the view. A good climb too especially up the last wooden stairs. I think it was only 4 Franks. If you can get anything in Zurich for 4 franks then take it.",
          "Worth a visit for the pretty jewel coloured Giacometti stained glass windows, but go up the tower for 4CHF. Lovely 360' views of the city, river & lake",
          "Grossmunster was built around 1100 and it was inaugurated around 1220. You can go inside and appreciate the inside architecture. An added bonus you can climb up to the top of the bell tower. It takes 187 steps to get to the top so you need to be reasonably fit to climb to the",
          "The Protestant Reformation in Switzerland was led in part by Rev. Zwingli. He was priest at Grossmunster in the early 1500's and joined in the Reformation movement.",
          "I think we were somewhat disappointed other than the beautiful Stained Glass windows. Unlike France, Italy and Portugal, the church was very plain inside. Great view from the Tower if you feel you can make the climb.",
          "This is an interesting church stemming from before the Reformation. Step into the crypt area to see its origins. The stain glass windows are eclectic and interesting. When entering, look to the right of the door for guides on wooden tableaus that you can take with you as you",
          "For only 4 bucks you can walk to the top of this cathedral. The view from their are the best in Zurich. You get a great views of old town and the lake.",
          "I was impressed by the tombs under the church with the statue of Charlemagne watching over, I sat there to meditate and pray for the deceased in my family. Wish I had the chance to visit once more",
          "Relative to other cathedrals of the world, the architecture here is not outstanding. However, this place is steeped in the history of the Reformation. And, a climb to the top of the clock tower is great fun. Caution: the stairway is very steep and narrow (not recommended",
          "Start by reading one of the multi-language information cards found next to the entrance. Pay 4cf (they accept euros) for the opportunity to climb 187 steps to the viewing deck. Fabulous view of altstadt.",
          "One thing hits you as soon as you go in; it is very plain, not at all like the great cathedrals of Italy. Protestant churches are not ornate or grand. The visit could take less than ten minutes! There is not a lot to do in Zurich, so you might want to go here.",
          "If you are a Christian or student of Reformation History, you must visit Grossmunster while in Zurich. Make sure you allow yourself enough time to climb the tower for great views of the city. Don't forget to walk to the Water Church and view the statue of Zwingli.",
          "If you're a historian or a Christian, this is a must visit. I have been here twice. Once to visit and tour the church which includes the downstairs museum and climbing the tower and the other time on Sunday morning for the actual service and although I did not understand",
          "I loved the serenity of this place of worship. I was told I should have walked to the lookout as the views of the city are spectacular but I was happy to enjoy the feeling of peace at ground level.",
          "This I s on of the largest churches in the city. It was built in 1781 and has many gothic features On the side of the church is a large statue of Charlemagne",
          "Like the Tour Eiffel for Paris or the Big Ben for London, this is the symbol of Zurich, its key landmark... Its unique and very distinctive shape and its prominent position on the Limmat river not far from the lake head make it so. The facade with the two twin belltowers at the",
          "You can reach the top of the munster by stairs. Its excellent for viewing the whole city, the river and the city itself. It is a perfect set for grabbing city knowledge.",
          "Cant miss it when in the city. This is the place that started all the Reformation in the country, where most of the country went from being Catholic to Protestant.",
          "Like many of Zurich's churches, this one was better from the outside than inside. We found the interior disappointing although there were some good stained glass windows.",
          "This church, along with the other 3 main churches of Zurich has an enthralling history. As Zurich was a major town in reformation times and home to a great many prevalent reformers (such as Zwingili), Grossmunster is the biggest and most historical of all the churches. Whilst",
          "I have visited this church many times, and the interior windows are definitely worth admiring from the inside as well as outside. Be wary though, if there is some kind of musical practice going on inside, the priest/pastor will not let you in to have a look. Beautifully simple",
          "This church dominates the area, being quite imposing and interesting to walk to in the lovely streets. Quite plain inside though and not quite as I would have expected. Is worth a look.",
          "North Americans go to Europe to see old buildings because we don't really have any back home! Great old church with public access and amazing views from the tower. A must see in Old Zurich.",
          "For all of its grandness outside inside it does not have the same inside. Although enjoyed the acoustics of the crypt ;)",
          "A nice church to visit and learn the history behind it. You also grab some good pictures from that area. Walk your way up to the church and then down to bridge across the river.",
          "The inside is very ordinary and nothing to compare with other great old churches. The view from the top is great but you can get other great views from places in Zurich whithout having to go up 187 steps.",
          "When visiting this church, don't miss the chance to climb to the top of the tower. (Cost a few $) The cool air coming off the alps & the lovely lake views are just glorious. Yes, it's a lot of tight stairs...both stone and wood. But, it's doable and you'll be rewarded. Just",
          "I didn't find much to do here aside from climbing to the top (although there are a few interesting stained glass windows inside). The views are wonderful. There are about 2 flights of very tight, spiral stairs and then they widen and become more traditional wooden stairs.",
          "Beautiful building set just above the main river which runs right through the city Very clean, bright and great views across the city Need to comeback for a longer visit as this was a beautiful well maintained city",
          "The importance of this church is only understood if the importance of Zwingli is understood in the Reformation. The building is very basic, though there is some excellent modern stained glass.",
          "Nice old church with interesting architecture. Every glass window frame tells a story. Chf4 fee to climb the tower, 187 steps to the top will show you a nice view of the city :-)",
          "One of four major churches in Zurich, this one dominates the skyline along the Limat River in central Zurich. It is in the old town with lots of scenic streets and lanes surrounding the church. Inside it is not not as spectacular as other churches but still worth a visit,",
          "Like everyone says it's worth the few bucks to climb the stairs up this church and get great photos of the city One nice addition we weren't expecting was that the organist started playing while we were there so on the way out we sat on the pews for an extra 5-10 minutes to",
          "Me and my friend were just exploring and saw this church, couldn't find the main door to get in for quite a while haha. The inside is really big, and you're not allowed to take photos inside. I inconspicuously took one of a stained glass. The stained glass pieces are very very",
          "Another beautiful church in the heart of Zurich.. one of four major churches in Zurich. It is beautiful and dominates the skyline of the old town. It's a Protestant Church so pretty minimal inside (at least compared to Catholic Churches), but it's lovely. You can climb to the",
          "Climbing the spiral stairs, older wooden stairs the rest of the way. Worth every step. Pictures will be our highlight of trip. Be prepared for steep incline. Would highly recommend.",
          "The climb up the curving steps to the top of the tower was like stepping back in time. The views of Zurich and Lake Zurich from the top were fantastic.",
          "The plaz near the church has great view since ut is high above the lake. The building itself is very impressive but in order to experience it you need to cross the river since it is huge. But inside it is not a church that hokds your breath.",
          "Passed by while on the best of Zurich tour. The weather is slightly forgiving today, slightly drizzling. Nevertheless, the view along the riverbank is awesome. Many of the buildings have a history behind, which were explained by the guide.",
          "Visited with my husband and would say this was a highlight for us. 4swiss francs to walk up the tower. From here the views are lovely all around. Would recommend.",
          "Zurich's landmark. Architecturally beautiful church. It's free entry into the church, and for CHF 4, you can gain access to one of the towers. 187 steps later and after numerous huffing and puffing, you are rewarded with a magnificent view of Zurich. Simply breathtaking,",
          "you can enjoy a complete scene of the town from the tower. Indeed, you have to pay for the ticket. but it is worth to see the city from above. You can see how beautiful the old town, the lake, and the mountain from here.",
          "Grossmunster is a mandatory crossing point and that is close to everything. We can enter the church, but cannot take pictures. Well worth it and recommend",
          "I found the church lovely, we went up to the tower and even tho it was hot, humid and crowded, the view was absolutely worth it!",
          "This is a very mediocre place to visit. The views are good but the church besides its size has not much going for it. It is historically a relevant site but beyond that I would not recommend it to any visitor.",
          "Big church a bit bare and simple. For a fee, you can go up the towers and have a good view of the surroundings and lake zurich",
          "The church itself is interesting from an architectural point of view, but far from being unforgettable. It is worth a visit if you are touring Zurich, together with the old town. You should not miss the visit to the top of the tower, from where you have a beautiful view of the",
          "Beautiful Architechture. Nicely preserved. It is not big inside but it holdsa lot of interesting history. Pay 4 CHF and you can go up on of the towers for sweeping views of zurich. Anything in this city is photogenic so don't miss the opportunity to have beautiful views from",

          "It is biggest Roman Church in Swiss. It is full of stories and you may understand more about Swiss people and history. Across the bridge, you may take the nice photos. In the afternoon is better.",
          "Stained glass windows in front are totally different from the Chagal windows in Fraumunster church directly across the river. No explanations given in the Church about these windows, which is unfortunate.",
          "Beautiful church with nice interior. Please do not expect rich decorations as it is a protestant church, but it worth to go in. Unfortunately, we did not have a time to climb the tower, as I believe the view is anazing.",
          "Right in the middle of the city is this beautiful church; well maintained and totally free to enter. I believe you can climb up from there but have to pay a small fee. Just standing there you can take in so many beautiful views of the city and the lake! a must visit for sure.",

          "It's taken us 8 years of living in Switzerland to finally visit - and we count ourselves lucky as we got to peek in on a Holy Communion rehearsal!",
          "The church has a set of stained glass windows made out of agate rock crystals encased in glass that are really unusual and beautiful. It's worth a visit.",
          "This is a fairly stark church with some very distinctive touches. The main doors are an incredible set of panels showing various scenes. The windows are not traditional stained glass. Some are made of cut rock, others are optical illusions. None have any explanation as to why",
          "A place of worship for patron saints Felix and Regula. Beautiful exteriors, peaceful interiors, picturesque surroundings and nice shopping places.",
          "It is a small church, with a simple decoration but a nice place to visit. You can go up stairs, in one of the towers, it cost 4 CHF per person. It was a beautiful view of the city old town. We went up on a raining day, and it still worth. It is 187 steps and it is a easy climb,",
          "Disappointing. Architecture wasn't really that great and there isn't much to see so we made a very quick visit.",
          "Not so special if you compare it with carholic churches in Italy or France...however it is nice to know the differences ...between catholic churches and christian churches....",
          "Take the time and visit one of the best church's in Zurich. It is quite impressive outside and even more so inside. You do need to take time for your visit.",
          "Worth more than one visit; every time I come with friends the light is different and the stained glass windows created by Sigmar Polke in 2009 seem to look different; the same with the stained glass windows by Augusto Giacometti (dating from 1932) in the Nave. Of course one",
          "Probably the most impressive stained-glass windows, I've ever seen. They are made of mineral stones and amazimgly beautiful. You are not allowed to take photos, but can buy a postcard.",
          "This church is a really nice balance between a fine architecture from the outside (capable of captivating every distracted gaze passing by the street) and a warm feeling possible to be experienced from the inside. Cute from inside, interesting adornments.",
          "Lovely old church. Try to attend a concert here....but be sure to take the stairs up to the outside balcony. It's a bit of a close, steep stairway, but it opens up about 1/3 of the way up).",
          "The Statue of Emperor Carolus Magnus in my guide of Zurich... The route did not describe the beauty of the church where I could find this statue. The first word that came to my lips is: \"WOW!\". Obviously the word was whispered, because this church is still an active house of",
          "A visit to the Grossmunster is a trip into the past of Switzerland. Anyone interested in Swiss history and/or the Reformation should visit the church and the adjoining cloister. There is also a brilliant stained glass window by Giacometti. Well worth a visit.",
          "A huge and most famous landmark in Zurich. Very old church which is tather plain inside but has beautiful stained glasss windows. Photos not allowed but postcards inside are cheap. Worth the 4 Francs to climb the tower, up narrow stone and wooden steps which are a little",

          "The Grossmunster is a very old cathedral. It is very plain inside, with few adornments. The windows are, however, really beautiful. They are modern and in s variety of styles. As art they are worth a visit. As thought provoking pieces they are wonderful. Worth a quick stop to",
          "If you're going to visit Zurich, you really should visit here. Grossm\u00fcnster, once a cathedral, has an impressive history. According to legend, it was founded by Charlemagne and has ties to various saints as well as the Protestant Reformation. It also offers one of the best",
          "I took my norwegian friends there and they loved it. The church is beautiful, big and got lots of history. One can climb one of the two towers which i highly recommend! Once the steep climb is over all the steps taken were worth it. The view is simply amazing!! However, one",

          "If you've been to top historical sites like Saint Chappelle and Westminster, this church will not necessarily be awe inspiring, but it was worth the additional little walk. The architecture is lovely, and the original statue in the crypt (circa the 1100s) is really neat. It's a",
          "This church has the stained glass windows by Augusto Giacometti, which are astonishing. Even on a cloudy day, it is miraculous inside. They also have a very helpfu information desk inside, with volunteers who know quite a bit about local events. Buy a postcard here!",
          "Another rather plain church but with magnificent stained glass, including amazing modern stuff. The Church tower is apparently worth the climb for the City views, but one needs to be fit",

          "I was showing a relation the Zurich old town and happened to pass the Grossmunster so decided to pop in. The Munster is not very ornate but does offer the opportunity to climb one of its towers for breathtaking views of the city. Don't forget to detour down to the crypt.",
          "Thanks to friends I have been up on the tower. The 360\u00b0 view of Zurich is simply amazing. If you don't mind climbing up the narrow stairs (some parts are very narrow), then it is definitely worth going up there. To do so you need to get a ticket inside the church. I believe it",
          "This is one of the historic and famous churches in Zurich, Overlooking the river, the twin towers of the Church look magnificent and imposing. The climb up the 200 odd steps can be never ending and tiring. The views from the top though makes up for the hardship endured",
          "In Z\u00fcrich you can find several beautiful old Churches and Grossm\u00fcnster is maybe the most famous one. Like it name(Gross=Big) says, you can see those tall twin towers far away. There is almost 200 steps up there and climb can be tough, but views up there are amazing! So worth of",
          "Make sure to drop by this old and historic church in Old Town if you are traveling in Zurich. It is one of the most important church in Switzerland since it houses the original statue of Charles the Great, King of Franks who united Western Europe in the Middle Ages. His statue",

          "You can't miss these twin rounded towers as you walk along the left or right bank of the old town or even as you just step out of the main train station and cross the bridge in front. Beautiful from the outside especially during sunset. I didn't get to go in as it was past",

        "wiki": "Z\u00fcrich (Alemannic German: Z\u00fcri; French: Zurich; Italian: Zurigo; Romansh: Turitg) is the largest city in Switzerland and the capital of the canton of Z\u00fcrich. It is located in north-central Switzerland at the northwestern tip of Lake Z\u00fcrich. As of January 2020 the municipality has 434,335 inhabitants, the urban area (agglomeration) 1.315 million (2009) and the Z\u00fcrich metropolitan area 1.83 million (2011). Z\u00fcrich is a hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Both Zurich Airport and railway station are the largest and busiest in the country.\nPermanently settled for over 2,000 years, Z\u00fcrich was founded by the Romans, who, in 15 BC, called it Turicum. However, early settlements have been found dating back more than 6,400 years (although this only indicates human presence in the area and not the presence of a town that early). During the Middle Ages, Z\u00fcrich gained the independent and privileged status of imperial immediacy and, in 1519, became a primary centre of the Protestant Reformation in Europe under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli.The official language of Z\u00fcrich is German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Z\u00fcrich German.\nMany museums and art galleries can be found in the city, including the Swiss National Museum, the Kunsthaus and newer Theater 11 in Oerlikon. Schauspielhaus Z\u00fcrich is one of the most important theatres in the German-speaking world.Z\u00fcrich is among the world's largest financial centres despite having a relatively small population. The city is home to many financial institutions and banking companies. Many of Switzerland's research and development centres are concentrated in the Greater Z\u00fcrich area and the low tax rates and canton funding subsidies attract overseas companies to set up their headquarters or finance treasury services in the city.Monocle's 2012 \"Quality of Life Survey\" ranked Z\u00fcrich first on a list of the top 25 cities in the world \"to make a base within\". In 2019 Z\u00fcrich was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Geneva and Basel.\n\n\n== Name ==\nIn German, the city name is written Z\u00fcrich, and pronounced [\u02c8tsy\u02d0r\u026a\u00e7] in Swiss Standard German. In Z\u00fcrich German, the local dialect of Swiss German, the name is pronounced without the final consonant, as Z\u00fcri [\u02c8tsyri], although the adjective remains Z\u00fcrcher(in) [\u02c8tsyrx\u0259r(\u026an)]. The city is called Zurich [zy\u0281ik] in French, Zurigo [dzu\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0261o] in Italian, and Turitg [tu\u02c8rit\u0255] (listen) in Romansh.\nIn English, the name used to be written as Zurich, without the umlaut. Even so, standard English practice for German names is to either preserve the umlaut or replace it with the base letter followed by e (i.e. Zuerich). It is pronounced  ZEWR-ik, and more recently sometimes also with /ts/, as in German.The earliest known form of the city's name is Turicum, attested on a tombstone of the late 2nd century AD in the form STA(tio) TURICEN(sis) (\"Turicum tax post\").  The name is interpreted as a derivation from a given name, possibly Gaulish personal name T\u016bros, for a reconstructed native form of the toponym of *Tur\u012bcon. The Latin stress on the long vowel of the Gaulish name, [t\u028a\u02c8ri\u02d0k\u00f5\u02d0], was lost in German [\u02c8tsy\u02d0r\u026a\u00e7] but is preserved in Italian [dzu\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0261o] and in Romansh [tu\u02c8rit\u0255]. The first development towards its later, Germanic form is attested as early as the 6th century with the form Ziurichi. From the 9th century onward, the name is established in an Old High German form Zuri(c)h (857 in villa Zurih, 924 in Zurich curtem, 1416 Z\u00fcrich Stadt). In the early modern period, the name became associated with the name of the Tigurini, and the name Tigurum rather than the historical Turicum is sometimes encountered in Modern Latin contexts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nSettlements of the Neolithic and Bronze Age were found around Lake Z\u00fcrich. Traces of pre-Roman Celtic, La T\u00e8ne settlements were discovered near the Lindenhof, a morainic hill dominating the SE - NW waterway constituted by Lake Zurich and the river Limmat. In Roman times, during the conquest of the alpine region in 15 BC, the Romans built a castellum on the Lindenhof.  Later here was erected Turicum (a toponym of clear Celtic origin), a tax-collecting point for goods trafficked on the Limmat, which constituted part of the border between Gallia Belgica (from AD 90 Germania Superior) and Raetia: this customs point developed later into a vicus. After Emperor Constantine's reforms in AD 318, the border between Gaul and Italy (two of the four praetorian prefectures of the Roman Empire) was located east of Turicum, crossing the river Linth between Lake Walen and Lake Z\u00fcrich, where a castle and garrison looked over Turicum's safety. The earliest written record of the town dates from the 2nd century, with a tombstone referring to it as to the Statio Turicensis Quadragesima Galliarum (\"Z\u00fcrich post for collecting the 2.5% value tax of the Galliae\"), discovered at the Lindenhof.In the 5th century, the Germanic Alemanni tribe settled in the Swiss Plateau. The Roman castle remained standing until the 7th century. A Carolingian castle, built on the site of the Roman castle by the grandson of Charlemagne, Louis the German, is mentioned in 835 (in castro Turicino iuxta fluvium Lindemaci). Louis also founded the Fraum\u00fcnster abbey in 853 for his daughter Hildegard. He endowed the Benedictine convent with the lands of Z\u00fcrich, Uri, and the Albis forest, and granted the convent immunity, placing it under his direct authority. In 1045, King Henry III granted the convent the right to hold markets, collect tolls, and mint coins, and thus effectively made the abbess the ruler of the city.Z\u00fcrich gained Imperial immediacy (Reichsunmittelbar, becoming an Imperial free city) in 1218 with the extinction of the main line of the Z\u00e4hringer family and attained a status comparable to statehood. During the 1230s, a city wall was built, enclosing 38 hectares, when the earliest stone houses on the Rennweg were built as well. The Carolingian castle was used as a quarry, as it had started to fall into ruin.Emperor Frederick II promoted the abbess of the Fraum\u00fcnster to the rank of a duchess in 1234. The abbess nominated the mayor, and she frequently delegated the minting of coins to citizens of the city. The political power of the convent slowly waned in the 14th century, beginning with the establishment of the Zunftordnung (guild laws) in 1336 by Rudolf Brun, who also became the first independent mayor, i.e. not nominated by the abbess.\nAn important event in the early 14th century was the completion of the Manesse Codex, a key source of medieval German poetry. The famous illuminated manuscript \u2013 described as \"the most beautifully illumined German manuscript in centuries;\" \u2013 was commissioned by the Manesse family of Z\u00fcrich, copied and illustrated in the city at some time between 1304 and 1340. Producing such a work was a highly expensive prestige project, requiring several years work by highly skilled scribes and miniature painters, and it clearly testifies to the increasing wealth and pride of Z\u00fcrich citizens in this period.\n\n\n==== Archaeological findings ====\nA female who died in about 200 B.C found buried in a carved tree trunk during a construction project at the Kern school complex in March 2017 in Aussersihl. Archaeologists revealed that she was approximately 40 years old when she died and likely carried out little physical labor when she was alive. A sheepskin coat, a belt chain, a fancy wool dress, a scarf and a pendant made of glass and amber beads were also discovered with the woman.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nOn 1 May 1351, the citizens of Z\u00fcrich had to swear allegiance before representatives of the cantons of Lucerne, Schwyz, Uri and Unterwalden, the other members of the Swiss Confederacy. Thus, Z\u00fcrich became the fifth member of the Confederacy, which was at that time a loose confederation of de facto independent states. Z\u00fcrich was the presiding canton of the Diet from 1468 to 1519. This authority was the executive council and lawmaking body of the confederacy, from the Middle Ages until the establishment of the Swiss federal state in 1848. Z\u00fcrich was temporarily expelled from the confederacy in 1440 due to a war with the other member states over the territory of Toggenburg (the Old Z\u00fcrich War). Neither side had attained significant victory when peace was agreed upon in 1446, and Z\u00fcrich was readmitted to the confederation in 1450.\n\nZwingli started the Swiss Reformation at the time when he was the main preacher in the 1520s, at the Grossm\u00fcnster. He lived there from 1484 until his death in 1531. The Z\u00fcrich Bible, based on that of Zwingli, was issued in 1531. The Reformation resulted in major changes in state matters and civil life in Z\u00fcrich, spreading also to a number of other cantons. Several cantons remained Catholic and became the basis of serious conflicts that eventually led to the outbreak of the Wars of Kappel.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the Council of Z\u00fcrich adopted an isolationist attitude, resulting in a second ring of imposing fortifications built in 1624. The Thirty Years' War which raged across Europe motivated the city to build these walls. The fortifications required a lot of resources, which were taken from subject territories without reaching any agreement. The following revolts were crushed brutally. In 1648, Z\u00fcrich proclaimed itself a republic, shedding its former status of a free imperial city. In this time the political system of Z\u00fcrich was an oligarchy (Patriziat): the dominant families of the city were the following ones: Bonstetten, Brun, B\u00fcrkli, Escher vom Glas, Escher vom Luchs, Hirzel, Jori (or von Jori), Kilchsperger, Landenberg, Manesse, Meiss, Meyer von Knonau, M\u00fclner, von Orelli.\n\nThe Helvetic Revolution of 1798 saw the fall of the Ancien R\u00e9gime. Z\u00fcrich lost control of the land and its economic privileges, and the city and the canton separated their possessions between 1803\u201305. In 1839, the city had to yield to the demands of its urban subjects, following the Z\u00fcriputsch of 6 September. Most of the ramparts built in the 17th century were torn down, without ever having been besieged, to allay rural concerns over the city's hegemony. The Treaty of Z\u00fcrich between Austria, France, and Sardinia was signed in 1859.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nZ\u00fcrich was the Federal capital for 1839\u201340, and consequently, the victory of the Conservative party there in 1839 caused a great stir throughout Switzerland. But when in 1845 the Radicals regained power at Z\u00fcrich, which was again the Federal capital for 1845\u201346, Z\u00fcrich took the lead in opposing the Sonderbund cantons. Following the Sonderbund war and the formation of the Swiss Federal State, Z\u00fcrich voted in favour of the Federal constitutions of 1848 and of 1874. The enormous immigration from the country districts into the town from the 1830s onwards created an industrial class which, though \"settled\" in the town, did not possess the privileges of burghership, and consequently had no share in the municipal government. First of all in 1860 the town schools, hitherto open to \"settlers\" only on paying high fees, were made accessible to all, next in 1875 ten years' residence ipso facto conferred the right of burghership, and in 1893 the eleven outlying districts were incorporated within the town proper.\n\nExtensive developments took place during the 19th century. From 1847, the Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn, the first railway on Swiss territory, connected Z\u00fcrich with Baden, putting the Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof at the origin of the Swiss rail network. The present building of the Hauptbahnhof (the main railway station) dates to 1871. Z\u00fcrich's Bahnhofstrasse (Station Street) was laid out in 1867, and the Z\u00fcrich Stock Exchange was founded in 1877. Industrialisation led to migration into the cities and to rapid population growth, particularly in the suburbs of Z\u00fcrich.\nThe Quaianlagen are an important milestone in the development of the modern city of Z\u00fcrich, as the construction of the new lake front transformed Z\u00fcrich from a small medieval town on the rivers Limmat and Sihl to an attractive modern city on the Z\u00fcrichsee shore, under the guidance of the city engineer Arnold B\u00fcrkli.In 1893, the twelve outlying districts were incorporated into Z\u00fcrich, including Aussersihl, the workman's quarter on the left bank of the Sihl, and additional land was reclaimed from Lake Z\u00fcrich.In 1934, eight additional districts in the north and west of Z\u00fcrich were incorporated.\nZ\u00fcrich was accidentally bombed during World War II.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\n\nThe blue and white coat of arms of Z\u00fcrich is attested from 1389 and was derived from banners with blue and white stripes in use since 1315. The first certain testimony of banners with the same design is from 1434. The coat of arms is flanked by two lions. The red Schwenkel on top of the banner had varying interpretations: For the people of Z\u00fcrich, it was a mark of honour, granted by Rudolph I. Z\u00fcrich's neighbours mocked it as a sign of shame, commemorating the loss of the banner at Winterthur in 1292. Today, the Canton of Z\u00fcrich uses the same coat of arms as the city.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City districts ===\n\nThe previous boundaries of the city of Z\u00fcrich (before 1893) were more or less synonymous with the location of the old town. Two large expansions of the city limits occurred in 1893 and in 1934 when the city of Z\u00fcrich merged with many surrounding municipalities, that had been growing increasingly together since the 19th century. Today, the city is divided into twelve districts (known as Kreis in German), numbered 1 to 12, each one of which contains between one and four neighborhoods:\n\nKreis 1, known as Altstadt, contains the old town, both to the east and west of the start of the Limmat. District 1 contains the neighbourhoods of Hochschulen, Rathaus, Lindenhof, and City.\nKreis 2 lies along the west side of Lake Z\u00fcrich, and contains the neighbourhoods of Enge, Wollishofen and Leimbach.\nKreis 3, known as Wiedikon is between the Sihl and the Uetliberg, and contains the neighbourhoods of Alt-Wiedikon, Sihlfeld and Friesenberg.\nKreis 4, known as Aussersihl lies between the Sihl and the train tracks leaving Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof, and contains the neighbourhoods of Werd, Langstrasse, and Hard.\nKreis 5, known as Industriequartier, is between the Limmat and the train tracks leaving Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof, it contains the former industrial area of Z\u00fcrich which has gone under a large-scale rezoning to create upscale modern housing, retail and commercial real estate. It contains the neighborhoods of Gewerbeschule, and Escher-Wyss.\nKreis 6 is on the edge of the Z\u00fcrichberg, a hill overlooking the eastern part of the city. District 6 contains the neighbourhoods of Oberstrass and Unterstrass.\nKreis 7 is on the edge of the Adlisberg hill as well as the Z\u00fcrichberg, on the eastern side of the city. District 7 contains the neighbourhoods of Fluntern, Hottingen, and Hirslanden. These neighbourhoods are home to Z\u00fcrich's wealthiest and more prominent residents. The neighbourhood Witikon also belongs to district 7.\nKreis 8, officially called Riesbach, but colloquially known as Seefeld, lies on the eastern side of Lake Z\u00fcrich. District 8 consists of the neighbourhoods of Seefeld, M\u00fchlebach, and Weinegg.\nKreis 9 is between the Limmat to the north and the Uetliberg to the south. It contains the neighbourhoods Altstetten and Albisrieden.\nKreis 10 is to the east of the Limmat and to the south of the H\u00f6nggerberg and K\u00e4ferberg hills. District 10 contains the neighbourhoods of H\u00f6ngg and Wipkingen.\nKreis 11 is in the area north of the H\u00f6nggerberg and K\u00e4ferberg and between the Glatt Valley and the Katzensee (Cats Lake). It contains the neighbourhoods of Affoltern, Oerlikon and Seebach.\nKreis 12, known as Schwamendingen, is located in the Glattal (Glatt valley) on the northern side of the Z\u00fcrichberg. District 12 contains the neighbourhoods of Saatlen, Schwamendigen Mitte, and Hirzenbach.Most of the district boundaries are fairly similar to the original boundaries of the previously existing municipalities before they were incorporated into the city of Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe City Council (Stadtrat) constitutes the executive government of the City of Z\u00fcrich and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of nine councilors, each presiding over a department. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the City Council. The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. The mayor (German: Stadtpr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election by a system of Majorz while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. Any resident of Zurich allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. In the mandate period 2018\u20132022 (Legislatur) the City Council is presided by mayor Corine Mauch. The executive body holds its meetings in the City Hall (German: Stadthaus), on the left bank of the Limmat. The building was built in 1883 in Renaissance style.\nAs of May 2018, the Z\u00fcrich City Council is made up of three representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party, one of whom is the mayor), two members each of the Green Party and the FDP (Free Democratic Party), and one member each of GLP (Green Liberal Party) and AL (Alternative Left Party), giving the left parties a combined seven out of nine seats. The last regular election was held on 4 March 2018.\n\nClaudia Cuche-Curti is Town Chronicler (Stadtschreiberin) since 2012, and Peter Saile is Legal Counsel (Rechtskonsulent) since 2000 for the City Council.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe Municipal Council (Gemeinderat) holds the legislative power. It is made up of 125 members (Gemeindrat / Gemeinder\u00e4tin), with elections held every four years. The Municipal Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the City Council and the administration. The sessions of the Municipal Council are held in public. Unlike those of the City Council, the members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession but are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Z\u00fcrich allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The legislative body holds its meetings in the town hall (Rathaus), on the right bank of the Limmat opposite to the City Hall (Stadthaus).The last election of the Municipal Council was held on 4 March 2018 for the mandate period of 2018\u20132022. As of May 2018, the Municipal Council consist of 43 members of the Social Democratic Party (SP), 21 The Liberals (FDP), 17 members of the Swiss People's Party (SVP), 16 Green Party (GPS), 14 Green Liberal Party (GLP), 10 Alternative List (AL), and four members of the Evangelical People's Party (EVP), giving the left parties an absolute majority of 69.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the SPS which received 25.6% (-6) of the vote. The next four most popular parties were the GPS (20.9%, +9.7), GLP (15.7%, +6.4), SVP (13.7%, -4.3), the FDP (11.8%, -2.2), the AL (4%, new), and the CVP (3.5%, -0.2). In the federal election, a total of 110,760 voters were cast, and the voter turnout was 47.7%.In the 2015 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the SPS which received 31.6% of the vote. The next four most popular parties were the SVP (18%), the FDP (14%), the GPS (10.7%), the GLP (9.2%). In the federal election, a total of 114,377 voters were cast, and the voter turnout was 46.2%.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\n\n==== Twin towns and sister cities ====\nZ\u00fcrich is partnered with two sister cities: Kunming and San Francisco.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nZ\u00fcrich is situated at 408 m (1,339 ft) above sea level on the lower (northern) end of Lake Z\u00fcrich (Z\u00fcrichsee) about 30 kilometers (19 mi) north of the Alps, nestling between the wooded hills on the west and east side. The Old Town stretches on both sides of the Limmat, which flows from the lake, running northwards at first and then gradually turning into a curve to the west. The geographic (and historic) centre of the city is the Lindenhof, a small natural hill on the west bank of the Limmat, about 700 m (2,300 ft) north of where the river issues from Lake Z\u00fcrich. Today the incorporated city stretches somewhat beyond the natural confines of the hills and includes some districts to the northeast in the Glatt Valley (Glattal) and to the north in the Limmat Valley (Limmattal). The boundaries of the older city are easy to recognize by the Schanzengraben canal. This artificial watercourse has been used for the construction of the third fortress in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe municipality of Z\u00fcrich has an area of 91.88 km2 (35.48 sq mi), of which 4.1 km2 (1.6 sq mi) is made up of Lake Z\u00fcrich. The area includes a section of the northern Swiss Plateau. The banks of the Limmat constitute the densest part of the city. The river is oriented in the southeast\u2013northwest direction, with the flat valley floor having a width of two to two to three kilometres (1.2 to 1.9 miles). The partially channeled and straightened Limmat does not flow in the central part of the valley, but always along its right (northeastern) side. The Sihl meets with the Limmat at the end of Platzspitz, which borders the Swiss National Museum. The Limmat reaches the lowest point of the municipality in Oberengstringen at 392 m (1,286 ft) above sea level.\n\nOn its west side, the Limmat valley is flanked by the wooded heights of the Albis chain, which runs along the western border. The Uetliberg is, with 869 m (2,851 ft) above sea level, the highest elevation of the surrounding area. Its summit can be reached easily by the Uetlibergbahn. From the platform of the observation tower on the summit, an impressive panorama of the city, the lake, and the Alps can be seen.\nThe northeast side of the Limmat valley includes a range of hills, which marks the watershed between the Limmat and the Glatt. From the northwest to the southeast, the height of the mostly wooded knolls generally increases: the Gubrist (615 m or 2,018 ft), the H\u00f6nggerberg (541 m or 1,775 ft), the K\u00e4ferberg (571 m or 1,873 ft), the Z\u00fcrichberg (676 m or 2,218 ft), the Adlisberg (701 m or 2,300 ft) and the \u00d6schbrig (696 m or 2,283 ft). Between the K\u00e4ferberg and the Z\u00fcrichberg is located the saddle of the Milchbuck (about 470 m or 1,540 ft), an important passage from the Limmat valley to the Glatt valley.\nThe northernmost part of the municipality extends to the plain of the Glatt valley and to the saddle which makes the connection between the Glattal and Furttal. Also, a part of the Katzensee (nature reserve) and the B\u00fcsisee, both of which are drained by the Katzenbach to Glatt, belong to the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZ\u00fcrich has, depending on the definition used, an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but in the higher areas it is defined as a humid continental climate (Dfb, using 0 \u00b0C isoterm) with warm summers and four distinct seasons. Decisive for the climate of Z\u00fcrich are both the winds from westerly directions, which often result in precipitation and, on the other hand, the Bise (east or north-east wind), which is usually associated with high-pressure situations, but cooler weather phases with temperatures lower than the average. The Foehn wind, which plays an important role in the northern alpine valleys also has some impact on Z\u00fcrich.The annual mean temperature at the measuring station of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology in Z\u00fcrich-Fluntern (556 m[1,824 ft] above sea level on the slope of the Z\u00fcrichberg, 150 m[490 ft] above the level of the city centre) is 9.3 \u00b0C (48.7 \u00b0F). The lowest monthly mean of daily minimum temperature are measured in January with \u22122.0 \u00b0C (28.4 \u00b0F) and the highest monthly mean of daily maximum temperature are measured in July with 24.0 \u00b0C (75.2 \u00b0F). On average there are 74.9 days in which the minimum temperature is below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) (so-called frost days), and 23.7 days in which the maximum temperature is below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) (so-called ice days). There are on average of 30 so-called summer days (maximum temperature equal to or above 25 \u00b0C [77 \u00b0F]) throughout the year, while so-called heat days (with maximum temperature equal to or above 30 \u00b0C [86 \u00b0F]) are 5.8 days.The average high temperature in July is 24.0 \u00b0C (75.2 \u00b0F) and average low temperature is 14 \u00b0C (57.2 \u00b0F). The highest recorded temperature in Z\u00fcrich was 37.7 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F), recorded on July 1947, and typically the warmest day reaches an average of 32.2 \u00b0C (90.0 \u00b0F).Spring and autumn are generally cool to mild, but sometimes with large differences between warm and cold days even during the same year. The highest temperature of the month March in 2014 was on the 20th at 20.6 \u00b0C (69.1 \u00b0F) during a sunny afternoon and the lowest temperature was on the 25th at \u22120.4 \u00b0C (31.3 \u00b0F) during the night/early morning. Record low of average daily temperatures in March since 1864 is \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F) and record high of average daily temperatures in March is 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). Record low of average daily temperatures in October is \u221216 \u00b0C (3 \u00b0F) and record high of average daily temperatures in October is 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).Z\u00fcrich has an average of 1,544 hours of sunshine per year and shines on 38% of its potential time throughout the year. During the months April until September the sun shines between 150 and 215 hours per month. The 1,134 millimetres (44.6 in) rainfall spread on 133.9 days with precipitation throughout the year. Roughly about every third day you will encounter at least some precipitation, which is very much a Swiss average. During the warmer half of the year and especially during the three summer months, the strength of rainfall is higher than those measured in winter, but the days with precipitation stays about the same throughout the year (in average 9.9\u201312.7 days per month). October has the lowest number (9.9) of days with some precipitation. There is an average of 59.5 so-called bright days (number of days with sunshine duration greater than 80%) through the year, the most in July and August (7.4, 7.7 days), and the least in January and December (2.7, 1.8 days). The average number of days with sunshine duration less than 20%, so-called cloudy days, is 158.4 days, while the most cloudy days are in November (17.8 days), December (21.7 days), and January with 19 days.\n\n\n=== Climate protection ===\nThe city is among the world-leaders in protecting the climate by following a manifold approach. In November 2008 the people of Z\u00fcrich voted in a public referendum to write into law the quantifiable and fixed deadline of one tonne of CO2 per person per annum by 2050. This forces any decision of the executive to support this goal, even if the costs are higher in all dimensions. Some examples are the new disinfection section of the public city hospital in Triemli (Minergie-P quality \u2013 passive house), the continued optimisation and creation of public transportation, enlargement of the bicycle-only network, research and projects for renewable energy and enclosure of speed-ways.\n\n\n=== Urban area ===\nThe areas surrounding the Limmat are almost completely developed with residential, industrial, and commercial zones. The sunny and desirable residential areas in the hills overlooking Z\u00fcrich, Waidberg and Z\u00fcrichberg, and the bottom part of the slope on the western side of the valley on the Uetliberg, are also densely built.\nThe \"green lungs\" of the city include the vast forest areas of Adlisberg, Z\u00fcrichberg, K\u00e4ferberg, H\u00f6nggerberg and Uetliberg. Major parks are also located along the lakeshore (Z\u00fcrichhorn and Enge), while smaller parks dot the city. Larger contiguous agricultural lands are located near Affoltern and Seebach. Of the total area of the municipality of Z\u00fcrich (in 1996, without the lake), 45.4% is residential, industrial and commercial, 15.5% is transportation infrastructure, 26.5% is forest, 11%: is agriculture and 1.2% is water.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nPublic transport is extremely popular in Z\u00fcrich, and its inhabitants use public transport in large numbers. About 70% of the visitors to the city use the tram or bus, and about half of the journeys within the municipality take place on public transport. Within Z\u00fcrich and throughout the canton of Z\u00fcrich, the ZVV network of public transport has traffic density ratings among the highest worldwide. When adding frequency, which in Z\u00fcrich can be as often as seven minutes, it does become the densest across all dimensions. Three means of mass-transit exist: the S-Bahn (local trains), trams, and buses (both diesel and electric, also called trolley buses). In addition, the public transport network includes boats on the lake and river, funicular railways and even the Luftseilbahn Adliswil-Felsenegg (LAF), a cable car between Adliswil and Felsenegg. Tickets purchased for a trip are valid on all means of public transportation (train, tram, bus, boat). The Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (commonly abbreviated to ZSG) operates passenger vessels on the Limmat and the Lake Z\u00fcrich, connecting surrounding towns between Z\u00fcrich and Rapperswil.\n\nZ\u00fcrich is a mixed hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof (Z\u00fcrich HB) is the largest and busiest station in Switzerland and is an important railway hub in Europe. There are between 350,000 and 500,000 commuters daily making use of this central network node \u2013 a significant figure in comparison to Z\u00fcrich's population. With regard to the number of trains daily entering and leaving a single railway station, Z\u00fcrich HB is the world's most frequently served railway station, with nearly 3,000 trains every day. Among the 16 railway stations (and 10 additional train stops) within Z\u00fcrich's city borders, there are five other major passenger railway stations. Three of them belong to the ten most frequented railway stations in Switzerland: Stadelhofen, Oerlikon, Altstetten, Hardbr\u00fccke, and Enge. The railway network is mainly operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS), but Z\u00fcrich is also served by major EuroCity trains from the neighbouring countries and is a destination for both French/Swiss (TGV Lyria) and German (ICE) high-speed trains, as well as by Austrian RailJet.\n\n\n=== Zurich Airport ===\nZurich Airport is located less than 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) northeast of the city in Kloten. Zurich Airport has its own railway station, which is located underground. It is directly connected to Z\u00fcrich and most of the major Swiss cities. Zurich Airport is served by more than 60 passenger airlines from around the world. It is also served by one cargo airline and is a hub for Swiss International Air Lines. There is also an airfield in D\u00fcbendorf.\n\n\n=== Road traffic ===\nThe A1, A3 and A4 motorways pass close to Z\u00fcrich. The A1 heads west towards Bern and Geneva and eastwards towards St. Gallen; the A4 leads northwards to Schaffhausen and southwards to Altdorf connecting with the A2 towards Chiasso; and the A3 heads northwest towards Basel and southeast along Lake Z\u00fcrich and Lake Walen towards Sargans.\n\n\n=== Bicycle transport ===\nIn 2012, the city council launched a program to improve the city's attractiveness for bicycle traffic. The so-called \"Masterplan Velo\" is part of the superordinate framework Stadtverkehr 2025 which shapes the future of the different means of transport. Research revealed that infrastructure and the social environment are essential factors in improving a city's appeal to bicycle traffic. Three main goals are specified: First, the modal share of bicycle traffic should be enhanced to twice the value of 2011 by 2015. Second, cyclists' safety should be improved to lower the overall accident risk. Third, cycling should be established as an everyday means of transport with a special focus on children and young people.\nIn terms of infrastructure, the city aims to build up a network of distinctive bicycle routes in order to achieve these objectives. At a final stage, the network will consist of main routes (Hauptrouten) for everyday use and comfort routes (Komfortrouten), with the latter focussing on leisure cycling. Additional measures such as special Velostationen providing bike related services are expected to help to further improve the quality. One of the key projects of the system is a tunnel beneath the tracks of the main railway station planned to combine a main connection with staffed possibilities where commuters can leave their bikes throughout the day. Apart from infrastructural measures, further approaches are planned in the fields of communication, education and administration.\nHowever, these efforts cause critique, mainly due to postponing. The institution of the bike tunnel at the main railway station, originally planned for 2016, is currently (2016) delayed to at least 2019. Pro Velo, a nationwide interest group, has publicly questioned whether the masterplan already failed. The critique aims at badly governed traffic management at construction sites, missing possibilities to park bikes in the city as well as rather diffident ambitions. In response, the responsible city department points to the big investments made every year and mentions ongoing discussions that would finally lead to even better results.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nThere are 415,367 people living in Z\u00fcrich (as of 31 December 2018), making it Switzerland's largest city. Of registered inhabitants (in 2016), 32% (133,473) do not hold Swiss citizenship. Of these, German citizens make up the largest group with 8% (33,548), followed by Italians 3.5% (14,543). The population of the city including suburbs totals 1.19 million people. The entire metropolitan area (including the cities of Winterthur, Baden, Brugg, Schaffhausen, Frauenfeld, Uster/Wetzikon, Rapperswil-Jona and Zug) has a population of around 1.83 million people.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe official formal language used by: governmental institutions, print, news, schools/universities, courts, theatres and in any kind of written form is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, while the spoken language is Z\u00fcrich German (Z\u00fcrit\u00fc\u00fctsch), one of the several more or less distinguishable, but mutually intelligible Swiss German dialects of Switzerland with roots in the medieval Alemannic German dialect groups. However, because of Z\u00fcrich's national importance, and therefore its existing high fluctuation, one can hear all kinds of Swiss German dialects spoken by its inhabitants and commuters. As of the December 2010 census, 69.3% of the population speaks diglossic Swiss German/Swiss Standard German as their mother-tongue at home. Some 22.7% of inhabitants speak Standard German in their family environment (\"at home\"). Dramatically increasing, according to the last census in 2000, 8.8% now speak English. Italian follows behind at 7.1% of the population then French at 4.5%. Other languages spoken here include: Croatian and Serbian (4.1%), Spanish (3.9%), Portuguese (3.1%) and Albanian (2.3%). (Multiple choices were possible.) Thus 20% of the population speak two or more languages at home.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nBefore the Protestant Reformation reached Z\u00fcrich, it was de jure and de facto Roman Catholic.\nThe Protestant Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli made Z\u00fcrich both a theological centre and a stronghold of Protestantism in Switzerland. Another Swiss city with a comparable status was Geneva, the so-called Protestant Rome, where John Calvin and his Protestant Reformers operated. Z\u00fcrich attracted other influential Protestant Reformers like Heinrich Bullinger. Zwingli translated the Bible (Z\u00fcrich Bible) into the local variety of German and introduced the Reformation by winning support of the magistrates, the princess abbess Katharina von Zimmern and the largely peasant population of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich. The canton unanimously adopted the Reformed tradition as represented by Zwingli. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants tormented the Swiss Confederacy. Zwingli died for political and religious reasons by defending the Canton of Z\u00fcrich in the Battle of Kappel. Bullinger took over his role as the city's spiritual leader.\nIn 1970, about 53% of the population were Swiss Reformed, while almost 40% were Roman Catholic. Since then both large Swiss churches, the Roman Catholic Church and Swiss Reformed Church, have been constantly losing members, though for the Catholic Church the decrease started 20 years later in around 1990. Nevertheless, for the last twenty years both confessions have been reduced by 10% to the current figures (census 2010): 30% Roman Catholic and 26% Swiss Reformed (organized in Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich). In 1970, only 2% of Z\u00fcrich's inhabitants claimed to be not affiliated with any religious confession. In accordance with the loss by the large Swiss churches, the number of people declaring themselves as non-affiliated rose to 17% in the year 2000. In the last ten years, this figure rose to more than 25%. For the group of people, being between 24 and 44 years old, this is as high as one in every third person.5% of Z\u00fcrich's inhabitants are Muslims, a slight decrease of 1% compared to the year 2000. The Mahmood Mosque Z\u00fcrich, situated in Forchstrasse is the first mosque built in Switzerland.The population of Jewish ethnicity and religion has been more or less constant since 1970 at about 1%. The Synagoge Z\u00fcrich L\u00f6wenstrasse is the oldest and largest synagogue of Z\u00fcrich.Nearly one tenth of the city's population are members of non-state-recognized Christian denominations (for example the Eastern Orthodox Church).More than 2% of Z\u00fcrich's population account for non-monotheistic religions (such as Buddhism or Hinduism).\n\n\n=== Social ===\nThe level of unemployment in Z\u00fcrich was 3.2% in July 2012. In 2008, the average monthly income was about CHF 7000 before any deductions for social insurances and taxes. In 2010, there were 12,994 cases (on average per month) of direct or indirect welfare payments from the state.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nMost of Z\u00fcrich's sites are located within the area on either side of the Limmat, between the Main railway station and Lake Z\u00fcrich. The churches and houses of the old town are clustered here, as are the most expensive shops along the famous Bahnhofstrasse. The Lindenhof in the old town is the historical site of the Roman castle, and the later Carolingian Imperial Palace.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nGrossm\u00fcnster (Great Minster) According to legend, Charlemagne discovered the graves of the city's martyrs Felix and Regula and had built the first church as a monastery; start of current building around 1100; in the first half of the 16th century, the Great Minster was the starting point of the Swiss-German Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger; declared by Charlemagne imperial church; romanesque crypt, romanesque capitals in the church and cloister; choir windows by Augusto Giacometti (1932) and Sigmar Polke (2009), bronze doors by Otto M\u00fcnch (1935 and 1950).\nFraum\u00fcnster (Women's Minster) Church of a former abbey for aristocratical women from southern Germany which was founded in 853 by Louis the German for his daughter Hildegard; first church built before 874; the romanesque choir dates from 1250\u201370; the church enjoyed the patronage of kings and had the right of coinage from Z\u00fcrich to the 13th century; after the Reformation, church and convent passed into the possession of the city; the most important jewelry \u2013 in addition to the largest organ in the canton with its 5,793 pipes and 92 stops \u2013 are color windows: the window in the north transept of Augusto Giacometti (1945), the five-part cycle in the choir (1970) and the rosette in the southern transept (1978) are by Marc Chagall; also the church of Z\u00fcrich's largest choir with 100 and more singers.\nSt. Peter romanesque-gothic-baroque church built on remains of former churches from before the 9th century; with the largest church clock face in Europe built 1538; baptismal font of 1598, baroque stucco; individual stalls from the 15th century from city repealed monasteries with rich carvings and armrests; Kanzellettner (increased barrier between the nave and choir with built-pulpit) of 1705 pulpit sounding board about 1790; rich Akanthus embellishment with Bible verse above the pulpit; 1971 new crystal chandelier modeled according 1710 design; organ in 1974 with 53 stops; Bells: five from 1880, the largest, A minor, without clapper weighs about 6,000 kg (13,228 lb); fire guard in the tower to the Middle Ages to 1911.\nPredigerkirche is one of the four main churches of the old town, first built in 1231 AD as a Romanesque church of the then Dominican Predigerkloster nearby the Neumarkt. It was converted in the first half of the 14th century, and the choir rebuilt between 1308 and 1350. Due to its construction and for that time unusual high bell tower, it was regarded as most high Gothic edifice in Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nZ\u00fcrich Museum of Art \u2013 The Museum of Art, also known as Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich, is one of the significant art museums of Europe. It holds one of the largest collections in Classic Modern art in the world (Munch, Picasso, Braque, Giacometti, etc.).

          "This is a delightful museum to spend a couple of hours. It's only a 10-15 minute walk from the River Limmat, and can also be reached by the tram. The art collection spans from the Middle Ages to contemporary art, with an emphasis on Swiss art. The museum's collection includes",
          "This museum is located a little out of the centre, but it is well worth the visit. The main collection hosts Monet, Picasso, Munch and more plus many more. They also host regular exhibitions and evening events.",
          "Don\u2019t miss this art museum - so much to see from Switzerland and around the world. Friendly front desk staff.",
          "This museum has a good collection of Swiss artists, old masters, impressionists, contemporary art, etc. There are several works by artists you would expect like Picasso, Cezanne, Rodin, Miro, Monet, Chagall and Van Gogh. One room had two of the large works by Monet. We got",
          "This expansive museum will keep you entertained and busy for hours. The vast amount of exhibition space housed an impressive collection of art from renaissance to contemporary with art from lichtenstein, piccaso, bacon, warhol and other famous artists. Bags are required to be",
          "It's a great collection, idiosyncratic but delightful. What a pity that you can't really see it. The curators have chosen to glaze most of the oil paintings using a material -- glass or plexiglass -- which reflects the poorly placed lighting in the galleries back at the",
          "This fine museum was not part of our tour but I am glad we visited (aside from the unattractive building). There is an impressive collection of European artists (Impressionists, Picasso, Rodin etc) and also a huge collection of various paintings and sculptures by Swiss artist",
          "One of the best museums of art I've seen to date. I am a fan of art museums and always try to visit them wherever I travel. It is a very well organized museum where you will find a wonderful set of old masters and the classics of modern art. You will be able to admire the",
          "Zurich some amazing museum and this is one of them. Cool collection of great artwork raging from 1600.",
          "I went on a Saturday of a long weekend, and felt like I was the only one in the galleries. Every now and then I saw another person, but it was very peaceful. I sat and stared at Monet's Waterlilies alone for a good long time. I've never been so close to van Gogh painting either!",
          "I would recommend this place for art lovers. It has good amount of Impresionist collection. It\u2019s not far from the city. The volunteers are friendly. Avail of the Zurich day pass card to get a discount. Audio guides are free. Plan at least 2 hours.",
          "I love the Kunsthaus. It's not to compare with the Prado, Louvre or any other of the top league museums but it is more than worth a visit. A relatively small city like Zurich has a world class art museum. Giaccometti, Munch and the french impressionists are just a view",
          "This museum greets you with a mold production of Hell's Gate by Rodan. There are many of his works scattered throughout the museum. A room for the french impressionists, an Edvard Munch room as well. There are obvious displays through doors and across several rooms that grab the",
          "Very busy with long queue at entry. Decided to return another day at opening time to beat the crowd.",
          "We went here to see the the Edvard Munch paintings, apparently the largest collection outside Norway, but were very impressed by their overall collection of modern painters.",
          "i wasn\u2019t impress from the personal, the working people there ware very aggressive, so no good service! the main collection from paintings and sculptors is good and interesting, but the rest very poor. i\u2019m not going to visit it again!",
          "Enjoyed the museum and the history of the family who was inspired to open it ! It is arranged in a confusing way but we managed to see it all with the help of the docents who were able to tell us where we were and where to go. It is light and airy so the art is easy to view!",
          "Especially good for Munch and Hodler, and some of the early Swiss artists, but the hanging could be improved - the impressionists suffer.",
          "It's a beautiful building with spatious interiors and a great collection of precious artworks. Highly recommended",
          "We've spent approximately 2-3 hours in the Kunsthaus, which I would say is really the minimum to enjoy the paintings and sculptures, but we could not stay more since it closes quite early.",
          "I went to the museum on a Wednesday and found that it is free on Wednesdays. Even the use of the lockers was free (the needed 2 franc coin is returned when you open the locker). The art is displayed on several levels and in multiple rooms, some of which were of good size. The",
          "Very good collection of art from Old Masters to Modern Art. Nice souvenir shop with big selection of books, posters and other stuff for young and not so young. I didn't like the glass on some paintings, the reflection distorted the art and it was really upsetting. I highly",
          "Only two days in Z\u00fcrich - visiting Kunsthaus is a must! Location-wise, it\u2019s easy to access. Masterpieces like Van Gogh\u2019s Self-portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe and Mark Rothko\u2019s Untitled can be found. Definitely worth visiting!",
          "I'm not such a big museuem goer, and despite an abiding love of art history, I can usually last about an hour in a museum before I start getting restless. For some reason, though, after 3 hours here in was still going strong. I think it had something to do with the fact that",
          "A delight for art lovers. Contained priceless paintings from the likes of Van Gogh and Monet. We spent 2.5 hrs here and it was barely enough. It was free on the wednesday we visited. Go to reception and they will give you a free metal disc for free adm. Free to most areas 1",

          "The museum is huge with high ceilings. Spacious rooms provide a smooth proceed and well balanced acustic provide a silent enviroment. I had the opportunity the appreciate Panini 's venturas who is one of my favorite painter at the same time an architect. There were some nice",
          "This is pretty much the best museum in Zurich if you are into modern art paintings and sculptures. Maybe it is even the only one. The guided tours for the temporary exhibitions are extremely good and therefore worth the extra 6 chf. The guides always ask if the tour should be",
          "Kunsthaus Zurich is a very approachable museum with a very good collection from masters to contemporary art including a very good impressionist collection. There is also a large collection of Alberto Giacometti's work which was donated by the family.",
          "This Museum is larger than expected with a Collection containing famous painters, artists and scupltures. We spent a few hours here. You almost get lost due to the size of the place, well worth a visit when you're into art",
          "The Museum is located very central just at the end of the \u201eNiederd\u00f6rfli\u201c. On wednesdays the collections are free of charge for every one, witch is great. The collecton offers something for every taste, from the great masters over famous swiss artists to modern art, everyone will",
          "Definitely worth a visit for art lovers, particularly of 19th & 20th century art. Spaces and art are beautifully presented in buildings that flow nicely together and within easy walking distance of Limmat in old city. You can easily spend several hours there, including special",
          "The museum is much larger than it seems. We spent almost 4 hours there. very good peaces of Van Gogh, Giacometti, Monet, Munk , Kandinsky, Klee. We enjoyed our time there.",
          "A wonderfully diverse collection full of interesting pieces by truly significant artists - from old masters to post modern and beyond. Highlights include, some epic Monets, a few wonderful Kandinskys, a few Miros and Picassos, severs Van Goughs, Warhol, Rothko, not to mention",
          "Very diverse museum - in-depth collection. Lockers were available for storing coats, etc. Nice restaurant upstairs.",
          "We are frequently here, mainly for the special exhibitions. There are good connections with the tram system, and car parking near by. No distance to walk down to the old town after a visit.",
          "This museum has a fantastic art collection that is very much worth visiting. The layout is a bit peculiar and it doesn't seem as big as it is at first. Start by going upstairs and then work your way down. You'll find amazing pieces from the usual suspects (e.g., Monet, Van Gogh,",
          "The museum had a fascinating show on 19th century French academic art and the permanent collection was also intriguing, lots of Swiss and German early 20th century work I had not seen before. The older parts of the museum are striking but it has an oddly configured addition. The",
          "We only had a quick visit, but glad we saw it. A real perk was it's free entry on Wednesdays and it was open so late. Not a long walk to get to from Zurich BH but there was a tram that stopped right outside.",
          "I grew up in Central Switzerland and visited one or two special exhibts when I was younger. Even though I've visited many of the great art museums around the world, It's taken me decades to finally see the permanent exhibit at the Kunsthaus. It's superb. There's something for",
          "On a bitterly cold afternoon, we sought shelter from the sleet in this museum. It was our favorite museum during a two week trip that included museums in Salzburg, Prague, and Budapest. The collection is so varied and includes so many fine pieces of art from many periods. Do not",
          "The collections of this downtown art museum is excellent. This is currently my favorite art museum in Europe. There are excellent pieces by Giacometti, Picasso, Degas, some impressive Monet lilies, Van Goghs, Warhols, and excellent Swiss artists. The accrochements are creative",
          "Excellent design and offers a very extensive choice of expositions. I saw many school groups wandering with teachers. Worth the visit. Better for children under 14 in my opinion",
          "Nice museum, not very big, 2,5h of a visit, very nice collection of modern art, Kokoschka, Mondrian, Giacometti, Picasso etc.",
          "The Kunthaus is a short stroll from the old town and is a comforatble sized museum where one need not spend hours unlike museums in other major cities.it allows the visitor to get a good view of well curated and selected artworks.there is a restaurant before the main entrance.",

          "What i loved about this museum is that it was easy to navigate and big enough to not over whelm you. With a solid two hours you can see it all. The old masters the most famous painters and i especially loved the pop art and modern art selection. I would say it\u2019s a must see in",
          "We spent a very enjoyable morning here wandering through the extensive collection with no crowds - it was lovely. The displays are well done and there is lots of space to stand back and take your time. We were here in January, but I was still surprised how few people were",
          "We had not heard of this museum, hotel recommended that we visit, plus it was one of the only places open on New Year's in Zurich. The museum isn't large, but it has a lot of great art, carefully curated. Our family really enjoyed it. Would definitely recommend to anyone",
          "This was the first attraction we saw in Zurich. We took advantage of the late night/ free Wednesday option, as we had arrived from a long day of travel - and found the place to be very welcoming. They offer audio guides, a cafe and lockers downstairs, and then you\u2019re free to",
          "An amazing collection of art. very difficult to navigate and to this day still didnt work out how the schematic of the galleries work. Presented well and interest throughout. the audio tour could be better and focus on some well known pieces of art.",
          "First class collection, impressively presented. Rich oeuvre of works from old masters to 20th century names, from Reubens to Van Gogh to Rothko. A must-see in Zurich.",
          "we had a great afternoon with our grand children and they loved the place. They learned a lot about art and culture",

          "This Museum of Art had some wonderful rooms of impressionist paintings of the famous artists like Monet, Renoir, Cezanne etc and is a must as it is extremely well laid out - leave at least two to three hours - it is included in the Zurich card so remember to tell the desk when",
          "We stopped at the museum to do a little culture and I must say this museum is super modern with a lot of unique perspectives. First it has the history of Switzerland and it\u2019s people presented in a very cool way using projectors and many languages. Then u are able to learn about",
          "visited the museum on a wednesday which happened to be free admission. i heard it's 20 something francs when its not. is it worth that much to see the arts? im not too sure. they do have a lot of arts from famous artists and they are wonderful. do allot about 1-2 hours in the",
          "I'm not a museum guy, hadn't seen famous pictures for real but I can say, I have now! The setup of the museum is very modern, wide spaces, many different levels and an amazing collection of well known painters, and changing collections. A must see in Zurich when you want to see",
          "I'm not the most cultured person, but I definitely feel like I got my money's worth from visiting the Kunsthaus Zurich. They have a fairly diverse collection with a particularly deep offering of Impressionist and old masters. It's well worth a visit if you have an afternoon",
          "This museum is a must in Z\u00fcrich. There are works by Picasso, Dal\u00ed, Monet, Alberto Giacometti, Van Gogh, Rodin, Gaugin, Warhol, Modrian, and many more. Museo graphs is excellent, with ample spaces and nice ambiance. Consider two hours to visit this museum.",

          "We went to this museum in October 2017. The museum was having extension works, so the main entrance has moved to the restaurant side. We went there on Wednesday and have discovered that on every Wednesday the entrance is free of charge. On the ground floor there is only a book",
          "Unlike most European museums, this one is in a modern building that helps to display the art in a fine manner. Their Impressionist collection is quite good. It isn't a huge museum and I was finished in about 2 hours",

          "A very nicely arranged building with a wide variety of art. Loads of artwork from the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th century. A very good collection of impressionism. If you love art, you will love the Museum of Art.",
          "Swiss artists showcased in a grand building on a hill in Zurich. Most of the art is from Swiss artists, with a handful of European ones as well. The art spans generations and most of the art is modern or contemporary. I found the Alberto Giacometti sculptures to me my",
          "Must visit when you are in Zurich if you like to see art works. 1. Famous painters I noticed many works from the many famous painter I had learned in school. I enjoyed a lot. Personally I was so happy see Kandinsky's and Milo's work. I could not believe seeing all the famous",
          "Zurich is not the world cultural capital, but it is not far behind; and ... it is rich! So, often they can afford really top travelling collections and then you will see world class art in a smaller place, neat, well presented and without the masses typical of London, Paris or",
          "I spend a couple of hours in this great museum every time I come to Zurich. The atmosphere is very serene there. There are benches inside the halls, where you can take a seat and admire a masterpiece. You will find paintings by many art geniuses there- Chagall and Bruegel -",
          "Thanks to everyone here who let us know that we could get in at no charge one day (I believe it was Wednesday). It would have been a shame to pay admission when so much of the art could not be appreciated due to the glare. We were there about 2 pm in September. Although sun",
          "We did not have high expectations about this Swiss museum. After all, Switzerland is known for its majestic alps and its pristine lakes. We had been to many famous museums and Art Kunsthaus is not on the list of must see museums. After reading the reviews, we decided to give it",
          "It has quite a few Munch painting ( the most outside of Norway), a lot of Ferdinand Hodler's, and Klee's and Mondrian's. it has one Rubin. The three Monet paintings were the best.",
          "Lucky me I was there on Wednesday. It is a must to visit Kunsthaus. The museum isn't that grand, if compared to the NY's Met, however the size itself let me wandered around and admire each artwork without a haste. I explored the whole building of masterpieces from Swiss's",
          "Getting to the main collection is awkward due to current construction work. The Art Deco wing is a highlight. Unfortunately many of the masterpieces, in what use to be a delightful museum, are now suffocated under glass. This makes it difficult to view them without reflections.",
          "Nice visit to the Kunsthaus Zurich. Check the website first for entrance fees and what special exhibits cost. We were surprised that the SwF16 entry fee did not cover the Italian folk art exhibit....which cost an additional 23 SwF! The front desk person did not offer any",
          "Plan on spending the better aprt of a day to fully enjoy this wonderful collection. The collection includes art from all of the Old Masters. If you're making a day of it, there's also an onsite restaurant for lunch.",
          "There is so much to see here that it is almost overwhelming. The collection ranges from the 15th century to the 20th century and even a couple of 21st century pieces. In addition to a lovely collection of 17th century art, they have outstanding 20th century art from almost all",
          "The Kunsthaus would be worth a visit for the building alone, which has some ultramodern sections, some classical painting galleries, and some beautifully conceived Jugendstil architecture, and furnishings. The collection itself is quite stunning, with terrific Dutch masters,",

          "I'm a fan of contemporary art because it can be unpredictable, out of the ordinary, full of different colours and shapes and textures, and the works of art I found in this museum ticked all those boxes. It's a very enjoyable visual experience and while you could walk around the",
          "Spent longer than I thought here as so much to see from a wide and varied world of artists. Particularly liked the Monets but was equally impressed by artists lesser known to myself. Found the audio guide really useful in opening both my mind and eyes.",
          "The museum's collection boasts three of Monet's large scale lily paintings, as well as some iconic Van Goghs and, my personal favorite, \"Rotterdam La Meuse\" by Signac. There are also some interesting surrealist and cubist paintings.",
          "Museum is enjoyable, exhibits are well spaced out. There were works by some of the great impressionists like Van Gogh. Monet\"s huge water lillies are in a big hall where you can sit and contemplate. There is a good collection of sculptures by Giacomettii, One of the most",
          "We had one day in Zurich where it rained all day. . We decided to check out several museums, and the art museum was not a disappointment. It has a great balance of old masters, to contemporary artists, as well as representing Swiss artists. Worth the price, even on a sunny day",
          "We had a great morning there with the children. The audio kept them interested and I think we could have spent more than the three hours that we did. Lots to see; start on the top floor and work your way down!",
          "This museum has unique collections of art by many world class artists. We especially enjoyed the Chagall, Van Gogh, Matisse and Picasso collections. Also many interesting paintings by Munch. The museum also has a large collection of contemporary art, including an extensive",

          "What a treat and surprise. No crowds for a spectacular museum. We visited on a Saturday, believing it would be crowded. Was quite empty and allowed us to fully appreciate the collections. Able to just sit and take in the beauty. Collection was vast. Much larger than",
          "What a great Art museum - as my wife the artist said 'all the big guns are here !!' Very well spaced out in huge rooms and not at all crowded - you can spend your time getting to see some really fantastic paintings by many of the worlds greatest artists.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this Museum. It is easily reached by tram and the access price is reasonable. There are some splendid works of art to see. Our only criticisms are that, even with the visitor leaflet we found it hard to find our way around the Museum, and also, the",
          "I have been a couple times now and this is a very solid museum. If you are looking for a 'see it all' kind of place, this is it. There is old/new/modern art all under the same roof. They also have nice temporary exhibits that change things up occasionally. Definitely worth a",
          "Quiet, has many important works. We really enjoyed our visit as there were not so many people here as compared to galleries in London or Paris. Staff were very helpful and polite.",
          "Had a quick look as part of the free time on a work trip. There is a lot to see, so plan at least few hours for your visit. Top tip I found on TripAdvisor - on Wednesdays general exhibition is for free! So it works great for a mid week traveler. A nice range of works",
          "Of course not every exhibition is my taste, but they are always very professional and with all the informative tools. Also the pictures and sculptures which are there since a long time, are worth to see.",
          "Despite being under renovation, strolling these galleries is very pleasant with plenty of breathing space. We took advantage of the free Wednesday admission to the regular collection. After a couple of hours we spent our savings on a scrumptious chocolate fondue in the attached",
          "Visiting the museum we were limited in time therefore we have observed only old masters and impressionists' collection. IMHO this is wise to visit because of paintings of the most prominent and great masters of Dutch, Italian, French schools. And even one pairing of El Greco.",
          "I really enjoyed the collections this museum has. It was an unexpected treat as I didn't have museum plans. When I got there (by bike my hotel lent me) it wasn't at all crowded. There is audio equipment available at no charge and locker deposits of 2 francs is refunded. Great",
          "This is without a doubt the best switch when you see him and all of Switzerland. It has a very well selected range of works, however mostly are focused on 20th century and modern Art. The museum is well-managed, the stuff for very friendly, and they provide with three headsets",
          "Excellent collection of art dating from the Middle Ages to contemporary. Regular special exhibitions are sometimes overcrowded - even during day time. A good place to just pop in and inhale art for an hour and forget about all the rest.",

          "We have been many times to the Kunsthaus including for children Painting Atleier. Fantastic! Well worth the admission price. Highly recommend.",
          "The Kunsthaus is a great museum. Wonderful permanent collection and the art that is brought in is always remarkable. Be sure to see the Giacometti sculptures! I think I like it best because it is human sized. Not too big. Hopefully the new addition will add to the quality",

          "Even if you're not a big art lover, Kunsthaus is definitely a must visit - especially the collections of Picasso, Van Gogh and Monet!",
          "We did not expect to see such famous originals. The well designed museum is worth the 1.5 hours it takes to see everything. The voice guide they supply you with is fantastic - never enjoyed an art museum like this - original Klee, Salvador Dali, Kandinsky, Manet Monet, Rembrandt",
          "This might appear a little boring/uninspiring from the outside, but you'll find lots of Global and Swiss gems in the Galleries. Layouts complicated and don't make for easy traversing, but you'll be rewarded with Monet, Van Gogh, Munch, Klee and other Swiss master if you persist.",

          "We had an idle day and visited. What a great well laid out museum. It was clean and offered all exhibits in English as well. It is a self paced exhibit and we could have used more time as it was that good. A MUST see. We were 2 adults and a 24 yr old student and a 15 year old",
          "This museum was so much larger than we expected. We saw artwork from Picasso, Van Gough, Monet, and Manet. It was a perfect rainy day activity.",
          "Not a big museum. Not a small one either. It is easy to do in an hour or two. They have some beautiful Monets and Van Goghs. There is even a realistic sketch by Picasso...I know right? If you look around you will even find a couple wonder sculptures by Degas and Rodin.",
          "We recently visited the Kunsthaus to see an exhibit covering Ernst Kirschner's art. He was a German expressionist who painted in Germany and, in recent years, Davos Switzerland. Although he lived a tragic life, he produced a large body of fine paintings. These were brilliantly",

          "As expected the collection focused on Swiss artists but not to the exclusion of others. I by passed the old masters to see Chagal, Rauchenberg, Miro etc. Good representation of other artists though few of each as would be expected. It is a place to put on your list of sites",
          "Stopped by primarily to see the biggest Munch collection outside of Norway. Extremely surprised by a very well done special exhibit on Kirchner and some gems in their permanent collection -- especially by Chagall, Picasso & vanGogh. The one Rembrandt is also stunning.",
          "The special on Kirchner was amazing. Really well laid out and provided a good background. The main gallery was excellent, especially the modern art section. Some of the stone work in the older part of the building is exquisite.",

          "It has an eclectic range of art which for me although well lit seemed a little jumbled up. We did not take the audio guides and perhaps that would have helped to have seen things in a chronological order. I did not enjoy it as much as the many museums in Amsterdam.",
          "A room of Giacometti's! A seascape by Manet, the first we have seen. A Van Gogh room. A painting by Magritte wherein leaves turn into birds. Oh why did the gift shop not have a copy for sale? A big exhibit of the works of Kirschner, an artist we were not at all familiar",

          "Wide ranging collection from Medieval to Contemporary art: mostly paintings with a bit of sculpture. The collection isn't particularly deep in any one era, but the small size lets the visitor range pleasurably through the centuries. There are some very nice late 19th -early 20th",

          "The museum was a wonderful surprise for me . The rich collection makes it a must see . I get to know artists and paintings I have never heard of and found paintings I did not know exist. This made my visit pleasant and educational alike . It is beautiful and relax place.",
          "A great place to spend a few hours in Zurich with a rich and diverse collection of artists and art works. I visited in January which is obviously not a peak month and the gallery was certainly not too crowded. The 16 Euro entrance fee seemed reasonable for such a top class",
          "like most of the important museums in Switzerland and also in the world, they are the necessity to extend to show more of the collection but also important donators will give more works if they sure that what they have given will be exhibit. the zurich kunshaus has an important",

          "One of our grand- grandfathers had moved to Zurich and established in about 1870 (!!) the Swiss part of our family; some members of our family have lived in Germany, some in North America (new England States, and Florida) and some members of our family emigrated to South Africa,",
          "A wonderful ambience, the find for me was the Monet room, breathtaking. I also enjoyed the architectural theme that was running through the exits when we were there. Well worth the visit.",
          "A small museum by comparison to major ones, but with many of the same notable artists and with special exhibits. There is a small cafe for refreshment and lockers to store your coats etc. Pictures are allowed. A quick walk through took us 2 hours, then we spent another hour",
          "We spent our time in the more modern section and they had a great display of traditional modern art. Very good place and one that worked well for our whole family",

          "Be prepared to be delighted and spend much more time than you anticipated. The highlight for me every time to to see the masterpieces by Hodler. Walk through every period of european art and enjoy getting up close and personal.",
          "I went to the Kunsthaus on a Wednesday, when admission is free. I initially thought this might be a bad idea, as it would be filled to capacity. Although there were many people in the museum, it was never overcrowded. It was easy to walk through the galleries, sit on a bench",
          "A unique experience, a look into culture and art tradition of Zurich, includes many international artists, from Monet and Picasso to Pop art and Andy Warhol. The temporary exhibition of Giacometti's sculptures was one of a kind! Its free with the Zurich pass.",
          "The Kunsthaus has a lot to offer. There is a great variety of paintings and the audioguide will enable those who aren't experts to understand a selection of paintings. Little tip: if you want to be amazed read about some of the paintings before going there and enjoy a specific",

          "While I lived in Zurich, I was a member of the Kunsthaus. This allowed me to come and go whenever I wanted. And it was well worth it. For moments where I needed to ponder about things, I would go to one of the remote rooms of the museum, sit in one of the comfortable chairs and",
          "I loved the pieces in there as I'm a huge of of European and renaissance at but it's a small venue and really for the art enthusiasts. It's a located very central so there's also plenty to explore outside it as well. The museum is free on Wednesday so it's a great way to check",
          "I had the chance to visit this museum for free as part of a private talk given by an art historian who took us through this breathtaking collection in an entertaining and educational way. The span of works housed in this museum is amazing, so many great names - modern and old",
          "Though not much of Monet and Picasso , but the other master pieces were also worth to see. I loved the museum",
          "I thought the museum was above average but not at the top. I've been to better but it definitely was a good visit. Lots of famous pieces. Fairly well laid out. Not overly expensive. If it's cold and wet worth the trip.",
          "We only had one afternoon to spend in Zurich before flying out, and after a lovely but cold walk near the lake, we came across this museum in an attraction list. We found out on arriving that being a Wednesday, the entry was free, however, the beautiful building and wonderful",

          "They have a spectacular collection exhibited in a stunning building. A new, modern building is being constructed at the moment. Apart from masterpieces of European art, the museum has an excellent collection of Swiss painters. I was particularly impressed by Augusto Giacometti's",
          "15 CHF to see Picasso, Miro, Van Gogh, Dali, Delvaux, Monet ...(ok, I admit, I have a preference for he more modern masters), it's a bargain. The building itself has a very airy feeling about it, making walking around or sitting on a bench to admire a painting a real pleasure.",
          "It is a little difficult if you are looking at the map to navigate exactly where you are, but the museum is a good size where you can take a couple of hours and see the entire museum. Wide variety of pieces - from old Swiss artists to more modern, abstract pieces.",
          "Nice art, huge variety and gives you the feel of MoMa in NY. One can also buy prints of your favourite and the exhibitions with themes are always interesting.",
          "Having been to this museum 3 times over the last 15 years, its exhibitions are always first class. To see art by Swiss artists this is the definitive Swiss museum. Allow enough time as there is plenty to see. Wall text is very well produced and a wonderful education.",

          "We spent over two hours here. Even with the map it was difficult to understand where we were. I discovered the paintings by Augusto Giacometti. The collection covers many periods including contemporary. In 2020 the addition will be finished and we plan to return. There is",

          "As a member of the art society I would highly recommend a visit at Kunsthaus. If you are interested in old masters, there are really interesting flemish art works to find, also three Claude Lorrain. Also the modern part is exiting. And you cant't miss Hodler in the swiss corner",

          "This is only a rating for the brunch at Kunsthaus and not for the museum itself. I was not impressed with the brunch as it is expensive and the range is not that big. You get a glass of champagne and some buffet but the way it is presented and the selections were not what i expected",
          "This museum offers visitors the chance to view so many spectacular works of art by very well-known artists. Wednesdays are free! This place is definitely worth visiting. ",

      "name": "Lindenhof hill",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Lindenhof (lit.: courtyard of the lime) is a moraine hill and a public square in the historic center of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. It is the site of the Roman and Carolingian era Kaiserpfalz around which the city has historically grown. The hilltop area\u2014including its prehistoric, Roman, and medieval remains\u2014is listed as a Swiss heritage site of national significance.\n\n\n== Topography ==\nLindenhof (its northern part is called Sihlb\u00fchl) dominates the Lindenhof quarter in district 1 (Altstadt), the historical center of Z\u00fcrich's Altstadt. To the North, it ends at Uraniastrasse (City police station) and to the South, it ends near St. Peter church. In the West, the hill is limited by the Bahnhofstrasse, and in the east, it ends at the Limmat and the Schipfe quarter.\nLindenhof sits atop the remains of a glacier. The hill and its public square are part of the Linth Glacier's moraines in the area of Z\u00fcrich. The now largely flattened Lindenhof (428 m \u00fc. M) rises about 25 meters above the Limmat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\n \n\nAt the flat shore of Lake Zurich were Neolithic and Bronze Age (4500 to 850 BC) lakeside settlements, such as Kleiner Hafner and Grosser Hafner (both small former islands west of Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz, near Bausch\u00e4nzli at the Stadthausquai, Alpenquai at the B\u00fcrkliplatz square and Lindenhof). Lindenhof was largely surrounded by water: until the early medieval area, neighboring M\u00fcnsterhof (Fraum\u00fcnster abbey square) was a swampy hollow flooded by the Sihl. Therefore, Lindenhof was an optimal location for early fortified settlements. Middle bronze age (1500 BC) artefacts were found near the Limmat (Schipfe). Archaeologists found remains of a Celtic Oppidum from the 1st century BC (La T\u00e8ne culture), whose remains were found in archaeological campaigns in the years 1989, 1997, 2004 and 2007 on Lindenhof and Rennweg.\n\n\n=== Roman Vicus ===\n\nIn 15 BC, Augustus's stepsons Drusus and Tiberius integrated the territory on the left side of Lake Zurich into the Roman provinces Raetia and Germania Superior. Several stone buildings from the Roman period were located on and around the hill. It was part of the small vicus Turicum, located on both sides of the Limmat and connected by a Roman bridge located near the present Rathausbr\u00fccke. \nTuricum, Z\u00fcrich's Roman name and possibly also its Celtic name, is engraved on a 2nd-century tombstone of a little boy. It was found on May 15, 1747, and it refers to the Roman STA(tio) TUR(i)CEN(sis). The tombstone is located in the Swiss National Museum; a copy is integrated in the Lindenhof wall at Pfalzgasse, leading to St. Peter church.\nUsing the topography, the Roman military built a citadel on top of the hill in the years of the Roman emperor Valentinian I (364\u2013375), to defend migrations from the North by the Alamanni. It was 4500 square meters large, and it was fitted with 10 towers and two meter wide walls.\n\n\n=== Medieval castle and graveyard ===\nDuring the middle ages, the hilltop leveled fort became the retaining wall and gave the Lindenhof terrace a form similar to its current form. The remains of the Roman camp were used as the center of the later fortification of the historical center of Z\u00fcrich. Significant parts of the lime mortar and ancient castle wall were integrated into the town houses around the Lindenhof and in a Kaiserpfalz (broken in 1218), which served as a place of festivities, including the engagement of the German emperor Henry IV with Bertha von Turin on Christmas in 1055. The Roman castle's remains existed until the early medieval age: a Carolingian, later Ottonian Pfalz (1054) was built on its remains. This Kaiserpfalz was a long building with a chapel on the eastern side of the fortified hill; it is last mentioned in 1172, and it was derelict by 1218, when its remains were scavenged for construction of the city walls and stone masonry on private houses.\nIn 1937, archaeologists found graves of late medieval children and adults that were oriented from the east to the west. In the year 1384, a chapel on the Lindenhof was mentioned, but no remains have been found. It is believed that the chapel was part of the processional axis Wasserkirche, Grossm\u00fcnster and Fraum\u00fcnster church processions that ended in 1524 or 1525 (Reformation in Z\u00fcrich). These religious celebrations at Pentecost honored Z\u00fcrich's Saints Felix and Regula and Exuperantius.\n\n\n=== Modern public park ===\n\nFollowing the demolition of the former royal residence, the hill\u2014the only public park within the city walls\u2014became an area for public life and relaxation, with dense tree vegetation, stone tables, crossbow stands, and bowling and chess; the latter are still very popular in modern times. According to a chronicle, fifty-two tilias (lime trees) were planted in 1774. Bow and crossbow-shooting was probably one of the most important leisure activities on the Lindenhof. Each Z\u00fcrich guild had its own stone table, and the costumed guild members met on Sechsel\u00e4uten for dinner, described by Gottfried Keller in his poem Ein Festzug in Z\u00fcrich (a procession in Z\u00fcrich, 1856).In August 1526, guests from St. Gallen were invited by the city councils and all the Guilds of Z\u00fcrich for a dinner. The attendees of this dinner included Ulrich Zwingli, the prominent Z\u00fcrich cleric; Leo Jud; Konrad Pelikan; Friedrich Myconius; and the Kappel abbey's abbot. \nThe Hedwig Fountain (1688) was sculpted by Gustav Siber. It depicts the legend of the siege of Z\u00fcrich in 1292 with a helmeted sculpture of the leader of the Z\u00fcrich women. Under baroque influence, Lindenhof was converted in 1780 to a strictly geometrical park.\n1851, the Masonic lodge Modestia cum Libertate (M.c.L.) bought the Paradies building and converted it into a lodge building with distinctive gables. At this time, coins, stove tiles and other artefacts from the Roman and medieval times were found. 1865, severe storm damage resulted in a redesign: Instead of Lime trees, the park was dominated for some years by chestnut and acacia trees. The redesign was not accepted by the population, and in 1900, Lindenhof Square was given its present appearance.\nToday, there are numerous public events and festivals in addition to the historical guild dinner. The Square is also a tourist attraction. Cars are not allowed in the narrow streets to the Lindenhof.\nAmong the prominent historical visitors are Giacomo Casanova; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; Johannes von M\u00fcller; Herzog Charles Augustus, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach; Johann Gottlieb Fichte; Anne Louise Germaine de Sta\u00ebl; Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel; Johann Ludwig Uhland; Franz Liszt; Richard Wagner and Johannes Brahms.\n\n\n== Heritage site of national significance ==\nThe hillside area is listed as a Swiss heritage site of national significance, including the remains of its prehistoric Celtic, Gallo-Roman and medieval settlements and buildings.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nMauro Baster, Nicola Behrens et al.: Quartierspiegel Lindenhof.

          "This is such a relaxed place away from the maddening crowd. I is never too busy. There are places to sit down and have a picnic. If you want to get away from it all then pop in here, it is so close to the city centre and yet is so peaceful.",
          "We were here in September and the gardens were well worth a visit. There is a wonderful area for sitting and enjoying nature. There are chairs supplied and the locals were certainly enjoying the sun.",
          "I had read this was a top spot in Zurich to visit and was not let down. There are a number of hot houses with exotic plants to visit as well as walking trail through out the Garden.",
          "We were looking forward to a nice garden walk, but found an unkept garden area instead. I'm not sure why the area was in such disrepair, while the rest of the city is so beautiful. Save your steps for another venue.",
          "The botanical garden is a good option if you want to walk in the nature and enjoy the warm weather for a couple of hours without leaving the city. I really liked the tropical section and the piranha pools.",
          "Beautiful and lovely garden in the city, very refreshing. Excellent plant collection including tropical rain forest plants in three greenhouse dome. Other good thing, no entrance fee - all free. Highly recomended",
          "The gardens are right down from the apartment we were renting. Beautiful gardens with plants marked. There are 3 huge domes that house rainforest like plants. One also contains a small Aquarium. The day we went was a nice Sunday. We took a ball and played in an open area. There",
          "Perfect place for studying and for relaxation. The singing of the bird is marvelous . It has some rare plants and a giant tree from thailand",
          "Interesting to see just how many different plants grow in the very well laid out Botanical garden. Also includes three Bio-Domes (a bit like the Eden Centre in Cornwall albeit smaller in size). It would be interesting to see what it looks like in the other seasons on subsequent",

          "The botanic garden is situated near the trendy Seefeld area just a few minutes of the hustle and bustle of Seefeldstrasse. It offers a great variety of flora and fauna as well as several greenhouses each of which is showcasing a different geographical zone, from dry desert",
          "The gardens are a very peaceful way to spend 1-2 hrs. We went in march the sun was shining and it was a very pleasant relaxing couple of hours. Take some sandwiches and you can chill in the garden and take In the view. There are three domes to visit which are nice.",
          "Stopped here while riding a rental bike in Zurich, Switzerland. So glad that I did because it was absolutely beautiful. It was a great place to enjoy the view, the scenery as well as a place to simply \"stop\" and reflect. Quite peaceful.",
          "... here in the 'Garden of Eden' it never gets boring for me because there's so many different things to explore in the botanical garden, people come in and find out about themselves, great place, best early in the morning when they open the gate or the hour before they close",
          "Quite fantastic collection, amazingly maintained garden. I went in autumn, which is perhaps not the best time for most plants, however, I especially loved the tropical domes, and they didn't seem to be seasonal.",
          "I didn't have a whole lot of time here, and judging from some of the pictures, I missed at least one entire section of the garden. But it's a very nice place to go to get some quiet. There's a bit of a maze of trails going in different directions, and it was fun to explore and",
          "A very good place to have a moment to think about live. Have a nice view and can learn about plants and flowers.",
          "The botanical garden is part of the University of Zurich. It has seasonal plants and flowers in their prime at \"their\" time of the year. It is used for educational purposes, especially for elementary-age children. The garden is really peaceful, and spending time just sitting",
          "A pleasant place to walk around. Probably nothing really unique. The perennial beds are a bit of a mish-mash but that seems to be the \"new\" style. Has a cafeteria with a salad bar. Greenhouses are standard plant habitats (the same design company must be doing all the gardens). A",
          "Best on a sunny day, but even in the wet you can enjoy the bio-domes. Plenty of space to walk and sit and of course lots of plants and trees. For a leafy longer walk: Head up Weineggstrasse and Buchenweg to the Tram Museum and then follow the path down from just past the museum",
          "It's really worth to visit the garden, even in fall. It's huge with 3 greenhouses and beautiful plants.",
          "The Botanical Garden of Zurich is a hidden gem. So much to see spread out on beautiful grounds with its gorgeous architectural landscaping. Includes a caf\u00e9. A very interesting part of Zurich with a country side flair yet impressive villas from the late 19th/early 20th century.",
          "Great way to spend a few hours, especially on a budget at it is a free attraction. Perfect for taking the kids for a walk around the grounds where they can burn off some energy and maybe learn a thing or two. Unfortunately the information plaques are all in German but it there",
          "We took the tram and then walked quite a way to find this spot - it was marked on our tourist map and we love gardens of all sorts. It was a bit of a hike up through the entrance. The flower gardens were unkempt, perhaps the wild look was the goal, although we saw lots of",
          "We are both keen gardeners and nature lovers so decided to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the city to visit the Botanical Garden. It was easy to find and we walked there from our hotel on Seefeldstrasse. What a welcome surprise! We enjoyed the tropical houses but",
          "One can spend hours at this botanical garden, so much flora and fauna to see. Also it is very relaxing just to walk around",
          "Cross this botanical garden off your list of to-do's while in Zurich. It's out of the way and not worth the time. I love nature and flowers but somehow this garden missed its mark.",
          "A very beautiful garden, quite small but full of different scenic corners. don't miss the green houses, and especially the tropical one! It is open for free, and makes a lovely place to wonder about in nice weather. Highly recommended!",
          "Amazing place to visit for people who want to see different plants - the range of plants in the garden is good to keep you engrossed for couple of hours",
          "The gardens are free of charge and since we had one hour we dropped by and did not disappointed. The park is nice and welcome and the tropical houses we very interesting but there are no explabation in English which is very disappointing. The toilet had no soap to wash hands,",
          "Whilst the three domes hold the major attractions the balance of the gardens are badly overrun with weeds, something many of us can see at home ??",
          "We spent a couple hours visiting the tropical domes and walking around the gorgeous grounds (lot of hills, wear good shoes). Unfortunately, many of the information cards are not in English and are too technical for a basic German speaker. There is a small caf\u00e9.",
          "When you're bored with walking by the lake, this might be the next best thing. A pleasant way to kill an hour or two.",
          "I was there a few days ago and it is great to walk around at different stages of growth in the gardens. I go there every few weeks and it is great.",
          "The botanical garden is located in a nice residential area of Zurich. It has two main buildings/greenhouses, which are lush with orchids and tropical plants.",
          "Spring has finally sprung here in Zurich & whilst the blossom trees are a stunning sight in the streets of Zurich, these gardens (which have been extensively replanted in recent times & therefore not nearly developed enough to either identify much, nor indeed admire). However",
          "One of the nicer botanical gardens in the world I have visited. Not far from the centre of the bustling city of Zurich it is a quiet oasis with tropical houses and a very nice alpine garden. A good place to view plants but also a nice quiet place to sit and read a book.",
          "This botanical garden is a wonderfully peaceful and relaxing spot. The location is convenient as it is even possible to walk there from downtown. It offers a lovely place to spend a day. There is a portion that is lightly wooded and another that is pastoral with a sloping",
          "Super beautiful place. lots of large and small plants. plants from different types of climate, nice eatery and gift shop.",
          "The garden is beautiful even during the winter months. It is not as magnificent as it would be in spring since there are not too many colors apart from green and brown but isn't this part of the cycle of nature? It is still nice to admire the various plants, flowers and trees",
          "October is never the best time to visit a garden, but the selection of plants seemed haphazard and poorly laid out. Regardless, I appreciated the variety of winding paths through them. The treat is the hothouses, which you don't often get free access to.",
          "We like to visit botanic gardens as we live in Kew. We had been to the lovely collection of succulents at Sukkulenten-Sammlung on the west bank of the lake and thought it was superb. The botanic garden was a real disappointment. It is very small and has a nasty building in",
          "Pleasant and very well maintained, offers pleasant hours. I recommend to anyone who wants to be in leisure hours",
          "It is build as a park, having few additional buildings, dedicated to particular theme, such as rain forest It is very clean, well treated and worth the visit",
          "This place is bit hidden and not very easy to find. I seems a hidden gem that is mostly used by locals. It is beautiful and nice just to walk through the area and see and enjoy all those plants. It is not made a a \"pure'\" attraction and you cannot expect guided tours or a museum",
          "The Zurich Botanical Garden is a wonderful compact, but very comprehensive garden. There are many spots throughout the garden where you can just sit and enjoy a peaceful lunch among the trees. There are three glass domes with a large variety of plants from around the world.",
          "This could have been an attractive spot in Zurich. Unfortunately, we felt there is no interest to make it a tourist attraction site. The Entrance is free of charge. There were no sign to guide yo through your visit. There are some good plant but lake organization. We enjoyed",
          "The garden has several different areas with lots of different plants. We saw locals enjoying the sun bathing on grass, tadpoles swimming, it's a very relaxing and fun place. The tropical plants domes were very interesting too. Free to visit. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "This is a lovely gem in Zurich - beautiful and peaceful. Skip the restaurant - it is terrible but enjoy the park, bring a picnic if you can - sit on the grass and enjoy this precious place. Do visit the greenhouses. You can easily spend an afternoon or a full morning here,",
          "Remember, these comments are for tourists, not people from the city about which we write. For native citizens of Zurich, by all means go to the Botanical Garden--a great education for your children and a nice diversion for all. But for travelers, I must report that this garden",
          "There was a Triathlon taking place and unfortunately much of the area was blocked off due to the race. What we did see was pretty...but we missed a great portion of it.",
          "With reluctance, we entered the botanical garden. But, upon getting inside... we were astonished to see the floral treat. From tiny to large, plain to colourful... just amazing variety of flowers. There is a nice restaurant also inside. Don't miss it!",
          "Indoor greenhouse with plants and arid plants section, outdoor ponds with lotus flowers, labeled plants for you to learn from This place is big and beautiful, you could spend an entire day here. Highly recommended.",
          "Good collection of tropical plants, but very few from other areas. There is still lots of places to expand and introduce more species.",
          "Pleasure to visit such beautiful place like this one.When in Zurich a must. Great for family and kids.Great break if you are in Zurich for business or couples.Good transportation(trams and buses)Highly recommended.",
          "Easy to get to by public transport - bus as well as various trams. A really very wonderful botanical garden; large, well-labelled, beautifully landscaped. There are three interconnected glasshouses for tropical plants. It's all a hilly place, and the splashes of color on the",
          "We went here and were not disappointed. The place is peaceful with lots of greenery and fresh are. There are many flowering plants and well as other medicinal plants, bushes, shrubs, and trees. There is a small pond and three biomes. There are many upslopes and down slopes to",
          "The Botanical Garden of Z\u00fcrich University is a free attraction. It is situated about 20-min walk away from the old town. The collection is planted on a hill with nice views to the lake and the city. Very nice tropical greenhouses of a shape of cupolas. This is a place to relax",
          "My Wife went with a friend. My Wife is a plants person and could have spent all day, but her friend was not. So my Wife will have to go back to take it all in!",
          "This is a nice place to spend time with your family and kids. The garden is well maintained with a variety of plants. The garden is quiet and well maintained.",
          "Very pleasant wandering around this fairly extensive bot garden which has a range of plant habitats. It's a great place to relax with a picnic or visit the very nice tea room. It has a lake with 3 biomes....like the Eden Centre only on smaller scale.",
          "The botanical garden is a short tram ride from the city center. The outdoor gardens are very peaceful and a great place to visit on a sunny day. The biospheres of tropical and arid areas are very well done. Great displays of herbs and medicinal plants.",
          "This is a lovely place for a walk or picnic in the sunshine. It's not very sheltered so it's better on a dry day. There are three domed green houses to hide from the rain but they don't take long to walk round. Overall, it's an excellent place considering it's free.",
          "The Zurich Botanical Garden would undoubtedly be splendid in summer but in March it is still sleeping - except in the glass domes that house the exotic collections. These were amazing. Extremely well arranged and tended, and free! That compares favourably with, say, Kew",
          "The gardens are 5 minutes walk from my office. In spring or summer when the weather is good I often go to eat my lunch there in the peace and quiet.",
          "While the outdoor garden is quite average (more of a park), don't miss the tropical domes which contain a wide variety of interesting flora. Despite free admission, it is being very well taken care of - well worth a visit.",
          "We visited the Old Botanical Garden, which is in downtown. Worth a visit if you have time to spend in a quiet place, surrounded by 300-year trees. We missed the Botanical Garden, which is larger and off-town.",
          "This is really a silent oasis in Z\u00fcrich. Nice place to walk with the family or just lie on the grass and read a book.",
          "Many types of plants, great place for family, or even solo visit. Spend time on sunny day, do not forget to bring your books if you would like to spend hours here. It would be great to put the pictures of the plant on their guide paper.",
          "My wife is a plant person so this trip had to be on our agenda. I thought it was a little challenging to figure out how get there so here is what I learned: take #11 streetcar from B\u00fcrkliplatz to Hegibachplatz. After you exit, look for the sign for the Garden (in Deutsch), then",
          "Really enjoyed this visit. Because they are part of the University they are more \"working gardens\", than tourist gardens, but very well kept with everything labelled.",
          "This is a nice botanical garden and a good place to get away from the many people in the city. Worth a visit since it is free.",
          "As far as botanical gardens go this is different ......... In a good way. Easy to get to, although the day we went there were diversions because of track work. Gardens seem to be unkempt but there are labels on everything so it isn't though they are weeds. Downside is that",
          "The Botanical Gardens (actually the new location - the old gardens being in the old city) were easily reached by tram and bus. The people in the Visitors Center in the main train station (Hauptbahnhof) were most helpful in planning the trip for us. The gardens are a pleasant",
          "The three new domed glass houses are great and feature plants from three different climate zones. It's refreshing to see such a well maintained park with educational walks open for free to everyone. Also usually not many people come here, so it's mostly quiet and serene. Only",
          "This place has samples of European and world vegetation and is a nice break of all the shopping you can have in Zurich. Worth the visit in a sunny day.",
          "While no heavyweight in terms of botanical gardens, the plants here are interesting and the entry via the stairs past the wildflower beds is beautiful. Amusing seeing plants we regard as ordinary in Brisbane, Australia, being treated with such care in this climate!",
          "The Biological gardens were worth half a day or more. Plants well signed in various climatic zones. Some stunning flowers from all over the world. Particularly enjoyed the domed atmospheres eg steamy rainforest, desert area .Tranquil grassed areas to sit and enjoy the peace,",
          "well laid out and easy walking. It was a good day though crisp, I can imagine that in good sunlight it is magnificent.",
          "Awesome location to relax and gaze at all kinds of plants, if you where in zurich and missed this place, go back immediatly. In almost every major city you'll find such jewels, this is definitely one of them",
          "whilst looking for something cheap to do in the city we decided to head to the botanical gardens which is actually free to get into. Its not a big area but the plants they have are beautiful and its very well maintained. The domes are basically big hot houses with some great",
          "This is basically a park however, there are three large recently renovated domed greenhouses that are worth a visit. There is a small exhibition when you enter the greenhouses with some information (all in German).",
          "The botanical gardens are a great place to escape the stress of the city. We spent the last day of the year here in lovely sunshine. Obviously, there is not that much to see plantwise in the middle of winter, but the three (newly renovated) big greenhouses all made up for that.",
          "Its worth visiting. The garden is really health and organized. Lots of different climate types and an incredible green diversity. Really nice fruit tree collection from over the world.",
          "You look for a quiet place to escape the rush of the city by yourself or with your significant other? This is the place. Beware to keep your watch close by as time will fly on this serenity Island.",
          "The gardens are accessed on public transit with Tram #2 or #4 to Hoschgasse and then approximately a 10 minute walk up the hill. The main gardens open at 07.00 and the greenhouses opens from 09.30 until 17.00. The three main greenhouses were renovated and opened to the public",
          "We visited mid July 2013 and maybe it was the heat but I have to say I felt like it wasn't worth the trip. From the tram stop you walk about 2 or 3 blocks down a hill then up a hill to get to the green houses. The green houses were quite small, very warm, and there wasn't much",
          "The botanical garden is such a beautiful place to spend some time. I'm so happy that it is open again after the restoration of the three futuristic looking buildings.",
          "A lovely excursion through a well kept and tended garden, an oasis of total sublimity in a city that is already well laid back",
          "I have been to various botanical gardens and this was the least impressive, there wasn't anything really bad with it, just there wasn't a lot there, and for all the beauty of Z\u00fcrich this isn't a place I will bring friends and family when they visit",
          "Beautiful variety of plants, small pond, quite neighbourhood and newly commissioned tropical house complex. Very accessible from the city center but may not be access friendly to disabled people due to landscape. Free entrance and restaurant available (did not get to use it).",

          "This Botanical Garden is not that big as a usual Botanical Garden. If you have some spare time and you like to be on your own or with your children it's a really try. Quite a couple of bench where you can sit, or lay and read a book or just look the children running around and",
          "I'm a big plant and garden lover and always visit botanic gardens wherever I go, but this one didn't appeal to me. It's not very big (for a botanic garden) and there's not much to see in Winter (March), contrary to what they claim. Moreover, the glasshouses (domes) are closed",
          "Nice outdoor gardens & indoor gardens. Huge space for little kids to run around. If the weather nice, it is a lovely place for a picnic. Picnic tables are available in the outside gardens.",

          "i visited the old botanical garden behind the stockmarket. As this was close to my office I used it to escape the rush and stress of work and to stretch out in the sun. It is a lovely park with lots of benches to relax on, birds to watch and simply to soak up the atmosphere.",

          "There are lots of plants to look at with signs, although not all of them are in English, however the Uni has gone to a lot of trouble to sign each and every plant. I was expecting something a bit livelier than what we saw but it was still acceptable. The view on a clear day from",
          "Coming from winter, it was lovely to walk along the lake to the green of the botanic gardens. The gardens were interesting, and incorporated the lake to good effect. Flowers etc, lovely to see.",
          "If you like to see weeds this place is for you. There are some flowers to see, however the greenhouses are closed for 2012 (construction). Can not complain about price tho - free. Allot 30 minutes and you will have seen everything that there is to see.",
          "I was there at the \"open day\" to find myself in a large garden, no real information and no real appeal. The garden is apparently build to give biologists a nice time, but for people that like nature and the outdoors, you better go in the forest",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Fraum\u00fcnster (German pronunciation: [f\u0281a\u028a\u032f\u02c8m\u028fnst\u0250]; lit. in English: Women's Minster, but often wrongly translated to [Our] Lady Minster) is a church in Z\u00fcrich which was built on the remains of a former abbey for aristocratic women which was founded in 853 by Louis the German for his daughter Hildegard. He endowed the Benedictine convent with the lands of Z\u00fcrich, Uri, and the Albis forest, and granted the convent immunity, placing it under his direct authority. Today, it belongs to the Evangelical Reformed Church of the canton of Z\u00fcrich and is one of the four main churches of Z\u00fcrich, the others being the Grossm\u00fcnster, Prediger and St. Peter's churches.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1045, King Henry III granted the convent the right to hold markets, collect tolls, and mint coins, and thus effectively made the abbess the ruler of the city.\nEmperor Frederick II granted the abbey Reichsunmittelbarkeit in 1218, thus making it territorially independent of all authority save that of the Emperor himself, and increasing the political power of the abbess. The abbess assigned the mayor, and she frequently delegated the minting of coins to citizens of the city. A famous abbess during this time of great power was Elisabeth of Wetzikon.\nHowever, the political power of the convent slowly waned in the fourteenth century, beginning with the establishment of the Zunftordnung (guild laws) in 1336 by Rudolf Brun, who also became the first independent mayor, i.e. not assigned by the abbess.\nThe abbey was dissolved on 30 November 1524 in the course of the reformation of Huldrych Zwingli, supported by the last abbess, Katharina von Zimmern.\nThe monastery buildings were destroyed in 1898 to make room for the new Stadthaus. The church building today serves as the parish church for one of the city's 34 reformed parishes. M\u00fcnsterhof, historically the main square and marketplace of the medieval city, is named for the abbey. Gesellschaft zu Fraum\u00fcnster cultivates the traditions of the former nunnery convent.\n\n\n== Chagall windows ==\nThe choir of the abbey includes 5 large stained glass windows designed by artist Marc Chagall and installed in 1970. Each of the 5 has a dominant color and depicts a Biblical story. From left (northern wall) to right, the 5 works are:\n\nProphets, depicting Elijah's ascent to heaven\nJacob, displaying his combat, and dreams of heaven\nChrist, illustrating various scenes of Christ's life\nZion, showing an angel trumpeting the end of the world\nLaw, with Moses looking down upon the suffering of his peopleEqually impressive is the 9m tall stained glass of the North transept, created by Augusto Giacometti in 1940.\n\n\n== Fraum\u00fcnster's Crypt museum ==\nSince the last renovation in 1900, the crypt under the choir of the Fraum\u00fcnster abbey was sealed, and has made public since 19 June 2016. The oldest part of the church preserved the abbey's Holy Relics until the Reformation in Z\u00fcrich banned the Roman Catholic adoration of saints. The foundations of the crypt date back to the 9th century when the abbey was founded. The crypt also comprises an exhibition on the history of the Reformation in Z\u00fcrich, on the architecture and local history, assisted by a multimedia information system that illustrates the foundation fragments of the crypt, and how the church was rebuilt from the original Romanesque construction phase to its present Gothic appearance, on occasion of its establishment guided by D\u00f6lf Wild, the archaeologist in charge.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nFor the around 500,000 visitors every year a new developed visitor management started in June 2016. Visitors groups up to 60 persons are admitted from June 20 only by appointment and only in defined time windows. Guided tours are allowed only in a \"whisper\" modus, and by accredited tour guides, from 10 am to 4 pm in winter, and to 5 pm and 6 pm in spring respectively summer.\n\n\n== The Organ ==\n\nWith 6.959 pipes, the organ at Fraum\u00fcnster is the largest in the canton of Zurich.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Abbesses ==\nHildegard (828-856 or 859), first abbess of Fraum\u00fcnster Abbey\nKatharina von Zimmern (1478-1547), last abbess of the Abbey\n\n\n== Cultural heritage of national importance ==\nIn the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance the Fraum\u00fcnster is listed as a Class A object of national importance.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nPeter Vogelsanger: Z\u00fcrich und sein Fraum\u00fcnster.

          "My Honey Bee & me were in Switzerland for Art Basel and took a train over to Zurich. It was well worth it; we encountered the Fraumunster by accident and discovered that Marc Chagall had created their stained glass windows. BOOM! It was some kind of wonderful. A delight that",
          "I had hoped to see the stained glass by Chagall. Missed it due to the time it was open (12n). Fortunately, I was able to go back a week later and head inside. I was a bit surprised to find out that there was a CHF 5 charge to get into a church. The audio tour takes about 1.5",
          "The relatively austere exterior of Fraumunster Church contrasts beautifully with the extraordinary windows created by Chagall in the 1970\u2019s. Marc Chagall, who died in 1985, aged 98 years old, created these five unique works of art very late in life, yet they are wonderfully",
          "Fraumunster is the only one church in Zurich that I need to pay admission fee for entering. However I'd say it is worth the money. The church itself, the 5 large stained glass windows designed by artist Marc Chagall, and the wall paintings are all amazing to me. It's a must see",
          "Everything great about the Grossmunster and its history is true, but this was our favorite church. The Fraumunster's architecture, history, windows and legend make it a great attraction and Zurich must see. First the building and steeple are simply amazing, sleek and delicate",
          "The amazing stain glass, which were created by Chagall, make you want to sit quietly in the peace of this church. It was great to get out of the heat and tourist traffic and relax here.",
          "The provided audio system was comprehensive and we spent longer here listening to the history of the building. Easy to access by public transport or walking across the bridge from the old town. Take the time to wander around this old area as well.",
          "When you read the tour guide for this church you read about the stain glass windows by Chagall. These are on prominent display in this church and quite beautiful. The church has a crypt much like the other European crypts to see. There is an entry fee of 5 CHF. Worth a trip but",
          "Best deal in Zurich! Take the audioguide tour for only 5 Francs and see the amazing Chagall windows in the church. The history of the church is very interesting too on the audioguide but the windows were one of the highlights of our whole trip. What a gem! Truly spectacular. Go",
          "This church has some amazing features - not least of which is the stained glass windows by March Chagall. It is well worth the CHF5 entrance fee.",
          "on the frontside of this church, there are some beautiful windows painted by Marc Chagall. unfortunately, access now is not free of charge anymore, but it is still worth to go in.",
          "Beautiful church with traditional clock tower. It's by the river side and nearby Lake Z\u00fcrich. It has a CHT 5 cost to enter.",
          "The Chagall windows are lovely, especially on a sunny day. You do need to come into the church to see them as the colors do not show up when viewing from the street. Photography is not allowed, but there are pictures of 5 of the 6 windows (not the rose window) in the \"short",
          "Having studied in Zurich previously, I have seen Fraumuenster on several occasions, back then when it could be entered for free, photos could be taken (before people started to complain about too many tourists). Typically the church is open from 10-17, on Sundays due to morning",
          "The Fraumunster, one of a number of magnificent church edifices lining the river across from Zurich\u2019s old town, happens to also feature some of Chagall\u2019s better known stained glass windows. Note that admission here is 5CHF and includes an audio set.",
          "For an entry fee of 5 CHF I thought there would be something unique inside. The audio guide helped in knowing the history. But I didn\u2019t find anything exceptional. The outside premises of the Church is much better than the inside so the rating.",
          "The Fraumunster dates from 853, first a convent and then, in 1524, it became a Reformed Protestant church. It houses the 3rd largest church organ in Switzerland with 7000 pipes and 95 stops. You will also find transept windows by the Swiss artist Augusto Giacometti - beautifully",
          "You don\u2019t see a lot of churches charging an entry fee, but this one does. It is not very interesting compared to the many other churches in Europe. I\u2019d skip it. It was just okay.",
          "This is a modern architectural design church. The building is beautiful. The stained glass pretty.A good church to visit.",
          "People told us we should visit the Fraumunster to see the windows by Marc Chagall. Those windows are beautiful, but there is so much more than that to see here. There is a 5CHF entrance fee, which is well worth paying. We recommend the audio guide instead of the written guide",
          "It is an 11th century church. It used to be an abbey and you can see the aristocracy oozing... It is one of the prominent landmarks in and of Zurich. It is mostly known for it's glass windows. Very serene once inside.A must visit.",
          "Has a really distinctive green roof that stands out amongst the grey of Zurich. It is a nice clean church that you will more than likely not find exceptional compared to other churches. It is just more clean which is really Zurich. Oh, and remember cash as the church does not",
          "The paintings on the walls tell a story. Interpretation is up to the individual like any art work. These paintings make you stop and reflect.",
          "It is 5 CHF to go inside the church. they offer both a brochure and guided audio tour. The church is stunning and full of history. If you are familiar with the history of Protestantism at all, this is a must-see. The museum in the crypt below is well worth the price of",
          "Unless you really love churches you can get a good view from the outside without paying. Eithier way you should visit.",
          "Wonderful church, filled with History and art. Very nice audioguide that I recommend to catch the details. And amazing Chagall and Giacometti vitral works. Not to miss!",
          "It is very deceiving to pay an entrance to this church. Although it is a beautiful church, it is definitely not worth the money one have to pay to visit it. Inside you have nothing more than what a normal church has.",
          "Spectacular Church outside and inside. Absolute beauty of architecture. Very modern renovation and preservation which make it fascinating to explore. It\u2019s a Holly Place but they have \u20ac5 entrance fee which is more like donating and serves also as crowds control too . It\u2019s must",
          "The entrance to the church is paid, so we decided to skip. Nowadays it is not possible to make everything be paid...",
          "This church can't be missed while you wondering the street and alleys of old town Zurich The name though is confused between Lady and Ladies Now, the rest of the story.. Women's Minster, but often wrongly translated to [Our] Lady Minster) in Z\u00fcrich over time. The name",
          "Worth the five Swiss francs to get in to see the stains glass designed by Marc Chagall. Really nice church that was once part of a convent.",
          "The church is actually very old and has a lot of history attached to it, but it was so often transformed and restored that hardly a stone remains from the Middle Age. The cloister was demolished and then rebuilt in the the 20th Century (still worth seeing). The Abbot's room is",
          "My wife, son, daughter and I visited Fraumunster in Zurich in November 2018. The courtyards, small gardens and fountains were beautiful. Fraumunster is a \"must-see\" as you walk around the historical center of Zurich. I recommend getting a map of Zurich which will show you the",
          "The magic of the church is in its surroundings and inside. An awesome home of God this church is truly divine",
          "Went here with my father, came here 10 min before closing, and they let us in for free. The windows by Mark Chagall and Alberto Giacometti were amazing, and church overall was amazing. Would return 100 percent.",
          "Fraumunster is a Zurich landmark situated right along the Limmat. The church itself is beautiful but the stained glass windows by Marc Chagall are the real draw.",
          "This pretty little church is lovely. Of course it helps to have windows behind the altar by Marc Chagall. We didn\u2019t go for services, just to look around. Underneath the altar is an old section that shows original excavation and other historic bits about the place. A nice visit.",
          "This is definitely a major part of the landscape of Limmat. The green copper roof, and the design gives this place plenty of charm!",
          "Most people visit here to see the Chagall windows, there is a charge to enter and photos are not allowed though you can buy merchandise. A pleasant enough Church you can find contemplation in.",
          "This is a really attractive church with a beautiful blue Spire. There was a service on so inside you get the true atmosphere. Beside the river and a small square",
          "The beauty of this church, previously an abbey for aristocratic women, is truly seen from its interior through the beautifully stain-glassed windows painted predominantly by Mark Chagall. It is quite hard to believe that this abstract artist was 70 years old when commissioned to",
          "A must see if you like Chagall - stunning, plus the church itself is nicely laid out and has interesting history for fans of church crawling.",
          "When you know what precisely happened to this place and the other part at the other site of river,you can enjoy more.Recommend it to tourists.",
          "Went to see the beautiful stained glass windows designed by Marc Chagall. They did now disappoint. Awe inspiring artistry was only added to by additional windows designed by Giacometti and the opportunity to walk through the crypt area with more history from the Reformation.",
          "We took the audio tour, and learned about the very interesting history, the role of Hildergarde and the women in the early days of the church, and the strikingly beautiful Chagall windows. This is not to be missed.",
          "The church is fabulous and the Chagall windows magnificent. Be sure to bring Swiss francs as only cash is accepted. The included audio guide was detailed and informative. Plan to spend about one hour.",
          "This old church, with its beautiful stained windows, by Chagall, have an amazing clock tower, and beautiful needle-shaped roofs... Part of the history of Z\u00fcrich",
          "I didn't plan go there, but chanced upon the place, by visiting only the courtyard. The beautifully painted murals were a pleasant surprise. You have to see to appreciate the special beauty of the place.",
          "This is the one to see windows. This church has been very well done for visitors. Be careful it is not always open as it is still a church. I got there too early and had to go back to see it. Only CHF 5 to get in and photos are allowed. A nice souvenir shop at the end.",
          "This church has amazing stain glass windows. Each depicting a part of the bible. The colors are amazing.",
          "One of my favourite spots in Zurich. The church is so pretty from the outside and the Chagall windows were very nice to see. The admission price was quite good, so definitely worth it.",
          "Catch the early morning light and circle these windows, the changing light highlights the colors of the glass. we felt privledged to have these windows almost to ourselves.",
          "A very well maintained church with some excellent features. The Chagall windows are breath taking and there is a very good Giacometti window as well. A good historical section in the crypt, and the outside areas, including the wall paintings are well worth visiting. One of my",
          "Each time I go, the windows strike me more deeply. The intense colors, the Bible stories, the simple old church- it becomes a place of meditation and reflection. 5 francs/ fee. Right across the bridge from the Grossmuenster Church. Easy to see in an hour or 2.",
          "Good audio guide and pleasant place to spend an hour. The history is interesting and the Building well managed. I do not think they take credit cards, so bring local currency of \u20ac5 each. The Chagall windows are worth the visit alone.",
          "The church itself is pretty ordinary compared to others Central Europe from the same era. The reason for visiting is the beautiful artwork by Marc Chagall. The four tall glass paintings are amazingly beautiful and compelling. \ud83d\udc4c",
          "There is a small entrance fee to this lovely old chapel. The highlight is the stained glass windows by Chagall. One needs less than an hour to visit.",
          "We visited this beautiful church and enjoyed an amazing organ concert in the early afternoon for about a half hour. Not only was the concert amazing, but you get in for free. Normally there is a fee to get in and see the inside of the church. Check out the calendar before you",
          "My wife and I while touring Zurich visitors the church and were enlightened about the history of the church and the transformation it had underwent over the period of time.",
          "The Chagall windows are beautiful. If you are caught taking pictures of them, expect to be berated. The idea is to sell the pictures they have. The church is rather plain, but the windows are great.",
          "I went for the Chagall windows and was not disappointed. The 5 entrance fee includes a good audio guide which really brings the building and the 5 windows to life.",
          "It\u2019s nice, it\u2019s pretty, but after you take a photo you will be content and satisfied. I definitely wouldn\u2019t plan on spending more than 20 minutes here. That would even be pushing it....",
          "A quiet place for reflection and silence in the midst of busy city. The windows by Marc Chagall are stunning and definitely worth spending time looking at. Highly recommend on any trip to Zurich.",
          "The amazing stained glass windows created by Chagall are worth the admission price. The free audio guide that is available makes the tour take a little less than an hour but brings out much rich history and detail that further enhance the visit. The explanation of the symbology",
          "Right across the river from the more publicized Grossmuester Church. The stained glass is impressive and remarkable and there are postcards, bookmarks, posters etc. of the stained glass.",
          "Just on the bank of Limmat, this nice old church is really charming. Pity that you are not allowed to take photos inside.",
          "They now charge 5 each and there is no restroom. I think when they charge to see the church, they should provide a restroom! The small museum in the basement was interesting.",
          "Chagall's windows at this church are stunning and definitely worth the 20-30 minutes of your time. The church itself is plain but the stained glass here is lovely.",
          "I guess this place may be worth it to have to PAY 5 francs to get inside... and then they ban you from taking pictures on the inside??? Sorry...I took a few shots of the outside and that will be it. (Does it cost 5 francs if you want to go inside to pray?) Not worth it.",
          "A lovely church, but being unable to take photos is such a shame when there is only a very limited display of postcards on offer! However make sure you take advantage of the free audio guide as it is both interesting and well explained.",
          "Beautiful church. Too bad you cannot take any pictures, unlike other churches in Europe where you can. Bells are beautiful and the gold really stands out on the tower.",
          "The Fraum\u00fcnster (Women's Minster) Church with its famous blue-spire and breathtaking stained-glass windows created by the famed artist Marc Chagall are its USP. A must go place if you are interested in art.",
          "Nice, but not magnificent church with a number of nice touches, most of all windows by Marc Chagall that make it worth a visit if you are in or near Zurich.Chagall is my favorite artist and I am especially fond of his windows. The color, the exubrance, the bizarreness ( is",
          "This is a lovely big cathedral, but there is a cost to enter, which is sad on churches. we just stuck our heads in the door for a quick peek, as found that 7 euros was a bit steep.",
          "I had an extra day in Zurich so I explored old town. Fraumunster church was easily recognizable by its clock tower. I found the church a little disappointing, as much of its old art had been removed during the reformation period. The Chagall windows are worth viewing, as they",

          "For 5 franc you get history and artistic beauty. An audio tour is included and is highly recommended for all the information that it imparts. The Chagall windows are defintiely worth seeing.",
          "The magnificent stained glass windows by Marc Chagall are one of the many reasons to visit the Fraumunster Church. His use of colour is sublime. You can sit quietly and take in the shades of green, blue and yellow with their religious themes. The crypt is another worthwhile",
          "This small church provides a well organized and substantial audio tour that builds up to the shockingly beautiful windows over the choir of the church. Note, no photos are allowed, but there is a small gift area by the exit with bookmarks, cards, and a few photo posters. This",

          "We had to pay to enter but it was free for the kids. At 5 CHF, you get an audio guide as well. Worth a visit if you have time.",
          "We spent a peacefl hour here and rented the listening device that explained the beautiful windows, organ and church design. The explanations of these can best be understood with the use of the audio guide that is available in many languages. Definitely a place not to be missed.",
          "If you are a history buff or a fan of Chagal Glass, see it. If not, skip this one as there is an entrance fee 5SF pp and to me, it wasn\u2019t worth it.",
          "If u have been to rome or any other places with nice basilicas , don\u2019t waste time coming to this church.. absolutely nothing special inside although the facade looks nice... no need to waste 5 franc to enter.. i came out of it within 5 mins",

          "The windows done by Chagall are amazing! But... I felt very weird to pay the entrance fee to get in. It is only 5 francs, but the fact that you have to pay to see the church is very strange for me. Still do go there to see the windows, but keep in mind that it is paid.",

          "Marc Chagall is my favorite artist. I had a 5 hour layover in Zurich, so I was excited to see this church that had his stained glass artwork. It was mesmerizing sight to see. I will always cherish seeing his work in person. Not only was seeing Chagall's work amazing...",

          "It was recommended to me that I visit the Fraumunster while in Zurich. This large church and its twin across the river dominate the landscape and jointly make for a great photo of the Old Town. This former convent church was disappointing when first entering, as it had been",
          "For a 5CHF donation we entered the church and immediately saw what everyone talks about- the Chagall windows. It was a sunny day and the light streaming through was wonderful. There is a lot to look at apart from just the windows and the crypt museum is worth seeing as well as",
          "This is very nice protestant church so you should not expect to see a beautiful decor inside of it. But the main decoration inside is famous stained glass windows designed and made by Marc Chagall. They really worth of seeing. The entrance fee is 5chf and audio guide is offered",
          "It's not so much the church but, rather, the Chagall windows and the one by Giacometti. There's a small entry fee now but the set up is worth the expense. Enjoy the windows; Chagall created them for a princely sum later in life. They're amazing. I could sit there all day. Also",

          "Honestly this church did not have anything of great interest and I spent very little time here. The history of the church is interesting but there isn't really anything about it in the church. I was also underwhelmed by the stained glass windows which are mean to be well-known,",
          "The not to be missed element of this church is the Chagall Windows, 5 of them, 30 feet high created by Chagall in his 80s as the backdrop of the altar. Excellent audio guide available and explains the blending of the Jewish and Christian symbols.",

        "wiki": "The FIFA World Football Museum is an association football museum owned and operated by FIFA. The museum is located in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, across town from the FIFA headquarters. It opened on 28 February 2016.\n\n\n== Exhibits and amenities ==\nThe 3,500 m2 (38,000 sq ft) museum occupies the lower three floors of the renovated Haus zur Enge, a ten-story mixed-use building located in the Enge quarter across from the Z\u00fcrich Enge railway station and the FIFA-owned Hotel Ascot. The building also contains a sports bar, a bistro, a caf\u00e9, a library, a museum shop and conference rooms; the upper floors have office spaces and 34 luxury apartments.The museum shows over 1,000 objects. Exhibits include memorabilia from every FIFA World Cup and FIFA Women's World Cup, the most famous one being the original FIFA World Cup Trophy. The exhibition features various interactive and multimedia installations such as the biggest pinball machine ever made and an audiovisual media installation called Visions of Football using 8 meter LED screens.  In 2017, the museum was nominated for the German Design Award.Every year the museum participates in Z\u00fcrich's Long Night of Museums.\n\n\n== History ==\nPlans for a museum dedicated to the history of world football to be located in Z\u00fcrich were proposed by FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the FIFA Executive Committee in 2012. In April 2013, FIFA signed a 40-year lease with Swiss Life for the Haus zur Enge, which would be dismantled and rebuilt to house the museum; an earlier proposal would have had a museum on the grounds of the FIFA headquarters. The City of Z\u00fcrich Building Authority approved planning permission for the museum in November 2013.Construction on the renovated Haus zur Enge began in 2014 and was completed in December 2015.The 30 million Fr. ($30 million USD) museum opened on 28 February 2016, during a ceremony presided by the newly elected president of FIFA, Gianni Infantino.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Museum is cute and has a lot of info about the World Cup; history of the events, countries and players. But what the kids really loved was the football lab, where they get to play football skills games and get scores for how they do. The games are such that even smaller kids can",
          "Very limited in every way. Great for kids with the mini football style golf near the end. For an avid football fan it was just not great. Even cinema at the end has that annoying style FIFA film previous tournaments in The souvenir shop was rubbish",
          "The museum had an interesting collection of information with an excellent display on the changes to the rules of the game over the years. The final part of the museum, on the top floor, has quite a few exhibits and games that can keep the little ones happy for a long time.",
          "Having visited a number of museums in Europe, I was very interested to see what was inside the World Cup museum. Despite the CHF 24 price tag, we assumed there must be plenty that would make the price worth it. We were left feeling a bit hollow - Much like the museum itself. We",
          "In all fairness, this review is only about the souvenir store of the museum. We did not take the tour of displays. We were hoping to get gifts for friends and grandchildren. It is quite small and has high end signed soccer items as well as a few clothing items for small",
          "We took a guided group tour (~20 people) and were able to talk to a FIFA about inclusiveness, anti-discrimination, and diversity in football. The speaker did a great job telling first-hand stories about working in Russia, the Middle-East, and South America to explain how FIFA",
          "I traveled from Lausanne to see this and wow it was definitely with the 8hr round trip. I found out so much about the history of the World Cup that I never knew. It\u2019s packed with so much information and memorabilia. Go see for yourself and kids will love the activity area",

          "Fascinating way to while away 2-3 hours in Z\u00fcrich, especially if you enjoy football. I am not a football follower ie I don\u2019t follow a team in England but I do enjoy a World Cup tournament. This museum manages to include different areas that would interest even non football fans",

          "Our GPS took us to the actual FIFA World HQ, can't blame FIFA for that. The FIFA World Football Museum has no parking. Luckily, one of the staff inside was extremely helpful and went out of his way to help us find parking nearby. The inside is a very impressive collection of all",
          "Great Place for football lovers. you get to see the history of how it all started, all the matches and trophies. Milestones. Also on display is all the Jerseys of all the Teams that have participated in the World Cup Soccer since beginning of the tournament. Plenty of",

          "Its not cheap...but then its FIFA! A lot of young lads really enjoying it and its very interactive in parts. Some of the artifacts on show were very interesting. However with a world Cup just finished in Russia there was NOTHING about it. The footage at the end of the tour was",

          "For me as a pensioner the entrance fee was 19 ch. I could not find a lift that help me avoid walking up and down a steep staircase.There are mirrors at the bottom which make the area seem larger.Each of the men's and women's world cups had a section devoted to it.There was so",
          "I am part of family of soccer fans and the FIFA museum was great fun and informative. You learn about the founding of FIFA and the winning teams of the World Cup since its inception. You can see the FIFA trophy and near the end the tour you get to play various soccer games.",

          "This is the brainchild of FIFA\u2019s disgraced former president, Sepp Blatter, who was banned from football after an ethics committee found him guilty of abusing his position. It tells the story of \u201cthe beautiful game\u201d through artefacts, archival collections and memorabilia. Take",
          "They really need to visit other Sport Museums to see how to make this better. It was clean. Entrance fee is included with Swiss Rail pass. Not a lot to do inside. Wish they had an IMAX theatre and showed a little better football film. Gift shop is expensive.",
          "Went there after visiting Interlaken. Had to go in circles to get a parking. Museum is clean, near the train station. I believe entrance fee is a bit high. Anyway, football jerseys from almost each country, women and men world Cup trophy models to take pics. Little world Cup",
          "I rated this museum 3 stars because it was small and didn\u2019t have a whole lot to offer. We had free admission included with our swiss pass, so it was a no brainer for my football loving husband that we go. They have every country\u2019s jersey on display by color in a big circle. It\u2019s",
          "We decided to go as family staying with us were football fans and we got discounted tickets online on Tuesday. I can\u2019t imagine paying full price to see the museum. As an outsider to the football mania, there is very little substance nor history explained at the museum and the",

          "It doesn't take too long to get around the FIFA museum so it is not a bad option if you have a morning or afternoon free in Zurich. There is some great history to see and read and we were lucky to see the world cup just after it returned home from the world cup. It is probably",

          "Yes football, not soccer - cause the game is played with a ball on foot. Full display of some of the iconic history in FIFA football (world cups mostly) with some gorgeous rendering of each world cup via art. The jerseys of all the teams in the world are at full display. Lots of",

          "Visited during World Cup 2018 Final group qualification and watched a match on a nice big screen with variety of beverages while family members join the tour inside the building. Ultimate destination if your kids like football while visiting Zurich.",

          "It was nice visiting the museum, there are some interactive attractions for both kids and adults, not to mention some interesting history, jerseys and balls. However, considering the amount of things football-related, I definitely expected more: the 8 minute movie showed in the",

          "I took the tour into the FIFA with my daughter which is a football fan (me not much) And she was amazed. The whole place is amazing I must say, but of course with the tons of money this organization collects you can not expect less, well maybe a lower entrance fee maybe?",
          "Very nice museum to learn the origin of FIFA and the history of the World Cup. The first part of the museum includes interactive areas where you can learn about each country's stars of the game. Both men and women World Cup teams and stars are included. Films of these stars",

          "As a senior have paid 19 CHF for a ticket. Quite expensive. The Museum is surprisingly well laid-out. For soccer fans of all ages it provides enormous amount of information in various channels. For kids it is a real heaven of self-activating games and challenges. Anyone keen on",

          "football lovers will love this museum. there are a lot of games to play as well as the history of all world cups and you actually get to see the world cup which is amazing",
          "Very slick, modern museum with lots of things for young football fans to do and a fair bit of the past for older enthusiasts. Interactive elements mean you can pick highlights of games to watch and it brings back plenty of memories. It blends current appeal well with its history",
          "I initially mistook the FIFA museum for a one-hour-tops time-killer and expected it to be full of hagiographic portraits of FIFA board members. But is a supremely well-done museum for everyone who likes football, with genuinely historic artifacts, appealing and well-designed",
          "This museum is located across the street from the Enge RR stop. It is the most modern and interactive museum that I have ever visited. On the entrance level there is a panoramic movie screen that is 2 stories high and shows a loop of children and adults playing \"football\" in",
          "If you are looking for the in depth history of football, this is the place to go. You'll get the very detail of Football history here. It is worth the price you pay.",
          "Well, to be brutally honest, you don't have to be a football fan to love this place. Give yourself some time to enjoy everything this museum has to offer. If you love your football and its rich history, this is the place to be. You'll almost relive every major moment in football",
          "I loved how interactive this mueseum is. I would recommend allowing enough time to fully enjoy this mueseum. At least 3 hours.",
          "The FIFA museum surprised me with how good it really was. I really liked a timeline of the sport and organization, highlighting the major rule changes over time. They conveniently avoided going into very much detail about the corruption that has plagued the sport, but other than",
          "Great history for the soccer fans and non fans to learn about the game from the early days. Would recommend it.",
          "The museum is small with not much to see, at least not yet. But the gift shop is worth a visit for sure!",
          "If you seen any world cup of football you should visit this place, not a museum its library of football world history and Other classic things related to football.",
          "It was a surprise seeing the worldcup trophy so close and we loved the place, my kid liked it spending time by kicking football, corner kick, goal kick etc.",
          "Fortunately we chose to visit here on a Sunday when it opened and this place is a museum my husband (a football tragic) and I both enjoyed. Looks like an excellent place for football aged children too as there is an interactive fun park upstairs.",
          "In the beginning it seem standard and even bit boring. But, as we go in, it was suprising and my small children found it cool. Worth visiting",
          "A good addition for sports fans. Although it was smaller that I thought it would be, we enjoyed our time exploring. The museum has a lot of interesting memorabilia, and is very interactive. They even have a soccer arcade area where you can test your skills. It was a good",
          "The entrance fee is really ridicolous. There is no relation between price, size of the museum or other aspects. The show is very entertaining. Very vivid and interesting setup with a completely different design than most museums I habe seen. More a show than showcase with funny",
          "The museum is very small, a lot of the interactive displays are aimed at kids. infact theres a whole floor dedicated to games. There is a short chronological display on the history of FIFA, some memorabilia and posters and thats about it. it would take about 30mins to an hour to",
          "I was in Zurich this week and went to the FIFA museum. Was not sure what to expect. Overall, for 24\u20ac it was a let down. To be honest, entry should be free given the limited value. It will take 15 mins to complete and then a small shop. Better ways of spending 24\u20ac in Zurich",
          "I'm not a football fan, so when my partner suggested we go to this museum I was less than enthused. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It is a very interactive museum and I had a lot of fun! Even the photo gallery asks you to pick up some beads and put them in jars below the",
          "This is a famous museum. It is dedicated to football lovers. It is the best museum in the world. It is worth every penny. Don't miss this museum especially if you have kids and they need some time off playing in Zurich. This is wonderful inter active museum for children and",
          "If you are a football fan, this place is definitely worth a visit. A lot of artifacts are on display to illustrate the history of world football. You will need to store your backpack in the basement and they'll give you a token so that you can have access to a locker (you just",
          "I toured the FIFA World Football Museum a few times now, first at the pre-opening preview period for the FIFA Ballon d\u2019Or trophy exhibit. During this special exhibit the museum was free and open to the public, and showcased all the previous World Championship trophies. A",
          "Amazing place , very friendly team . My kid has enjoyed the place to much and interesting gifts there my only comment is it was very expensive",
          "As a lifelong fan of the game of soccer this was a must visit when I decided to go to Zurich. Very modern, great use of technology, nice blend of informative and interactive. Spent about 90 minutes because I was only in Zurich for two days and had a lot of ground to cover -",
          "I visited the museum the first days of August and, nothing to say about the organization. The museum is brand new and it was possible to go through the Football world in any kind of its aspects: interaction and innovative \"attractions\" are the keys of its success. Anyway, I need",
          "All focused on international football and was hoping for a little more national cup teams. The kids really enjoyed it. great kids area with football games and a sit down area for colouring/making arts and crafts. The movie in the middle was great but I felt like there was",
          "Given the amount of money FIFA has I would have expected the tickets to be a bit cheaper. The museum is nicely arranged and has some spectacular displays (like all the shirts of all national teams) and there are lots of fun activities. Unfortunately most of the challenges",
          "It was a fun thing to do. If you are a football fan, it is a must to do. The 8 minutes movie was spectacular.",
          "The museum building is new and has some interesting historical videos, but does not provide any insights into the big business of football.",
          "An otherwise simple museum for football that has an excellent child-friendly interactive football game. Like everything else in Switzerland, extortionate pricing for a moderate service.",
          "Easy to get to - and note on Tuesday you can get half price tickets on line only! History of the game and the world cup in particular; lots of interactive parts - especially for children. Recommended!",
          "This is a mecca for fotball fans, but even if you are not a really big fotball fan you will probably enjoy this museum which is really international. It is also very interactive.",
          "My son is a huge soccer fan and he enjoyed the museum, balll & jersey displays and interactive experiences and games. Well worth the visit for anyone enjoying football, young & old.",
          "As a HUGE football fan, this is must see, even with a bad impression with FIFA itself. Totally beyond my expectation. The museum is very interactive. First of all, you cannot bring any bag inside, so you will be led to the locker room. I would say just go there no matter if you",
          "Not a great football fan but definitely worth going to see. There is so much to see and read about how it all began. The actual world cup is on display to see which is amazing, it is not everyday you get to this so take a photo while there.",
          "We enjoyed the visit, with an exciting exhibition, even for non-football fans. Many artifacts and fun facts. Collection of home made footballs from Africa and other countries. Nice cafe in the building, which you can access without entering the museum.",
          "Everyone in the family enjoyed the museum. It had just the right mix of education , interactive, fun, and was a good length. Lots of very interesting facts and fun activities. Beautiful pictures and easy layout. Would recommend this to anyone, not just soccer fans.",
          "Bad experience overall. The staff kept asking me to finish the visit as the musum was closing in 10 minutes. Had only 1 hour, didn't finish my tour. Would apprecaciate if the staff was more approachable and let football lovers stay just for few minutes after official closing",
          "Our family consists of two people who love football (soccer) and two that don't. We all came out of our visit to the FIFA World Football Museum having had a very good time - so don't let your lack of interest in the sport itself put you off. If you're interested in history,",
          "I rated it Very Good instead of Excellent because it is men-centric. The video highlights are of the men World Cups. The interactive map by country is for the men's game. Example: Click on U.S. and the display shows Rank: 23; Coach: Bruce Arena; Wins; Losses; Draws. On the far",
          "I came here with my husband as he has always wanted to go. I am so glad that I went into the museum with him as I originally planned on not going. We came here to spend 1 hour.. we ended up spending 3 hours here! This museum has so much information and history on the origins",
          "The museum is well-thought out with lots of interactive options. There is a place to commentate a bit of a match, lots of memorabilia, and an excellent short video. My personal favorite was the soccer skills challenge games on the second floor. There is also an app that can",
          "Had planned to visit this museum for just a couple of hours, but could have easily spent 4 to 6 hours. The Museum is filled with all that you would expect, the history of football, the original memorabilia from the past, ie Diego Maradona's World Cup Final jersey of 1986,",
          "The museum was well worth it. Great visual aids and historical memorabilia from all of the FIFA World Cups. The golden trophy is even on display there. The movie at the end of the museum is great too. Definitely stay to watch the movie.",
          "Loved the interactive activities the kids can take part in. Too many stairs though. Restaurant/caf\u00e9 is alright.",
          "I visit a lot of museums and football matches around the world so it was great to combine the two here. The museum, whilst being 24 Francs to enter was very much worth the money. If you are interested in football history then two hours here is a wonderful way to spend your",
          "One of the must do activities in Zurich if you are a soccer fan. Went there with my kids and they had a great time The original World Cup in all of its 6.4 kgs of gold is kept there There is also a lot of history of soccer and interactive games A must do",
          "initially i thought the entrance fee is slightly on the higher side, but if you are a football fan, probably you can spend 2 to 3 hours here and try out some of your football techniques as well..",
          "I was in Zurich for a couple if days and heard about Fifa museum. What a great experience! It is an very interactive museum. I had a chance to test my skills as a real referee, to try I score commemoration dance, experience soccer skills as direct kick, corner kick, drible.",
          "As an avid football fan I loved this museum and its very informative displays. The only reason I can see why you wouldn't like it is if you aren't a football fan. However, all sports and modern history fans should check this place out and you will probably have a good time if",
          "Best Museum ever in swiss. we enjoy eht Football Museum in zurich. there is too much things about Football. knowledge about football amazing. we want to come back once again here in the future.",
          "Pretty disappointing. Lovely building with a few good displays and some cool interactive games, but we felt there could have been more substance. For example, the first display is every countries jersey - it takes a up a lot of the space, and who really cares - not much to be",
          "In the centre of Zurich, laid out over two and a half floors, you can tell it has been set up in a most professional way. Ground floor you see pictures and description of the story of football (soccer) with the subsequent introduction of more and more rules. Then you walk down a",
          "Amazing, interactive, overwhelming, just wow!!! Even my wife joined me for the museum and never complained ! Tip: don't forget to find your favourite player in the locker room!",
          "The museum is beautiful. New, clean, bright and well organized. I was so encouraged as my bright eyed daughters (3 and 5yrs old) picked our their countries jerseys as we walked into the first display. I was so excited to show them how awesome womens football is, its history and",
          "Loved it so as my 6 years old son It goes without saying that you should be a fan but great history including the world cups a lot of activities to be done for the kids Recommend!",
          "Very exciting & amazing, with good & creative gamifications & emotinal film about football at it's cinema. A good Place for football lovers & family!",
          "We spent about two hours here. $24 for Adults $14 for kids under $15 to $6. It is not on the Swiss travel pass. You enter on the a nice display of all the members jerseys and a nice wall detailing the leaders and their accomplishments. Head down stairs to a nice interactive",
          "If you are a football fan you have to go there. Me and my son who was 6 enjoyed it a lot. History of football and even games section.",
          "A good FIFA history. Backpack and bags must be left in the lockers provided. The museum gives you a brief history of when FIFA was started. You will see different jerseys from different countries. You walk down to the basement see the the FIFA men and women's World Cup trophy.",
          "This was so much fun for my wife & I, especially since I am a big football fan. You can commentate a football clip, take FIFA quizzes, learn about the history of the sport, and even do a skills challenge at the end. At first glance it is small & overpriced... But then you",
          "Although the entrance ticket is a bit pricey i.e 24 fr for adult and 14 fr for children of about 12 yrs , Its a great place to visit to embrace FIFA history and watch some amazing football moments and some memoirs of football legends . Since its a private establishment, they do",
          "A must for any football fan! Great for kids with lots of interactive activities I'm not a massive football fan and I found it fun. On arrival we were told to download the app which included games. Definitely enhanced my visit",
          "While in Zurich it would be difficult not to visit here if you are a football fan. This museum was added to my personal bucket list as soon as it was built! Although the outside leaves a lot to be desired for the inside is completely different story. It is modern, clean,",
          "The visit was a lesson for all the group. A lesson in regards how technology can be applied to a museum for a better comprehension of the attractions. In my case, as Costa Rican, I felt very proud to see the names of Paulo Wanchope in the locker area, side to side to very big",
          "This must be the most expensive museum I have been to and I have been to many in all continents. A red card to FIFA I will give credit where credit is due, the audio visual displays are excellent. It is very interactive and designed for children.",
          "There a lot of emotions on this Museum. You can find a line of history of the soccer, the cups and the evolution of the materials. Also, you can see the trophy of the world cup over there. There is a film of the cups. In the end, you can play with a soccer ball to make some",
          "it is great and interesting place to visit...but only 1 time. Maybe it could be possible to make the museum attractive for more than one visit? This movie place is not nice...bad for the eyes...unpleasant quality. Idea is great, but sadly old movies are not with quality suitable",
          "The FIFA museum is spread over 4 floors and gives great details of FIFA football history with a special focus on world cups. It has great detail of history over the decades of world cup history. While the details could be overwhelming for kids, it can be of real interest for",
          "We went to Zurich especially to visit this museum as my son recieved this trip for his 10th birthday. He was absolutely enthousiastic, we spent there more than 4 hours and still he did not want to leave! :-) The museum is visually attractive and very interactive and has really",
          "The interactive pinball type games using a soccer ball was very popular with my 13 year old son. This is the last attraction on the top floor. The museum is not that big, we needed about 30 minutes to look at everything and then spent 2 hours playing on the top floor.",
          "I really enjoyed visiting the museum. The visit is made very interactive with videos and games, nice for children with a treasure hunt game, and a lot of relics of each and every World Cup are kept. The story of each WC is very nice to read or read again, and allows to build",
          "If you like football, you will like this museum for sure. There is plenty of interesting history of football told and exhibitions are very well organised. On top floor there are some nice games like football pinball to be played - kids will certainly love all of this. Well done",
          "Paid 24\u20ac to get in and spent a couple of hours here. Some of the memrobilia was excellent and the highlight was seeing the World Cup [ or a copy] The layout was a bit strange as there is a lot of glass and mirrors! The cinema showed World Cup highlights which bought back",
          "Was looking forward to this but really was disappointed! Entrance fee way too expensive for what it is. Look elsewhere!",
          "Since my 14 years old boy and my husband are 2 big soccer fans, this is the place they wouldn't miss for anything. I tagged along and we all had fun. The best part was the interactive soccer trainings. There are 4 stations and each of them is very interesting. They are very",
          "Anything and Everything you need to know about FIFA. Interactive experience, great exhibition of memorabilia. Took my time, didn't feel rushed. However you can't go back once you have moved to another area in the museum, so make sure you take everything.",
          "the price of 24 \u20ac is too high, Not even they were the Vatican museums. Italian language which also is one of the official languages of Switzerland is provided",
          "Every sports or just soccer fan should visit this museum in case you're in Zurich. Lots of memorabilia to see. It is even great for kids, especially on the end, they can play lots of different soccer games. Well, the aduls can play also. :)",
          "Nice the World Cup gallery and the playground. Almost nothing about the most important players (history, videos, etc). The negligible presence of statistics is another big gap to be definitely improved.",
          "Lots of fun, especially the Lab with games where kids (and adults) can spend hours. Everything well organised,even the lockers are marked with footballers; names (Messi, of course, always taken :-). Worth the money and the time.",
          "The museum is less exhibition than experience based, which makes it perfect for youngsters. The memorabilia are nice, but the most fun part is the interactive soccer parkour.",
          "This was our first destination of the 4 day trip to Zurich ... had booked it online before leaving and was soo excited to get there. The place is nice , but it lacks the cosy touch. I would have imagined it would have more of the football memories... there is a nice interactive",
          "We visited of the cuff and had a great few hours there. Plenty to look at and lots of interactive exhibitions, the be a commentator seamed to be the most popular. At the end you get to test your football skills on a series of games and play a bit of football.",
          "My husband is a die-hard soccer fan, and we had a blast at the FIFA Museum. They have built a stunning and interactive museum that is fun for adults and kids. Definitely recommended!",
          "Visited the museum whilst passing through Zurich and had a good time. Lots of information and artefacts from World Cups past, the history of football and some nice memorabilia. The lay out is good and I like the chronological aspect of the journey through all the world cups and",
          "Went with my son's football club to the new Museum near to Enge train station in Zurich. It is very flash but not a lot of substance. The word museum should be replaced with 'experience' as there is not much original old items and the information displays are globules of",
          "Enjoyed looking at all those collections from starting to the end. Lovely place and must visit place for every football fan all over the world. It's quite worth to spend couple of hours there.",
          "Apart from seeing all the football shirts from the FIFA World Cup in Brazil arranged by colour there wasn't much else going on. The interactive games felt more like an poorly organized arcade squeeze into a small space. And the movie was uninspiring (I'd recommend substituting",
          "If you are in zurich you should visit this place although the tickets price is very expensive , they offer summary of all world cups history and some other stuff but the best thing was the short film .",
          "#17 on list of things to see in Zurich? seriously the train station is ranked higher? C'mon people. Ok maybe its because I am a big football fan but I really enjoyed the museum and would rank it much higher than the train station for sure. Was a bit pricey at 24euros. Great",
          "The place had an impressive collection and exhibitions. Though, you have to be a football fan to get something out if (which I am not). The exhibitions is of to the legends and the legendary moments I figure more economics, design of football etc. would have sparked my interest",
          "Very nice museum for those who appreciate soccer. Museum is very modern and interactive, bags lockers are named under famous soccer players and the museum displays the story and evolution of Soccer and all World Cup winners since its foundation .. FIFA knows how to impress",
          "Very good collection of memorabilia, very well thought out the flow of the musuem and the best part is the futbol acitvities that feel like futbol practice with technology fun for kids and adults alike. The 4 francs additional to eneter the world cup exibitions seem to me like",
          "What to say .... This is a must and a Highlight for any Football enthusiast and/or sport loving people. Not to be missed - its a Must A very professionally done set up/exhibition. Very friendly staff.",
          "Despite all of the allegations surrounding FIFA in recent years, the museum in Zurich is very well put together. Very interactive for kids - from videos and movies to an play area dedicated to different football challenges. Lots of history and memorabilia, with the center",
          "Very nice world cup memorabelia. Movie was interesting. Nice attraction. Must see for soccer fans, if visiting Zurich. Decent value.",
          "If you love football and its history, it can take up to 2 hours inside. If you like football and don't care much about its history, you will spend around 45 minutes inside. If you like playing mini games, FIFA video game, or foosball, you will spend more time there. Add more",
          "Also great to visit with children if they are soccer enthusiasts. Lots of interactive games and activities for children. The gift shop needs improvement to include more souvenirs.",
          "So much history and memories... I just loved being there! It is also a great place to visit with children, there are so many activities for them! A short film that shows all the excitement around a match will bring tears to your eyes if you really feel this sport.",
          "just an amazing experience, a must see for football fan! the history of world cup and even for a non fan, it's still a great experience",
          "The entry price is excessive, especially for what they have on show. It was nice to see the World Cup and it was really interesting to see some of the exhibits covering how the laws of football were made but, while this was interesting, it was not enough to make me feel like I",
          "it was very quiet and this made it easy to get round. Was interesting for me, who likes the history, and for the kids who liked the interactive exhibits.",
          "I'm a museum junkie. I've been to many different types of museums over the years. On this trip alone, I went to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Chaplin's World in Corsier sur Vevey, Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich, as well as a few others. So, I decided to checkout this new museum. At 24",
          "I visited this museum with my brother, who is a huge football enthusiast, which was needless to say the perfect place for him to see the history and beginnings of the FIFA and everything related to it. Although I'm not very interested in football I did enjoy the museum,",
          "Nicely designed, lots of pictures, interactive screens, exiting short movie and a very nice, mainly for children (at any age) gaming area.",
          "We try to visit the place whenever we can though it is a bit pricey. The food is amazing and there is an exceptional view of the city. You can visit the hotel by car or you go up the stairs through a beautiful vinyward it's just amazing.",
          "We were told the whole museum would take two hours to walk and we were in there for 3 1/2 hours and left only because they were closing up. Plenty of reading material on the history of FIFA, the would cup and the various nations that compete. Go through the many artefacts from",
          "The trip was amazing for football lovers and the sight is just beautiful. It has great ball pictures.",
          "Cool technology, loots of hands-on activities for children, still missing some displays, for old and young, footballs funs will live it",
          "Great to visit if you are in town and you really like football. But even if it's not your game, the historical section about World Cups and the games for adults and kids are worth for a visit.",
          "This is an amazing interactive museum and a must for football fans. It only opened in Feb this year so not too many people know about it",
          "Spent a leisurely half-day in this museum. So much to see, learn, and have fun too. Very unique in its layout. Don't miss the short movie screening - worth every minute!!!",
          "Does not look big from the outside. Inside it is really well laid out with something for everybody. Lots of history and lots of interactive displays. At the end there is a football pinball area. Great for the young ones. Needs maybe 90 minutes.",
          "As a fan of football, this was an informative, fun and excellent museum. It brings to life the history of the World Cup, providing a history of the sport's best moments. It was great seeing the World Cup trophy as well. Overall, a fantastic experience that I would recommend to",
          "We woke up this morning to pouring rain and had no clue how to fill our first day of holiday in Zurich, having envisaged it being beautiful sunshine! A quick Google search came up with the FIFA Museum as an option. Myself and my daughter (aged 16) have absolutely no interest in",
          "It was a great experience not only for my son who is a football fan, but also for me. The memorabilias and documentation of the history of FIFA is presented very well. There was a kid's trail in which you get to explore the whole museum and is a must-see when you visiti Zurich.",
          "If you love football or only have a minor interest in the sport, this museum bring it all to life. Very well laid out, lots of interactive things to try and very informative and interestingly laid out. The exhibition of football shirts from around the world when you first walk",

          "If you are a crazy football fan like me and you are in Z\u00fcrich, then this museum is a must visit. It grabs you from the moment you enter until you leave the museum, although you certainly don't want to. There are games on the second floor for young ones and adults which are",
          "WOW!! What can I say. This place was right up my alley. I absolutely LOVE soccer history and this place more than delivered. They have a plethora of pictures, videos, artifacts etc. of EVERY World Cup since the very first one in 1930. In addition, their upper floor is",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Z\u00fcrich Opera House (German: Opernhaus Z\u00fcrich) is an opera house in the Swiss city of Z\u00fcrich. Located at the Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz, it has been the home of the Z\u00fcrich Opera since 1891, and also houses the Bernhard-Theater Z\u00fcrich. It is also home to the Z\u00fcrich Ballet.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first permanent theatre in Z\u00fcrich, the Aktientheater, was built in 1834 and it became the focus of Richard Wagner\u2019s activities during his period of exile from Germany.\nThe Aktientheater burnt down in 1890. The new Stadttheater Z\u00fcrich (municipal theatre) was built by the Viennese architects Fellner & Helmer, who changed their previous design for the theatre in Wiesbaden only slightly. \n\nIt was built in only 16 months and was opened in 1891 and became the first opera house in Europe to have electrical lighting.\n\nIt was the city's main performance space for drama, opera, and musical events until 1925, when it was renamed Opernhaus Z\u00fcrich and a separate theatre for plays was built: The Bernhard Theater opened in 1941, in May 1981 the Esplanada building was demolished, and the present adjoint building opened on 27/28 December 1984 after three years of transition in the Kaufhaus building nearby Schanzengraben.\nBy the 1970s, the opera house was badly in need of major renovations; when some considered it not worth restoring, a new theatre was proposed for the site. However, between 1982 and 1984, rebuilding took place but not without huge local opposition which was expressed in street riots. The rebuilt theatre was inaugurated with Wagner\u2019s Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg and the world premi\u00e8re of Rudolf Kelterborn\u2019s Chekhov opera Der Kirschgarten.\nAs restored, the theatre is an ornate building with a neo-classical fa\u00e7ade of white and grey stone adorned with busts of Weber, Wagner, and Mozart. Additionally, busts of Schiller, Shakespeare, and Goethe are to be found. The auditorium is built in the neo-rococo style and seats approximately 1200 people. During the refurbishment, the issue of sightlines was not adequately addressed.  As a result, the theatre has a high number of seats with a limited view, or no view, of the stage. This is unusual in international comparison, where sightlines in historic opera houses have been typically enhanced over time.Corporate archives and historical library collections are held at the music department of the Predigerkirche Z\u00fcrich.The Opera House also holds concerts by its Philharmonia orchestra, matinees, Lieder evenings and events for children. Opera Ball is organised every year in March, and is usually attended by prominent names.\n\n\n== Opera Studio ==\nThe Z\u00fcrich Opera House is also home of the International Opera Studio (in German: Internationales Opernstudio IOS) which is a educational program for young singers and pianists. The studio was created in 1961 and has renowned artists currently teaching such as Brigitte Fassbaender, Hedwig Fassbender, Andreas Homocki, Rosemary Joshua, Adrian Kelly, Fabio Luisi, Jetske Mijnssen, Ann Murray, Eytan Pessen or Edith Wiens.\n\n\n== Youth protests of 1980 ==\nIn response to the combination of high subsidies for the Opera and the lack of cultural programs for the youth in Z\u00fcrich, large protests were held in May 1980. The protests became known as the Opernhauskrawalle youth protests \u2013 Z\u00fcri br\u00e4nnt, meaning Zurich is burning, as documented in the 1981 Swiss documentary film of the same name.\n\n\n== Financing ==\nOpernhaus Z\u00fcrich AG is organised pursuant to Swiss law as a company limited by shares and it operates a music theater and Ballet under the authority of Canton of Zurich that has been providing the main funding since 1995.\nBoth Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, are partners of Opernhaus Z\u00fcrich AG.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nZ\u00fcrich Opera\u2019s official website\nMarco Badilatti (2005). \"Opernhaus Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich ZH\".

        "wiki": "The Rietberg Museum is a museum in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, displaying Asian, African, American and Oceanian art.  It is the only art museum focusing on non-European art and design in Switzerland, the third-largest museum in Z\u00fcrich, and the largest to be run by the city itself.  In 2007 it received approximately 157,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Location and buildings ==\nThe Rietberg Museum is situated in the 17-acre (69,000 m2) Rieterpark in central Z\u00fcrich, and consists of several historic buildings: the Wesendonck Villa, the Remise (or \"Depot\"), the Rieter Park-Villa, and the Sch\u00f6nberg Villa.  In 2007 a new building designed by Alfred Grazioli and Adolf Krischanitz was opened \u2013 the addition of this largely subterranean building, known as \"Smaragd\", more than doubled the museum's exhibition space.The Rieterpark is located near Z\u00fcrich Enge railway station, and can also be reached by tram line #7 and bus line #33.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 1940s the city of Z\u00fcrich purchased the Rieterpark and the Wesendonck Villa.  In 1949 the Wesendonck Villa was selected, by referendum, to be rebuilt into a museum for the art collection of Baron von der Heydt, which he had donated to the city in 1945.  This was carried out in 1951-52 under the architect Alfred Gradmann.  The Rietberg Museum was opened on 24 May 1952.  Johannes Itten, the Swiss expressionist painter, was director of the museum until 1956.\nIn 1976 the city acquired the Sch\u00f6nberg Villa, which had been threatened with demolition, and opened it in 1978 as an extension of the museum.  Today the Villa is also home to an extensive non-lending library administrated by the museum.\n\n\n== Organisation and funding ==\nThe Rietberg Museum is operated by the presidential department of the city of Z\u00fcrich.  In 2007, it employed around 100 people.  About half of the funding comes from the city, while the other half is raised through revenue, sponsors, and donations.  Additions to the collection come mostly from donations.\n\n\n== Publishing activities ==\nThe museum established an in-house press shortly after its founding in 1952.  Initially it published catalogues of the museum's Asian and African artworks, as well as occasional short monographs.  The museum's publishing activity has increased since 1985, in connection with the large special exhibitions that it has organised since then, and it now publishes four to six new titles per year.\nSince 1991, the museum also publishes Artibus Asiae, a biannual scholarly journal on the arts and archaeology of Asia.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRietberg Museum website\u2014(in English)\n3D Google Earth model of museum complex",

          "I have been at the Rietberg several times now, and it's definitely my favorite museum in Zurich. While the entrance ticket is not the cheapest, it's definitely worth it. The sheer amount of pieces in the permanent collection will keep you busy for several hours, and the special",
          "The museum is huge that's why it makes it kind of confusing walking through. The English descriptions aren't as detailed as the German ones. Also there aren't many historical facts in the descriptions",
          "Interesting however they have no free entrance on Wednesday. There are some spectacular pieces that attract attention.",
          "The Museum Rietberg is easy to get to by Zurich Tram. We got off the Green Line here on our way back from seeing Dolder Grand Hotel. Be sure to see the awesome Rodin Gate next to the entrance here.",
          "Most stores in Zurich are closed on Sundays, so my husband and I planned a visit to the Museum Reitberg in the afternoon. There are several different ticket types that are sold depending on whether you want to view just the main collection or special exhibits too. We chose the",
          "The museum itself is wonderful, as well as the garden surrounding it! I especially recommend a visit if you are looking for a break from the usual crowded tourist spots of Z\u00fcrich.",
          "Beautifully situated in a park, the museum has a very worthwhile collection. The villa itself is of historical importance as the Wesendonck Villa where Wagner stayed.",
          "We went to see the temporary Mirrors exhibition here on a rainy Sunday. Cost is 25 CHF per adult .The free booklet you can pick up in at least German and English languages explains some of the displays in more detail. Fascinating exhibits from all around the world from 800BC up",
          "Great museum and outstanding exhibit. It is both easy to visit and a great place to take time and enjoy the surroundings. For the mirror exhibit you need to speak German or take a tour",
          "After going to the national museum I think this one is better. So many pieces to view and they even let you into the storage area. The special exhibit mirrors was interesting and easy to follow even in English with the provided guidebook. The entrance fee of 25 CHF is standard",
          "located in a large beautiful park a bit out of the city center, Rietberg is a mayor place for global culture and art. and the park is really a jewel. I love spending my time here.",
          "The exhibitions in the museum are always very interesting. What I love most about the place thouch is its location in the Rietberg Park.",
          "The Rietberg is located in a park-like grounds. The museum is fantastic with lots of great interesting displays, beautifully laid out with good information cards in English. Would not be difficult to spend a couple of hours here. On the way out have a look at the items displayed",
          "This small modern museum has very special art work from various countries. If your a member you are kept up to date. The restaurant, where I advice you to sit outside has simple food, so also very nice for families",
          "With grounds that are enough of a reason in themselves for a trip to this unusual museum, one must stop for a tasty meal in their small restaurant. The current exhibits focus on Buddism with marvelous scultptures, masks, and textiles & fashions & object de art from China, India,",
          "If you want to visit a museum that gives you glimpses of cultures from around the world, check out the Rietberg. Between its permanent collection and its special shows, it often has exhibits showcasing works from several continents. In each case, the well-curated displays",
          "We visited in order to see a temporary exhibition, which was very enjoyable. the permanent exhibitions were interesting but did not hold the same attraction for us. Information was available in English which was useful. The staff were friendly. We thought the entry price was",
          "This is one of Europe's hidden gems. Hidden, it has to be said, partly through its own fault. I talked to people who live in Zurich who did not even know about it and it is not well advertised or signposted. But it is really worth finding. The collection of early Chinese",
          "So far the best art museum I have visited in Switzerland. First of all, the location is fabulous, in the middle of a lush park. Secondly, the part above the ground looks perfectly ordinary and classical, however through the main entrance you go down and enter the sophisticated",
          "The museum is divided in the new building see in in the photo, and a nineteenth century villa once inhabited by Richard Wagner. It is set in a magnificent park with intermittent views over the lake. The contents are magnificent, depending on your interests. I found the Chinese",
          "... Before and Beyond the Image ... The Rietberg Museum is geographical located and spectacular situated in the 17-acre Rieterpark in central Z\u00fcrich, which is easy to reach via tram 7. The exhibitions are generally accompanied by publications as well as a wide range of",
          "I hadn't visited the Rietberg in many years, but during the annual Lange Nacht der Museen (long night of museums) I got to re-visit several museums I knew from prior visits as well as a few I didn't know. Everything about the Rietberg is literally perfect, from the manicured",
          "The Rietberg Museum is in the middle of a beautiful park in Zurich, so the walk to this museum is delightful. I went especially to see the Meiyintang Collection housed here, but was surprised to find an excellent exhibition on Ancient Egyptian objects, many found under water,",
          "we went to the Osiris Exhibition- was very well done. The park itself, the lovely caf\u00e9 is a visit worth. We really liked it - the caf\u00e9 prices are a bit exaggerated even for Zurich but then one supports some culture? The exhibitions in this museum are always presented with an",
          "The permanent exhibition was very captivating and had unique pieces of art. The collection was from India, China, Japan, Egypt, Nigeria and etc... I definitely recommend",
          "The Rietberg Museum is located in a gorgeous park in the centre of Zurich. The collection outgrew the original home and has expanded into a new part of the museum that is mainly underground. Without entering the new section of the museum, it is impossible to realize how",
          "Another art museum but diff one in itself as this is the probably only museum in Swiss with non European art collection.",
          "the msueum excels in exhibiting particular cultures for a period of time. Nasca was the last exhibit I visited. that was superb and superbly done. the permanent exhibits are also wirthwhile visiting",
          "This was an unexpected gem of my trip! I really enjoyed all the permanent exhibits - sadly I managed to visit when they were prepping all the temporary exhibits so those areas were all closed. The grounds of the museum are really pretty too. They've got free lockers for",
          "Good and healthy homemade food, quick and nice service, fair prices. Their cakes and sweets are also nice.",
          "great to seat for a picnic or a book to read. Nice view with tons of trees and it is free. You can walk all around it is worth it.",
          "Really love that museum, for the architecture, the program and the location. Highly recommended, especially with kids (beautiful park around it!).",
          "The museum has a very special collection of Far East ancient art crafts. The tour might take good 3 hours but it is worthy it. Take the guided tour as the information about some pieces cannot be obtained by just reading what is on t he piece.",
          "This really is a wonderful museum situated in a pleasant garden estate. I visited in February, the weather was cold with a bit of snow lying on the ground. I can imagine the gardens in summer bloom. The Nasca Exhibition is well worth seeing. Who or what created the lines? The",
          "By exploring the hundreds of amazing artifacts in this museum, I learned a lot about ancient eastern Asia cultures. I recommend buying the Z\u00fcrich card, which gets you into this museum for free.",
          "We went to see the Nasca, Peru exhibition, and it was really informative, interesting and well presented. It is on until 15th April 2018 and I highly recommend to go and see it if you are in Z\u00fcrich, and have a couple of hours to spare. As quoted on their website: The probably",
          "Really enjoyed this museum. Excellent collection of eastern art and artefacts that is truely fascinating. The Nasca Peru exhibit is well worth a visit and I really learned so much.",
          "The only museum I came across with non European art collection during my stay in swiss for 7 days. Nice collection where few are really dated very old.",
          "Quite some old art and artifacts from around the world. You get there on tram #7. Very close by the city center. I enjoyed very much spending some hourse there",
          "Amazing place. Arts and artifacts from all over the world mostly on revolving loan basis. Good cafe and excellent outdoors for kids to play and run about as well. The collections we saw were from Africa, China, Japan, Pakistan, India and Peru.",
          "A bit of a nondescript part of Zurich which makes you wonder. Then you walk up a nice park area and sort of wonder where the big museum building is. Then you realize after checking in that a bunch of the museum is housed underground and in two additional houses in the park",
          "We went over for an Alice Boner exhibition opening. Arresting photos. Took me back to a whole different India... It was getting dark, but the trees around the museum seemed very interesting - almost like a Botanical Garden",
          "Incredible variety of art works from all over Asia. Very often a special collection is shown. Wort every franc!",
          "We had a lovely time looking around the gardens surrounding the museum and visiting the cafe. The museum has a vast collection of very, very old masks and ancient pottery - you have to keep reminding yourself that you are looking at things thousands of years old.",
          "A ticket costs a small fortune but it is literally a treasure house. I have been there twice, once with my younger brother and once with a friend and we spent hours mesmerised by all the artifacts on show. Super fun and interesting. Be prepared to spend at least 4 hours or so.",
          "Have been there a number of times, lovely place just to relax and have a coffee at the cafe. It includes historical artifacts, art, and much more. There are seats to take along with you to sit in front of a beautiful artifact or painting. The gardens are beautiful aswell.",
          "Very interesting ethnographic exhibitions in a wonderful setting, 15 minutes from city center by tram. High quality presentation. Ideal for a romantic outing or otherwise.",
          "This Museum is Outstanding! We loved looking around and taking in all its rapture. If you have the time make sure you stop in for a while",
          "A most stunning and attractive museum with its futuristic emerald green entrance and wooden staircase which makes you believe you were in a maze. Its exhibitions are of global exception and carefully curated each time. You can easily spend a day in the museum and its various",
          "We travelled from London to see a true sensational exhibition of the Osiris mysteries. Objects from Egyptian museums (incl new underwater finds off the coast at Abu Qir). The permanent collection of non-European art deserves a visit as well, but we were too tired after",
          "A little bit out of town, but you can get a tram & walk up the hill through nice gardens. Collection is spread out a bit but very interesting. The green glass entrance is lovely. May have some expensive temporary exhibits.",
          "I put a gold leaf in the left corner, on the concrete wall covered with Gold. I saw the Carl Jung exhibition some time ago. They are changing all the time.",
          "The Reitberg Museum is lovely, set in a park on top of a hill. Right now, there is a wonderful exhibit entitled Osiris: Egypt's Sunken Mysteries, which will be there until July 16. It tells the story of the Egyptian worship of the god Osiris, the natural sinking of island",
          "This museum is full of old art and artifacts from around the world. You get there on tram #7. Then walk a couple of blocks up a hill to the museum in the park. Tickets are in a modern building to your left as you head in. The entrance fee is covered by the Zurich card. The",

          "Visited the Rietberg museum in April, lured by the visiting Treasures of Alexandria exhibition (which was excellent) but we enjoyed the rest of the museum, which is packed full of cultural artifacts from all over the world (so much so, they have an open annex with piles of stuff",
          "The Rietberg Museum is situated in a beautiful park. The museum itself is partly in an old villa, partly in a very modern building, the two are interconnected. It shows exceptional ethnic works from many different areas: African, Asian, oceanic and this time a beautiful special",
          "Do not be fooled: from the \"Rietberg Museum\" tram stop it is a 5-10 minutes walk through village-like streets and the botanical gardens, to reach the top of a hill. It is a carefully designed museum. The Osiris exhibition was breathtaking and the permanent collection",
          "There is an Osiris exhibition on until July 2017 - well worth a visit as it covers the recent undersea excavations. Well laid out and informative labelling in English. The walk from the tram stop through a park is pretty. Free bag lockers. Good shop.",
          "I have no hesitation in recommending a visit to this museum, regardless of whether there is a temporary exhibition.",
          "we visited as a family the Orisis exhibition , was well organized and well displayed . the information headphones were easy to use and informative (sadly could have been a bit more lively and colorful) it was encyclopedia info .... and could have been so much more..........",
          "Went to see the stunning exhibition of Frank Goddio's underwater excavations at Heraklion which is on until mid July. Very steep entry fee of Chf 25. That includes an audio guide but it wasn't very good for the exhibition. They also only had books but no phat cards of the",
          "My wife and I visited the Rietberg museum in order to see the excellent exhibition \"Osiris - Egypt's Sunken Mysteries\" (until July 16th 2017) which is a must see if you like egyptian art. The museum is located in a lovely park next to a beautiful old mansion which includes the",
          "A jewel in the Zurich museum landscape in a generous park with precious old trees where it is also allowed to have picknick with the food from the museum cafe - where you even can get a basket and a plaid! The shows are very carefully arranged with great sensibility for the",
          "For all connoisseurs/lovers of East Asian art it's the best place to visit. and as all exponates can't be places for visitors due to large number of collection, there are storage place too in museum where are assembled many other amazingly interesting pieces of art. In front of",
          "Museum Rietberg has one of the largest collections of asian art that I have seen. They regularly have special shows which are excellently curated and well documented. Set in a pretty park with old trees, it is definetly worth a visit.",
          "A place to visit again and again. You get bored. The small bistro with local, organic foods is delightful. The traditional Japanese Tea Ceremonial is a one in the life time experience. Booking in advance ( over the website ) is recommend !",
          "We weren't in the mood for seeing antiquities when it was such nice weather. The grounds are great for strolling (although a bit hilly) and down by the lake is the fascinating collection of cacti, if you're into that sort of thing.",
          "The Rietberg museum is one of my favorite places to visit in Z\u00fcrich. The exhibitions are always top notch and the permanent collection is interesting enough to look at. I could just spend hours in the book shop and I WANT to buy everything. Of course, in the warmer months it is",
          "An outstanding museum of several collections. With one exception, Gardens of the World, non-flash photography is permitted. Pamphlets in English are available. The vast collection is displayed in several buildings on the campus, and there is coffee shop and gift shop (of",
          "Yawn..CHF18.00 to look at an exhibition is a ripoff. Save your money and enjoy the nice park landscape for free. Don't bother with the restaurant, see for yourself in the attached photo what it costs",
          "Hidden in a parc, near translation Zurich-Engi, is a real treasure: You walk up a few steps and will find even for Wagner Fans Villa Wesendonck and right beneath the museum.take your time and stroll around. The exposition part changes and it is very inspirational for artists,",
          "The setting for this Museum on beautiful grounds with huge trees and lovely walking paths complements the museum's collections of artifacts from primitive cultures to the sophisticated developments in China, Japan, Africa, really from all over the Asian world. The displays are",
          "You have to visit this museum when you are in Zurich. Also the Rieterpark is worthwhile a visit and often very quiet. There is also a nice coffee shop and always special exhibitions.",
          "Modern museum with African and Egyptian artifacts surrounded by excellent gardens and walks. Pleasant day out for all the family. Caf\u00e9 available for snacks and drinks.",
          "This is an Asian Museum, and over the years I have seen many great exhibitions here. The quality is extremely high and well run. The ambience and setting is of the highest quality. Highly recommended.",
          "The museum houses mainly pottery and statues from parts of the world other than Europe, which is interesting from an anthropology standpoint but unusual for an European destination. It likely caters to more of a local audience. The park it is located in is definitely worth",
          "This museum has interesting exhibitions, which often are asian. It is located uphill in a residential area of the city. It has beautiful grounds.",
          "I was so lucky to find this nice museum, away from the busy center, just by chance. Now, it will be one of my favorites! Visit it if you are interested in Asian or African art. You will be amazed!",
          "Beautiful location in a parc and beautiful changing collection, now about African masks and ao Chinese art. A must see in Zurich",
          "Visited it since it was a top attraction in Zurich, it was ok but nothing to write home about. The park it was in was nice, but I wouldn't make this top of the list of things to see in Zurich.",
          "a bit of centre by tram 7 from main centre. in middle of a wonderful parcarea. very famous for far east or south american exhibitions - see whats on. there are artifacts shown sometimes, that never been out for public in the whole world! a bit expensive entry",
          "After two years I have come back to the Rietberg Museum in Zurich. It has always been one of my favorite museums in Switzerland. Two years ago I saw the special exhibition of a Zenmaster. This time the special exhibition was \u201cAkbar\u2019s golden heritage (Akbars goldenes Erbe)\u201d. This",

          "Unfortunately, this time the museum doesn't keep up to the usually exceptional exhibitions. - there is no proper guidance through the exhibition, I didn't even know where to start or what the purpose was - there is no learning effect; maybe better to read some things on chinese",

          "This museum shows most of the time asian related historic objects from old civilisations. Not only the objects of the museum are interesting and beautyful but also the location of the museum park has a mystic atmosphere.",
          "More like an art gallery than a museum. Each room has very few exhibits, thorough descriptions of the items can only be obtained from handbooks scattered around the gallery, and it covers a relatively limited selection of history (the last not being a bad thing). My favourite",
          "We were advised to go to the Rietberg to see the exhibition on \"Akbar's Golden Legacy - Painting for the Emperors of India\" from the sixteenth century by a friend who lives in Zurich. It was brilliant. The paintings were beautiful but the interpretation was outstanding and",
          "It has a large Asian collection, and perfect exhibitions. We visited it many times to see new exhibitions, and they are always impressive. Book store is interesting too. Plus perfect views around museum. It has easy access by trams from Hauptbahnhof.",

          "If you like Asian culture, you will find this museum very interesting The museum located in a nice park, with beautiful views on the lake and walking promenades.",
          "The museum is easy to reach with public transportation. You walk in the park and can see the permanent asiatic exhibitions in one of the building or specific exibitions in the main building. The cafeteria is a nice place to stay and to enjoy pastries, sandwichtes and bicher",
          "Very \"focused\" exhibition. This is the place to see far away cultures, referring to Europe- Japan, Africa, India,..Since it is not a big museum, you can see that each article was chosen very carefully, to reflect as much as possible.",
          "Excellent Asian collection including many pieces dating back to the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC. A hidden Gem!",
          "Visited mid-week and not that busy, even though lunchtime. Photography exhibition \"World in Colour\" is well worth a visit, as is the incredible special exhibition on Papua New Guinea. Allow lots of time as there is so much to see and not possible to do all in one visit. Highly",
          "Well worth a visit but leave yourselves plenty of time as the volume of exhibits is astounding. These are mainly historic artifacts but from all over the World. The current exhibition of old scenes from around the World is fascinating and, when you've had enough, the cafe",

          "This is a wonderful ethnographic museum with a superb collection of art from Asia, Africa and the Americas. For Richard Wagner devotees it has added interest as being housed in the Villa Wesendonck where the composer most likely had an affair with the lady of the house and wrote",
          "One of the nice and best Museum in Switzerland. Just like all other museums you need to got extra time to take the real advantage of visit. Good luck",
          "I cannot believe it took me numerous visits to Zurich to discover this gem. I saw an ad for it in town so I looked it up and off I went. The collection of African art was my favorite, but the others are excellent as well. They have material from various parts of Asia, from New",
          "The whole setting of this museum is delightful, with a couple of houses in extensive grounds and beautiful gardens. We primarily went to see the photographic exhibition of the world in color pre 1930 which was exceptional- not only prints but also original books we could look",
          "Located in a beautiful park, this museum offers great exhibitions and a permanent collection. Worth the visit and to hang out under the trees for a break.",
          "Great Museum and the food at the cafe is excellent ! Atmosphere is charming and the park around it is lovely to walk through.",

          "We enjoyed as part of our education at the Hotel Management School in Z\u00fcrich (Belvoirpark) a tour of the Rietberg Museum. The employees, who gave us this tour did a great job. They are all very passionated about their subjects and made it possible to get in touch with the",

          "On a 12 hour layover in Zurich I decided to take in as much art as I could. Aside from Zurich itself being a work of art I visited the Rietberg Museum for several hours. I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed this museum and the grounds around it. It is truly a half day",
          "The people from Zurich don't name it an ethnografic museum, but an art one. Let's skip this debate: there I found a incredible collection of ethnographical pieces.... the most marvellous African masks I have ever seen, considering that I am a seeker of.... oh... ethnographical",

          "Tripadvisor contains already quite some comments about the Rietberg Museum in Zurich, and I agree with them: It is one of the finest museums of German speaking Switzerland. in 1952 it has been founded in an old villa located in a wonderful park and enlarged in 2007 by an",

          "Set in some pretty grounds, and easily accessible by tram (like most of Zurich), I was stunned by the quality of Chinese and African exhibits. It's amusing that I flew all the way to Switzerland and saw a Chinese collection that was better than what I could find in Hong Kong.",

        "wiki": "Die Altstadt (German for \"the old town\") in the Swiss city of Z\u00fcrich encompasses the area of the entire historical city before 1893, before the incorporation of what are now districts 2 to 12 into the municipality, over the period 1893 to 1934. Die Altstadt approximately corresponds to the area enclosed by the former city ramparts, and is today within the administrative area of the city called Kreis 1 (District 1).\nWith a population of 5,617 (as of 2015), it houses about 1.4% of the city's total population.\nAdministratively, District 1 is divided into four parts or quarters by the Z\u00fcrich statistical office, Rathaus (town hall), Hochschulen (universities), Lindenhof (\"lime trees courtyard\") and City. Lindenhof and Rathaus correspond to the parts of the medieval city left (west) and right (east) of the Limmat, respectively, while City and Hochschulen include the area of the Early Modern city west and east of the medieval walls, respectively.\n\n\n== Lindenhof ==\n\nDer Lindenhof (\"The lime trees courtyard\") quarter corresponds to the mindere Stadt, the smaller but more prestigious half of the medieval town left of the river. This is the oldest core of the city, with settlement traces dating to pre-Roman (La T\u00e8ne) times, and fortified as the Roman Vicus Turicum, a Roman customs station with a surrounding civilian settlement, in the final decades of the 1st century BC.\nThe Lindenhof hill itself is the site of the Roman castle at the location of the Celtic Oppidum Z\u00fcrich-Lindenhof, rebuilt in Carolingian times but derelict by the 13th century, when it was used as a source for building stone for the first stone houses of rich burghers of the recently reichsfrei city. The Schipfe quarter at the Limmat below the Lindenhof is the site of the Roman vicus, with traces of a hypocaustum nearby the M\u00fcnsterhof excavated. St. Peter church was the parish church of the medieval city, built on the site of an earlier temple to  Jupiter.\nThe Rennweg street below the Lindenhof hill was the main street of the medieval city, entering by the Rennweg gate through the western city wall which is now marked by the course of Bahnhofstrasse. Augustinergasse is a small street leading from St. Peterhofstatt situated at the St. Peter church, passing the former Augustinians monastery below the Lindenhof hill, towards the Kecinst\u00fcrlin gate at the southern Fr\u00f6schengraben moat, Bahnhofstrasse as of today.\nZunfthaus zur Meisen at M\u00fcnsterhof plaza near Fraum\u00fcnster church houses the porcelain and faience collection of the Swiss National Museum. Lindenhof also contains the former Augustinian abbey, and formerly the Oetenbach nunnery north of the Lindenhof hill, demolished in 1903 to make way for the Uraniastrasse as part the partially built \u00abUrania-axis\u00bb Sihlporte\u2013Uraniastrasse\u2013Z\u00e4hringerplatz by Gustav Gull, and the Urania Sternwarte.\n\n\n=== Fraum\u00fcnster ===\n\nThe Fraum\u00fcnster (\"women's minster\") abbey ruled the town until the 1336 \"guild revolution\" of Rudolf Brun and which remained highly influential until Zwingli's Reformation.\n\n\n== Rathaus ==\n\nThe Rathaus quarter is named for the town hall, built in the 1690s.\nIt is the part of the medieval town on the right side of the Limmat,  separated by the Hirschengraben from the Hochschulen quarter to the east, and delimited by the Bellevue and Central squares to the south and north, respectively. As such, it includes the Limmatquai as well as the Niederdorf (downstream of the Kirchgasse) and the Oberdorf (upstream of the Kirchgasse). The historical name of this eastern half of the medieval town was \"greater town\" (mehrere Stadt), contrasting with the \"lesser town\" (mindere Stadt), the western half along the left river bank.\n\n\n=== Limmatquai ===\n\nThe Limmatquai was built along the right side of the Limmat, running from Central to Bellevue. It was built in the 19th century, connecting various earlier quais built into the Limmat. The current right bank is some 28 m west of the medieval river's. The quai was constructed from 1823\u20131859 from Bellevue to the Rathaus, in 1835\u20131836 from the Rathaus to the Wasserkirche and 1835\u20131839 the portion from the Wasserkirche to Bellevue, formerly called Sonnenquai. At the Limmatquai are located some guild houses, as Zunfthaus zur Zimmerleuten, Zunfthaus zur Haue, Zunfthaus zum R\u00fcden and Zunfthaus zur Saffran.\nZ\u00fcrich tram routes 4 and 15 run along the Limmatquai, serving the stops Helmhaus, Rathaus and Rudolf-Brun-Br\u00fccke. The quai was one of the main routes through the old town before it was freed from traffic in 2004.\nThe bridges passed by the Limmatquai, south to north, are:\n\nQuaibr\u00fccke, connecting Bellevue and B\u00fcrkliplatz,\nM\u00fcnsterbr\u00fccke between Grossm\u00fcnster and Fraum\u00fcnster,\nRathausbr\u00fccke just north of the town hall,\nRudolf-Brun-Br\u00fccke, between M\u00fchlegasse and Uraniastrasse,\nthe M\u00fchlesteg footbridge\nBahnhofbr\u00fccke, between Central and Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof.north of Limmatquai:\n\nWalche-Br\u00fccke\nthe Drahtschmidlisteg, a footbridge to Platzspitz\n\n\n=== Niederdorf ===\nThe Niederdorf (lit.: \"low village\") was the least developed part of the medieval city. It properly includes just the north-eastern corner, between M\u00fchlegasse and Central, but the term was extended to the whole part of the mehrere Stadt north of the town hall, i.e. for the entire length of the Niederdorfstrasse, or even including the parts north of the Kirchgasse.So defined, the Niederdorf includes Rindermarkt and Neumarkt, Froschaugasse and the area of the medieval Jewish quarter, the Predigerkirche (the former Blackfriars' monastery) at Z\u00e4hringerplatz (historically the city hospital, now housing the city library) and the Z\u00e4hringerstrasse.\n\n\n=== M\u00fcnstergasse ===\nThe mehrere Stadt between the Niederdorf and the Oberdorf (between Rathaus and Kirchgasse) includes the M\u00fcnstergasse, Obere Z\u00e4une, Untere Z\u00e4une and the Barf\u00fcsserkloster (the former Franciscan abbey) as well as a number of alleys leaving M\u00fcnstergasse:  Marktgasse, Spiegelgasse, Krebsgasse, Ankengasse, R\u00f6mergasse and Kirchgasse.\n\n\n=== Grossm\u00fcnster ===\n\n\n=== Predigerkirche ===\n\nInitially the church of the Predigerkloster (Dominican monastery), it became after the Reformation in Switzerland the parish church of Niederdorf respectively Neumarkt, and owns since 1900 the tallest church tower of Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n=== Oberdorf ===\nThe Oberdorf (lit.: \"upper village\") proper is the mehrere Stadt south of the Grossm\u00fcnster, along the Oberdorfstrasse, between Kirchgasse and R\u00e4mistrasse.\n\n\n== Hochschulen ==\n\nHochschulen (universities) is wedged between Hirschengraben (the historical course of the eastern moat) and R\u00e4mistrasse, corresponding to the area taken up by the eastern fortifications of the 17th century ramparts (destroyed following the 1839 Z\u00fcriputsch), the hillside now holding the main buildings of both ETH Zurich (built 1861 to 1864 under Gustav Zeuner) and University of Zurich (built 1914 under Karl Moser), at the sites of the Kronen Bollwerk and Sch\u00f6nenberg Bollwerk ramparts, respectively. Hochschulen borders on District 6 (Unterstrass and Oberstrass) to the north, on District 7 (Fluntern and Hottingen) to the east and on District 8 (M\u00fchlebach) and Seefeld) to the south.\nHochschulen in its southern end also includes the Bellevue and Sechsel\u00e4uten squares as well as the theater and opera house at Stadelhoferplatz and the Stadelhofen train station. Stops of the Z\u00fcrich tram system in the Hochschulen quarter are: Central, ETH/Universit\u00e4tsspital, Kantonsschule, Kunsthaus, Neumarkt, Bellevue, Opernhaus and Stadelhofen. Line 9 follows  R\u00e4mistrasse which separates Hochschulen from Fluntern, line 3 follows Hirschengraben and Seilergraben (the historical eastern moat), which separates it from the Rathaus quarter. The Polybahn funicular connects Central and the ETH Zurich main building.\n\n\n=== Central ===\nThe Central square at the northern border between Rathaus and Hochschulen quarters is a major junction of the Z\u00fcrich tram system, served by lines 3, 4, 6, 7, 10 and 15 besides buses 31 and 46. Formerly called Leonhardsplatz, it was renamed after the Hotel Central built in 1883.\n\n\n=== Pfauen ===\nSituated at Heimplatz, vernacularly called the Pfauen, are the theatre Schauspielhaus Z\u00fcrich and the art museum Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n=== Bellevue ===\n\nThe Bellevueplatz, a square at the southern border between the Rathaus quarter and the southern end of the Hochschulen quarter, right next to the lake outflow, is a major junction of the Z\u00fcrich tram system, served by lines 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 15 besides buses 912 and 916. It is situated at the lakeside, just north of Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz. It is named for the Grandhotel Bellevue built in 1856, and is the nodal point of the quaysides that were built between 1881 and 1887 crossing the Quaibr\u00fccke towards B\u00fcrkliplatz and General-Guisan-Quai.\n\n\n=== Stadelhofen ===\nSouth of Bellevue are the squares Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz and Stadelhofenplatz. Stadelhofen was an estate just south of the southeastern-most bastion, the Stadelhofen Bollwerk, whilst Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz takes its name from the Sechsel\u00e4uten, a traditional Z\u00fcrich festival that is celebrated there.\nStadelhofen station, on Stadelhofenplatz, is an important stop of the Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn lines to Uster, Rapperswil-Jona and Winterthur as well as the terminal of the Forchbahn (S18) line serving Zumikon and Esslingen. The Z\u00fcrich Opera House is situated at the southern end of the Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz.\n\n\n== City ==\nCity is the area west of the Bahnhofstrasse, delimited by the Sihl and the Schanzengraben, the moat of the 17th century ramparts. It includes the Paradeplatz, Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof, the Swiss National Museum and the Platzspitz park (formerly Limmatspitz). It comprises the tram stops B\u00fcrkliplatz, Paradeplatz, Rennweg, Bahnhofstrasse / Bahnhofplatz / Bahnhofquai, L\u00f6wenplatz, Sihlstrasse and Bahnhof Selnau. City borders on District 2 (Enge) to the southwest, and on Districts 4 and 5 (Aussersihl) to the northwest.\n\n\n=== Platzspitz ===\n\nPlatzspitz (formerly Platzpromenade, Limmatspitz) is a park at the confluence of the two rivers of Z\u00fcrich; the Limmat and the Sihl.\nIn medieval times, the area situated north of the city was used as pasture. In the early 15th century it was made into a shooting-range, and in the 16th to 17th centuries, Sch\u00fctzenfeste were held there. A remnant of these can be found in the contemporary Knabenschiessen shooting contest.\nDuring the 1990s, the long-practised official tolerance of drug users there from throughout Central Europe has been the subject of much worldwide media interest.\n\n\n=== Hauptbahnhof ===\n\n\n=== Bahnhofstrasse ===\n\n\n=== B\u00fcrkliplatz ===\n\nB\u00fcrkliplatz is a square and stop of the Z\u00fcrich tram system (lines 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and buses 161, 165), situated at the southern end of the Bahnhofstrasse, and west of the Bellevue square, with which it is connected by the Quaibr\u00fccke. The lakeshore quay connecting the square with Lake Zurich is named General-Guisan-Quai, after Henri Guisan.

        "wiki": "The Chinese Garden (German: Chinagarten Z\u00fcrich) is a chinese garden in the Swiss city of Z\u00fcrich. It is a gift from Z\u00fcrich's Chinese partner town Kunming, dedicated to the Three Friends of Winter.\n\n\n== Location and history ==\nZ\u00fcrich's Chinese garden is located in the city's Seefeld quarter, next to the Pavillon Le Corbusier between Blatterwiese and Bellerivestrasse and near to the Z\u00fcrichhorn peninsula on the right shore of Z\u00fcrichsee. Ending winter season, the garden will be opened on March 18 to October 18, daily from 11:00 (am) to 19:00 (7 pm), even on Sundays and public holidays. Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich tram lines 2 and 4, together with bus line 33, serve nearby stops at H\u00f6schgasse or Fr\u00f6hlichstrasse, whilst bus lines 912 and 916 run from Bellevue to Chinagarten.\nThe garden is a gift by Z\u00fcrich's Chinese partner town Kunming, as thanks for Z\u00fcrich's technical and scientific assistance in the development of the Kunming city drinking water supply and drainage. From May to October 1993, it was built under the direction of the Z\u00fcrich garden department, in cooperation by garden experts and craftsmen from Kunming and Z\u00fcrich, paid by Z\u00fcrich city administration. Its official inauguration was in spring 1994, under participation of the now former mayor of Kunming City and Z\u00fcrich's Josef Estermann. As from 2010 maintenance and operation are provided by Gr\u00fcn Stadt Z\u00fcrich, the City of Z\u00fcrich's Office of Parks and Open Spaces being a service of the Civil Engineering and Waste Management Department.\n\n\n== Landscaping and buildings ==\n\nThe garden covers an exactly rectangular terrain, surrounded by a low wall. Its central element is a pond with a small island.\nThe surrounding wall separates the outer mundane world from art, an ideal microcosm in the garden inside \u2013 offers protection against unwanted visitors, too. The wall has on three sides windows, with barred bamboo and lotus flower tiles. Eaves and final bricks as well as the frieze bear small sculptural figures, representing the Chinese dragon of clouds. Wall corners and wall's top adorns the second of the nine dragon sons, Chiwen dragon.\nThe main portal (entrance) is emblazoned with a calligraphy on a golden plate, meaning China Garden. Nine nail rows and the red color of the gate originally were reserved for the emperor. In China's Yunnan province, for 300 years they have been an essential architectural element of garden plants. The second door was originally named the second-last gate of the Imperial Court's inner rooms. The carved panels on both sides, are excerpts from Chinese tales. The artificial mountain represents the meaning of landscape \u2013 \u00abMountain und Water\u00bb \u2013 and is contrasting Yin and Yang. Rock formations are the bones in the body, focusing the garden. They also are sharing space and draw the viewer's gaze.\nA bridge is connecting the pavilion's island and the inner garden, reminding the island of immortals. The circular pavilion embodies the middle, and so the fifth cardinal direction in the culture of China. His inscriptions refer to the water as a symbol of friendship between the cities of Kunming and Z\u00fcrich. The hectagon pavilion suggests lofty heights and snow drift in winter. His carvings are full of allegories: Phoenix as symbol of empress, and flowers as well as a symbol of female beauty. The pavilion's inside is showing symbols of good luck and landscapes. A square pavilion forms the entrance to the galleries and to the water palace. Its entrance shows two golden Phoenix'. A carved archway is devoted to the spring, a magpie and plum blossoms announce the newly waked life. Open galleries are adorned by more than 500 still lifes and landscapes. Its carved arche beams are a particular feature of the gardens of Yunnan. A short  winding path symbolizes abundance and harmony.\nThe water palace is the heart of the Chinese garden. The painting of its exterior walls, doors and windows is deliberately kept simple, so that visitors are able to concentrate to the inner qualities of the building. Its terrace opens to the water surface, showing all important elements of the garden, its rear garden is called garden of shadows.\n\n\n== Plants and water world ==\nThe garden is an expression of one of the main themes of Chinese culture, the \u00abThree Friends of Winter\u00bb \u2013 three plants that together brave the cold season \u2013 pine, bamboo and plum blossom. The inscriptions and paintings point to the uniqueness of the culture of Yunnan and its influences from various ethnic groups. Trees and flowers represent the source of feelings and aspirations. In Z\u00fcrich's Chinese garden, the local poplars are integrated in the overall design. The pond is lined with willows, as symbol of pure water and holyness. Also important are four ginkgos between the open gallery and the northern wall. Bamboo is representing a forest, with its deep unique sound when wind is blowing. Pine symbolizes the male principle among the trees and a long life. The \u00abThree Friends of Winter's\u00bb third part is the plum blossom, beginning to bloom in late winter, and therefore a joyful symbol of spring.\nWater is the central element, as a symbol of friendship between Kunming and Zurich. Entering the garden, the pond opens our view to all important elements of the garden.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChinagarten Z\u00fcrich on City of Z\u00fcrich administration website\nPanoramics and further information on swisspanorams.ch\n3D Google Earth model of pavilion.",

          "Established as a symbol for the city partnership with Kinming, the Chinese Garden was built in Chinese quality, and therefore it was and is closed half of the time, as there is always something to be repaired. I prefer the park area around.",

          "Currently under construction. Nice that the fee is reduced from 4 CHF to 1 CHF during construction. Nice coy ponds and pagodas next to a pretty park and not far from Lake Zurich. Took us only 30 min or less to get thru. Not a must see but neat attraction",

          "This is one of the best attractions in Zurich. When we went the building was currently under construction, I would imagine that after they are finished they would be beautiful. This is a great place to read or just sit and stare.",
          "Lovely peaceful garden on the lake promenade. Unfortunately renovations where taking place on one section and it was unsightly. However the atmosphere of the rest was nice. Don't think its worth the entrance fee to see as it is a small walled in garden but then you don't know",
          "The Chinese garden is right next to the Eastern Bank of Lake Z\u00fcrich. It is rather small, but very pretty and if you want to have a minute of reflection in a quiet place, this is the place to come. We were charged one Swiss franc per person to enter and spent about half an hour",
          "A peaceful and reflective spot to walk around. It isn't very big but it only cost 2CF to enter. Unfortunately some renovations were taking place during our visit but this didn't distract too much from the pretty water garden. You're likely to only spend 15-20mins here but worth",
          "Whilst on our boat tour we stopped off at one of the stops to check out the Chinese Garden, you have to pay 4 francs entry but in my opinion the garden is nice but I don't think it requires an entrance fee as you can see the whole attraction within 10 minutes.",

          "The chinese garden is amazing! It is not very big, but it is well preserved. There is a lake with fish and some chinese structures. The price is 4 CHF, but because of the fact that two exhibits are under construction, the price is 1CHF. Go there on foot, the view and the walk",
          "We walked to the Chinese Gardens from the main city center near Neiderdorf where we stayed. The walk took us a bit longer since our son wanted to stop every few steps and play with the next thing catching his attention! We decided against paying to enter the Chinese garden",
          "It was refreshing to find a full Chinese garden in Zurich - with a pond with goldfish, chinese bridge and bamboo! Although it was under construction, we enjoyed the stroll on a beautiful sunny day. The ticket (reduced price) attendant was very nice and gave us some tips",

          "I am new in Zurich and found the Chinese Garden randomly when i was exploring my new neighbourhood. It really reminds me of a park back home and therefore i love it :)",

          "Had higher expectations and upon entry did not see but only a few trees, virtually no gardening landscape and structures under construction. Even though entry was only 4fr, it was not worth admittance.",

          "The walk along the lake from the center of town was easy and the views great. It was half price because of work on the buildings. Even wth the buildings there was not much to see. We read that the average visit was 1.5 hours. It is more like a short half hour, even without",
          "Major rehabilitation was in progress within the garden, and we were advised of this at the ticket booth. With the scaffolding on some of the buildings, getting around is a bit difficult and you can't enter all that's there. Rehabilitation will go on for quite a while, and you",
          "Beautiful chinese garden present from Nanjing to Zurich.Entrance fee but worths the money.Very relaxing and there is also a small chinese restaurant.",

          "This garden is quite small and was undergoing some repairs when we were there so the main pavilion was covered in scaffolding. However, we were able to enjoy the beauty of the buildings. The area round this garden is a very average park along the lakeside. We took a pleasant",

          "If you are familiar with Zurich or have an extra few hours- take the tram (or a boat) to the Chinese gardens - the plants and flowers are unique and the inside (costs 4 Euros) reminds you of a lovely garden in the far east.",
          "The garden is smaller than we expected but it is very unique and beautiful. Unfortunately part of the buildings were under construction. Too bad.",
          "A beautiful garden to walk around and take pictures. Despite being being refurbished, the garden was immaculate. Well worth it and recommend it.",
          "Nicely designed Chinese garden. Part of it was being repaired when we were there. Lots of pretty photo opportunities. Small entrance fee.",
          "Very cute little garden a little bit away from the old town. The walk from the old town is about 20min along the lake. Not great food options in the garden and it's very small but well worth the trip!",
          "After a walk along the lake, a visit to the peaceful gardens was most welcome! The gardens are beautifully maintained. It was a pity we already had had lunch as I would have liked to try their food. An hour well spent!",
          "We missed getting some views due construction/refurbishment work. There were still lovely views. A few things you might care about: -It's a bit small, but what is there is well done. -We spent 4 CHF (about $4) each to see it. Considering the cost of things in this city, that",
          "Maybe I expected too much but this garden is really nothing special. When we were there half of the place was under construction and we still had to pay full price. If you are a reeeeeally big fan of Chinese architecture and culture there is kind of a possibility you might enjoy",
          "At first I put 1 hour in my plan to visit Chinese garden but I found that it's small and only 10 minutes to discover it but what I like the most is the receptionist, his name is (Jyon) hope spelling is correct :) . He was lovely and so helpful. He told me about places to visit",

          "Nice and quiet place, good for reading and escape from city crowd. You feel like you are in different place when you are in garden, there is a fish pond and couple of interesting houses with benches in front where you can sit and enjoy. Unfortunately you must pay 4 CHF to enter.",
          "We spent quite a while here as there was a lot to see and they are regarded as one of the top Chinese gardens in the world. We were most impressed with the set-up.",
          "It looked very beautiful from the outside, but unfortunately it was closed when we arrived. very different and lovely.",
          "As an attraction in itself the Chinese garden is quite modest. But the great thing is that there's a fantastic park next to it with a big meadow right next to the lake which is particularly great in summer. There is also one of the best children playgrounds in Zurich next to it.",

          "It's a nice little place. It's very cute and worth it. You can enjoy it there. The Koi fishes are typical and great as well :-)",
          "Not much things to see but it is still cute. The most interesting for me was to see white-orange-grey fishes up close from the lake. There is also nice Chinese snack-bar inside.",
          "A wonderful garden with lots of nice stillebens, wonderful to walk around and look at all the details. Peace for the mind.",
          "located on the lakeside, walking out of town from Bellevue, this little Chinese garden lays in the larger green area going along the lake. At a sunny day, you will find hundreds of people sunbathing and swimming in front of the Chinese garden - a view maybe as interesting as the",
          "Nice little garden with a Chinese motif. Small, and good for a walk with the kids, taking pictures, and resting for a few minutes. There's a small pond as well. There's a small cafe there too. Nothing to go out of your way for. But the shoreside of lake Zurich just opposite to",
          "We visited in Spring so it was pretty with the blossoms. We spent about an hour relaxing in the gardens and taking photos. There is a small entrance fee and a cafe.",
          "Very nice ornamental garden. Yes it's small, but it don't think 4 francs is much to pay and my children loved it. We also had lunch at the small cafe there, which I believe is only open in good weather.",
          "A good impression of a chinese garten and it is really well maintained. However, it is so small that the fee paid is not worth visiting this park. Outside the park you can sit on several bench and enjoy the view of the lake.",
          "A gift to the city. The bus stops right there and a walk through the park back to the ferry is very easy and a nice way to end the trip. Garden is small but neat.",
          "Interesting, but not spectacular, short visit. Kind of primitive, but surprising in Zurich. Periodically renewed Chinese wooden buildings, fences",
          "The garden is nice but very very small and I was really expecting more colorful floral landscape. There were no blooming flowers at all. It would be better if there is light Chinese music especially in the pagodas. It is right next to a large beautiful park beside the lake.",
          "The Chinese gardens right by the lake are absolutely gorgeous . A very authentic reproduction of a typical classical Chinese garden. The flora is gorgeous and the buildings pay very close attention to authenticity. Well worth the visit and a surprising treat to discover in",
          "we paid 4 Swiss Franc each to enter the garden! Seriously Zurich? It is truly a waste money and time, a small garden with a pond and cheap Chinese architecture. I was disappointed, the views outside the garden on the lake and mountains and the beautiful scenery worth much more",
          "Reasonable representation of a Chinese garden and fairly priced at 4 francs. Nicely shaded and tranquil, though you can hear the busy road nearby. Also, right next to it is a large kids play area.",
          "Even on rainy days, the Chinese Garden offers a peaceful oasis in Z\u00fcrich. The covered walkways and pagodas offered shelter from the summer rain while I was visiting, and due to the dreary weather, I was alone in the park with the koi, goldfish and the grey heron who likes to",
          "I was visiting A friend in Zurich having lived here for 2 years and never made it to the Chinese gardens, so thought we would visit. I was expecting it to be bigger than it was and a little more tranquil, however it is right next to a road with passing traffic. It's very",
          "This garden is small, but beautiful. It is worth the CHF 4 entrance. Many may say this is just a garden, but I disagree, maybe because we visited it in a sunny and warm afternoon where all the garden's colors explode in your face. It is so peaceful that makes you sit down and",
          "It is a wonderful peaceful place almost in the city center. I found it really unexpected, so it was amazing. You can feel a small peace of culture of china.",
          "We visited it on the last day of our stay in Zurich. Once inside, it seems like another place, another world. The place beautifully showcases China and attempts to present its culture to the people. The effect of the red and golden colors is mesmerizing. It is picture perfect.",
          "This attraction is located at the Zurichhorn area on the western (gold coast) side of Zurich lake and just north of Bahnhof Tiefbrunnen. Access with public transport on Tram lines #2 and #4, bus lines #33,#912 and #916 then walking a couple of blocks. Hours of operation of",
          "It was such a pleasant surprise when I passed by and saw this familiar architecture in the heart of Zurich! It is quite small yet very well taken care of. Only 4 CHF the entrance per adult and you get to enter another world in the middle of the city. After the visit you can",

          "I found this place expensive and not particularly interesting. Considering it was a gift to the city i would expect it to have a token entrance fee to cover costs, but that idea doesnt exist in Switzerland. The gardens are nice but the view over each is ruined by the path full",

          "It was nice, but I have seen nicer. Best part is that location is great, being so close to the Zurichsee. There is a big park for kids right next to it where you can sit and relax and look at the water.",
          "We walked over 2 miles to get to this place only to find a small concrete cubical with a pond, some rocks, and oriental gazebo. It was 4 CHF to enter which wasn't worth it and everything can be seen in the garden in a matter of minutes. The inside looked cheap and dirty!",
          "Beautiful gardens built by specialists from China, a wonderful place to relax away from the bustle of an international city. I repeatedly come here to simply enjoy watching the fish and feel the atmosphere of the place.",

          "the China Garden is a nice place to go and relax and meditiate.",
          "This is a small enclosed garden right by the lakeside. Nominal admission fee. Fun with smaller kids because it's walled and you can let them run around a bit. Can be a quiet retreat when the lakeside is full of people in the summer.",

An early church of 10 by 7 metres is archaeologically attested for the 8th or 9th century. This building was replaced by an early Romanesque church around AD 1000, in turn replaced in 1230 by a late romanesque structure, parts of which survive. Rudolf Brun, first independent mayor of the town, was buried here in 1360. The nave was rebuilt in 1460 in Gothic style. Prior to the Reformation, St. Peter was the only parish church of the town, the rest being part of monasteries. The first reformed pastor, Leo Jud (1523-1542), was a friend of Zwingli and contributed to the first translation of the Bible in Zurich. Johann Kaspar Lavater was pastor from 1778-1801. His gravestone can be seen in the church wall. Theologian Adolf Keller served as pastor 1909 -1924.\nThe current building was consecrated in 1706 as the first church built under Protestant rule. Its congregation forms part of the Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich. Until 1911, the steeple was manned by a fire watch. Restoration work was carried out in 1970 to 1975. The steeple's clock face has a diameter of 8.7 m, the largest church clock face in Europe. The bells date to 1880.\nPeculiarly, the church's steeple is owned by the city of Z\u00fcrich, while the nave is owned by the St. Peter parish of the Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n== Church tower and largest church clock of Europe ==\nThe church tower and the nave of St. Peter do not have the same owner: Until the French Revolution the tower belonged to the former city republic of Z\u00fcrich, since 1803 to the city of Z\u00fcrich. Belfry and bells belong to the Reformed Church of the canton of Z\u00fcrich, as well as the staircase leading to the tower.The church tower was primarily used for fire police duties, and 1340 AD the first fire guard was set in duty. In the pre- and early Romanesque area, St. Peter had no church tower, i.e. the first massive three-storey tower was built in early 13th century AD. The first floor with Romanesque ribbed vault dates back to that period. In 1450 the tower was increased to 64 metres (210 ft) (as of today) and a pitched (helmet) roof was attached. That 24 metres (79 ft) high part of the tower was in 1996 re-covered with 42,000 larch shingles from the Engadine valley, since then being the only wooden roof in Z\u00fcrich.Towards the end of the 13th century a mechanical church clock was installed. In 1366 it was renewed and got one only dial that was directed towards the Limmat and only displayed the hours. Around 1460, the sense of time has been refined by half on the quarter-hour strike, and in 1538 the striking clock was replaced, and all four facades got dials. Replacements of the clock mechanism followed in 1593/94 and 1675 and 1826. In 1844 a new movement with quarter-hour strike was installed; the electrification of the work was carried out in 1873. In 1972 the balance was replaced by a fully automatic master clock in the clock room of the St. Peter's tower, and  in 1996 the electrified mechanical movement of 1844 was shut down and replaced by a central computer system. The clock tower of St. Peter was for centuries Z\u00fcrich's 'official local time', and all public city clocks had to conform to it. The church clock of St. Peter has the largest tower clock face in Europe, the outer diameter of each of the four church clocks measures 8.64 metres (28.3 ft), the minute hand 5.73 metres (18.8 ft), the hour hand 5.07 metres (16.6 ft), and the minute crack of the large pointer measures 0.455 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n== Pipe organ ==\nThe pipe organ was installed in 1974 by M\u00fchleisen Manufacture d\u00b4orgues from Strasbourg. It was revised in 1992, 1994 and 1997.\n\nThe slider chests instrument has 52 registers on three manuals and 32 pedals.\n\n\n== St. Peterhofstatt ==\nAround the 1st century BC La T\u00e8ne culture, archaeologists excavated individual and aerial finds of the Celtic-Helvetii oppidum Lindenhof, whose remains were discovered in archaeological campaigns in the years 1989, 1997, 2004 and 2007 on Lindenhof, M\u00fcnsterhof and Rennweg-Augustinergasse, and also in the 1900s, but the finds mistakenly were identified as Roman objects. Not yet archaeological proven but suggested by the historians, as well for the first construction of the today's M\u00fcnsterbr\u00fccke Limmat crossing, the present Weinplatz square was the former civilian harbour of the Celtic-Roman Turicum.Assumed to be the oldest parish church of Z\u00fcrich, St. Peterhofstatt is St. Peter's adjoint plaza, analogously meaning the royal court at St. Peter.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Literature ==\nPeter Ziegler: St. Peter in Z\u00fcrich.

          "While it certainly has great history, like member Rudolf Brun who established the Guild system in Zurich, it lacks the significant importance of the Grossmunster or Fraumunster. However don't skip, because this is beautiful Swiss church with an amazing story. Of the big 4",

          "My main reasons for liking this church are (i) it overlooks a lovely little square in the Old Town and (ii) it has interesting concerts with good acoustics. Over the centuries the church interior has been stripped of any aesthetic interest. It's now a rather dull, severe hall.",

          "My husband and I enjoyed a lovely walk around this lovely old church. Both inside and out. It gives you a sense of how really small we all are in the face of this world and it\u2019s magnificent history! We were self guided... but, we were able to figure things out well enough.",
          "Long history drawn back to somewhat before 10th century and went through different times, situations and settings to be finally to be in this current condition. It has the largest church clock in Europa, start with one only facing the river, and then gradually all four tower",

          "Until the 20th century,this tower was manned as a fire watch. Inside is very peaceful and quiet. Clock tower can be seen from everywhere in Zurich.",
          "The tower looks pretty from outside- you could go inside for free and it looked more like a concert hall than a church on the inside.",
          "St. Peters is probably most attractive for its clock tower and carved wood inside, but it contains no stained glass, so don't go inside looking for that alone. It is old and majestic though, so for that reason alone it is worth a visit.",
          "No one was there when I walked in, so I thought I was doing something wrong. it was nice to be able to walk around with no one there and reflect alone. Not very elaborate inside, but has its own beauty with the woodwork and stone. The clock is quite large when you see it up",
          "Clock's great. Pretty, but very plain. And that's ok. It's on a little hill that is very pretty up there with a couple of old, old restaurants that looked enticing. It's fine if you have the time, because you will spend almost no time there and it's very close to Fraumunster",
          "Didn\u2019t know that the biggest face clock in Europe can be admired in Zurich! I found out interesting legends about it and it is really impressive big when you stand just next to the tower! The little square in front of it is lovely as well!",

          "The St. peters church is located just behind the Fraumuster church. The church is said to have the largest clock tower, but we didn't find it to be that big and attractive like the Fraumuster's clock tower.",
          "Lovely exterior, had the largest clock face of the 4 churches in Zurich. Inside is not your usual church/cathedral architecture so could be dissappointing. Lots of musical performances take place here",

          "On our way to the Lidenhofplatz, we visited the 3rd of the main churches of Zurich. St Peter\u2019s church is easily recognizable because of its huge clock. The clock face measures 8.7 meters in diameter. From ground level, it does not appear this huge. After admiring the tower",
          "I'm not sure this church is a \"must do\", certainly not compared to other intricately detailed cathedrals that dot the Swiss / European landscape.",
          "We happened to arrived when a choir did an impromptu song. Made our day. It's free and well worth a visit. For every minute the large hand of the clock moves 45cm on the diameter. Inside the church has good proportions and some amazing wooden carvings.",
          "Well worth visiting, for the peaceful calm interior, note photographs not permitted inside. A simple plain interior beautiful stained glass windows and impressive pipe organ.",
          "Sankt Peter is claiming to sport the largest dial of a church or spire clock in Europe; of course our British friends cannot let this small triumph be in our hands, they claim that Big Bens clock in London may sport a dial with some centimeters larger dial but never the less",
          "When we arrived we could not get in as services were going on. However we waited and were glad we did. The beautiful openness and wood were wonderful to see. The tolling of the bells was fantastic.",
          "We had the opportunity to hear a beautiful organ concert here. The inside of the church is rather simple with very few decorations, but the outside boasts a beautiful large clock. This is definitely a beautiful church and for organ concerts it's magnificent",
          "The church was not open when we were there. But the clock tower is so big that you can see it from anywhere in the old town. This alone is worth seeing. The old town is beautiful, but as most cities in Switzerland, very expensive to visit. Switzerland has an incredible Christian",
          "The highlight here is stained glass so go when the sun is positioned to optimize the light streaming from river side. i think that would be morning hours. The wooden interior is nice as well. We also enjoyed the plaza outside with a fountain.",
          "St. Peter Church was the only church built as a parish church in Zurich and remains as it today. Unlike other church properties in Zurich, this parish church has two owners: City owns church's steeple; St. Peter, the parish church of the Evangelical Reformed Church of the Zurich",
          "The most distinctive feature of the church is without a doubt the clock face (28-feet in diameter) and tower. The building has been considerably expanded over the years; the oldest surviving vestiges are of a late Romanesque church erected in the early 13th century. The clock",
          "Amazingly huge church tower and clock. Very beautiful and definitely a money shot with your camera. Understated elegance.",

          "On the other side of Grossmunster lies St. Peterskirche, with its huge clock face gilded with gold paint. The square around it is also very nice and takes you back a couple hundred of years. Definitely a must see in Zurich.",
          "St. Peterskirche is a must see in Zurich. It's a quaint, romantic church which harkens back to yesterday. It boasts the largest clock face in Europe, so one can't really say he's late because he didn't know what time it was in Zurich.",

          "My friend told me it is the largest clock face in Europe! Worth seeing just for that. There are great views of this clock tower from anywhere in the old town. I didn't go inside, but loved how it was an unmissable feature wherever you were standing in Zurich old town!",
          "One of the four main churches/cathedrals in Zurich, St Peterskirche stands tall in the skyline. The clock face is of particular interest and is well worth a close-up look if you have time. The church is easy to find within the narrow streets of Zurich on the south side of River",
          "Not really worth going To, very dissappionting rather do other sights. Clock you can see anywhere from outside",
          "This is a beautiful building, which boasts the biggest clock face in not just Switzerland, but all of Europe! You have to give it to Swiss time-keeping! A must-see! This church is in an area with other \"must-see\" locations such as the Roman ruins of a centuries old bathhouse",
          "This is just your average Protestant church - still used today and helps add to Z\u00fcrich's skyline but nothing spectacular. There are some really nice and extravagant churches around Europe but this isn't one of them. Thankfully it's not too out of the way. Go see it, tick it off",

          "Another of the churches not to be missed in Zurich. Very quiet and spacious with an unusual pulpit. The style inside is very simple but charming. I liked the large vases of sunflowers inside.",
          "Very nice church to visit and a short walking distance from river and lake Zurich. There are other churches in area worth to visit.",

          "So magical and so whimsical!! its located by the river with Old town on one part and the modern on the other. Just magical and a good walking tour is much needed!!!",
          "We walked from our hotel room to this church and ended up on the downhill entrance (courtesy of Google Maps), getting read to walk away when we noticed a small plaque on the wall showing the entrance on the uphill side. Great work :( Zurich tourism authority. We walked around",
          "Compared to some of the other churches in Zurich this is rather underwhelming. The renovations that were undertaken make this church feel like an opulent hotel room rather than a place of worship.",

          "This church is really a landmark of Zurich, second only to the Grossmunster, due to its very prominent clock tower - visible and recognisable from almost everywhere in the centre, a bit like the Tour Eiffel in Paris. The tower stands out because of the much lower surrounding",

          "From many places in Zurich you cannot miss the large and imposing clock face which the guide books claim to be the oldest in Europe. Up close it has even more presence and in the tiny space before it is a quite place free of cars and hustle and bustle so a great space for a",

          "The oldest parish church in Zurich, the inside is plain and stark, but the attraction is the outside clock, the biggest in Europe. Still worth visiting and spending some quiet minutes inside.",
          "Unlike downtown Zurich eg Bahnhoffstrasse/Paradeplatz, the old town has no cars or trams, so for that reason is peaceful. This church is on top of hill in the centre of the old town. The hill or area around it is called Lindenhof and is a park full of trees. From one side of it",

          "Just go in as part of the stroll through the old town. Otherwise, there's really nothing particular about the church. Maybe they should let people climb the tower.",

          "I didn't go inside. I am only commenting on the large clock face. St. Peter or St. Peter's Kirche has a clock face of over 26 feet big. It is very interesting up close, but it is more beautiful across the river. It is a quick walk from the trainstation. If you are walking",
          "The very own experience of getting to the church is interesting, as it makes you roam around alleys and narrow passages to get there (naturally, depending on where you start). It is in the heart of Zurich, surrounded by typical houses and squares with trees (two squares, one at",

          "this does is not to compare with the 2 other major churches but it is pretty in itself and its an cute quaint area. St. Peters has usually a fair amount of concerts and they are always incredible with the acoustic and should be seen. So when in town check and see what is",

        "wiki": "The Rieterpark is a park in central Zurich, Switzerland. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 19th century it was bought by the German merchant Otto Wesendonck in an independent municipality near Zurich. Through the well-known architect Leonhard Zeugheer, he established the Villa Wesendonck and hired the gardener Theodor Froebel to design the extensive park and gardens. \nAs a great patron of the arts, the Wesendoncks granted the house to Richard Wagner in 1849. Wagner had an affair there with Mathilde Wesendonck and finished in 1858 when he fled from Zurich. In 1871, the Wesendoncks eventually sold the mansion to the industrialist Rieter family along with the park grounds. After the death of Adolf Rieter Rotpletz  in 1882, he left it to his son Fritz Rieter. Alfred Friedrich Bluntschli was hired to develop part of the property. In 1912, the German Emperor William II stayed several days at the villa as a guest. In 1887 Fritz Rieter further extended the property, with farm buildings and an orangery created by Adolf Brunner.\nIn 1945, after a referendum on the matter, the city of Zurich bought a 68,000 m2 large area of Rieterpark and Villa Wesendonck for 2.9 million francs from the Rieter family. Through a popular decision in 1949, the Villa Wesendonck was renovated and became a museum for non-European culture. Baron Eduard von der Heydt of the City of Zurich, donated and led to the establishment of the Rietberg Museum in 1952. This was extended in 2007.\nThe park has a notable pond and fountain and is used for classical concerts and theater.\nOn 26 December 1999 parts of the park were severely damaged by hurricane Lothar.\n\n\n== See also ==\nVilla Wesendonck\nRietberg Museum\nBelvoirpark\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStadt Zuerich website",

        "wiki": "Cabaret Voltaire was the name of an artistic nightclub in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. It was founded by Hugo Ball, with his companion Emmy Hennings, in the back room of Holl\u00e4ndische Meierei, Spiegelgasse 1, on February 5, 1916, as a cabaret for artistic and political purposes. Other founding members were Marcel Janco, Richard Huelsenbeck, Tristan Tzara, and Sophie Taeuber-Arp and Jean Arp. Events at the cabaret proved pivotal in the founding of the anarchic art movement known as Dada.\nIt closed in the summer of 1916.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSwitzerland was a neutral country during World War I and among the many refugees coming to Z\u00fcrich were artists from all over Europe. Ball and Hennings approached Ephraim Jan, patron of the Holl\u00e4ndische Meierei at Spiegelgasse 1, which had already hosted Z\u00fcrich's first literary cabaret, the Pantagruel in 1915. Jan permitted them to use the back room for events. The press release on 2 February 1916 announcing the opening of the club reads:\n\nThe Cabaret Voltaire. Under this name a group of young artists and writers has formed with the object of becoming a center for artistic entertainment. In principle, the Cabaret will be run by artists, permanent guests, who, following their daily reunions, will give musical or literary performances. Young Z\u00fcrich artists, of all tendencies, are invited to join us with suggestions and proposals.\nThe cabaret featured spoken word, dance and music. The soirees were often raucous events with artists experimenting with new forms of performance, such as sound poetry and simultaneous poetry. Mirroring the maelstrom of World War I raging around it, the art it exhibited was often chaotic and brutal. On at least one occasion, the audience attacked the cabaret's stage. Though the cabaret was to be the birthplace of the Dadaist movement, it featured artists from every sector of the avant-garde, including Futurism's Marinetti. The cabaret exhibited radically experimental artists, many of whom went on to change the face of their artistic disciplines; featured artists included Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Giorgio de Chirico, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, and Max Ernst.\nOn July 28, 1916, Ball read out the Dada Manifesto. In June, Ball had also published a journal with the same name. It featured work from artists such as the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and had a cover designed by Arp.\nThe cabaret closed down in the summer of 1916.\nWhile the Dada movement was just beginning, by 1917 the excitement generated by the cabaret Voltaire had fizzled out and the artists moved on to other places in Z\u00fcrich such as the Galerie Dada at Bahnhofstrasse 19, then later Paris and Berlin.\n\n\n== Recent events ==\n\nIn recent years, the building which had housed Cabaret Voltaire in 1916 fell into disrepair, and in the winter of 2001/2002 a group of artists describing themselves as neo-Dadaists, organised by Mark Divo, squatted the building to protest its planned closure. They declared that it was a signal for a new generation of artists to align themselves with a revival of Dada.\nOver a period of three months there was a number of performances, parties, poetry evenings and film nights. Among the participating artists were Ingo Giezendanner, Lennie Lee, Leumund Cult, Mickry3, xeno volcano, elektra sturmschnell, Aiana Calugar, and Dan Jones. The building was decorated on the outside as well as the inside. Thousands of people from around Z\u00fcrich took part in the experiment. On April 2, 2002 police evicted the occupants.\n\nA new cabaret has since opened in the building, with an extensive programme of events such as, Hugo Ball: Fuga saeculi, in 2008, curated by Bazon Brock and included a performance of Gabriella Daris' corporeal poem LopLop: WORD or WOman biRD (an homage to Max Ernst's namesake collage from 1921) as well as a film projection by Werner Nekes, and the Summer 2008 exhibition Dreamachine: David Woodard, Sheela Birnstiel, Christian Kracht.Nowadays The Cabaret Voltaire adopts personalities and celebrates them as Dadaists such as Alexander Archipenko, Tatsuo Okada or Mikhail Bakunin. They also sponsored the restoration of Bakunin's grave plate in the Bremgarten cemetery in Berne, adding a portrait by Swiss artist Daniel Garbade and Bakunin's quote: \"By striving to do the impossible, man has always achieved what is possible\".\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe electronic band  Cabaret Voltaire was named as so in reference to the club, drawing inspiration from Dadaism and incorporating it in their earliest albums.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDada and Surrealism: Texts and Extracts\nCabaret Voltaire Homepage",

        "wiki": "MuDA is the acronym of the Museum of Digital Art, is an art space dedicated to digital arts. The institute was opened in February 2016 in Zurich by the non-profit Digital Arts Association.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe MuDA project came into public spotlight in June 2015 when the founders launched a crowd sourcing campaign on Kickstarter to rise the remaining necessary funds to complete the construction works. The initiative was started by Caroline Hirt and Christian Etter, two Swiss citizens and carried out by the Digital Arts Association, also based in Zurich. It opened in February 2016.\n\n\n== Direction ==\nEach exhibition at the MuDA is dedicated to one solo artist or artist collective. It does not stage group or themed exhibitions. According to the MuDA's website is each artists chosen by an algorithm and is given as much freedom as possible to curate their own exhibition apart from two rules:\n1. Since the MuDA is a small museum (but not only because of that), its administrators believe in the \u201cless but better\u201d maxim. Exhibitions shouldn\u2019t be a clutter of things. They should instead display a carefully chosen selection of artworks, that will have space to unfold and be experienced.\n2. Technology is at its very best when it is invisible. The MuDA doesn\u2019t want to hold exhibitions where the art is only displayed on screens \u2014 visitors could just as well enjoy these contents at home. On the contrary, the MuDA encourages physical installations that appeal to multiple sensory organs.\n\n\n== Building ==\nIn 1959, the Migros Cooperative, Switzerland\u2019s largest food retailer, bought about 50,000 m2 of land on which was erected, just two years later, one of Switzerland\u2019s first high-rise building, the Herdern Hochhaus.\nThe purpose of the 58-meter tall building was to provide logistics, distribution and storage space for their food delivery chain \u2014 including a ripening hall for all the bananas that were dispatched from there to all corners of Switzerland.\nDue to its industrial historical importance, the building was classified as a listed monument in 2012. That same year, after an internal reorganization, parts of the premises were left empty and a series of vacant spaces were made available for temporary usage.\n\n\n== Funding ==\nThe MuDA's construction was partly crowd funded. The campaign raised the total amount of USD 111,111 within 30 days and hence completed the funding. Despite that the exhibition of digital arts requires less resources than conventional art, the MuDA also relies on donations and subsidies to cover its entire budget. Therefore the museum partners up with like-minded technology, engineering and design companies and institutes, as well as applies for art grants to carry out the MuDA\u2019s vision.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nBodmer, Marc (16 June 2015). \"Wenn das Programmierte Gestalt annimmt\".

          "Very small and undergoing restoration, bare, without music and with only 3 instruments to use: a digital blackboard that stores drawings, projects them on a wall and then moves digitally, a screen that is sensitive to \u2026",
          "Artworks by an artist, very simple graphics, nothing special. For me at least the CHF10 entry was not worth it.\n\n",
          "Hardly anything to offer and that for 10 CHF :(\n\n",
          "Very well. Interesting art. Polite and very dedicated museum staff, who gives a small art guide without hesitation. I will come back.\n\n",

          "Ingenious, if you are interested in digital art! The atmosphere with the staff is also very pleasant.\n\n",
          "The current Qubibi exhibition is simply not worth the money. The price of the first object is still explained in detail, but the whole exhibition seems to be more a therapeutic treatment of personal, psychological \u2026",

        "wiki": "Z\u00fcrich (Alemannic German: Z\u00fcri; French: Zurich; Italian: Zurigo; Romansh: Turitg) is the largest city in Switzerland and the capital of the canton of Z\u00fcrich. It is located in north-central Switzerland at the northwestern tip of Lake Z\u00fcrich. As of January 2020 the municipality has 434,335 inhabitants, the urban area (agglomeration) 1.315 million (2009) and the Z\u00fcrich metropolitan area 1.83 million (2011). Z\u00fcrich is a hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Both Zurich Airport and railway station are the largest and busiest in the country.\nPermanently settled for over 2,000 years, Z\u00fcrich was founded by the Romans, who, in 15 BC, called it Turicum. However, early settlements have been found dating back more than 6,400 years (although this only indicates human presence in the area and not the presence of a town that early). During the Middle Ages, Z\u00fcrich gained the independent and privileged status of imperial immediacy and, in 1519, became a primary centre of the Protestant Reformation in Europe under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli.The official language of Z\u00fcrich is German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Z\u00fcrich German.\nMany museums and art galleries can be found in the city, including the Swiss National Museum, the Kunsthaus and newer Theater 11 in Oerlikon. Schauspielhaus Z\u00fcrich is one of the most important theatres in the German-speaking world.Z\u00fcrich is among the world's largest financial centres despite having a relatively small population. The city is home to many financial institutions and banking companies. Many of Switzerland's research and development centres are concentrated in the Greater Z\u00fcrich area and the low tax rates and canton funding subsidies attract overseas companies to set up their headquarters or finance treasury services in the city.Monocle's 2012 \"Quality of Life Survey\" ranked Z\u00fcrich first on a list of the top 25 cities in the world \"to make a base within\". In 2019 Z\u00fcrich was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Geneva and Basel.\n\n\n== Name ==\nIn German, the city name is written Z\u00fcrich, and pronounced [\u02c8tsy\u02d0r\u026a\u00e7] in Swiss Standard German. In Z\u00fcrich German, the local dialect of Swiss German, the name is pronounced without the final consonant, as Z\u00fcri [\u02c8tsyri], although the adjective remains Z\u00fcrcher(in) [\u02c8tsyrx\u0259r(\u026an)]. The city is called Zurich [zy\u0281ik] in French, Zurigo [dzu\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0261o] in Italian, and Turitg [tu\u02c8rit\u0255] (listen) in Romansh.\nIn English, the name used to be written as Zurich, without the umlaut. Even so, standard English practice for German names is to either preserve the umlaut or replace it with the base letter followed by e (i.e. Zuerich). It is pronounced  ZEWR-ik, and more recently sometimes also with /ts/, as in German.The earliest known form of the city's name is Turicum, attested on a tombstone of the late 2nd century AD in the form STA(tio) TURICEN(sis) (\"Turicum tax post\").  The name is interpreted as a derivation from a given name, possibly Gaulish personal name T\u016bros, for a reconstructed native form of the toponym of *Tur\u012bcon. The Latin stress on the long vowel of the Gaulish name, [t\u028a\u02c8ri\u02d0k\u00f5\u02d0], was lost in German [\u02c8tsy\u02d0r\u026a\u00e7] but is preserved in Italian [dzu\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0261o] and in Romansh [tu\u02c8rit\u0255]. The first development towards its later, Germanic form is attested as early as the 6th century with the form Ziurichi. From the 9th century onward, the name is established in an Old High German form Zuri(c)h (857 in villa Zurih, 924 in Zurich curtem, 1416 Z\u00fcrich Stadt). In the early modern period, the name became associated with the name of the Tigurini, and the name Tigurum rather than the historical Turicum is sometimes encountered in Modern Latin contexts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nSettlements of the Neolithic and Bronze Age were found around Lake Z\u00fcrich. Traces of pre-Roman Celtic, La T\u00e8ne settlements were discovered near the Lindenhof, a morainic hill dominating the SE - NW waterway constituted by Lake Zurich and the river Limmat. In Roman times, during the conquest of the alpine region in 15 BC, the Romans built a castellum on the Lindenhof.  Later here was erected Turicum (a toponym of clear Celtic origin), a tax-collecting point for goods trafficked on the Limmat, which constituted part of the border between Gallia Belgica (from AD 90 Germania Superior) and Raetia: this customs point developed later into a vicus. After Emperor Constantine's reforms in AD 318, the border between Gaul and Italy (two of the four praetorian prefectures of the Roman Empire) was located east of Turicum, crossing the river Linth between Lake Walen and Lake Z\u00fcrich, where a castle and garrison looked over Turicum's safety. The earliest written record of the town dates from the 2nd century, with a tombstone referring to it as to the Statio Turicensis Quadragesima Galliarum (\"Z\u00fcrich post for collecting the 2.5% value tax of the Galliae\"), discovered at the Lindenhof.In the 5th century, the Germanic Alemanni tribe settled in the Swiss Plateau. The Roman castle remained standing until the 7th century. A Carolingian castle, built on the site of the Roman castle by the grandson of Charlemagne, Louis the German, is mentioned in 835 (in castro Turicino iuxta fluvium Lindemaci). Louis also founded the Fraum\u00fcnster abbey in 853 for his daughter Hildegard. He endowed the Benedictine convent with the lands of Z\u00fcrich, Uri, and the Albis forest, and granted the convent immunity, placing it under his direct authority. In 1045, King Henry III granted the convent the right to hold markets, collect tolls, and mint coins, and thus effectively made the abbess the ruler of the city.Z\u00fcrich gained Imperial immediacy (Reichsunmittelbar, becoming an Imperial free city) in 1218 with the extinction of the main line of the Z\u00e4hringer family and attained a status comparable to statehood. During the 1230s, a city wall was built, enclosing 38 hectares, when the earliest stone houses on the Rennweg were built as well. The Carolingian castle was used as a quarry, as it had started to fall into ruin.Emperor Frederick II promoted the abbess of the Fraum\u00fcnster to the rank of a duchess in 1234. The abbess nominated the mayor, and she frequently delegated the minting of coins to citizens of the city. The political power of the convent slowly waned in the 14th century, beginning with the establishment of the Zunftordnung (guild laws) in 1336 by Rudolf Brun, who also became the first independent mayor, i.e. not nominated by the abbess.\nAn important event in the early 14th century was the completion of the Manesse Codex, a key source of medieval German poetry. The famous illuminated manuscript \u2013 described as \"the most beautifully illumined German manuscript in centuries;\" \u2013 was commissioned by the Manesse family of Z\u00fcrich, copied and illustrated in the city at some time between 1304 and 1340. Producing such a work was a highly expensive prestige project, requiring several years work by highly skilled scribes and miniature painters, and it clearly testifies to the increasing wealth and pride of Z\u00fcrich citizens in this period.\n\n\n==== Archaeological findings ====\nA female who died in about 200 B.C found buried in a carved tree trunk during a construction project at the Kern school complex in March 2017 in Aussersihl. Archaeologists revealed that she was approximately 40 years old when she died and likely carried out little physical labor when she was alive. A sheepskin coat, a belt chain, a fancy wool dress, a scarf and a pendant made of glass and amber beads were also discovered with the woman.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nOn 1 May 1351, the citizens of Z\u00fcrich had to swear allegiance before representatives of the cantons of Lucerne, Schwyz, Uri and Unterwalden, the other members of the Swiss Confederacy. Thus, Z\u00fcrich became the fifth member of the Confederacy, which was at that time a loose confederation of de facto independent states. Z\u00fcrich was the presiding canton of the Diet from 1468 to 1519. This authority was the executive council and lawmaking body of the confederacy, from the Middle Ages until the establishment of the Swiss federal state in 1848. Z\u00fcrich was temporarily expelled from the confederacy in 1440 due to a war with the other member states over the territory of Toggenburg (the Old Z\u00fcrich War). Neither side had attained significant victory when peace was agreed upon in 1446, and Z\u00fcrich was readmitted to the confederation in 1450.\n\nZwingli started the Swiss Reformation at the time when he was the main preacher in the 1520s, at the Grossm\u00fcnster. He lived there from 1484 until his death in 1531. The Z\u00fcrich Bible, based on that of Zwingli, was issued in 1531. The Reformation resulted in major changes in state matters and civil life in Z\u00fcrich, spreading also to a number of other cantons. Several cantons remained Catholic and became the basis of serious conflicts that eventually led to the outbreak of the Wars of Kappel.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the Council of Z\u00fcrich adopted an isolationist attitude, resulting in a second ring of imposing fortifications built in 1624. The Thirty Years' War which raged across Europe motivated the city to build these walls. The fortifications required a lot of resources, which were taken from subject territories without reaching any agreement. The following revolts were crushed brutally. In 1648, Z\u00fcrich proclaimed itself a republic, shedding its former status of a free imperial city. In this time the political system of Z\u00fcrich was an oligarchy (Patriziat): the dominant families of the city were the following ones: Bonstetten, Brun, B\u00fcrkli, Escher vom Glas, Escher vom Luchs, Hirzel, Jori (or von Jori), Kilchsperger, Landenberg, Manesse, Meiss, Meyer von Knonau, M\u00fclner, von Orelli.\n\nThe Helvetic Revolution of 1798 saw the fall of the Ancien R\u00e9gime. Z\u00fcrich lost control of the land and its economic privileges, and the city and the canton separated their possessions between 1803\u201305. In 1839, the city had to yield to the demands of its urban subjects, following the Z\u00fcriputsch of 6 September. Most of the ramparts built in the 17th century were torn down, without ever having been besieged, to allay rural concerns over the city's hegemony. The Treaty of Z\u00fcrich between Austria, France, and Sardinia was signed in 1859.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nZ\u00fcrich was the Federal capital for 1839\u201340, and consequently, the victory of the Conservative party there in 1839 caused a great stir throughout Switzerland. But when in 1845 the Radicals regained power at Z\u00fcrich, which was again the Federal capital for 1845\u201346, Z\u00fcrich took the lead in opposing the Sonderbund cantons. Following the Sonderbund war and the formation of the Swiss Federal State, Z\u00fcrich voted in favour of the Federal constitutions of 1848 and of 1874. The enormous immigration from the country districts into the town from the 1830s onwards created an industrial class which, though \"settled\" in the town, did not possess the privileges of burghership, and consequently had no share in the municipal government. First of all in 1860 the town schools, hitherto open to \"settlers\" only on paying high fees, were made accessible to all, next in 1875 ten years' residence ipso facto conferred the right of burghership, and in 1893 the eleven outlying districts were incorporated within the town proper.\n\nExtensive developments took place during the 19th century. From 1847, the Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn, the first railway on Swiss territory, connected Z\u00fcrich with Baden, putting the Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof at the origin of the Swiss rail network. The present building of the Hauptbahnhof (the main railway station) dates to 1871. Z\u00fcrich's Bahnhofstrasse (Station Street) was laid out in 1867, and the Z\u00fcrich Stock Exchange was founded in 1877. Industrialisation led to migration into the cities and to rapid population growth, particularly in the suburbs of Z\u00fcrich.\nThe Quaianlagen are an important milestone in the development of the modern city of Z\u00fcrich, as the construction of the new lake front transformed Z\u00fcrich from a small medieval town on the rivers Limmat and Sihl to an attractive modern city on the Z\u00fcrichsee shore, under the guidance of the city engineer Arnold B\u00fcrkli.In 1893, the twelve outlying districts were incorporated into Z\u00fcrich, including Aussersihl, the workman's quarter on the left bank of the Sihl, and additional land was reclaimed from Lake Z\u00fcrich.In 1934, eight additional districts in the north and west of Z\u00fcrich were incorporated.\nZ\u00fcrich was accidentally bombed during World War II.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\n\nThe blue and white coat of arms of Z\u00fcrich is attested from 1389 and was derived from banners with blue and white stripes in use since 1315. The first certain testimony of banners with the same design is from 1434. The coat of arms is flanked by two lions. The red Schwenkel on top of the banner had varying interpretations: For the people of Z\u00fcrich, it was a mark of honour, granted by Rudolph I. Z\u00fcrich's neighbours mocked it as a sign of shame, commemorating the loss of the banner at Winterthur in 1292. Today, the Canton of Z\u00fcrich uses the same coat of arms as the city.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City districts ===\n\nThe previous boundaries of the city of Z\u00fcrich (before 1893) were more or less synonymous with the location of the old town. Two large expansions of the city limits occurred in 1893 and in 1934 when the city of Z\u00fcrich merged with many surrounding municipalities, that had been growing increasingly together since the 19th century. Today, the city is divided into twelve districts (known as Kreis in German), numbered 1 to 12, each one of which contains between one and four neighborhoods:\n\nKreis 1, known as Altstadt, contains the old town, both to the east and west of the start of the Limmat. District 1 contains the neighbourhoods of Hochschulen, Rathaus, Lindenhof, and City.\nKreis 2 lies along the west side of Lake Z\u00fcrich, and contains the neighbourhoods of Enge, Wollishofen and Leimbach.\nKreis 3, known as Wiedikon is between the Sihl and the Uetliberg, and contains the neighbourhoods of Alt-Wiedikon, Sihlfeld and Friesenberg.\nKreis 4, known as Aussersihl lies between the Sihl and the train tracks leaving Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof, and contains the neighbourhoods of Werd, Langstrasse, and Hard.\nKreis 5, known as Industriequartier, is between the Limmat and the train tracks leaving Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof, it contains the former industrial area of Z\u00fcrich which has gone under a large-scale rezoning to create upscale modern housing, retail and commercial real estate. It contains the neighborhoods of Gewerbeschule, and Escher-Wyss.\nKreis 6 is on the edge of the Z\u00fcrichberg, a hill overlooking the eastern part of the city. District 6 contains the neighbourhoods of Oberstrass and Unterstrass.\nKreis 7 is on the edge of the Adlisberg hill as well as the Z\u00fcrichberg, on the eastern side of the city. District 7 contains the neighbourhoods of Fluntern, Hottingen, and Hirslanden. These neighbourhoods are home to Z\u00fcrich's wealthiest and more prominent residents. The neighbourhood Witikon also belongs to district 7.\nKreis 8, officially called Riesbach, but colloquially known as Seefeld, lies on the eastern side of Lake Z\u00fcrich. District 8 consists of the neighbourhoods of Seefeld, M\u00fchlebach, and Weinegg.\nKreis 9 is between the Limmat to the north and the Uetliberg to the south. It contains the neighbourhoods Altstetten and Albisrieden.\nKreis 10 is to the east of the Limmat and to the south of the H\u00f6nggerberg and K\u00e4ferberg hills. District 10 contains the neighbourhoods of H\u00f6ngg and Wipkingen.\nKreis 11 is in the area north of the H\u00f6nggerberg and K\u00e4ferberg and between the Glatt Valley and the Katzensee (Cats Lake). It contains the neighbourhoods of Affoltern, Oerlikon and Seebach.\nKreis 12, known as Schwamendingen, is located in the Glattal (Glatt valley) on the northern side of the Z\u00fcrichberg. District 12 contains the neighbourhoods of Saatlen, Schwamendigen Mitte, and Hirzenbach.Most of the district boundaries are fairly similar to the original boundaries of the previously existing municipalities before they were incorporated into the city of Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe City Council (Stadtrat) constitutes the executive government of the City of Z\u00fcrich and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of nine councilors, each presiding over a department. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the City Council. The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. The mayor (German: Stadtpr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election by a system of Majorz while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. Any resident of Zurich allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. In the mandate period 2018\u20132022 (Legislatur) the City Council is presided by mayor Corine Mauch. The executive body holds its meetings in the City Hall (German: Stadthaus), on the left bank of the Limmat. The building was built in 1883 in Renaissance style.\nAs of May 2018, the Z\u00fcrich City Council is made up of three representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party, one of whom is the mayor), two members each of the Green Party and the FDP (Free Democratic Party), and one member each of GLP (Green Liberal Party) and AL (Alternative Left Party), giving the left parties a combined seven out of nine seats. The last regular election was held on 4 March 2018.\n\nClaudia Cuche-Curti is Town Chronicler (Stadtschreiberin) since 2012, and Peter Saile is Legal Counsel (Rechtskonsulent) since 2000 for the City Council.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe Municipal Council (Gemeinderat) holds the legislative power. It is made up of 125 members (Gemeindrat / Gemeinder\u00e4tin), with elections held every four years. The Municipal Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the City Council and the administration. The sessions of the Municipal Council are held in public. Unlike those of the City Council, the members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession but are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Z\u00fcrich allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The legislative body holds its meetings in the town hall (Rathaus), on the right bank of the Limmat opposite to the City Hall (Stadthaus).The last election of the Municipal Council was held on 4 March 2018 for the mandate period of 2018\u20132022. As of May 2018, the Municipal Council consist of 43 members of the Social Democratic Party (SP), 21 The Liberals (FDP), 17 members of the Swiss People's Party (SVP), 16 Green Party (GPS), 14 Green Liberal Party (GLP), 10 Alternative List (AL), and four members of the Evangelical People's Party (EVP), giving the left parties an absolute majority of 69.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the SPS which received 25.6% (-6) of the vote. The next four most popular parties were the GPS (20.9%, +9.7), GLP (15.7%, +6.4), SVP (13.7%, -4.3), the FDP (11.8%, -2.2), the AL (4%, new), and the CVP (3.5%, -0.2). In the federal election, a total of 110,760 voters were cast, and the voter turnout was 47.7%.In the 2015 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the SPS which received 31.6% of the vote. The next four most popular parties were the SVP (18%), the FDP (14%), the GPS (10.7%), the GLP (9.2%). In the federal election, a total of 114,377 voters were cast, and the voter turnout was 46.2%.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\n\n==== Twin towns and sister cities ====\nZ\u00fcrich is partnered with two sister cities: Kunming and San Francisco.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nZ\u00fcrich is situated at 408 m (1,339 ft) above sea level on the lower (northern) end of Lake Z\u00fcrich (Z\u00fcrichsee) about 30 kilometers (19 mi) north of the Alps, nestling between the wooded hills on the west and east side. The Old Town stretches on both sides of the Limmat, which flows from the lake, running northwards at first and then gradually turning into a curve to the west. The geographic (and historic) centre of the city is the Lindenhof, a small natural hill on the west bank of the Limmat, about 700 m (2,300 ft) north of where the river issues from Lake Z\u00fcrich. Today the incorporated city stretches somewhat beyond the natural confines of the hills and includes some districts to the northeast in the Glatt Valley (Glattal) and to the north in the Limmat Valley (Limmattal). The boundaries of the older city are easy to recognize by the Schanzengraben canal. This artificial watercourse has been used for the construction of the third fortress in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe municipality of Z\u00fcrich has an area of 91.88 km2 (35.48 sq mi), of which 4.1 km2 (1.6 sq mi) is made up of Lake Z\u00fcrich. The area includes a section of the northern Swiss Plateau. The banks of the Limmat constitute the densest part of the city. The river is oriented in the southeast\u2013northwest direction, with the flat valley floor having a width of two to two to three kilometres (1.2 to 1.9 miles). The partially channeled and straightened Limmat does not flow in the central part of the valley, but always along its right (northeastern) side. The Sihl meets with the Limmat at the end of Platzspitz, which borders the Swiss National Museum. The Limmat reaches the lowest point of the municipality in Oberengstringen at 392 m (1,286 ft) above sea level.\n\nOn its west side, the Limmat valley is flanked by the wooded heights of the Albis chain, which runs along the western border. The Uetliberg is, with 869 m (2,851 ft) above sea level, the highest elevation of the surrounding area. Its summit can be reached easily by the Uetlibergbahn. From the platform of the observation tower on the summit, an impressive panorama of the city, the lake, and the Alps can be seen.\nThe northeast side of the Limmat valley includes a range of hills, which marks the watershed between the Limmat and the Glatt. From the northwest to the southeast, the height of the mostly wooded knolls generally increases: the Gubrist (615 m or 2,018 ft), the H\u00f6nggerberg (541 m or 1,775 ft), the K\u00e4ferberg (571 m or 1,873 ft), the Z\u00fcrichberg (676 m or 2,218 ft), the Adlisberg (701 m or 2,300 ft) and the \u00d6schbrig (696 m or 2,283 ft). Between the K\u00e4ferberg and the Z\u00fcrichberg is located the saddle of the Milchbuck (about 470 m or 1,540 ft), an important passage from the Limmat valley to the Glatt valley.\nThe northernmost part of the municipality extends to the plain of the Glatt valley and to the saddle which makes the connection between the Glattal and Furttal. Also, a part of the Katzensee (nature reserve) and the B\u00fcsisee, both of which are drained by the Katzenbach to Glatt, belong to the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZ\u00fcrich has, depending on the definition used, an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but in the higher areas it is defined as a humid continental climate (Dfb, using 0 \u00b0C isoterm) with warm summers and four distinct seasons. Decisive for the climate of Z\u00fcrich are both the winds from westerly directions, which often result in precipitation and, on the other hand, the Bise (east or north-east wind), which is usually associated with high-pressure situations, but cooler weather phases with temperatures lower than the average. The Foehn wind, which plays an important role in the northern alpine valleys also has some impact on Z\u00fcrich.The annual mean temperature at the measuring station of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology in Z\u00fcrich-Fluntern (556 m[1,824 ft] above sea level on the slope of the Z\u00fcrichberg, 150 m[490 ft] above the level of the city centre) is 9.3 \u00b0C (48.7 \u00b0F). The lowest monthly mean of daily minimum temperature are measured in January with \u22122.0 \u00b0C (28.4 \u00b0F) and the highest monthly mean of daily maximum temperature are measured in July with 24.0 \u00b0C (75.2 \u00b0F). On average there are 74.9 days in which the minimum temperature is below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) (so-called frost days), and 23.7 days in which the maximum temperature is below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) (so-called ice days). There are on average of 30 so-called summer days (maximum temperature equal to or above 25 \u00b0C [77 \u00b0F]) throughout the year, while so-called heat days (with maximum temperature equal to or above 30 \u00b0C [86 \u00b0F]) are 5.8 days.The average high temperature in July is 24.0 \u00b0C (75.2 \u00b0F) and average low temperature is 14 \u00b0C (57.2 \u00b0F). The highest recorded temperature in Z\u00fcrich was 37.7 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F), recorded on July 1947, and typically the warmest day reaches an average of 32.2 \u00b0C (90.0 \u00b0F).Spring and autumn are generally cool to mild, but sometimes with large differences between warm and cold days even during the same year. The highest temperature of the month March in 2014 was on the 20th at 20.6 \u00b0C (69.1 \u00b0F) during a sunny afternoon and the lowest temperature was on the 25th at \u22120.4 \u00b0C (31.3 \u00b0F) during the night/early morning. Record low of average daily temperatures in March since 1864 is \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F) and record high of average daily temperatures in March is 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). Record low of average daily temperatures in October is \u221216 \u00b0C (3 \u00b0F) and record high of average daily temperatures in October is 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).Z\u00fcrich has an average of 1,544 hours of sunshine per year and shines on 38% of its potential time throughout the year. During the months April until September the sun shines between 150 and 215 hours per month. The 1,134 millimetres (44.6 in) rainfall spread on 133.9 days with precipitation throughout the year. Roughly about every third day you will encounter at least some precipitation, which is very much a Swiss average. During the warmer half of the year and especially during the three summer months, the strength of rainfall is higher than those measured in winter, but the days with precipitation stays about the same throughout the year (in average 9.9\u201312.7 days per month). October has the lowest number (9.9) of days with some precipitation. There is an average of 59.5 so-called bright days (number of days with sunshine duration greater than 80%) through the year, the most in July and August (7.4, 7.7 days), and the least in January and December (2.7, 1.8 days). The average number of days with sunshine duration less than 20%, so-called cloudy days, is 158.4 days, while the most cloudy days are in November (17.8 days), December (21.7 days), and January with 19 days.\n\n\n=== Climate protection ===\nThe city is among the world-leaders in protecting the climate by following a manifold approach. In November 2008 the people of Z\u00fcrich voted in a public referendum to write into law the quantifiable and fixed deadline of one tonne of CO2 per person per annum by 2050. This forces any decision of the executive to support this goal, even if the costs are higher in all dimensions. Some examples are the new disinfection section of the public city hospital in Triemli (Minergie-P quality \u2013 passive house), the continued optimisation and creation of public transportation, enlargement of the bicycle-only network, research and projects for renewable energy and enclosure of speed-ways.\n\n\n=== Urban area ===\nThe areas surrounding the Limmat are almost completely developed with residential, industrial, and commercial zones. The sunny and desirable residential areas in the hills overlooking Z\u00fcrich, Waidberg and Z\u00fcrichberg, and the bottom part of the slope on the western side of the valley on the Uetliberg, are also densely built.\nThe \"green lungs\" of the city include the vast forest areas of Adlisberg, Z\u00fcrichberg, K\u00e4ferberg, H\u00f6nggerberg and Uetliberg. Major parks are also located along the lakeshore (Z\u00fcrichhorn and Enge), while smaller parks dot the city. Larger contiguous agricultural lands are located near Affoltern and Seebach. Of the total area of the municipality of Z\u00fcrich (in 1996, without the lake), 45.4% is residential, industrial and commercial, 15.5% is transportation infrastructure, 26.5% is forest, 11%: is agriculture and 1.2% is water.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nPublic transport is extremely popular in Z\u00fcrich, and its inhabitants use public transport in large numbers. About 70% of the visitors to the city use the tram or bus, and about half of the journeys within the municipality take place on public transport. Within Z\u00fcrich and throughout the canton of Z\u00fcrich, the ZVV network of public transport has traffic density ratings among the highest worldwide. When adding frequency, which in Z\u00fcrich can be as often as seven minutes, it does become the densest across all dimensions. Three means of mass-transit exist: the S-Bahn (local trains), trams, and buses (both diesel and electric, also called trolley buses). In addition, the public transport network includes boats on the lake and river, funicular railways and even the Luftseilbahn Adliswil-Felsenegg (LAF), a cable car between Adliswil and Felsenegg. Tickets purchased for a trip are valid on all means of public transportation (train, tram, bus, boat). The Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (commonly abbreviated to ZSG) operates passenger vessels on the Limmat and the Lake Z\u00fcrich, connecting surrounding towns between Z\u00fcrich and Rapperswil.\n\nZ\u00fcrich is a mixed hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof (Z\u00fcrich HB) is the largest and busiest station in Switzerland and is an important railway hub in Europe. There are between 350,000 and 500,000 commuters daily making use of this central network node \u2013 a significant figure in comparison to Z\u00fcrich's population. With regard to the number of trains daily entering and leaving a single railway station, Z\u00fcrich HB is the world's most frequently served railway station, with nearly 3,000 trains every day. Among the 16 railway stations (and 10 additional train stops) within Z\u00fcrich's city borders, there are five other major passenger railway stations. Three of them belong to the ten most frequented railway stations in Switzerland: Stadelhofen, Oerlikon, Altstetten, Hardbr\u00fccke, and Enge. The railway network is mainly operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS), but Z\u00fcrich is also served by major EuroCity trains from the neighbouring countries and is a destination for both French/Swiss (TGV Lyria) and German (ICE) high-speed trains, as well as by Austrian RailJet.\n\n\n=== Zurich Airport ===\nZurich Airport is located less than 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) northeast of the city in Kloten. Zurich Airport has its own railway station, which is located underground. It is directly connected to Z\u00fcrich and most of the major Swiss cities. Zurich Airport is served by more than 60 passenger airlines from around the world. It is also served by one cargo airline and is a hub for Swiss International Air Lines. There is also an airfield in D\u00fcbendorf.\n\n\n=== Road traffic ===\nThe A1, A3 and A4 motorways pass close to Z\u00fcrich. The A1 heads west towards Bern and Geneva and eastwards towards St. Gallen; the A4 leads northwards to Schaffhausen and southwards to Altdorf connecting with the A2 towards Chiasso; and the A3 heads northwest towards Basel and southeast along Lake Z\u00fcrich and Lake Walen towards Sargans.\n\n\n=== Bicycle transport ===\nIn 2012, the city council launched a program to improve the city's attractiveness for bicycle traffic. The so-called \"Masterplan Velo\" is part of the superordinate framework Stadtverkehr 2025 which shapes the future of the different means of transport. Research revealed that infrastructure and the social environment are essential factors in improving a city's appeal to bicycle traffic. Three main goals are specified: First, the modal share of bicycle traffic should be enhanced to twice the value of 2011 by 2015. Second, cyclists' safety should be improved to lower the overall accident risk. Third, cycling should be established as an everyday means of transport with a special focus on children and young people.\nIn terms of infrastructure, the city aims to build up a network of distinctive bicycle routes in order to achieve these objectives. At a final stage, the network will consist of main routes (Hauptrouten) for everyday use and comfort routes (Komfortrouten), with the latter focussing on leisure cycling. Additional measures such as special Velostationen providing bike related services are expected to help to further improve the quality. One of the key projects of the system is a tunnel beneath the tracks of the main railway station planned to combine a main connection with staffed possibilities where commuters can leave their bikes throughout the day. Apart from infrastructural measures, further approaches are planned in the fields of communication, education and administration.\nHowever, these efforts cause critique, mainly due to postponing. The institution of the bike tunnel at the main railway station, originally planned for 2016, is currently (2016) delayed to at least 2019. Pro Velo, a nationwide interest group, has publicly questioned whether the masterplan already failed. The critique aims at badly governed traffic management at construction sites, missing possibilities to park bikes in the city as well as rather diffident ambitions. In response, the responsible city department points to the big investments made every year and mentions ongoing discussions that would finally lead to even better results.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nThere are 415,367 people living in Z\u00fcrich (as of 31 December 2018), making it Switzerland's largest city. Of registered inhabitants (in 2016), 32% (133,473) do not hold Swiss citizenship. Of these, German citizens make up the largest group with 8% (33,548), followed by Italians 3.5% (14,543). The population of the city including suburbs totals 1.19 million people. The entire metropolitan area (including the cities of Winterthur, Baden, Brugg, Schaffhausen, Frauenfeld, Uster/Wetzikon, Rapperswil-Jona and Zug) has a population of around 1.83 million people.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe official formal language used by: governmental institutions, print, news, schools/universities, courts, theatres and in any kind of written form is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, while the spoken language is Z\u00fcrich German (Z\u00fcrit\u00fc\u00fctsch), one of the several more or less distinguishable, but mutually intelligible Swiss German dialects of Switzerland with roots in the medieval Alemannic German dialect groups. However, because of Z\u00fcrich's national importance, and therefore its existing high fluctuation, one can hear all kinds of Swiss German dialects spoken by its inhabitants and commuters. As of the December 2010 census, 69.3% of the population speaks diglossic Swiss German/Swiss Standard German as their mother-tongue at home. Some 22.7% of inhabitants speak Standard German in their family environment (\"at home\"). Dramatically increasing, according to the last census in 2000, 8.8% now speak English. Italian follows behind at 7.1% of the population then French at 4.5%. Other languages spoken here include: Croatian and Serbian (4.1%), Spanish (3.9%), Portuguese (3.1%) and Albanian (2.3%). (Multiple choices were possible.) Thus 20% of the population speak two or more languages at home.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nBefore the Protestant Reformation reached Z\u00fcrich, it was de jure and de facto Roman Catholic.\nThe Protestant Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli made Z\u00fcrich both a theological centre and a stronghold of Protestantism in Switzerland. Another Swiss city with a comparable status was Geneva, the so-called Protestant Rome, where John Calvin and his Protestant Reformers operated. Z\u00fcrich attracted other influential Protestant Reformers like Heinrich Bullinger. Zwingli translated the Bible (Z\u00fcrich Bible) into the local variety of German and introduced the Reformation by winning support of the magistrates, the princess abbess Katharina von Zimmern and the largely peasant population of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich. The canton unanimously adopted the Reformed tradition as represented by Zwingli. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants tormented the Swiss Confederacy. Zwingli died for political and religious reasons by defending the Canton of Z\u00fcrich in the Battle of Kappel. Bullinger took over his role as the city's spiritual leader.\nIn 1970, about 53% of the population were Swiss Reformed, while almost 40% were Roman Catholic. Since then both large Swiss churches, the Roman Catholic Church and Swiss Reformed Church, have been constantly losing members, though for the Catholic Church the decrease started 20 years later in around 1990. Nevertheless, for the last twenty years both confessions have been reduced by 10% to the current figures (census 2010): 30% Roman Catholic and 26% Swiss Reformed (organized in Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich). In 1970, only 2% of Z\u00fcrich's inhabitants claimed to be not affiliated with any religious confession. In accordance with the loss by the large Swiss churches, the number of people declaring themselves as non-affiliated rose to 17% in the year 2000. In the last ten years, this figure rose to more than 25%. For the group of people, being between 24 and 44 years old, this is as high as one in every third person.5% of Z\u00fcrich's inhabitants are Muslims, a slight decrease of 1% compared to the year 2000. The Mahmood Mosque Z\u00fcrich, situated in Forchstrasse is the first mosque built in Switzerland.The population of Jewish ethnicity and religion has been more or less constant since 1970 at about 1%. The Synagoge Z\u00fcrich L\u00f6wenstrasse is the oldest and largest synagogue of Z\u00fcrich.Nearly one tenth of the city's population are members of non-state-recognized Christian denominations (for example the Eastern Orthodox Church).More than 2% of Z\u00fcrich's population account for non-monotheistic religions (such as Buddhism or Hinduism).\n\n\n=== Social ===\nThe level of unemployment in Z\u00fcrich was 3.2% in July 2012. In 2008, the average monthly income was about CHF 7000 before any deductions for social insurances and taxes. In 2010, there were 12,994 cases (on average per month) of direct or indirect welfare payments from the state.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nMost of Z\u00fcrich's sites are located within the area on either side of the Limmat, between the Main railway station and Lake Z\u00fcrich. The churches and houses of the old town are clustered here, as are the most expensive shops along the famous Bahnhofstrasse. The Lindenhof in the old town is the historical site of the Roman castle, and the later Carolingian Imperial Palace.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nGrossm\u00fcnster (Great Minster) According to legend, Charlemagne discovered the graves of the city's martyrs Felix and Regula and had built the first church as a monastery; start of current building around 1100; in the first half of the 16th century, the Great Minster was the starting point of the Swiss-German Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger; declared by Charlemagne imperial church; romanesque crypt, romanesque capitals in the church and cloister; choir windows by Augusto Giacometti (1932) and Sigmar Polke (2009), bronze doors by Otto M\u00fcnch (1935 and 1950).\nFraum\u00fcnster (Women's Minster) Church of a former abbey for aristocratical women from southern Germany which was founded in 853 by Louis the German for his daughter Hildegard; first church built before 874; the romanesque choir dates from 1250\u201370; the church enjoyed the patronage of kings and had the right of coinage from Z\u00fcrich to the 13th century; after the Reformation, church and convent passed into the possession of the city; the most important jewelry \u2013 in addition to the largest organ in the canton with its 5,793 pipes and 92 stops \u2013 are color windows: the window in the north transept of Augusto Giacometti (1945), the five-part cycle in the choir (1970) and the rosette in the southern transept (1978) are by Marc Chagall; also the church of Z\u00fcrich's largest choir with 100 and more singers.\nSt. Peter romanesque-gothic-baroque church built on remains of former churches from before the 9th century; with the largest church clock face in Europe built 1538; baptismal font of 1598, baroque stucco; individual stalls from the 15th century from city repealed monasteries with rich carvings and armrests; Kanzellettner (increased barrier between the nave and choir with built-pulpit) of 1705 pulpit sounding board about 1790; rich Akanthus embellishment with Bible verse above the pulpit; 1971 new crystal chandelier modeled according 1710 design; organ in 1974 with 53 stops; Bells: five from 1880, the largest, A minor, without clapper weighs about 6,000 kg (13,228 lb); fire guard in the tower to the Middle Ages to 1911.\nPredigerkirche is one of the four main churches of the old town, first built in 1231 AD as a Romanesque church of the then Dominican Predigerkloster nearby the Neumarkt. It was converted in the first half of the 14th century, and the choir rebuilt between 1308 and 1350. Due to its construction and for that time unusual high bell tower, it was regarded as most high Gothic edifice in Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nZ\u00fcrich Museum of Art \u2013 The Museum of Art, also known as Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich, is one of the significant art museums of Europe.

The summit is easily accessible by train from Z\u00fcrich main station.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nCompared to other cities, there are few tall buildings in Z\u00fcrich. The municipal building regulations (Article 9) limit the construction of high-rise buildings to areas in the west and north of the city. In the industrial district, in Altstetten and Oerlikon, buildings up to 80 meters (260 ft) in height are allowed (high-rise area I). In the adjacent high-rise areas II and III the height is limited to 40 meters (130 ft). Around the year 2000, regulations became more flexible and high-rise buildings were again planned and built. The people's initiative \"40 metres (130 feet) is enough,\" which would have reduced both the maximum height and the high-rise buildings area, was clearly rejected on 29 November 2009. At this time in Z\u00fcrich about a dozen high-rise buildings were under construction or in planning, including the Prime Tower as the tallest skyscraper in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== World heritage sites ===\nThe prehistoric settlements at Enge Alpenquai and Grosser Hafner and Kleiner Hafner are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nZ\u00fcrich is a leading financial center and global city. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Z\u00fcrich was ranked as having the 11th most competitive financial center in the world, and second most competitive in Europe after London. The Greater Z\u00fcrich Area is Switzerland's economic centre and home to many international companies. By far the most important sector in the economy of Z\u00fcrich is the service industry, which employs nearly four-fifths of workers. Other important industries include light industry, machine and textile industries and tourism. Most Swiss banks have their headquarters in Z\u00fcrich and there are numerous foreign banks in the Greater Z\u00fcrich Area. Located in Z\u00fcrich, the Swiss Stock Exchange was established in 1877 and is nowadays the fourth most prominent stock exchange in the world. In addition Z\u00fcrich is the world's largest gold trading centre. Ten of the country's 50 largest companies have their head offices in Z\u00fcrich, among them ABB, UBS, Credit Suisse, Swiss Re and Z\u00fcrich Financial Services.\n\n\n=== Contributory factors to economic strength ===\nThe high quality of life has been cited as a reason for economic growth in Z\u00fcrich. The consulting firm Mercer has for many years ranked Z\u00fcrich as a city with the highest quality of life in the world. In particular, Z\u00fcrich received high scores for work, housing, leisure, education and safety. Local planning authorities ensure clear separation between urban and recreational areas and there are many protected nature reserves. Z\u00fcrich is also ranked the third most expensive city in the world, behind Hong Kong and Tokyo and ahead of Singapore.Z\u00fcrich benefits from the high level of investment in education that is typical of Switzerland in general and provides skilled labour at all levels. The city is home to two major universities, thus enabling access to graduates and high technology research. Professional training incorporates a mix of practical work experience and academic study while, in general, emphasis is placed on obtaining a good level of general education and language ability. As a result, the city is home to many multilingual people and employees generally demonstrate a high degree of motivation and a low level of absenteeism. The employment laws are less restrictive as nearby Germany or France. Technology new start, FinTech and others in MedTech secure good seed and starter funding.\n\n\n=== The Swiss stock exchange ===\n\nThe Swiss stock exchange is called SIX Swiss Exchange, formerly known as SWX. The SIX Swiss Exchange is the head group of several different worldwide operative financial systems: Eurex, Eurex US, EXFEED, STOXX, and virt-x. The exchange turnover generated at the SWX was in 2007 of 1,780,499.5 million CHF; the number of transactions arrived in the same period at 35,339,296 and the Swiss Performance Index (SPI) arrived at a total market capitalization of 1,359,976.2 million CHF.The SIX Swiss Exchange goes back more than 150 years.

        "wiki": "Augusto Giacometti (16 August 1877 \u2013 9 June 1947) was a Swiss painter from Stampa, Graub\u00fcnden, cousin of Giovanni Giacometti who was the father of Alberto, Diego and Bruno Giacometti. He was a prominent as a painter in the Art Nouveau and Symbolism movements, for his work in stained glass, as a proponent of murals and a designer of popular posters.\nHe finished (among others) stained glass windows in both of the most important churches of Z\u00fcrich, Grossm\u00fcnster and Fraum\u00fcnster, as well as the inner decoration of the so-called Waisenhaus Z\u00fcrich.\nFrom 1909 to 1913 Augusto Giacometti was a great inspiration for Czech born sculptor Helen Zelezny-Scholz.\nA two-day hiking trail connects most of the locations of the family in Val Bregaglia.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nAugusto was part of the successful Giacometti dynasty of painters. He grew up near the home and studio of his cousin Giovanni Giacometti, and devoted himself to painting from a young age. After completing his training as an art teacher at the Zurich University of the Arts between 1894 and 1897, he moved to Paris to study under Eug\u00e8ne Grasset in Paris from 1897 to 1901. Following periods of residence in Florence and Zurich he settled down in Zurich in 1915.In 1917 Giacometti came to know the Dadaists Tristan Tzara, Marcel Janco, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, and Hugo Ball. He took part in the 8th Dada-Soir\u00e9e in the Zurich merchants' hall and became a member of the group of artists \"Das Neue Leben\" (1918\u20131920). Known for his decorations in holy arts and his floral subjects, in 1919 Giacometti was initiated  to the Swiss Freemasonry at Z\u00fcrich.With the realization of his design for the entrance hall (now known as Giacometti-Halle) of the police station at Waisenhaus Z\u00fcrich between 1923 and 1925, Giacometti accomplished one of his most important works. The great recognition he received for this work paved the way for him to further important commissions.\nIn 1929 he created the colorful glass windows in the east wall of the Protestant church in Frauenfeld, in 1933 the choral windows of Grossm\u00fcnster in Zurich, in 1937 the choral windows of the village church of Adelboden, and in 1945 a stained-glass window of Fraum\u00fcnster.\nHe was one of the first painters of the 20th century to take steps into non-representational painting; his abstract paintings reflect his exhaustive study of the characteristics and rules of color. His epitaph reads Qui riposa il maestro dei colori, \"here lies the master of color.\"\nGiacometti influenced the German painter August Babberger greatly in both his style and his choice of subjects.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n2014/2015: Color and I.

        "wiki": "Ad Astra Aero (Latin for \"to the stars\") was a Swiss airline based at Z\u00fcrichhorn in Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nInitiated by Oskar Bider and Fritz Rihner, in July 1919 the \"Schweizerische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Lufttourismus\" (literally: Swiss corporation for air tourism) was established in Z\u00fcrich. Tourist flights with flying boats were planned from sites at Z\u00fcrichhorn in Z\u00fcrich-Riesbach, and in Gen\u00e8ve, Interlaken/Thun, Locarno, Lugano, Luzern, Lausanne-Ouchy, Romanshorn and St. Moritz. Switzerland, with its numerous lakes, appeared predestined for the use of seaplanes, so that no expensive airports would have to be built. Oskar Bider was killed in an accident before the ambitious project was realized. The driving forces of the latter Ad Astra Aero company were the Swiss aviation pioneers Walter Mittelholzer and Alfred Comte. Using Junkers F.13, Comte and Mittelholzer undertook flights over the Alps, Ticino, Matterhorn, the Bernese Alps in late summer 1919, and on 11 September 1919 they succeeded in the crossing of the Mont Blanc (el. 4,807 metres (15,771 ft)).\nOn December 15, 1919 Ad Astra Aero S.A. was registered as an Aktiengesellschaft, and on 24 February 1920 Ad Astra Aero merged with the airlines Frick & Co and Aero-Gesellschaft Comte Mittelholzer & Co to form Ad Astra Aero AG in Z\u00fcrich. Alfred Comte was appointed by the board as chief pilot for land planes and Walter Mittelholzer as head of the aerial photography department. On 21 April 1920 Avion Tourisme SA in Geneva was bought and the share capital was doubled to 600,000 Swiss francs. Following the recent merger, the company was renamed in Ad Astra Aero, Avion Tourisme S. A. (Schweiz. Luftverkehrs A.-G.). Flight stations were held in Bern, Geneva, Lugano, Romanshorn and Z\u00fcrich (Z\u00fcrichhorn and Schwamendingen).\nOn 24 May 1920 \u00c9mile Tadd\u00e9oli, the chief pilot for seaplanes, and his mechanic, died during a demonstration flight at an air show in Romanshorn aboard a Savoia flying boat. Financial constraints limited the operations in the first year of operation, and so the Board of Directors recommended on December 23, 1920, to reduce the flight crew to the pilots Pillichody, Cartier and Weber. Operations were limited to the air stations at Z\u00fcrichhorn and Geneva.\nIn 192, the seven pilots of the company did 4,699 tourist flights with 7,384 passengers, resulting in 1,254 hours' flight time and a total distance of about 166,920 kilometres (103,720 mi). Ad Astra Aero closed its first year with a huge loss of 426,365 Swiss francs, and a 410,757-Swiss-franc loss in the second fiscal year. The co-CEO of Ad Astra, Henry Pillichody, made on July 18, 1921, with five passengers the first Alpine passenger flight with the Junkers F.13 airplane in the Bernese Alps.In the first two years of operational service, aerial photography and charter airline needs were the main focus of operations: in June 1922 the first scheduled flight route Geneva-Z\u00fcrich-Nuremberg-Fuerth was established. In 1924 Alfred Comte founded the Alfred Comte Flug- und Sportfliegerschule in Oberrieden, Horgen; Walter Mittelholzer became Ad Astra's one and only CEO.\n\n\n== Flight routes and time of expansion ==\nIn operational association with Junkers aviation, on 1 June 1921 the Geneva-Z\u00fcrich route to Fuerth (in September 1922 extended to Berlin) was established with four Junkers F.13, and Ad Astra became the first airline of Switzerland to maintain regular international flights. On behalf of Junkers, scheduled flights to Berlin, Danzig and Riga were established. In April 1924 the air route Z\u00fcrich-Stuttgart-Frankfurt was established with connections to the route Berlin-Amsterdam. At the same time, the Ad Astra route Geneva-Z\u00fcrich-Munich got a new intermediate station in Lausanne, on May 15 the line Z\u00fcrich-Munich-Vienna was admitted to the grid. In 1925 Ad Astra had to separate their operational flights from that of the Trans-European Union, as the Swiss authorities did not pay subsidies for an international company, and therefore Ad Astra had to limit the flights to the line Geneva-Z\u00fcrich-Munich, exclusively with Swiss aircraft and pilots. However, Ad Astra participated the so-called Europa-Union and became a member of the IATA in 1926. On 14 June 1928 the first serious accident in the Swiss passenger air travel occurred: a Junkers F 13 of the Ad Astra crashed after takeoff at Frankfurt am Main: F. Chardon, the pilot, and three passengers were seriously injured.\n\n\n== Mittelholzer's Africa flights ==\nThe Swiss media events of the 1920s were Walter Mittelholzer's Africa flights for aerial photography and cartography purposes. In 1924, he did the first transcontinental flight expedition, starting from the water airport at Z\u00fcrichhorn via Egypt to South Africa. Mittelholzer's aircraft was a Dornier Merkur (CH-142); it was taken over on March 26, 1931, by the Swissair airline and taken out of service in 1932. In winter 1924/25, Mittelholzer flew to Tehran; the trip lasted a month including two emergency landings. Its flights are considered outstanding technical achievements of its time. In 1930, during another flight to Africa, Walter Mittelholzer was the first pilot to fly over Mount Kilimanjaro.\n\n\n== Fleet ==\nThe modern Junkers F.13 (aircraft registration CH-91, CH-92, CH-93 and CH-94) and Junkers G 23 have been leased from Junkers. Besides, Ad Astra Aero concentrated to post and photo flights with smaller machines, some with a decommissioned military aircraft. From Z\u00fcrichhorn (Z\u00fcrich-Seefeld) seaplanes were used, among others, two Dornier Merkur B Bal (CH-142/171, the latter was for Mittelholzer's Africa flights equipped with floats), three Fokker F.VII (CH-190/192/193), one BFW/Messerschmitt M18d (CH-191), at least one Comte AC-4 (designed by Alfred Comte), six Lohner flying boats and flying boats of Italian origin, among them seven Macchi-Nieuport and five Savoia flying boats and the first large flying boat, Dornier Wal.\n\n\n== Merger with Balair to form Swissair ==\nOn 31 December 1930, was the retroactive merger done with Air Basel AG (Balair), as per decision of the General Assembly on 17 March 1931. The merger was forced by the Swiss Federal Air Administration due to the bad financial situation and also subsidized Balair, to form a new Swiss airline, Swissair, whose technical director became Walter Mittelholzer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAd Astra Aero on swissair00.ch (in German)",

        "wiki": "The MFO-Park is a public park in the Oerlikon quarter of the Swiss city of Z\u00fcrich. The area to the north of Z\u00fcrich Oerlikon railway station was once home to the extensive works of Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon (MFO), as site that has now been redeveloped as Neu Oerlikon. As part of that redevelopment, four new parks were created, including the MFO-Park, which was created on the footprint of one of MFO's buildings. The project was designed by the architects Burckhardt + Partner and landscape architects Raderschallpartner.The park is characterized by its modern and unusual design. The large \u201cPark-Haus\u201d is a double-walled steel-framed construction, 100 m (330 ft) in length, 35 m (115 ft) in width and 17 m (56 ft) high, reminiscent of a conservatory without glass. It is covered by a trellis (or treillage) and covered with climbing plants, resulting in a space that is filled by ever changing light, shadow and smells. The large hall space is broken up by four plant-covered wire chalices. The water basin planted with irises is located in a sunken area that is floored with recycled glass. The spaces between the double walls contain staircases, linking to balconies and platforms at different levels, including a sun deck high up on the roof that offers views over northern Z\u00fcrich.The MFO-Park accommodates a number of different activities. The facility is suitable for sport and games, for meetings of all kinds, or events such as film screenings, concerts and theatrical performances \u2013 all with a baroque backdrop of hedges. Small silent garden rooms with a view into the hall are created in the spaces between the walls, just like opera boxes.The foundation stone was laid in autumn 2001 and the MFO-Park was inaugurated in summer 2002. As originally planned, there was intended to be a second phase which would feature an area with plant-covered pillars in front of the south side of the hall. This phase has not yet been implemented, and the four-story brick building which was originally intended for demolition to make space for this will continue to be used for the time being.The garden has received the following awards:\nEuropean Garden Award in the category of \"Most Innovative Contemporary Park or Garden\", awarded by the European Garden Heritage Network EGHN 2010\nAward for good architecture in the Z\u00fcrich canton 2006 - Recognition\nAward for good architecture from the City of Z\u00fcrich 2006\n2004: MAX on top Vienna, free space 02, 2nd place 2004\nPlay & Leisure Award Friedrichshafen 2004\nBDLA Prize (Association of German Landscape Architects) 2003 - Appreciation\nPublic design-award 2003\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nUdo Weilacher: Ein Park als Versprechen.

        "wiki": "Urania Sternwarte is a public observatory in the Lindenhof quarter of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. Its name Urania refers to the muse of astronomy in Greek mythology.\n\n\n== History ==\nIts origins base on a first observatory on the roof of the Zunfthaus zur Meisen. In 1759, so called \u00abAstronomische Kommission\u00bb succeeded from this location for the first time, to define Culminatio solis and thus calculated the exact global location of the city of Zurich. In later years, astronomical observations were done from the Grossm\u00fcnster's southern \"Karl's tower\", followed by scientific observations (not for public use by interested enthusiasts) from the Federal observatory, built 1861/64 for ETH Z\u00fcrich by Gottfried Semper.\nIn 1899, the Z\u00fcrich merchant Abraham Weill Einstein initiated the oldest observatory in Switzerland, situated near Werdm\u00fchleplatz (Uraniastrasse). On June 15, 1907, the observatory was given to operational use. Its approximately 51 meter high tower, dominating western end of Zurich's historical Altstadt.\n\n\n== Telescope ==\n\nUrania's refracting telescope is equipped with a Fraunhofer two-lens system of 30 cm aperture and focal length of 5.05 meters, allowing maximal 600-fold magnification (mostly used 150- to 205-fold magnification). The refractor in the dome area is the center of the imposing tower building: The telescope stands on a pillar, contact-free installed through the center of the building to the foundations of the business house Urania, fitted with anti-vibration installations.Its optical telescope measures twelve tons and was designed by Carl Zeiss AG in Jena, Germany, considered as a technical masterpiece. Urania's refractor topped technological history as \"Urania type\". On its centenary anniversary, telescope and dome were fully renewed. The Zeiss telescope, still meeting today's demands, was dismantled in March 2006, and  in Jena fully restored. On April 25, 2007, the telescope was hoisted into the observatory's 51 m high dome, on May 4, 2007, its second opening ceremony was celebrated.\n\n\n== Observations and limitations ==\nThe observatory offers guided tours \u2013 Moon, Solar System objects, stars, star clusters, interstellar clouds, and galaxies \u2013 and special events for a wide audience, as well as individual tours for schools and groups. Paid public tours can be found on clear weather from Tuesday to Friday, starting at 20:00 (8 pm). The central location and the city of Zurich overriding observation tower also provide an unusual view of the city, Lake Zurich and Alps. The Urania house hosts a restaurant and an exclusive Bar, too. At the same time, its location in the middle of the city of Zurich is a serious problem: light pollution allows restricted observations of few galaxies and nebulae. Therefore, observations are limited practically to the moon and planets and bright celestial objects.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage of national importance ==\nThe observatory is, as part of the building ensemble at that area, listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance.\n\n\n== External links ==\nUrania observatory (in German)\nAstronomische Gesellschaft Urania Z\u00fcrich (Astronomical society Urania Z\u00fcrich AGUZ) (in German)\n\n\n== References ==",

          "This is the very best tour you can take in Zurich. The guy does it for 26 years and his your is just amazing!",
          "After being let in we were send away because of overbooking.....very unprofessional....new tickets were offered but with any marketing they should be free as we had to take a tram to get here and no refund for that.",
          "The day we visited it was raining so we did not get to see the star but still the observatory is unique and the tour guide is passionate! You can also catch some drink in the bar below it before heading up to see the observatory.",
          "Enter through the restaurant. Up the elevator to the bar and observatory floor. Great views late in the day or early evening.",
          "There are paid public tours given in the evenings (if there is clear weather). Tours on Thursday - Saturday evenings 21:00 - 22:00 hrs. The telescope is a two lens system allowing for 600-fold magnification. Interesting to visit.",

          "It looks like Zurich is loaded with nice high views, be it from church towers, a nearby mountain an here an observatory. It is difficult to find the entrance but with some help from locals things work. However, I think high views of Zurich tend to become repetitive after trying",

          "I was lucky enough to be in a small group that was given a private tour. From the scientific point of view the middle of a city is the last place you want to have an observatory. But for the inhabitants of and visitors to the city, it's so handy.",
          "Worth a visit for every youngster. I dont know any other place that allows you to look through a 20 ton telescope and see Venus, Mars and Saturn. During summer the show goes on till quite late (past 10pm) to eat and go.",
          "I lovedmy visit to the observatory. The fact that we were able to use a telescope made 105 years ago and it works so well... We saw mercury (rare opportunity), the moon, Saturn ... The guide is this great amateur who has a passion for what he does. If you love astronomy, please",

        "wiki": "The Platzspitz park is a park in Zurich, located next to the Swiss National Museum. \n\n\n== History ==\nHistory of the park goes back to the Middle Ages. Positioned between the Sihl and Limmat rivers, it was originally used as a hunting and shooting ground in the 14th century, and by the end of the 18th century the park was also adorned with beautiful Baroque architecture.During the 1980s, heroin users would frequently gather at the park, and attempts to disperse them merely resulted in them regrouping elsewhere. Thus in 1987 the authorities chose to allow illegal drug use and sales at the park, in an effort to contain Zurich's growing drug problem. Police were not allowed to enter the park or make arrests. Clean needles were given out to addicts as part of the Zurich Intervention Pilot Project, or ZIPP-AIDS program. However, lack of control over what went on in the park caused a multitude of problems. Drug dealers and users arrived from all over Europe, and crime became rampant as dealers fought for control and addicts (who numbered up to 20,000\n) stole to support their habit. The once-beautiful gardens had degraded into a mess of mud and used needles, and the emergency services were overwhelmed with the number of overdoses, which were almost nightly. Platzspitz, or Needle Park as it was then known, became a source of embarrassment to the Swiss government and in 1992, police moved in to clear up the park.Today Platzspitz has been cleaned up and restored, and is presented by the authorities as a peaceful, family-friendly garden.\n\n\n== National Exhibition Vestige ==\nOne structure that stands out is the gazebo that stands just behind the Swiss National Museum. It is very close to Zurich's main railway station. The Gazebo is a vestige of the first Switzerland's National Exhibition of 1883. It was first built to be a musical pavilion, a function it still serves to this day.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "name": "Old Botanical Garden",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Old Botanical Garden (German: Alter Botanischer Garten) is a botanical garden and arboretum in the Swiss city of Z\u00fcrich. The garden is, among the neighbored Schanzengraben moat and the Bausch\u00e4nzli bastion, one of the last remains of the Baroque fortifications of Z\u00fcrich, that was begun in 1642.\n\n\n== Facilitites ==\nThe Garden is located on the former zur Katz bastion in the city centre near the Sihlporte area. Opening times are daily from April to September 7:00\u201319.00 (7 pm), October to March 8:00\u201318:00 (6 pm). Trams 2 and 9 stop at the nearby Sihlstrasse stop. Although the Old Botanical Garden is owned by the University of Zurich, it should not be mistaken for the Botanical Garden of the University of Zurich, opened in 1977 and located at Zollikerstrasse in the Weinegg quarter of the city. The present facilities also house the ethnological museum (V\u00f6lkerkundemuseum) of the University of Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origins of the first botanical garden base on Conrad Gessner's (1516\u20131565) private herbarium. A Gessner descendant, Johannes Gessner (1709\u20131790) who was a physician and naturalist, founded Z\u00fcrich's first botanical garden in 1746, in co-operation with the Naturforschende Gesellschaft Z\u00fcrich (Z\u00fcrich Botanical Society).\nIn 1833 the Canton of Z\u00fcrich changed this first location to the so-called Schimmelgut when the University of Z\u00fcrich was founded. On dissolution of the ramparts zur Katz in 1837, the still existing plant at the Schanzengraben moat was built. The garden was designed by the University's gardener Leopold Karl Theodor Fr\u00f6bel (1810\u20131907). In 1851 its Palmhaus (a greenhouse) was opened \u2013 constructed of glass and wood, in 1877 the octagonal glass pavilion got an iron frame. Today, the pavilion is primarily used for concerts, theater and exhibitions.The terrain of the garden was limited by surrounding buildings, whilst the shadows of these buildings  hindered growth conditions for the plants. Thus in second half of the 20th century, an urgently needed expansion was impossible, and as the botanical buildings were in poor condition, the administration decided to move the gardens from the city center to a more peripheral location within the city, where there was room to expand. In 1971 the old park of the Bodmer-Abegg family in the Weinegg quarter was selected, and in 1976 the new botanical garden was opened there.\nSince 1976 the Old Botanical Garden, as it is now known, has been used as a recreation area, as the location of the V\u00f6lkerkundemuseum (ethnological museum) of the University of Z\u00fcrich, as the site of an arboretum and of the so-called Gessner-Garten.\n\n\n== Arboretum and Gessner-Garten ==\nThe arboretum is still remarkable, as is the idyllic location on the Schanzengraben moat in the midst of Z\u00fcrich, and therefore the garden is a popular recreation area.\nGessner-Garten on the hilltop, a medieval herb garden, is a memorial to Conrad Gessner. The southern gun bastion of the fortifications of Z\u00fcrich was at the highest point of the former ramparts zur Katz. The guns at the fortification were called Katz. Opened on 27 May 1997, the garden was built by private horticultural companies and financed by the Pro Katz foundation, with the object of maintaining the botanical garden. At the northern end of the herb garden, we find the Conrad Gessner memorial.\nThe Gessner garden shows 50 medicinal plants (herbs and shrubs), used by 16th century's healers, each with a citation of a healer from that period, such as Cynara cardunculus, Potentilla erecta, Linum usitatissimum, Paeonia officinalis, Silybum marianum, Juniperus communis, Fragaria vesca, Artemisia absinthium and more. The garden features herbs, which for centuries have been healing illness or having beneficial effects in infirmity. The signs by the plants give us an insight into the medicinal knowledge of Conrad Gessner and his contemporaries, such as Hieronymus Bock (1498\u20131554) and Leon Hart Fuchs (1501\u20131566). Another herb garden dedicated to Conrad Gessner is situated in the former cloister of the Grossm\u00fcnster respectively Carolinum.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Katz bulwark (Bollwerk zur Katz) ==\n\nThe Bollwerk zur Katz (German name) is besides the Bausch\u00e4nzli river island the last remaining bulwark of the 17th-century city fortifications. The first structures of this bastion were built between 1648 and 1664, the final expansion took place from 1673 to 1675. The final construction stage of this centrally positioned military factory on Schanzengraben had also two casemates, two underground vaults for purposes of defense, and a cavalier on hilltop that was overlooking the area outside of the Schanzengraben moat. The cavalier was particularly a strong increased gun emplacement, which towered over the adjacent defense walls and thus enabled additional covering fire. Thanks to the altitude, a strong and large-scale defense was maintained by its powerful and therefore more far-reaching guns up to the present General-Guisan-Quai on lakeshore respectively the Sihlfeld area towards the Limmat Valley. As of 1661 originated there also, incidentally, the only access for larger carriages into the town, the so-called Sihlporte which is the name of the area west of the botanical garden at the present Schanzengraben moat. After discontinuation of defense purposes, from 1834 the upstream curtain walls were demolished, and in 1935 the hilltop bulwark was rebuilt to house the Gessner-Garten.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage of national importance ==\nThe garden is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in German)",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Die Altstadt (German for \"the old town\") in the Swiss city of Z\u00fcrich encompasses the area of the entire historical city before 1893, before the incorporation of what are now districts 2 to 12 into the municipality, over the period 1893 to 1934. Die Altstadt approximately corresponds to the area enclosed by the former city ramparts, and is today within the administrative area of the city called Kreis 1 (District 1).\nWith a population of 5,617 (as of 2015), it houses about 1.4% of the city's total population.\nAdministratively, District 1 is divided into four parts or quarters by the Z\u00fcrich statistical office, Rathaus (town hall), Hochschulen (universities), Lindenhof (\"lime trees courtyard\") and City. Lindenhof and Rathaus correspond to the parts of the medieval city left (west) and right (east) of the Limmat, respectively, while City and Hochschulen include the area of the Early Modern city west and east of the medieval walls, respectively.\n\n\n== Lindenhof ==\n\nDer Lindenhof (\"The lime trees courtyard\") quarter corresponds to the mindere Stadt, the smaller but more prestigious half of the medieval town left of the river. This is the oldest core of the city, with settlement traces dating to pre-Roman (La T\u00e8ne) times, and fortified as the Roman Vicus Turicum, a Roman customs station with a surrounding civilian settlement, in the final decades of the 1st century BC.\nThe Lindenhof hill itself is the site of the Roman castle at the location of the Celtic Oppidum Z\u00fcrich-Lindenhof, rebuilt in Carolingian times but derelict by the 13th century, when it was used as a source for building stone for the first stone houses of rich burghers of the recently reichsfrei city. The Schipfe quarter at the Limmat below the Lindenhof is the site of the Roman vicus, with traces of a hypocaustum nearby the M\u00fcnsterhof excavated. St. Peter church was the parish church of the medieval city, built on the site of an earlier temple to  Jupiter.\nThe Rennweg street below the Lindenhof hill was the main street of the medieval city, entering by the Rennweg gate through the western city wall which is now marked by the course of Bahnhofstrasse. Augustinergasse is a small street leading from St. Peterhofstatt situated at the St. Peter church, passing the former Augustinians monastery below the Lindenhof hill, towards the Kecinst\u00fcrlin gate at the southern Fr\u00f6schengraben moat, Bahnhofstrasse as of today.\nZunfthaus zur Meisen at M\u00fcnsterhof plaza near Fraum\u00fcnster church houses the porcelain and faience collection of the Swiss National Museum. Lindenhof also contains the former Augustinian abbey, and formerly the Oetenbach nunnery north of the Lindenhof hill, demolished in 1903 to make way for the Uraniastrasse as part the partially built \u00abUrania-axis\u00bb Sihlporte\u2013Uraniastrasse\u2013Z\u00e4hringerplatz by Gustav Gull, and the Urania Sternwarte.\n\n\n=== Fraum\u00fcnster ===\n\nThe Fraum\u00fcnster (\"women's minster\") abbey ruled the town until the 1336 \"guild revolution\" of Rudolf Brun and which remained highly influential until Zwingli's Reformation.\n\n\n== Rathaus ==\n\nThe Rathaus quarter is named for the town hall, built in the 1690s.\nIt is the part of the medieval town on the right side of the Limmat,  separated by the Hirschengraben from the Hochschulen quarter to the east, and delimited by the Bellevue and Central squares to the south and north, respectively. As such, it includes the Limmatquai as well as the Niederdorf (downstream of the Kirchgasse) and the Oberdorf (upstream of the Kirchgasse). The historical name of this eastern half of the medieval town was \"greater town\" (mehrere Stadt), contrasting with the \"lesser town\" (mindere Stadt), the western half along the left river bank.\n\n\n=== Limmatquai ===\n\nThe Limmatquai was built along the right side of the Limmat, running from Central to Bellevue. It was built in the 19th century, connecting various earlier quais built into the Limmat. The current right bank is some 28 m west of the medieval river's. The quai was constructed from 1823\u20131859 from Bellevue to the Rathaus, in 1835\u20131836 from the Rathaus to the Wasserkirche and 1835\u20131839 the portion from the Wasserkirche to Bellevue, formerly called Sonnenquai. At the Limmatquai are located some guild houses, as Zunfthaus zur Zimmerleuten, Zunfthaus zur Haue, Zunfthaus zum R\u00fcden and Zunfthaus zur Saffran.\nZ\u00fcrich tram routes 4 and 15 run along the Limmatquai, serving the stops Helmhaus, Rathaus and Rudolf-Brun-Br\u00fccke. The quai was one of the main routes through the old town before it was freed from traffic in 2004.\nThe bridges passed by the Limmatquai, south to north, are:\n\nQuaibr\u00fccke, connecting Bellevue and B\u00fcrkliplatz,\nM\u00fcnsterbr\u00fccke between Grossm\u00fcnster and Fraum\u00fcnster,\nRathausbr\u00fccke just north of the town hall,\nRudolf-Brun-Br\u00fccke, between M\u00fchlegasse and Uraniastrasse,\nthe M\u00fchlesteg footbridge\nBahnhofbr\u00fccke, between Central and Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof.north of Limmatquai:\n\nWalche-Br\u00fccke\nthe Drahtschmidlisteg, a footbridge to Platzspitz\n\n\n=== Niederdorf ===\nThe Niederdorf (lit.: \"low village\") was the least developed part of the medieval city. It properly includes just the north-eastern corner, between M\u00fchlegasse and Central, but the term was extended to the whole part of the mehrere Stadt north of the town hall, i.e. for the entire length of the Niederdorfstrasse, or even including the parts north of the Kirchgasse.So defined, the Niederdorf includes Rindermarkt and Neumarkt, Froschaugasse and the area of the medieval Jewish quarter, the Predigerkirche (the former Blackfriars' monastery) at Z\u00e4hringerplatz (historically the city hospital, now housing the city library) and the Z\u00e4hringerstrasse.\n\n\n=== M\u00fcnstergasse ===\nThe mehrere Stadt between the Niederdorf and the Oberdorf (between Rathaus and Kirchgasse) includes the M\u00fcnstergasse, Obere Z\u00e4une, Untere Z\u00e4une and the Barf\u00fcsserkloster (the former Franciscan abbey) as well as a number of alleys leaving M\u00fcnstergasse:  Marktgasse, Spiegelgasse, Krebsgasse, Ankengasse, R\u00f6mergasse and Kirchgasse.\n\n\n=== Grossm\u00fcnster ===\n\n\n=== Predigerkirche ===\n\nInitially the church of the Predigerkloster (Dominican monastery), it became after the Reformation in Switzerland the parish church of Niederdorf respectively Neumarkt, and owns since 1900 the tallest church tower of Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n=== Oberdorf ===\nThe Oberdorf (lit.: \"upper village\") proper is the mehrere Stadt south of the Grossm\u00fcnster, along the Oberdorfstrasse, between Kirchgasse and R\u00e4mistrasse.\n\n\n== Hochschulen ==\n\nHochschulen (universities) is wedged between Hirschengraben (the historical course of the eastern moat) and R\u00e4mistrasse, corresponding to the area taken up by the eastern fortifications of the 17th century ramparts (destroyed following the 1839 Z\u00fcriputsch), the hillside now holding the main buildings of both ETH Zurich (built 1861 to 1864 under Gustav Zeuner) and University of Zurich (built 1914 under Karl Moser), at the sites of the Kronen Bollwerk and Sch\u00f6nenberg Bollwerk ramparts, respectively. Hochschulen borders on District 6 (Unterstrass and Oberstrass) to the north, on District 7 (Fluntern and Hottingen) to the east and on District 8 (M\u00fchlebach) and Seefeld) to the south.\nHochschulen in its southern end also includes the Bellevue and Sechsel\u00e4uten squares as well as the theater and opera house at Stadelhoferplatz and the Stadelhofen train station. Stops of the Z\u00fcrich tram system in the Hochschulen quarter are: Central, ETH/Universit\u00e4tsspital, Kantonsschule, Kunsthaus, Neumarkt, Bellevue, Opernhaus and Stadelhofen. Line 9 follows  R\u00e4mistrasse which separates Hochschulen from Fluntern, line 3 follows Hirschengraben and Seilergraben (the historical eastern moat), which separates it from the Rathaus quarter. The Polybahn funicular connects Central and the ETH Zurich main building.\n\n\n=== Central ===\nThe Central square at the northern border between Rathaus and Hochschulen quarters is a major junction of the Z\u00fcrich tram system, served by lines 3, 4, 6, 7, 10 and 15 besides buses 31 and 46. Formerly called Leonhardsplatz, it was renamed after the Hotel Central built in 1883.\n\n\n=== Pfauen ===\nSituated at Heimplatz, vernacularly called the Pfauen, are the theatre Schauspielhaus Z\u00fcrich and the art museum Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n=== Bellevue ===\n\nThe Bellevueplatz, a square at the southern border between the Rathaus quarter and the southern end of the Hochschulen quarter, right next to the lake outflow, is a major junction of the Z\u00fcrich tram system, served by lines 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 15 besides buses 912 and 916. It is situated at the lakeside, just north of Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz. It is named for the Grandhotel Bellevue built in 1856, and is the nodal point of the quaysides that were built between 1881 and 1887 crossing the Quaibr\u00fccke towards B\u00fcrkliplatz and General-Guisan-Quai.\n\n\n=== Stadelhofen ===\nSouth of Bellevue are the squares Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz and Stadelhofenplatz. Stadelhofen was an estate just south of the southeastern-most bastion, the Stadelhofen Bollwerk, whilst Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz takes its name from the Sechsel\u00e4uten, a traditional Z\u00fcrich festival that is celebrated there.\nStadelhofen station, on Stadelhofenplatz, is an important stop of the Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn lines to Uster, Rapperswil-Jona and Winterthur as well as the terminal of the Forchbahn (S18) line serving Zumikon and Esslingen. The Z\u00fcrich Opera House is situated at the southern end of the Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz.\n\n\n== City ==\nCity is the area west of the Bahnhofstrasse, delimited by the Sihl and the Schanzengraben, the moat of the 17th century ramparts. It includes the Paradeplatz, Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof, the Swiss National Museum and the Platzspitz park (formerly Limmatspitz). It comprises the tram stops B\u00fcrkliplatz, Paradeplatz, Rennweg, Bahnhofstrasse / Bahnhofplatz / Bahnhofquai, L\u00f6wenplatz, Sihlstrasse and Bahnhof Selnau. City borders on District 2 (Enge) to the southwest, and on Districts 4 and 5 (Aussersihl) to the northwest.\n\n\n=== Platzspitz ===\n\nPlatzspitz (formerly Platzpromenade, Limmatspitz) is a park at the confluence of the two rivers of Z\u00fcrich; the Limmat and the Sihl.\nIn medieval times, the area situated north of the city was used as pasture. In the early 15th century it was made into a shooting-range, and in the 16th to 17th centuries, Sch\u00fctzenfeste were held there. A remnant of these can be found in the contemporary Knabenschiessen shooting contest.\nDuring the 1990s, the long-practised official tolerance of drug users there from throughout Central Europe has been the subject of much worldwide media interest.\n\n\n=== Hauptbahnhof ===\n\n\n=== Bahnhofstrasse ===\n\n\n=== B\u00fcrkliplatz ===\n\nB\u00fcrkliplatz is a square and stop of the Z\u00fcrich tram system (lines 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and buses 161, 165), situated at the southern end of the Bahnhofstrasse, and west of the Bellevue square, with which it is connected by the Quaibr\u00fccke. The lakeshore quay connecting the square with Lake Zurich is named General-Guisan-Quai, after Henri Guisan. From the B\u00fcrkliplatz landing gate, Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft boat services leave for Thalwil, Rapperswil, Schmerikon, Erlenbach and down the Limmat to Z\u00fcrich Landesmuseum. B\u00fcrkliplatz is named for Arnold B\u00fcrkli (1833\u20131894), the engineer responsible for the construction of the city's quays.\n\n\n=== Schanzengraben ===\n\nOn its remains at \u00abzur Katz\u00bb ramparts, the Old Botanical Garden is located.\n\n\n=== Selnau ===\nSelnau (from earlier Sellnau, Seldnau) was historically an estate west of the city, which came to lie between the north-western moat (Schanzengraben) and the Sihl. Together with the Gessnerallee, Selnaustrasse and Sihlh\u00f6lzlistrasse running along the right bank of the Sihl, it is part of the City quarter even though strictly situated outside the city ramparts. Today, Z\u00fcrich Selnau railway station is a stop on the line of the Uetlibergbahn, running from  Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof to the Sihltal (S4) and to the Uetliberg (S10). The SWX Swiss Exchange building is located in Selnau. The museum Haus Konstruktiv is located in a former power station near Selnau train station.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Z\u00fcrich\nFortifications of Z\u00fcrich\n\n\n== Literature ==\nHeimatkunde der Stadt Z\u00fcrich.

        "wiki": "The Polybahn, also known as the UBS Polybahn, is a funicular railway in the city of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. The line links the Central square with the terrace by the main building of ETH Z\u00fcrich, which was formerly called Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Polytechnikum, and from which the railway derives its name. Previous names for the line include the SBG Polybahn and the Z\u00fcrichbergbahn. The line is owned by the banking group UBS AG, and operated on their behalf by the municipal transport operator Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich.The Polybahn is one of two funiculars within the city of Z\u00fcrich, the other being the Rigiblick funicular in the city's northern suburbs. Additionally, the city's Dolderbahn rack railway was originally a funicular, until its conversion to rack working in the 1970s.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1886 a concession for the railway was issued, and the line was opened by the Z\u00fcrichbergbahn company in 1889. The funicular was initially water-driven (filling water in a ballast tank under the carriage at the top station, emptying at the bottom); the railway was converted to electric drive in 1897.In 1950 the Z\u00fcrichbergbahn company began losing money, and eventually (in the 1970s) decided not to renew the concession. In 1972 a foundation was created to help preserve the Polybahn. In 1976 the Union Bank of Switzerland, then known in German as the Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft or SBG, rescued the Polybahn, branding it as the SBG Polybahn. The line and cars were refurbished for a planned 20 more years service.In 1996 the railway was completely rebuilt. The haulage mechanism was replaced, and fully automated, whilst the old three-rail tracks were replaced with the current two-rail tracks. On 21 October 1996 the railway reopened and is now advertised under the name UBS Polybahn, reflecting the rebranding (in 1998) of the owning banking group as UBS AG. In 1998 the line set a new record, carrying more than 2 million passengers.\n\n\n== Operation ==\nThe line has the following parameters:\nThe standard Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund zonal fare tariffs apply, with the whole of the line being within fare zone 110 (formerly zone 10) (Z\u00fcrich city). However, there is a special flat tariff only applicable to Polybahn for CHF 1.20 per ride.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of funicular railways\nList of funiculars in Switzerland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPage on the Polybahn from the official web site of the VBZ (in German)\nFunimag article on the Polybahn\nVideo of descent of the line from YouTube",

          "The ride lasts for about 2-3 minutes. The coach has about 10 seating places and an outside deck for standing. It connects the Limmatquai street and the Zurich university. Overall, it was an interesting experience (and also a quick way to climb that hill :)).",

          "Connecting downtown Zurich at the river level with the main building of the ETH (the well known Swiss technical University), it is also of interest for those who want to gain an overview over Zurich. While the old train brings you up, you may think of generations of students",

          "All the students use it. It is the fastest way to come from the Central Square uphill to the University and ETH. At rush hours can be quite full and queues are forming at both stations. For a tourist, I find it interesting at least once to use the Polybahn, instead of taking the",

          "It's a quick connection from city center to the University. The journey takes only two minutes. I don't know the price because I bought a 24 hour ticket",
          "If you're going to the university, this saves a few minutes. If you want to experience a funicular, go on one of the two that actually go to the top of a hill and some nature trails. However, if you've got a day rail pass and are next to it, I wouldn't say you shouldn't get on.",
          "Apart from the fun ride the views from the top are great and it is included in your 24 hour public transport ticket",
          "I had been to Zurich a year ago, but only for one day stuffed with sightseeing. One thing I missed was the recommended Polybahn, situated to bring people to a height that would be formidable if one were forced to climb stairs to it. For those of you who have been on funiculars",
          "UBS Polybahn is a nice attraction if you have spare time during your visit in Zurich! The tickets are not very cheap though, especially for the tourist who probably got used to cheaper prices (since don't forget that Switzerland is famous for its high prices). It is a nice ride",
          "The Polybahn is a cute little detail of Zurich. Kids of all ages will enjoy this steep open air ride, taking you straight from the tram hub of Central square, to the ETHZ, the Swiss federal polytechnic, the richest University in Europe, and the one with the most Nobel prize",
          "Part of our city tour, we took the Polybahn to the top of the mountain for an awesome view of Zurich.",
          "interesting small ride, just 3 minutes. It does not really go anywhere ( just the university ) and mostly students and staff use it.",
          "We took the polybahn up to the university because we heard there were great views of the city from there. It was a very short ride (<2min) and the views were great.",
          "It's a quick connection from Central to ETH/University. Even so the journey only takes about 2' and costs less than a bun, NEVER forget to buy a ticket (it's included in Zone 10 - Zurich City), as checks are frequent.",
          "Very convenient and easily accessible. I used to take it daily during my stay there. Going up and down is very much fun.",
          "When we were last in Zurich two years ago, I seriously wondered what they\u2019d put in my scrambled eggs at the Hotel du Theatre... Their breakfast room overlooks the street, and that\u2019s exactly what I was sleepily doing when \u2013 out of a hole in an old office building to my left \u2013",
          "A fun ride and a good way to get to the ETH platform from where you have a fabulous view over Zurich. The Polybahn itself is an interesting piece of engineering - with a lot of (historical) technology in it.",
          "Handy, very fast, alternative to climb to the museums etc. It's a pitty that the service already ends at 7 pm.",
          "I use the polybahn to get to the University. It is a two minute ride which takes you from Central (next to Starbucks) up to the Campus. There is a small outside area and well as enclosed sitting. It is a quick, fun trip especially for children and gives one another perspective",
          "If you already have a ZVV pass for the city of Zuerich that is already validated (i.e. you can take the trams, etc.), then this is free. ;) I wouldn't buy a ticket just to ride it - it's a really short trip! But the views from the University/ETH patio are really good, and",
          "Took the polybahn up the hill to look at the view this morning. We had a 24 hour travel card, so we were able to just hop on. It's only a short ride, but the view at the top is good. Well worth the ride.",
          "A fun way of getting up to a lovely look out over Zurich. We saw an area we probably wouldn't have got too otherwise.",
          "Make a visit to the polytechnic state owned university ETh, the place where Albert Einstein studied and Zurich university with their fantastic terrace where on weekdays diverse foodtrucks set up on lunchtime is really worth your while specially if you are Vegan or",
          "The funicular is not the best to ride. I have seen steeper, higher, older and much advanced than this one. However, it can be an introduction to Funiculars for a novice. Also if you need to see ETH, this is the best way to get to it.",
          "This is a two cabinned train plying between Zurich Central and Zurich Institute of Technology. It will not be of any attraction to any tourist who has travelled in a Funicular anywhere in the world. The journey is just around two minutes .The trip may be interesting to children",
          "I still love the Polybahn. Completely restored, simple little cable car that runs between the Bellevue and the University. It's charming! Get in the front if you can, so you are outside and can see how it works. At the top, on a nice day, go to the first university building",
          "A short funicular ride from near Central to the ETH. Ride is only a few minutes. Interesting if you need to get to the ETH or like funiculars.",
          "Very interesting and unique mean of transportation. In only a few minutes you can get from Central to the ETH main building (elevation of around 40m). The cablecar is crossing a busy street. Tip: if it is not raining stay at the very end of the car where there are no windows, so",
          "the little cablecar climbing the few hundred meters up to the Technical Highschool and the University. From the terrasse here you have a splendid view over the town. The city tickets (tram and buses) is also valid for this cablecar.",
          "You get on and before you know it you get off. Only a few minutes. Nothing to go out of your way to do, but cute way to transport to the top.",
          "A nice and simple way to get up the mountain. It's a very short ride and you mostly see trees but the view is great once you get up. Your public transportation card works here and it runs every 2-3 minutes.",
          "Short but fun in my opinion. Connects the station to a very nice panoramic viewpoint, the ETH Polyterrasse. The trip is the blink of an eye long and tourists would definitely stand out from the crowd of university students. The trip is enjoyable too.",
          "During our recent visit to Zurich, we decided to take the short train ride on the Polybahn. The polybahn is located in the main square, close to the Central station on the other side of the river. Owned by the UBS Group, its also known as UBS Polybahn The ride is pretty short,",
          "It was our last night in Zuirich with the Friendship Force group from Milwaukee and we saw this little red car go over our heads up the hill towards the university. After some exploring, we found where it left from. Because we had Swiss Trail Passes there was no charge for",
          "rode the train from Zurich to Geneva. Had a bit of difficulty what we were supposed to do with our suitcases.",
          "Very easy to find off the tram line! Reasonably priced. Just about a 5 minute trip up the hill to a beautiful lookout over the city of Zurich. I just went up and took a few pictures before heading down. U can walk up but this was a fun, historical thing to do!",
          "This little old train has been part of Zurich as long as I can remember. Short and cute little ride up the hill for an amazing view.",
          "saw it come down, got on it. and after 10 minutes, told it was out of order. damn. sat 11 April. But it was comfortable while it stood there and the glass was clean. But that didn't stop me and the moaning little one to have to walk up the hill",
          "The 200 meter ride with the old Polybahn is worth it to get to the Polyterrasse where one can enjoy the view over Zurich. Do not go there only for the funicular.",
          "Its a really short drive but its a cute little train and its very old. you can get off on top and walk back down for an amazing view of the old town",
          "Clean, regular and always on time. Easily accessible by a few steps, great for those with difficulty getting up the hills!",
          "This is a small historical train, specially built to climb the steep side of the Zurichberg. It connects Central - a major tram hub just across the river Limmat from the Hauptbahnhof (main train station) - to the central building of the Swiss Federal Polytechnical Institute",
          "The bahn is cool, the politerrace is breathtaking. Take the bahn, and check out how the students can spend their time in breaks. Amazing view, I wish I was again a student, and in Zurich!",
          "A short ride up to the ETH, with a wonderful view over the city of Z\u00fcrich. Its a nice way to get to see more of the city than just walking through it. Do make sure to buy a ticket, as they do sometimes check when you get to the top...",
          "Close to the main Station, the Polybahn brings you within a Minute to the terrace of the University from where you have an excellent view over the roofs of the City. Don't miss it!",
          "The Polybahn is nothing more then a way to get to the viewpoint above. It's a quick trip and once there, go to the right for a sweeping view of the city. Einsteins college is right in front of you and worth a quick walk around the building.",
          "This is great for little kids (and big kids who like mini railways!). It's only a short ride but it's quaint and cute. Definitely not an essential part of Zurich but if you're staying near by, it's cheap to do. There is nothing much at the top, just an average view over the",
          "I like the very little cabin, the old fashioned way of travelling and the short trip up to the Polyterasse. You see tourists, students and local people in here. Everyone uses the Polybahn. But: Remind the opening hours. Sometimes I was too late.",
          "If you have not been on a cog railway this is a real easy trip the access is from the river close to the old part of Zurich. There are great views over the city and the Alps from the top, and is free if you have at ravel card.",

          "A little confused how it worked but got the hang of getting our tickets out of a machine and up we went. Out at the top and walked about a minute and found a flat area with some great views. Then back down we went. Go for it!",
          "Have you ever been on a cable car? No - well, 5 minutes from the Zurich main station you can fetch a ride with this charming \"funicular\" (latin name for a train going up and down on a cable - the car is still on tracks). It is included in the city 24hr daypass, and you'll get",

          "After we changed from a terrible hotel to a new one ( Limmathof\") - we found our view out of the window was of the funicular which takes you up to the University building. This was a really pretty site and not as noisy as you would expect !",
          "This little train takes you up the side of a hill from the central station to the university at the top of the hill although not too far but worth a try",

          "i love this short cable car. it looks and behaves like the ones in the mountains (stoos, grimsel, pilatus, ...) but is just way shorter and in the center of z\u00fcrich. you dont need a special ticket, its in the vbz-network, so any z\u00fcrich ticket works.",

        "wiki": "Lake Zurich is a village in Lake County, Illinois, United States, a northwest suburb of Chicago. The population was 19,631 at the 2010 census.The village is named after a body of water named \"Lake Zurich,\" which is completely located inside the village.\nIn 2015, personal finance website, NerdWallet.com, rated Lake Zurich number one in Illinois for young families. In 2006, Lake Zurich was named by Frommer's as one of the top hundred \"Best Places to Raise Your Family\" and by U.S. News as one of the \"Top Twenty-five Affordable Places to Live in the Country\". In 2013, Lake Zurich achieved national recognition when Sandra Bullock's character in Gravity name-dropped the village as her character's hometown.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLake Zurich is located at 42\u00b011\u203232\u2033N 88\u00b05\u203217\u2033W (42.192324, -88.088098), with an elevation of 850 feet (260 m) above sea level.\nAccording to the 2010 census, Lake Zurich has a total area of 7.187 square miles (18.61 km2), of which 6.77 square miles (17.53 km2) (or 94.2%) is land and 0.417 square miles (1.08 km2) (or 5.8%) is water.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 18,104 people, 5,746 households, and 4,866 families residing in the village. The population density was 2,792.3 people per square mile (1,078.7/km\u00b2). There were 5,828 housing units at an average density of 898.9 per square mile (347.3/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the village was 92.31% White, 0.81% African American, 0.17% Native American, 3.82% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 1.97% from other races, and 0.92% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.55% of the population.\nThere were 5,746 households out of which 54.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 75.3% were married couples living together, 7.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 15.3% were non-families. 12.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 3.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.12 and the average family size was 3.42.\nIn the village, the population was spread out with 34.1% under the age of 18, 5.0% from 18 to 24, 34.1% from 25 to 44, 21.0% from 45 to 64, and 5.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.4 males.\nAccording to a 2007 estimate, the median income for a household in the village was $101,872, and the median income for a family was $108,108. Males had a median income of $63,909 versus $43,047 for females. The per capita income for the village was $30,287. About 2.0% of families and 2.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.9% of those under age 18 and 5.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area of Lake Zurich was first settled by European descendants in the 1830s. Two early pioneers were George Ela, after whom the Ela township is named, and Seth Paine, who established a number of commercial ventures in the town. New England farmers moved to the area in the 1830s and 1840s, and German immigrants began to move to the area later in the middle of the 19th century. The lake now known as Lake Zurich was named Cedar Lake at the time. The village of Lake Zurich was incorporated on September 29, 1896. It remained primarily a farming community; although the village was connected to the railroad in 1910, the line was closed ten years later. However, the arrival of the highway system with Rand Road (U.S. Route 12) in 1922 and Half Day Road (Illinois Route 22) in 1927 established Lake Zurich as a convenient summer resort. The now-defunct Palatine, Lake Zurich and Wauconda Railroad also served the community. Housing development began in the 1950s, with the population increasing throughout the latter part of the 20th century.\nIn 1988, a historic, landmark legal case in Illinois took place settling a dispute on Lake Zurich, thereby clarifying throughout Illinois property owners' rights on private lakes. In 1988, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled in Beacham v. Lake Zurich Property Owners Association (123 Ill. 2d 227; 526 N.E.2d 154; 1988 Ill. LEXIS 91; 122 Ill. Dec 14, filed June 20, 1988) that each individual owner of the private (aka non-public) lake's bottom has the legal right to recreate over the surface waters of the entire private lake.  The High Court ruled that by ownership of a lake bottom land, each partial-lake-bottom owner of a private lake can not be prohibited from recreating on the surface waters that may be located above other owners' lake bottom properties.  Riparian land rights were defined in Illinois.\n\n\n== Eminent domain controversy ==\nThe village government has used eminent domain to obtain properties in an attempt to increase downtown revenue via new businesses. As of 2004 Lake Zurich had acquired all the property intended to fulfill its downtown redevelopment project. While many protests occurred regularly throughout 2005 near the promenade, the protests failed to garner much attention and ended up failing. A 2007 court defeat brought the issue back into the public eye, as a village-owned rental parcel was denied eminent domain. The renters were granted the ability to stay through the end of their lease due to clerical errors made by the village's legal and administrative employees regarding this parcel in particular.\n\n\n== Village government ==\nThe village of Lake Zurich is headed by Village President Thomas Poynton, who was reelected in 2017, and originally won a seat on the village board as Trustee in 2007. The village has a six-member Board of Trustees.  Mary Beth Euker was elected village trustee in 2017 to a 4-year term; Jim Beaudoin was re-elected in 2017 to 4-year terms; Jon Sprawka, Marc Spacone were elected in 2015 to 4-year terms and re-elected in 2019. Greg Weider was appointed in 2016 and elected in 2017 to a 4-year term. Janice Gannon was elected to a 4 year term in 2019. Kathleen Johnson was re-elected Village Clerk in 2017.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nLake Zurich is the hometown of Sandra Bullock's character Dr. Ryan Stone in the 2013 science fiction film Gravity.Lake Zurich is also the hometown of Sam Holtz, the sixth-grader sports-picking prodigy who won first place in the 2015 ESPN NCAA Bracket Challenge, beating 11.57 million other submitted brackets and earning national fame.Lake Zurich is also the name of a song from a Gorillaz album named \u201cThe Now Now\u201d.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nMatt Blanchard, former National Football League player\nLeo Burnett, creator of Tony the Tiger, Charlie the Tuna, the Marlboro Man, and the Maytag Repairman, and founder of the company that would become Leo Burnett Worldwide.\nAl Salvi, former Illinois state legislator and 1996 Republican U.S. Senate nominee\nPhoebe Snetsinger, notable birdwatcher. She was raised in Lake Zurich.\nJustin Tranter, songwriter and singer for Semi Precious Weapons.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Public schools ===\nPublic schools are managed by the Lake Zurich Lake Zurich Community Unit School District 95. A small section of east Lake Zurich is served by Kildeer Countryside Community Consolidated School District 96 and Consolidated High School District 125.\nElementary schools (K-5):\n\nIsaac Fox\nSarah Adams\nSeth Paine\nSpencer Loomis\nMay WhitneyUntil 2009, Charles Quentin Elementary School was also a school in the district, located in nearby Kildeer, that served students in Kildeer, parts of Deer Park and a small part of Lake Zurich, but it closed due to the small total number of students attending it.  The district was remapped and students attending Charles Quentin were assigned to various other schools.

        "wiki": "Trams make an important contribution to public transport in the city of Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland. The tram network serves most city neighbourhoods, and is the backbone of public transport within the city, albeit supplemented by the inner sections of the Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn, along with urban trolleybus and bus routes as well as two funicular railways and one rack railway. The trams and other city transport modes operate within a fare regime provided by the cantonal public transport authority Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV), which also covers regional rail and bus services.The city's trams are operated by the Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich (VBZ), which also manages the tramway infrastructure within the city, but the city's tram tracks are also used by two other operations. The Glattalbahn tram services to the Glattal area to the north of the city interwork with the city tram services and are also operated by the VBZ, although in this case it does so as a sub-contractor to the Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal (VBG). Trains of the independent Forchbahn (FB) light railway also use the city's tram lines to reach their city centre terminus.Trams have been a consistent part of Z\u00fcrich's streetscape since the 1880s, when the first horse tram ran. Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by trolleybuses and by a metro or U-Bahn. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a new light rail system in the Limmat Valley that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\n\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft (ZStG), a private company, and were of standard gauge (1,435 mm or 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in gauge) and horse-drawn.By 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich (EStZ), started operating metre gauge (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.Further tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.\n\n\n=== Many companies ===\n\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below. Names of companies whose lines were entirely outside the current city boundaries are shown in italic type, and those which still operate tram or other light rail services are shown in bold type.\n\n\n=== Heyday of the StStZ ===\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the StStZ had acquired all the companies that had operated tramways within the city boundaries, with the single exception of the Dolderbahn, which had closed its short tramway in 1930. The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.However, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first motor bus route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the city's trolleybus routes. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.In 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the Swiss Standard Tram. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the second world war slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.\n\n\n=== Lines closed ===\n\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over. In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\nThe Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.\nThe Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.\nThe Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.\nThe Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.In the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.\n\n\n=== Underground proposals ===\n\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the Tiefbahn. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or Karpfen, could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the Mirage.Despite the planning and new rolling stock, a referendum in 1962 rejected the Tiefbahn. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale metro, the Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.In 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the Uetliberg and Sihltal railway lines under the Hauptbahnhof.\n\n\n=== Extensions and a new model ===\n\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to Werdh\u00f6lzli. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.The Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with island platforms, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their nearside, the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.From 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the Tram 2000 design used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.From the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the modal split, and the Z\u00fcrich model of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the ZVV and its zone-based common fare structure.\n\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the Cobra. Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the Glattal region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of Z\u00fcrich Airport. Whilst the airport is served by the city's S-Bahn rail network, the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the Glattalbahn. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.The arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles. The Karpfen last ran in regular service in 2006, and the Mirage in 2010. Many members of both classes have been transferred to Vinnytsia in Ukraine.\n\n\n=== More extensions and Mirages make a comeback ===\n\"Tram Z\u00fcrich West\", an extension from Escher-Wyss-Platz to Bahnhof Altstetten Nord, in the city of Z\u00fcrich, opened in December 2011. The resulting reorganisation of routes included a new route 17 from Hauptbahnhof to Werdh\u00f6lzli via Escher-Wyss-Platz, and the diversion of route 4, which had previously served Werdh\u00f6lzli, to Altstetten. In 2017, route 8 was extended from Hardplatz to Hardturm, via new track over Hardbr\u00fccke, the first tram line to cross the main railway line through Z\u00fcrich.In September 2019, city route 2 was extended from Farbhof to Geissweid, a distance of 2.9 kilometres (1.8 mi) with seven stops. The new route operates over the first section of the Limmattalbahn to open, and replaces trolleybus route 31 over that section. Once the Limmatalbahn is completed, it will also carry a separate regional light rail service from Bahnhof Altstetten to Killwangen-Spreitenbach, although that service will not form part of the city tram network and will be operated by the BDWM.The extension of route 2, together with a delay to the delivery of the Bombardier Flexity trams on order (see Future developments), required a reorganisation of other routes in order to free up trams for route 2. In addition two Mirage trams, withdrawn from service nearly ten years earlier but held in reserve, were reinstated to cover some peak workings. The first of the new Flexity trams arrived in Z\u00fcrich on 13 November 2019, but it is not expected to enter passenger service until the summer of 2020.\n\n\n=== History preserved ===\nThe Z\u00fcrich Tram Museum, located at the former tram depot at Burgwies (on tram route 11), preserves many examples of Z\u00fcrich's former tramcar fleet, along with other related exhibits.\n\n\n== Operation ==\n\n\n=== Route network ===\n\nThe following tram routes make up the urban and Glattalbahn route network:\n\nAll journeys on routes 6, 10 and 12 are operated by low-floor trams, whilst at least every other journey on lines 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14 are provided by such vehicles. Most, but not all, tram stops are configured to allow passengers in wheelchairs to board low-floor trams.Of the three routes that operate in part over Glattalbahn tracks, routes 10 and 12 are operated by the VBZ on behalf of the Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal (VBG), normally using tramcars in the VBG's own predominantly white colour scheme, whilst route 11 is operated by the VBZ on its own behalf, normally using vehicles in its own livery.The independent Forchbahn (FB) railway uses VBZ trackwork to reach their city centre terminus, at Bahnhof Stadelhofen, from the eastern edge of the city, at Rehalp. The FB trains operate largely in the street for this section of their route, sharing track with VBZ tram routes, but are categorised as route S18 of the city's S-Bahn railway network rather than as part of the tram network. Beyond Rehalp the trains use the FB's own segregated tracks to reach their outer terminus at Esslingen.On the last weekend of each month, the Z\u00fcrich Tram Museum operates tram route 21 from the city centre to the museum at Burgwies (up to Rehalp at Saturdays), using their own heritage rolling stock.\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n\nZ\u00fcrich's tram network is built to metre gauge (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in gauge). There are 171.9 kilometres (106.8 mi) of track, equating to a network length of 72.9 kilometres (45.3 mi) and a total route length of 118.7 kilometres (73.8 mi). The tracks are electrified using overhead line at 600 V DC, utilising a supply system shared with the city's trolleybus network.The VBZ infrastructure within Z\u00fcrich is largely street based, with varying degrees of segregation from other street traffic and significant sections where trams run in unrestricted traffic lanes. In the city centre the tram tracks run through largely pedestrianised streets, and in one place in the suburbs the trams use a tunnel originally constructed for the never completed Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn system. By contrast, on VBG infrastructure in the Stadtbahn Glattal, VBZ trams operate on long stretches of dedicated track.Many of Z\u00fcrich's tram stops have been equipped with boarding platforms raised to match the floor height of the low floor trams, although there are still examples of stops where passengers must board from street level. Z\u00fcrich's trams are single-ended, with doors on only one side, although Forchbahn trains are double-ended and double-sided. In consequence all terminal locations are equipped with turning loops, and all tram stops are to the nearside of the tram.\n\n\n=== Depots and workshops ===\n\nZ\u00fcrich's tram fleet is kept in the five operational depots of Hard, Irchel, Kalkbreite, Oerlikon and  Wollishofen, together with a permanent way yard at Hardturm. Whilst these depots have the capability to undertake minor maintenance, heavier maintenance is the responsibility of the VBZ's central workshop at Altstetten. This is connected to the tram network, and also has a rail connection to the Swiss Federal Railway system, allowing the delivery of infrastructure items and vehicles by rail.In addition to the above depots and workshops, two other former tram depots, at Burgweis and Wartau, are also still connected to the tram network. Burgweis depot now houses the Tram-Museum Z\u00fcrich main collection, whilst Wartau is used as a workshop by that organisation. The rail connections permit the occasional operation of preserved trams on the VBZ network.\n\n\n=== Tram fleet ===\nAs of 2012, the VBZ owns 313 tram vehicles, which between them cover over 16 million vehicle-kilometres per year. All regular public services are covered by 289 vehicles of two basic classes, with the remainder of the fleet made up of a number of assorted works vehicles, including some used for the cargo tram service, and heritage vehicles. The heritage fleet sees occasional use on special services.The tram fleet comprises the following vehicles:\n\n\n=== Fares and tickets ===\n\nLike the rest of the VBZ network, Z\u00fcrich's tram network operates on a proof-of-payment system. All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle. Passengers may board through any door and are not required to show tickets on boarding. Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.Tram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the canton of Z\u00fcrich and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn suburban rail network. Free transfer is permitted between different vehicles, routes, modes and operators, provided a ticket valid for the whole journey is held.The ZVV system is zone-based, with fares for individual journeys set by the zones the journey passes through. The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes. Both single journey and day tickets are available, as are a number of passes with longer validities.\n\n\n=== Cargo tram ===\n\nBesides its passenger transport activities, VBZ, jointly with the city refuse and recycling department ERZ, operates the cargo tram to collect bulky waste. The cargo tram serves 10 different collection points around Z\u00fcrich, calling at each on different days of the month. The collected refuse is taken to a specially constructed siding at the ERZ yard adjacent to the Werdh\u00f6lzli tram terminus.The service was introduced in 2003, as an attempt to reduce the amount of bulky waste items dumped illegally every year. As Z\u00fcrich has an extensive tram network serving most neighbourhoods, and many suitable sidings not used by regular services, it was decided to use the tram network. In its first year of operation it was responsible for the collection of 380 tonnes (370 long tons; 420 short tons) of waste.The collected waste is carried in two standard refuse containers, which are mounted on four-wheeled flat wagons. These are hauled by car 1922, a former Swiss Standard Tram, originally delivered to Z\u00fcrich in 1940, and converted into a works car in 1980.\n\n\n== Future developments ==\n\n\n=== New vehicles ===\n\nThe VBZ has long intended to order a new generation of tram cars, to replace the high-floor Tram 2000 trams currently in service. By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the Stadler Tango, the Siemens Combino and the Bombardier Flexity. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids. As of February 2015, no decision had been made as to which supplier to select, with reports of conflict between city and canton authorities.In May 2016, it was announced that VBZ had awarded a contract worth 358 million Swiss Francs to Bombardier Transportation for the supply of 70 7-section Flexity 2 trams, with an option for a further 70, to be delivered between 2018 and 2023. The new trams will be 43 metres (141 ft) long and 2.4 metres (7 ft 10 in) wide, and be capable of carrying 90 seated and 186 standing passengers. Both Stadler Rail and Siemens filed complaints with the Administrative Court of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich, causing the finalisation of the contract to be suspended, but the court ruled in February 2017 that VBZ could conclude the contract with Bombardier. After both Stadler and Siemens decided not to appeal this decision to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, the contract was finally signed on 2 March 2017. The first car of the order arrived in Z\u00fcrich in November 2019, but they are not expected to enter passenger service until the summer of 2020.\n\n\n=== System expansion ===\nIn the Limmat Valley, between Bahnhof Altstetten and Bahnhof Killwangen-Spreitenbach, the Limmattal light rail line is under construction, after being approved by a referendum held in November 2015. The first section of the line opened in September 2019, and this section connects to the VBZ tram system at Farbhof, the former terminus of route 2. That route has been extended over the light rail line as far as Schlieren, as a partial replacement for trolleybus route 31. Work is now underway on the rest of the line, and once that is completed it will also carry a regional light rail service between Bahnhof Altstetten and Killwangen-Spreitenbach. It was announced in May 2016 that this service would be operated by BDWM.There are also plans for a number of other extensions to be built up to 2025.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of railway companies in Switzerland\nList of town tramway systems in Switzerland\nTrolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBernet, Ralph (2000).

        "wiki": "The Wasserkirche (\"Water Church\") of Z\u00fcrich, first mentioned as  ecclesia Aquatica Turicensi around 1250 and as wazzirkilcha in 1256, is a church built on a small island in the Limmat, situated between the two main churches of medieval Z\u00fcrich, the Grossm\u00fcnster and the Fraum\u00fcnster, at the Limmatquai and the M\u00fcnsterbr\u00fccke.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIt seems likely that the original building was used for cult meetings. The meetings were centred on a stone now located in the crypt of the church. According to medieval tradition, the site was used for the execution of Saints Felix and Regula. The church was built in the 10th century and modified at various points, culminating in a complete reconstruction that was completed in 1486. During the course of the Reformation, the Wasserkirche was identified as a place of idolatry. Eventually it was secularised, becoming the first public library of Z\u00fcrich in 1634, when it became a seat of learning that greatly contributed to the foundation of University of Z\u00fcrich in the 19th century. The island was connected with the right bank of the Limmat in 1839 with the construction of the Limmatquai. The library was merged into the Zentralbibliothek in 1917, and the church was used as a storage room for crops for some time, until reconstruction work and archaeological excavations were undertaken in 1940.  Following this the building was again used for services by the Evangelical-Reformed State Church of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich.\n\nThe Helmhaus is an extension of the church to the north, first mentioned in 1253 as a court of criminal justice, at which time it was a simple wooden structure covering the eastern end of the bridge.  It was extended to a larger wooden structure in 1563, and replaced with a stonework hall in 1791.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage of national importance ==\nThe building Helmhaus und Wasserkirche is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance.\n\n\n== References ==\n Media related to Wasserkirche at Wikimedia Commons\n\nKonrad Escher, Die Kunstdenkm\u00e4ler des Kantons Z\u00fcrich, vol.

        "wiki": "Gr\u00fcn Stadt Z\u00fcrich, commonly shortened to GSZ, is the Office of Parks and Open Spaces being a service of the Civil Engineering and Waste Management Department of Swiss city of Z\u00fcrich. Gsz is responsible for creating, preserving and maintaining the city's park system, sports facilities, urban forests, cemeteries, public swimming pools and playgrounds. Ten farms, nine of which are leased out, several nature schools, the local plant nursery, the Succulent Plant Collection and the Chinagarten are also operated, as well as the Quaianlagen promenades at the Z\u00fcrichsee lake shore.\n\n\n== Scope of activities ==\nThe department includes five divisions: Operations, Services, Promotion of Nature, Planning/Construction and Maintenance.\n\n\n=== Operations ===\nThe Operations Division includes the nine municipal farms which are leased out and the agricultural estate \"Juchhof\". The \"Juchhof\" meets the requirements of the Swiss Ecologic Performance Record (\u00f6kologischer Leistungsnachweis \u00d6LN). The city forest, which covers an area of about 3,000 acres, is managed sustainably by the \"Waldrevier Uetliberg\" and \"Waldrevier Nord\". The municipal plant nursery, which organizes various courses and events on all aspects of \u2018Green Knowledge,\u2019 belongs to this division too, as well as the lease of roughly 6,000 garden allotments. The subdivision \"Workshop and Logistics\", which includes wood working, painting and mechanical workshops, is responsible for material acquisition, the vehicle fleet and repairs.\n\n\n=== Services ===\nThe Services Division provides commercial supporting benefits. It coordinates the economic processes, especially in Human Resources, Finances, Systems Management (Informatics and Geographic Information Systems GIS) and Legal departments. The Services Division's activities are apparent at the job market, as the results of regular user surveys that generate an impact balance sheet, on annual and financial reports and through quality management.\n\n\n=== Promotion of Nature ===\nThe Promotion of Nature Division advocates for the preservation and conservation of valuable plant and animal habitats. Its goal is to awaken the joy of nature and to show the value of a manifold city nature to city dwellers. The four municipal gamekeepers ensure the harmonic coexistence of humans and wild animals. The nature schools provide age-appropriate experiences for the schoolchildren of Zurich. A wide range of courses and events foster the understanding of nature. Since 1931, the Succulent Plant Collection has accommodated one of the largest and most important special collections of succulent plants, including roughly 6,500 different species from more than 50 different plant families.\n\n\n=== Planning/Construction ===\nOpen space planning, open space promotion, monuments preservation and construction projects make up the backbone of this division. It ranges from future planning and concept design of new green and open spaces to the promotion of concrete building projects to the protection and development of valuable parks within the city. In addition, this division is responsible for the construction and maintenance of parks, cemeteries, sport facilities, schools and swimming pools in urban areas that include regional public facilities.\n\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThere are roughly 200 employees in this division devoted to the care of parks and facilities, city trees, playgrounds, streams, cemeteries and tombs, sport facilities and fields, as well as swimming pools. This division works with the sustainability principle and advocates for the preservation of biodiversity. The green area of the city is divided into 12 districts, which are managed by Green Space Managers, who are contact people for district residents.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlready at the end of the 18th century, a gardener was employed for the maintenance of the new facility \"Sihlh\u00f6lzli\" and other public facilities. The beginning of the official municipal garden management dates from 1858 when Casper Hartmanns was named the first city gardener. Before then, urban promenades were maintained by city employees, who were not always qualified as gardeners.The opening of the so-called Quaianlagen in 1887 as well as the first large incorporation of independent municipalities around the city's downtown area transformed Zurich into Switzerland's first large city. The circumstances transformed the scope of activities of the garden administration immensely. Gottlieb Friedrich Rothpletz took over in 1900, the promenade formerly being the responsibility of the city gardener, and in 1902 was made the head of the new horticulture office. His influence still can be seen through the spirit of German landscape architect and social reformer, Leberecht Migge. Migge drafted a public park that considered the city forest as a local recreational area, in opposition to decorative parks like Belvoirpark.At the end of the 1920s, cactus grower Jakob Gasser wanted to sell his collection to the city of Zurich. The venture failed miserably. In 1929, the department store owner, Julius Brann, purchased the collection and gave it to the city as a gift. Botany professor Carl Schr\u00f6ter convinced the city that to accept the collection. Two years later, present day's Succulent Plant Collection, with the name \"St\u00e4dtische Kakteensammlung,\" were brought to its new home at the city's greenhouse in the former plant nursery.In 1934, the second incorporation of the city took place which expanded the area of which the garden department was responsible. From 1940 the city's green spaces were converted into farm fields to provide enough food during World War II and increase the self-sufficiency of the country. In 1941, the new plant nursery was completed in Sackzelg.\nThe people acquired a taste for gardening from the so-called \"war gardens\" and starting in 1946 small garden allotment areas were set up. In 1959, Walter Frischknecht advocated for the reuse of G59 - 1st Swiss Horticulture Exhibition lands and for other garden design projects in the garden department. Over the course of his career, he developed other projects, such as the rose facility \"Muraltengut\" (1960), the \"Seeuferweg\" (1963), the lake promenade \"Utoquai\" (1971), the \"Schanzengraben\" (1982\u20131984) and the \"Irisgarten\" (1985).From 1969, the first vineyards were planted below the church in H\u00f6ngg from the initiative of Heinrich Zweifel. The western part of \"Chillesteig\" was cultivated shortly after the eastern part. From the late 1960s to the mid-70s, the lack of manpower led to insufficient maintenance of the green spaces. In 1975 a full-time Human Resources Department, including an administrative secretary, was formed that was responsible for about 400 employees.\nIn 1985, the residents of Zurich defended supported the preservation of green and open spaces through several referendums which led to the Garden Department's creation of a green space concept. In the same year, the Conservation Subdivision was formed, followed by the Garden Monument Preservation Subdivision in 1989.In 1996 the first large restructuring of Gr\u00fcn Stadt Z\u00fcrich took place when the Agricultural Subdivision which was originally located in the Health and Economic Subdivision was combined with the Garden Department and placed in the Civil Engineering and Waste Management Department. The Garden Department was renamed the Garden and Agricultural Department, and Irchelpark, Z\u00fcrich's widest park was opened. Four years later, Ernst Tschannen was given the task to combine the Garden, Agricultural and Forest Departments. In 2000, the new department, directed by Tschannen, was called \"Gr\u00fcn Stadt Z\u00fcrich\".\nFrom 2001 to 2005, several new parks were created in northern Zurich: the Oerliker Park (2001), the MFO-Park (2002), the Louis-H\u00e4fliger-Park (2003), the Wahlenpark (2005) and the Leutschenpark (2008) which are distinguished by their modern and contemporary design.\nFrom 2002 until 2011, the GSZ published Gr\u00fcnzeit, a quarterly magazine. The first \"Gr\u00fcnForum,\" which is a public event that includes presentations on current topics and podium discussions, took place in 2003 and takes place annually.\nIn 2006, the GSZ published The Green Book of Zurich which describes the department's strategy for the next ten years.The first playground which was created with input from the local children was opened in 2007 in the Hardau. In 2008 Gr\u00fcn Stadt Z\u00fcrich had the opportunity to temporarily use a fallow field with the objective of promotion of nature, especially for schoolchildren.\nThe Zurich wilderness park is operated as an independent foundation which has been called a nature adventure park since September 2009. In January 2010, Gr\u00fcn Stadt Z\u00fcrich  took over management of the \"Chinagarten\" from the Water Supply Department.In July 2011, Gr\u00fcn Stadt Z\u00fcrich, in corporation with the Swiss Landscape Architects Association (Bund Schweizerischer Landschaftsarchitektinnen und Landschaftsarchitekten), will host the 48th International Federation of Landscape Architects World Congress (IFLA).\nIn October 2013 Christine Br\u00e4m took over the post of CEO.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAnne Hansen, Men Kr\u00e4uchi: Z\u00fcrichs gr\u00fcne Inseln: unterwegs in 75 G\u00e4rten und Parks.

        "wiki": "A department store is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different product categories known as \"departments\".  In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (Le Bon March\u00e9 in 1852) and in New York (with Stewart's).Today, departments often include the following: clothing, furniture, home appliances, toys, cosmetics, houseware, gardening, toiletries, sporting goods, do it yourself, paint, and hardware. Additionally, other lines of products such as food, books, jewelry, electronics, stationery, photographic equipment, baby products, and products for pets are sometimes included. Customers generally check out near the front of the store, although some stores include sales counters within each department. Some stores are one of many within a larger retail chain, while others are independent retailers. In the 1970s, they came under heavy pressure from discounters, and have come under even heavier pressure from e-commerce sites since 2010. Big-box stores, hypermarkets, and discount stores are comparable to historical department stores.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Britain ===\nThe origins of the departmental store lay in the growth of the conspicuous consumer society at the turn of the 19th century. As the Industrial Revolution accelerated economic expansion, the affluent middle-class grew in size and wealth. Urbanized social groups, sharing a culture of consumption and changing fashions, were the catalyst for the retail revolution. As rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people, especially women (who found they could shop unaccompanied at department stores without damaging their reputation), with disposable income in the late Georgian period, window shopping was transformed into a leisure activity and entrepreneurs, like the potter Josiah Wedgwood, pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence the prevailing tastes and preferences of society. Department stores also often featured post services, childcare services, restaurants and other services that appealed to female shoppers.One of the first department stores may have been Bennett's in Derby, first established as an ironmonger (hardware shop) in 1734. It still stands to this day, trading in the same building. However, the first reliably dated department store to be established, was Harding, Howell & Co, which opened in 1796 on Pall Mall, London. An observer writing in Ackermann's Repository, a British periodical on contemporary taste and fashion, described the enterprise in 1809 as follows:\n\nThe house is one hundred and fifty feet in length from front to back, and of proportionate width. It is fitted up with great taste, and is divided by glazed partitions into four departments, for the various branches of the extensive business, which is there carried on. Immediately at the entrance is the first department, which is exclusively appropriated to the sale of furs and fans. The second contains articles of haberdashery of every description, silks, muslins, lace, gloves, &etc. In the third shop, on the right, you meet with a rich assortment of jewelry, ornamental articles in ormolu, french clocks, &etc.; and on the left, with all the different kinds of perfumery necessary for the toilette. The fourth is set apart for millinery and dresses; so that there is no article of female attire or decoration, but what may be here procured in the first style of elegance and fashion. This concern has been conducted for the last twelve years by the present proprietors who have spared neither trouble nor expense to ensure the establishment of a superiority over every other in Europe, and to render it perfectly unique in its kind.\nThis venture is described as having all of the basic characteristics of the department store; it was a public retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different departments. This pioneering shop was closed down in 1820 when the business partnership was dissolved. All the major British cities had flourishing department stores by the mid-or late nineteenth century.  Increasingly, women became the main customers. Kendals (formerly Kendal Milne & Faulkner) in Manchester lays claim to being one of the first department stores and is still known to many of its customers as Kendal's, despite its 2005 name change to House of Fraser. The Manchester institution dates back to 1836 but had been trading as Watts Bazaar since 1796. At its zenith the store had buildings on both sides of Deansgate linked by a subterranean passage \"Kendals Arcade\" and an art nouveau tiled food hall. The store was especially known for its emphasis on quality and style over low prices giving it the nickname \"the Harrods of the North\", although this was due in part to Harrods acquiring the store in 1919. Other large Manchester stores included Paulden's (currently Debenhams) and Lewis's (now a Primark).\nIn London, department stores were established in Oxford Street and Regent Street in the mid 19th-century. These were distinctly modern stores with lavish displays of imported goods, especially Oriental shawls, embroidery and furniture and served a wealthy clientele. Harrods of London can be traced back to 1834, while the current store on Brompton Road on a site they acquired in 1849, was constructed between 1894 and 1905. Liberty & Co. gained popularity in the 1870s for selling Oriental goods.  Gamages was founded in London's High Holborn by Arthur Walter Gamage in 1878. In Bayswater, the draper, William Whiteley established a department store with more of a mass market appeal.\n\nBainbridge's (now owned by John Lewis) dates back to 1838, when Emerson Muschamp Bainbridge went into partnership with William Alder Dunn and opened a drapers and fashion shop in Newcastle's Market Street. In 1849 there were 23 separate departments, with weekly takings recorded by department, making it the first proper department store in the world. This ledger survives and is now kept in the archives of the John Lewis Partnership.\nBy 1900, London, Glasgow and Liverpool were the three largest shopping centres in the country. The company Lewis's started in Liverpool in 1856 and experimented with new ways of advertising (such as flooding the basement of the Manchester store to create a mini Venice.) Lewis's built up the largest chain of stores in the country, opening branches in Manchester (1877), Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, Hanley, London, Blackpool, Bristol and Leicester.Selfridges was established in 1909 by American-born Harry Gordon Selfridge on Oxford Street. The company's innovative marketing promoted the radical notion of shopping for pleasure rather than necessity and its techniques were adopted by modern department stores the world over. The store was extensively promoted through paid advertising. The shop floors were structured so that goods could be made more accessible to customers. There were elegant restaurants with modest prices, a library, reading and writing rooms, special reception rooms for French, German, American and \"Colonial\" customers, a First Aid Room, and a Silence Room, with soft lights, deep chairs, and double-glazing, all intended to keep customers in the store as long as possible. Staff members were taught to be on hand to assist customers, but not too aggressively, and to sell the merchandise. Selfridge attracted shoppers with educational and scientific exhibits; in 1909, Louis Bl\u00e9riot's monoplane was exhibited at Selfridges (Bl\u00e9riot was the first to fly over the English Channel), and the first public demonstration of television by John Logie Baird took place in the department store in 1925.\nIn Scotland, Jenners was founded by Charles Jenner and Charles Kennington and has maintained its position on Edinburgh's Princes Street since 1838. It lays claim to being the oldest independent department store in Scotland.\nIn Northern Ireland, Austin's in Derry, was established as a department store in 1830, and according to some claims was the world's first department store. The domineering building measured 25,000 square feet (2,300 m2) and was five stories high with an Edwardian-style exterior.\n\n\n=== France ===\nThe Paris department store had its roots in the magasin de nouveaut\u00e9s, or novelty store; the first, the Tapis Rouge, was created in 1784,.  They flourished in the early 19th century, with La Belle Jardiniere (1824),  Aux Trois Quartiers (1829), and Le Petit Saint Thomas (1830). Balzac described their functioning in his novel C\u00e9sar Birotteau.  In the 1840s, with the arrival of the railroads in Paris and the increased number of shoppers they brought, they grew in size, and began to have large plate glass display windows, fixed prices and price tags, and advertising in newspapers.A novelty shop called Au Bon March\u00e9 had been founded in Paris in 1838 to sell lace, ribbons, sheets, mattresses, buttons, umbrellas and other assorted goods.  It originally had four departments, twelve employees, and a floor space of three hundred meters. The entrepreneur Aristide Boucicaut became a partner in 1852, and changed the marketing plan, instituting fixed prices and guarantees that allowed exchanges and refunds, advertising, and a much wider variety of merchandise. The annual income of the store increased from 500,000 francs in 1852 to five million in 1860. In 1869 he built much larger building at 24 rue de S\u00e8vres on the Left Bank, and enlarged the store again in 1872, with help from the engineering firm of Gustave Eiffel, creator of the Eiffel Tower.  The income rose from twenty million francs in 1870 to 72 million at the time of the Boucicaut's death in 1877.  The floor space had increased from three hundred square meters in 1838 to fifty thousand, and the number of employees had increased from twelve in 1838 to 1788 in 1879.  Boucicaut was famous for his marketing innovations; a reading room for husbands while their wives shopped; extensive newspaper advertising; entertainment for children; and six million catalogs sent out to customers. By 1880 half the employees were women; unmarried women employees lived in dormitories on the upper floors.Au Bon March\u00e9 soon had competitors.  Printemps was founded in 1865; La Samaritaine was founded in 1869 by Ernest Cognacq and Marie-Louise Jay, a new Tapis Rouge in 1867, La Ville de Saint-Denis, with the first elevator in France (1869);  La Paix;  Les Nouvelles Galeries; Les Magasins Dufayel (1890); the Bazaar de Hotel de Ville (BHV); and Galeries Lafayette, founded by Alphonse Kahn in 1895.The French gloried in the national prestige brought by the great Parisian stores. The great writer \u00c9mile Zola (1840\u20131902) set his novel Au Bonheur des Dames (1882\u201383) in the typical department store. Zola represented it as a symbol of the new technology that was both improving society and devouring it. The novel describes merchandising, management techniques, marketing, and consumerism.The Grands Magasins Dufayel was a huge department store with inexpensive prices built in 1890 in the northern part of Paris, where it reached a very large new customer base in the working class. In a neighborhood with few public spaces, it provided a consumer version of the public square. It educated workers to approach shopping as an exciting social activity not just a routine exercise in obtaining necessities, just as the bourgeoisie did at the famous department stores in the central city. Like the bourgeois stores, it helped transform consumption from a business transaction into a direct relationship between consumer and sought-after goods. Its advertisements promised the opportunity to participate in the newest, most fashionable consumerism at reasonable cost. The latest technology was featured, such as cinemas and exhibits of inventions like X-ray machines (that could be used to fit shoes) and the gramophone.Increasingly after 1870 the stores' work force became feminized, opening up prestigious job opportunities for young women. Despite the low pay and long hours they enjoyed the exciting complex interactions with the newest and most fashionable merchandise and upscale customers.By the 21st century, the grand Paris department stores had difficulty surviving in the new economic world. In 2015, just four remained; Au Bon March\u00e9, now owned by the luxury goods firm LVMH; BHV; Galeries Lafayette and Printemps.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nThe compact and centralized 19th century city with its mass transit lines converging on the downtown was a perfect environment for department store growth. But as residents moved out of the downtown areas to the suburbs, the large, downtown department stores became inconvenient and lost business to the newer suburban shopping centres.  In 2003, U.S. department store sales were surpassed by big-box store sales for the first time (though some stores may be classified as \"big box\" by physical layout and \"department store\" by merchandise).\n\n\n==== New York City ====\nArnold Constable was the first American department store. It was founded in 1825 by Aaron Arnold (1794?\u20131876), an emigrant from Great Britain, as a small dry goods store on Pine Street in New York City. In 1857 the store moved into a five-story white marble dry goods palace known as the Marble House. During the Civil War, Arnold Constable was one of the first stores to issue charge bills of credit to its customers each month instead of on a bi-annual basis.  Recognized as an emporium for high-quality fashions, the store soon outgrew the Marble House and erected a cast-iron building on Broadway and Nineteenth Street in 1869; this \u201cPalace of Trade\u201d expanded over the years until it was necessary to move into a larger space in 1914. In 1925, Arnold, Constable merged with Stewart & Company and expanded into the suburbs, first with a 1937 store in New Rochelle, New York and later in Hempstead and Manhasset on Long Island, and in New Jersey. Financial problems led to bankruptcy in 1975.In New York City in 1846, Alexander Turney Stewart established the \"Marble Palace\" on Broadway, between Chambers and Reade streets. He offered European retail merchandise at fixed prices on a variety of dry goods, and advertised a policy of providing \"free entrance\" to all potential customers. Though it was clad in white marble to look like a Renaissance palazzo, the building's cast iron construction permitted large plate glass windows that permitted major seasonal displays, especially in the Christmas shopping season. In 1862, Stewart built a new store on a full city block uptown between 9th and 10th streets, with eight floors and nineteen departments of dress goods and furnishing materials, carpets, glass and china, toys and sports equipment, ranged around a central glass-covered court. His innovations included buying from manufacturers for cash and in large quantities, keeping his markup small and prices low, truthful presentation of merchandise, the one-price policy (so there was no haggling), simple merchandise returns and cash refund policy, selling for cash and not credit, buyers who searched worldwide for quality merchandise, departmentalization, vertical and horizontal integration, volume sales, and free services for customers such as waiting rooms and free delivery of purchases. His innovations were quickly copied by other department stores.In 1858, Rowland Hussey Macy founded Macy's as a dry goods store. B. Altman and Company and Lord & Taylor soon competed with Stewart as New York's earliest department stores, followed by McCreery's and Brooklyn's Abraham & Straus. The Straus family would be in the management of both Macy's and A&S.\nBy the 1880s New York's retail center had moved uptown, forming a stretch of retail shopping northward from 9th Street: the \"Ladies' Mile\". By 1894, the major stores competed in the Christmas season with elaborate Christmas window displays; in 1895 Macy's featured 13 tableaux, including scenes from \"Jack and the Beanstalk\", Gulliver's Travels and other children's favorites.\n\n\n==== Philadelphia ====\nIn 1877, John Wanamaker opened the United States' first modern department store in a former Pennsylvania Railroad freight terminal in Philadelphia. Wanamakers was the first department store to offer fixed prices marked on every article and also introduced electrical illumination (1878), the telephone (1879), and the use of pneumatic tubes to transport cash and documents (1880) to the department store business. Subsequent department stores founded in Philadelphia included Strawbridge and Clothier, Gimbels, Lit Brothers, and Snellenbergs.\n\n\n==== Chicago ====\nMarshall Field & Company originated in 1852. It was the premier department store on the main shopping street in the Midwest, State Street in Chicago. Upscale shoppers came by train from throughout the region, patronizing nearby hotels. It grew to become a major chain before converting to the Macy's nameplate on 9 September 2006. Marshall Field's served as a model for other department stores in that it had exceptional customer service. Field's also brought with it the now famous Frango mints brand that became so closely identified with Marshall Field's and Chicago from the now defunct Frederick & Nelson Department store.  Marshall Field's also had the firsts; among many innovations by Marshall Field's were the first European buying office, which was located in Manchester, England, and the first bridal registry. The company was the first to introduce the concept of the personal shopper, and that service was provided without charge in every Field's store, until the chain's last days under the Marshall Field's name. It was the first store to offer revolving credit and the first department store to use escalators. Marshall Field's book department in the State Street store was legendary; it pioneered the concept of the \"book signing\". Moreover, every year at Christmas, Marshall Field's downtown store windows were filled with animated displays as part of the downtown shopping district display; the \"theme\" window displays became famous for their ingenuity and beauty, and visiting the Marshall Field's windows at Christmas became a tradition for Chicagoans and visitors alike, as popular a local practice as visiting the Walnut Room with its equally famous Christmas tree or meeting \"under the clock\" on State Street.The Carson Pirie Scott brand is strongly associated with the historic Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building designed by Louis Sullivan. It was built in 1899 for the retail firm Schlesinger & Mayer, and expanded and sold to Carson Pirie Scott in 1904. The building, located on State Street in Chicago's Loop, housed the chain's flagship store for more than a century before closing for good in 2007. Target now occupies the building.\n\n\n== Countries ==\n\n\n=== Argentina ===\nIn Buenos Aires, upscale department stores came during the early years of the 20th century. Gath & Ch\u00e1vez opened in 1905 and Harrods Buenos Aires was established in 1912. Today, the Chilean department store Falabella is one of the most prominent in the country, with branches in Buenos Aires, C\u00f3rdoba, San Juan, Mendoza, and Rosario.\nFalabella is one of the most popular stores in Argentina today.\n\n\n=== Austria ===\nKastner & \u00d6hler is a chain of department stores based in Graz. The company was the first in central Europe to introduce fixed prices and mail order.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\n\nDavid Jones was started by David Jones, a Welsh merchant who met Hobart businessman Charles Appleton in London. Appleton established a store in Sydney in 1825 and Jones subsequently established a partnership with Appleton, moved to Australia in 1835, and the Sydney store became known as Appleton & Jones. When the partnership was dissolved in 1838, Jones moved his business to premises on the corner of George Street and Barrack Lane, Sydney. David Jones claims to be the oldest department store in the world still trading under its original name.In Melbourne, the earliest large department store was Coles Book Arcade (1873\u20131929).  Edward Cole's vast premises extended south from Bourke Street Mall for two city blocks and included departments for books, a glass and china department, a photographic studio, tea rooms, toy department, stationery department, confectionery department, as well as a permanent musical band for entertaining customers, a cage of monkeys, circulating library and other entertainments.  The store is remembered largely through the now out-of-print Coles Funny Picture Books for children.  Buckley and Nunn was a smaller store directly opposite the Arcade, later taken over and expanded by David Jones, that still exists to this day.  In the same precinct is the flagship Myer Melbourne store.\nAlthough there were a number of department stores in Australia for much of the 20th century, including chains such as Grace Bros. and Waltons, many disappeared during the 1980s and 1990s. Today Myer, David Jones and Harris Scarfe, located nationally, are practically the national department stores oligopoly in Australia. When Russian-born migrant, Sidney Myer, came to Australia in 1899 he formed the Myer retail group with his brother, Elcon Myer. In 1900, they opened the first Myer department store, in Bendigo, Victoria. Since then, the Myer retail group has grown to be Australia's largest retailer. Both Myer and David Jones are up-market chains, offering a wide variety of products from mid-range names to luxury brands while the Adelaide-based Harris Scarfe is pitched towards brand led value, with hi-lo pricing. Other retail chain stores led by Kmart but also dominated by Target (unrelated to the American chain of the same name), Venture (now defunct), and Big W, also located nationally, are considered to be Australia's discount department stores. Most department stores in Australia have their own credit card companies, each having their own benefits while the discount department stores do not have their own credit card rights.\n\n\n=== Brazil ===\nEven though department stores have virtually disappeared from Brazilian landscape in the 90s, department stores are booming in Brazil in the recent years mainly because of the culture of a single place for everything, even cafes are being added to the market places. Among the major names are Americanas, Riachuelo, Pernambucanas, Havan and Casas Bahia.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\n\nHistorically, department stores were a significant component in Canadian economic life, and chain stores such as Eaton's, Charles Ogilvy Limited, Freiman's, Spencer's, Simpsons, Morgan's, and Woodward's were staples in their respective communities. Department stores in Canada are similar in design and style to department stores in the United States. Before the 1950s, the department store held an eminent place in both Canada and Australia, during both the Great Depression and World War II. Since then, they have suffered from strong competition from specialist stores. Most recently the competition has intensified with the advent of larger-scale superstores (Jones et al. 1994; Merrilees and Miller 1997). Also, the changing structure of cities affected them. \nFrom its origins in the fur trade, the Hudson's Bay Company is the oldest corporation in North America and was the largest department store operator in Canada until the mid-1980s, with locations across the country. It also previously owned Zellers, another major Canadian department store which ceased to exist in March 2013 after selling its lease holdings to Target Canada.  Other department stores in Canada are: Canadian Tire, Ogilvy, Les Ailes de la Mode, Giant Tiger, Co-op, Costco and Holt Renfrew. Grocery giant Superstores carry many non-grocery items akin to a department store. Woolco had 160 stores in Canada when operations ceased (Walmart bought out Woolco in 1994). Today the low-price Walmart is by far the most dominant department store retailer in Canada with outlets throughout the country. In northern or isolated communities The North West Company (named after the historical North West Company fur trade company) operates smaller department stores.\n\n\n=== Chile ===\nAlbeit relatively small, the domestic Chilean retail market has proved fiercely competitive with several department stores sprouting in Santiago and then expanding north and south of Santiago. Leading department stores today include Falabella, Ripley, Almacenes Par\u00eds, La Polar, and Johnson's. Falabella, founded in 1889, has opened branches in Argentina, Colombia, and Peru, with Par\u00eds \u2013 its main Chilean competitor \u2013 coming on its heels.\n\n\n=== China ===\nSince the opening policy in 1979, the Chinese department stores also develops swiftly along with the fast-growing economy. There are different department store groups dominating different regions. For example, INTIME department store has the biggest market presence in Zhejiang province, while Jinying department stores dominate Jiangsu Province. There are many other department store groups, such as Pacific, Parkson, Wangfujin, and New World, many of which are expanding quickly by listing in the financial market.\n\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n\nThe first department store, Lane Crawford, was opened in 1850 by Scots Thomas Ash Lane and Ninian Crawford on Des Voeux Road, Hong Kong Island. At the beginning, the store mainly catered to visiting ships' crews as well as British Navy staff and their families. In 1900, the first ethnic-Chinese owned Sincere Department Store was opened by Ma Ying Piu, who returned from Australia and inspired by David Jones. In 1907, another former Hong Kong expatriate in Australia, the Kwoks family, returned to Hong Kong and founded Wing On.\nSince the 1960s, a number of Japanese owned department stores started to enter the Hong Kong market. Daimaru was opened in the corner of Great George Street and Paterson Street in 1960, followed by Matsuzakaya, Isetan, Seibu, Sogo and Yaohan. Yaohan was taken over by JUSCO in 1990s and later became \u00c6ON. Currently, out of all Japanese department store brands that entered Hong Kong, only Sogo survived while others have pulled out.\n\n\n=== Colombia ===\nIn Colombia, upscale department stores came in the mid-20th century when Sears entered the country. Today, the Chilean department store Falabella is one of the most prominent in the country, with branches in Barranquilla, Cali, Bogota, Medellin, Pereira and Bucaramanga. Falabella is one of the most popular stores in Colombia today.\n\n\n=== Cyprus ===\nThe most famous department store chain in Cyprus is Debenhams (formerly Woolworths).\n\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nThe three main historical department stores in Prague are Bila Labut, Kotva, and Maj (now Tesco).\n\n\n=== Denmark ===\nIn Denmark there are three department store chains: Magasin (1868), Illum (1891), and Salling (1906).\nMagasin is by far the largest, with six stores all over the country, with the flagship store being Magasin du Nord on Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen. Illum's only store on Amagertorv in Copenhagen has the appearance of a department store with 20% run by Magasin, but has individual shop owners making it a shopping centre. However, in people's minds, it remains a department store. Salling has two stores in Jutland with one of these being the reason for the closure of a Magasin store due to the competition.\n\n\n=== El Salvador ===\nSIMAN\nCarrion\nSears\nSanborns\n\n\n=== Finland ===\nThe most famous department store chains in Finland are Stockmann, a listed company, and Sokos, owned by a nationwide retailing cooperative. The Stockmann department store in central Helsinki is the biggest department store in the Nordic countries and a famous landmark of Helsinki.\n\n\n=== France ===\nFrance's major upscale department stores are Galeries Lafayette and Le Printemps, which both have flagship stores on Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and branches around the country. The first department store in France, Le Bon March\u00e9 in Paris, was founded in 1838 and is now owned by the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. La Samaritaine, another upscale department store also owned by LVMH, closed in 2005. Mid-range department stores chains also exist in France, such as the BHV-Marais (Bazar de l'Hotel de Ville), part of the same group as Galeries Lafayette. It's known to be Parisian favorite department store.\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nThe design and function of department stores in Germany followed the lead of London, Paris and New York. Germany used to have a number of department store chains; now only a few of them remain. Next to some smaller, independent department stores these are Karstadt (in 2010 taken over by Nicolas Berggruen, also operating the KaDeWe in Berlin, the Alsterhaus in Hamburg and the Oberpollinger in Munich), Galeria Kaufhof (part of the Canadian Hudson Bay Company since 2017). Others like Hertie, Wertheim and Horten AG were taken over by others and either fully integrated or later closed.\nLarger department stores in Germany usually contain a self-service restaurant, clothing departments, a toy department, a department for computer and electronics, a small book department (for bestsellers), a department for newspapers and magazines and a food department (like a supermarket).\nOne of the most famous department stores in Germany is the Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe, German for \"department store of the west\") which is located in Berlin.\n\n\n=== India ===\n\nIn India, companies like Big Bazaar, Shopper's Stop, Kingsberry, Pantaloon, Ezone and D-Mart are entering into retail.Small-time department stores \u2013 or convenience shops as they are better known in most western countries \u2013 are also upcoming. Although these stores are much bigger in size than a usual-size convenience shop in, for example, the US, they are much smaller than a regular-sized department store. Examples include 1-India Family Mart, Sabka Bazaar, Big Apple, Spencer's and Dailymart. It's 2019 and India is one of the world's up and biggest consumer markets.\n\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nIndonesia's largest department store chain is Ramayana with over ninety branches across the country. The same group also operates under Robinson (not related to Robinsons and Co from Singapore and Central Department Store's Robinson from Thailand) and Cahaya, all targeting the lower-income sectors. Other local department stores positioned for the lower-middle segment are CT Corp-owned Transmart and Lippo Group-owned Matahari.\nLippo Group's Matahari previously managed to trade under Mega M, Galeria, and Parisian brands, all of which have been progressively closed. Lippo acquired Matahari Department Store from its founder Hari Darmawan in 1996, and sits as President Director of the company until 2001. Lippo previously owned a franchise of Walmart (hypermarket) and J.C. Penney before both brands pulling out during 1997\u20131998 Asian economic crisis.Meanwhile, Transmart Department Store is established after CT Corp acquired Carrefour hypermarket in 2011. The department store itself has 24 branches nationwide as of 2017 and plans to expand as part of Transmart's expansion plan. The company also owned 50% ownership of Metro Department Store in Indonesia, targeting the middle-up segment with 10 branches nationwide. Metro entered Indonesia in 1991, opening its first store at Pondok Indah Mall. CT Corp's partnership with Metro starts when Metro opened its third store at Trans Studio Mall Bandung, previously known Bandung Supermall, before finally acquiring Metro Indonesia's 40% stake in 2008, and another 10% in 2010.Another middle-up segment competitor besides Metro Department Store is Sogo Department Store from Japan, established in the 1990s at Plaza Indonesia and Mal Kelapa Gading before Plaza Indonesia branch's closure in 2007. The year 2007 also saw the re-opening of Jakarta's Seibu Department Store at Jakarta shopping mall Grand Indonesia, poised to be the largest and second most upscale department store in Indonesia after Harvey Nichols; the latter closed in 2010 and plans to return. Other international department stores include Debenhams and Galeries Lafayette. Debenhams opened its doors at Plaza Indonesia in 2003 before expanding to Senayan City in 2005, Supermall Karawaci in 2008, and Lippo Mall Kemang in 2012, before all branches (Debenhams pulled out of Plaza Indonesia in 2008) eventually closed in 2017. while the latter joined the Indonesian market in 2013 inside Pacific Place Mall, targeting the middle-up market with a price range from affordable to luxury, and is poised to be the largest upscale department store. Galeries Lafayette, Debenhams, Harvey Nichols, Seibu and Sogo are all operated by PT. Mitra Adiperkasa.\nCentral Group from Thailand entered Indonesia replacing Harvey Nichols at Grand Indonesia, bringing its flagship Central brand. Its entry gained success in the Indonesian market by bringing Thailand-based fashion and living brands. Parkson, Lotte, and AEON also entered Indonesia in the 2010s.\nParkson acquired the local brand Centro Department Store in 2011. Centro still operates for middle market while the Parkson brand itself, positioned for middle-up segment, entered in 2014 by opening its first store in Medan, followed by its second and third store in Jakarta and Yogyakarta. Lotte, meanwhile, entered the market by inking a partnership with Ciputra Group, creating what is called 'Lotte Shopping Avenue' inside the Ciputra World Jakarta complex, as well as acquiring Makro and rebranding it into Lotte Mart for hypermarket business and Lotte Grosir (previously Lotte Mart Wholesale) for wholesale business. As of 2017, Lotte Department Store is not expanding despite the company plans to open 5 more stores.AEON also inked a partnership with Sinarmas Land, opened its flagship store inside its AEON Mall in Sinar Mas Land's flagship BSD City on 30 May 2015. AEON recently opened its second branch at Jakarta Garden City in September 2017. Plans to open AEON Mall and its AEON Department Store in Sentul City, Kota Deltamas, and Jakarta's Southgate complex have been announced. AEON's BSD City, Deltamas and Southgate branches are opened under AEON and Sinarmas Land's partnership while Sentul City and Jakarta Garden City branches are not affiliated with the AEON-Sinarmas partnership, therefore managed independently by AEON and other partners.\nOther local department store brands include STAR Department Store, Surya, Suzuya Department Store, JM Department Store, Java/Lotus (PT. Mitra Adiperkasa's low-end dept store brand, now closed), the Grand Palace, Yogya, Lima Cahaya, Chandra Department Store, Galeri Keris, Pasaraya and Indonesia's oldest department store Sarinah, which opened in 1963.\n\n\n=== Iran ===\nIran's largest department store chain is Shahrvand with 31 stores, all located in Tehran.  The other department store that has been established lately is Hyperstar that invested by Carrefour's license holder, Majid Al Futtaim Group, in Tehran, Shiraz and Isfahan.\n\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIreland developed a strong middle class, especially in the major cities, by the mid-nineteenth century.  They were active patrons of department stores.Delany's New Mart was opened in 1853 in Dublin, Ireland. Unlike others, Delany's had not evolved gradually from a smaller shop on site. Thus it could claim to be the first purpose-built department store in the world. The term \"department store\" had not been invented at that time, so it was called the \"Monster House\". The store was completely destroyed in the 1916 Easter Rising, but reopened in 1922.Arnotts is one of the largest stores in Ireland. However, several large retailers now own chains of department stores, such as:\n\nBrown Thomas\nDebenhams\nDunnes Stores\nMarks & SpencerThe most upmarket chain is undoubtedly Brown Thomas (known colloquially as BT), founded as a haberdasher's in 1849 on Dublin's Grafton Street. The company (which belongs to the same group as the UK's Selfridges or Canada's Holt Renfrew) bought its long-time competitor across the street, Switzers, from House of Fraser group in 1995. BT then moved to the larger site. It also acquired and re-branded the former Switzer stores in Cork (formerly Cash's), Limerick (formerly Todd's) and Galway (formerly Moon's).The British department store, Debenhams, purchased the Roches Stores chain in 2006, closed two stores and rebranded the others. The opening of Dundrum Town Centre in Dublin's suburbs saw the arrival of two more British stores, House of Fraser and Harvey Nichols.  The Woolworth chain store had major presence from the early twentieth century until 1984, when its stores in Ireland closed their doors for the last time.\n\n\n=== Israel ===\nThe oldest and largest department store chain in Israel is Hamashbir Lazarchan.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nItaly's most famous department stores are Coin, established in Mirano, Venice in 1926, and La Rinascente, founded in Milan in 1865 by Luigi and Ferdinando Bocconi.\n\n\n=== Japan ===\n\nSome of the largest department stores in Japan are Daimaru (J. Front Retailing), Hankyu (H2O Retailing), Hanshin (H2O Retailing), Isetan (Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings), Matsuzakaya (J.

It operates 17 retail outlets across the country and offers a wide selection of imported international brands in fashion and apparel, perfumery, cosmetics, accessories, housewares, electronics, appliances and food. Recently one of the most well known high-end clothing department stores in Kuwait is Villa Moda. Co-op society stores are department stores put up by the government.\n\n\n=== Lebanon ===\nThe history of department stores in Lebanon dates back to 1900 when Orozdi-Back, a department store that was founded by a French businessman of Hungarian origin, opened a branch in Beirut.  By the mid-twentieth century, Beirut had become the luxury department store of the Near East.Beirut remains a shopping magnet in the region, with shoppers from neighboring Levantine countries heading to Beirut to shop.Department stores in Lebanon include today ABC Group, Bazar de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville, The Sultan Center, A\u00efshti and Spinneys.\n\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nIn Malaysia, companies such as AEON, Parkson, Metrojaya, The Store, Isetan, Marks & Spencer, Robinson & Co., Debenhams, and Tangs are considered department stores, while retail brands such as Tesco, and Giant are discount department stores combined with supermarkets.\n\n\n=== Mexico ===\nA large number of department stores are based in Mexico, of which the most traditional are El Palacio de Hierro (high end and luxury goods) and Liverpool (upper-middle income), with its middle income sister store Fabricas de Francia. Sanborns owns over 100 middle-income level stores throughout the country. Grupo Carso operates Sears Mexico and two high-end Saks 5th Avenue stores. Other large chains are Coppel and Elektra, which offer items for the bargain price seeker. Wal-Mart operates Suburbia for lower income shoppers, along with stores under the brand names of Wal-Mart, Bodega Aurrera, and Superama.\nThe first two conglomerates have a very strong mark in the country, and particularly in Mexico City. Foreign chains such as J. C. Penney had previously entered the Mexican market, but they failed to gain popularity.  Sears likewise had little success after it opened its first department store in Mexico City in 1947.\n\n\n=== Nepal ===\nBluebird is the first department store in Nepal and BhatBhateni is currently the largest chain of department stores, with several stores all over the country.\n\n\n=== The Netherlands ===\nThe first department store in the Netherlands was the Winkel van Sinkel, opened in Utrecht by Anton Sinkel in 1839. It continued to exist until 1912.\nThe most well known in the Netherlands are the local high-end department stores De Bijenkorf and the variety stores chain HEMA. A former well-known chain in the Netherlands was V&D. At 130 years of age, it was declared bankrupt in 2016. After the bankruptcy, the Canadian Hudson's Bay Company exported its Hudson's Bay and Saks OFF 5th chains to the Netherlands and entered the market. The strongest lines in the Netherlands have always been clothing.\n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nThe iconic department stores of New Zealand's three major centres are Smith & Caughey's (founded 1880), in New Zealand's most populous city, Auckland; David Jones Limited in the capital, Wellington; and Ballantynes (founded 1854) in New Zealand's second biggest city, Christchurch as well as Timaru.

Karim Buksh, Jalal sons and Potpourri stores with branches throughout the cities' commercial areas. Many urban centers of Pakistan now have large and spacious Metro Cash and Carry or Carrefour, Chase and Imtiaz stores.\n\n\n=== Panama ===\nPanama's first department stores such as Bazaar Franc\u00e9s, La Dalia and La Villa de Paris started as textile retailers at the turn of the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century these eventually gave way to stores such as Felix B. Maduro, Sarah Panam\u00e1, Figali, Dant\u00e9, Sears, Gran Morrison and smaller ones such as Bon Bini, Cocos, El Lider, Piccolo and Clubman. Of these, only Felix B. Maduro (usually referred to as Felix by locals) and Dant\u00e9 remain strong. All the others have either folded or declined although Cocos has managed to secure a good position in the market.\n\nToday, other major department stores include Steven's and Collin's.

Then came other stores like Sears in 1952, adquired by Chilean group Falabella in 1995, Ripley in 1997 and Paris S.A. in 2013.\nCurrently, the largest department stores are Falabella, Oechsle, Paris SA and Ripley.\n\n\n=== Philippines ===\nThe first department store in the Philippines is the Hoskyn's Department Store of Hoskyn & Co. established in 1877 in Iloilo by the Englishman Henry Hoskyn, nephew of Nicholas Loney, the first British vice-consul in Iloilo. It also claimed to be the first to introduce the \"fixed price\" policy in merchandising in the country and was known to be \"the store that sold everything from needle to anchor.\" It offered groceries, hardware, stationary, toys, watches, jewelry, machinery, buttons, threads etc.  (Source: Articulos que  ordinariamente reciben y venden Hoskyn y ca. del comercio de Iloilo, 1895.)    Some of the earliest department stores in the Philippines were located in Manila as early as 1898 with the opening of the American Bazaar, which was later named Beck's. During the course of the American occupation of the Philippines, many department stores were built throughout the city, many of which were located in Escolta. Heacock's, a luxury department store, was considered as the best department store in the Orient. Other department stores included Aguinaldo's, La Puerta del Sol, Estrella del Norte, and the Crystal Arcade, all of which were destroyed during the Battle of Manila in 1945. After the war, department stores were once again alive with the establishment of Shoemart (now SM), and Rustan's. Since the foundation of these companies in the 1950s, there are now more than one hundred department stores to date. At present, due to the huge success of shopping centres, department stores in the Philippines usually are anchor tenants within centres. SM Supermalls and Robinsons Malls are two of the country's most prominent shopping centre chains, all of which have department store sections.\n\n\n=== Portugal ===\nThe traditional and century-old department stores Armaz\u00e9ns Grandella (established in 1891) and Grandes Armaz\u00e9ns do Chiado (established in 1894) closed after their main buildings were destroyed in the Chiado's great fire on 25 August 1988.\nCurrently Portugal has only two department stores, both operated by El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, one in Lisbon metropolitan area, other in Porto Metropolitan Area. This small number of department stores can be explained by the widespread presence throughout the country of shopping centres and supermarket chains like Continente, owned by Sonae, Intermarch\u00e9 and Pingo Doce, owned by Jer\u00f3nimo Martins, which are more akin to the local taste.\n\n\n=== Puerto Rico ===\nIn Puerto Rico, various department stores have operated, such as Sears, JC Penney, Macy's, Kmart, Wal-Mart, Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory, T.J. Maxx, Costco, Sam's Club and others. La New York was a Puerto Rican department store. Topeka, Capri and Pitusa are competitors on the Puerto Rican market that also have hypermarkets operating under their names. Retailers Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue also have plans to come to the Mall of San Juan, a new high-end retail project with over 100 tenants. The shopping centre was set to open in March 2015.\n\n\n=== Russia ===\n\nThe site where the Saint Petersburg Passage sprawls had been devoted to trade since the city's foundation in the early 18th century. It had been occupied by various shops and warehouses (Maly Gostiny Dvor, Schukin Dvor, Apraksin Dvor) until 1846, when Count Essen-Stenbock-Fermor acquired the grounds to build an elite shopping centre for the Russian nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie. Stenbock-Fermor conceived of the Passage as more than a mere shopping centre, but also as a cultural and social centre for the people of St Petersburg. The edifice contained coffee-houses, confectioneries, panorama installations, an anatomical museum, a wax museum, and even a small zoo, described by Dostoyevsky in his extravaganza \"Crocodile, or Passage through the Passage\". The concert hall became renowned as a setting for literary readings attended by the likes of Dostoevsky and Turgenev. Parenthetically, the Passage premises have long been associated with the entertainment industry and still remains home to the Komissarzhevskaya Theatre.\nSocialism confronted consumerism in the chain State Department Stores (GUM), set up by Lenin in 1921 as a model retail enterprise. It operated stores throughout Russia and targeted consumers across class, gender, and ethnic lines. GUM was designed to advance the Bolsheviks' goals of eliminating private enterprise and rebuilding consumerism along socialist lines, as well as democratizing consumption for workers and peasants nationwide. GUM became a major propaganda purveyor, with advertising and promotional campaigns that taught Russians the goals of the regime and attempted to inculcate new attitudes and behavior. In trying to create a socialist consumer culture from scratch, GUM recast the functions and meanings of buying and selling, turning them into politically charged acts that could either contribute to or delay the march toward utopian communism. By the late 1920s, however, GUM's grandiose goals had proven unrealistic and largely alienated consumers, who instead learned a culture of complaint and entitlement. GUM's main function became one of distributing whatever the factories sent them, regardless of consumer demand or quality.In the 21st century the most famous department store in Russia is GUM in Moscow, followed by TsUM and the Petrovsky Passage. Other popular stores are Mega (shopping centres), Stockmann, and Marks & Spencer. Media Markt, M-video, Technosila, and White Wind (Beliy Veter) sell a large number of electronic devices. In St. Petersburg, the Passage has been popular since the 1840s. The 1956 Soviet film Behind Store Window depicts the operation of a Moscow department store in the 1950s.\n\n\n=== Singapore ===\nMost department stores are clustered around Orchard Road in Singapore. The most well-known department stores in Singapore are BHG (formerly known as Seiyu), Isetan, John Little, Marks & Spencer, Metro, Mustafa, OG, Robinson & Co., Takashimaya and Tangs. Some of their branch outlets can also be found in the suburban shopping centres. As of 2019, Marks & Spencer have the most stores in Singapore with 8 branches in total, followed by BHG with 6 stores, Isetan with 4 stores, OG and Robinsons with 3 stores, Metro and Tangs with 2 stores, and Takashimaya and Mustafa with only 1 store each.\n\n\n=== South Korea ===\n\nConcept of department store introduced during Japanese forced occupation. Hwashin Sanghoe (literally \u201cHwashin Store\u201d) in downtown Seoul was considered as first department store in Korea. Mitsukoshi opened Seoul branch in 1930 as Keijo Mitsukoshi(\u4eac\u57ce\u4e09\u8d8a). After the liberation of Korea, Japanese-owned department stores became government corporation. For example, Mitsukoshi became Dongwha and acquired by Samsung in 1963, and Choujiya became Midopa then acquired by Lotte in late 1990s.\nThe five most prevalent chains are Lotte, Hyundai, Shinsegae, Galleria, and AK Plaza.\nLotte Department Store is the largest, operating more than 60 stores (including Lotte Outlets, Young Plazas, and foreign branches). Hyundai Department Store has about 19 stores (15 department, 4 outlet), and there are 13 stores in Shinsegae. Shinsegae has three outlet stores with Simon. Galleria has five, and AK has five stores. These five department stores are known as giant retailers in South Korea. From fashion items to electric appliances, people can buy various kinds of products. Every weekend, people are fond of going around these department stores, because their locations are usually easy to visit.\nAs of 2010 the Shinsegae department store in Centum City, Busan, is the largest department store in the world.\n\n\n=== Spain ===\n\nThe first department store in Spain was Almacenes el Siglo, opened in October 1881 in Barcelona. Following the 2002 closure by the Australian group Partridges of their SEPU (Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Precios Unicos) department store chain, which was one of Spain's oldest, the market is now dominated by El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, founded in 1934 as a drapery store. El Corte Ingl\u00e9s stores tend to be vast buildings, selling a very broad range of product. The group also controls a number of other retail formats, including the supermarket chain Supercor and hypermarket chain Hipercor. It currently employs 91,000 people and is the largest department store in Europe, with department stores all over mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands and Portugal. Its first store opened in Madrid, where it currently has its headquarters. As of 2016, there were 95 El Corte Ingl\u00e9s department stores.\nOther competitors such as Simago and Galer\u00edas Preciados closed in the 1990s. El Corte Ingl\u00e9s also faces competition from French discount operators such as Carrefour and Auchan.\n\n\n=== Sri Lanka ===\nIn Sri Lanka there are few department stores. Most are based on Colombo, the country's capital. Notable department stores are Odel, the Food City chain by Cargills (Ceylon) PLC and the Arpico Super Centre operated by David Pieris & Co.\n\n\n=== Sweden ===\nThe largest department store chain in Sweden is \u00c5hl\u00e9ns, which operates stores throughout the country. Its flagship Stockholm store, \u00c5hl\u00e9ns City, is the largest department store in Sweden. Other large stores are Nordiska Kompaniet in Stockholm and Gothenburg, and PUB in Stockholm (closed in 2015).\n\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nThe Swiss retail market is dominated by two consumers' cooperatives, Migros and Coop, which also run department stores. Migros operates 12 upscale Globus department stores and 34 mid-range Migros MMM centers across the country. Since the acquisition of EPA in 2002, Coop operates its mid-range department stores under the brand Coop City. Manor operates department stores throughout the country. Jelmoli and Loeb operate upscale department stores in Zurich and Bern respectively.\n\n\n=== Taiwan ===\nNotable department store chains in Taiwan include Breeze (eight branches), Shin Kong Mitsukoshi (13 branches), Far Eastern Department Stores (10 branches), Pacific Sogo (nine branches), Uni-Ustyle Department Store (formerly Uni-President Hankyu) (two branches), Pacific Department Store (two branches), Dayeh Takashimaya (one branch), Ming Yao Department Store (one branch) and Chungyo Department Store (one branch, Taichung local). Shin Kong Mitsukoshi, Pacific Sogo and Dayeh Takashimaya were established as joint ventures between Taiwanese companies and Japanese department store chains. Uni-President Hankyu was replaced by Uni-Ustyle in 2016 due to expiration of the contract on March 2 that year, while Takashimaya sold its 50% stake in Dayeh Takashimaya, thus leading to company's withdrawal despite the name 'Takashimaya' is still used to this day.\n\n\n=== Thailand ===\nTwo of the central department stores are Central Chidlom, the oldest in Thailand, having been established in 1947, and Siam Center, which opened in 1973, currently known to be one of the oldest shopping malls in Bangkok, Thailand.\nThe most popular department stores in Thailand are Central Department Store, which are managed by Central Group. The group also manages Robinsons Department Store (which targets middle market) and Zen, which located only in CentralWorld. Central once expands the 'Zen' brand into China but closed down since 2013.\nThese are the department stores in Thailand:\n\nCentral Department Store \u2013 14 branches (2012)Robinson Department Store \u2013 22 branches (2010)\nZen Department Store \u2013 one branch (2018)\nThe Center \u2013 one branch (a division of Tesco Lotus) (2010)\nDiana Department Store \u2013 three branches (2010)\nThe Mall Group \u2013 nine branches (2010)\nEmporium Department Store (located in Emporium Shopping Mall) (2010)\nParagon Department Store (located in Siam Paragon, JV partnership with Siam Paragon mall operator Siam Piwat) (2010)\nBL\u00daPORT Department Store (located in BL\u00daPORT Mall, Hua Hin) (2014)\nBL\u00daPEARL Department Store (located in BL\u00daPEARL Mall, Phuket, currently under construction)\nSiam Takashimaya \u2013 one branch (located in Iconsiam) (2018)\nIsetan Department Store \u2013 one branch (located in CentralWorld) (2018)\nTokyu Department Store \u2013 two branches (located in MBK Center and Paradise Park) (2018)\n\n\n=== Turkey ===\nWhile many shopping centres have opened in Turkey since 2000, department stores are located inside the centres. Boyner and \u00d6zdilek are the main department stores in Turkey. While Boyner takes places in centres, \u00d6zdilek generally builds its own building near popular spots.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nDepartment stores tend to target different socio-economic and geographic segments:\n\nUpscale/Luxury: Harrods, Selfridges, Harvey Nichols, Liberty\nMiddle market/Upscale: John Lewis, House of Fraser, Fenwick, Next plc\nMiddle market/Downscale: Debenhams, Marks & Spencer\nDiscount stores: TK MaxxMost of the early department stores in London started out as small drapery shops which bought up neighbouring shops and increased their range of products.\n\nThe UK's first purpose-built department store was Compton House, Liverpool, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey, to replace a previous building which had burned down in 1865. It was probably the largest in the world at the time. It is occupied today by Marks & Spencer.\nAllders of Croydon, founded in 1862 by Joshua Allder, was the flagship of a large chain of department stores in the UK. The chain went into administration in 2005. The Croydon store was taken over by Harold Tillman of Jaeger trading as Allders but went into administration in June 2012.\nWhiteleys in Westbourne Grove was first to grow to department store size. By 1867 it consisted of 17 departments and by 1890 it was operating in a purposely built department store and had over 6,000 staff employed in the business.\nBarkers of Kensington can be defined as a department store by 1880, when it encompassed 15 neighbouring stores, and in 1889 the company moved into a new, large building. It was taken over by House of Fraser in 1957 and closed for business in 2006.\nHarrods was reborn as a proper department store in 1889, after a devastating fire in 1883.\nJohn Lewis was opened in 1864, and it currently operates 51 stores across the UK.\nSelfridges was opened in 1909 by the American entrepreneur Harry Gordon Selfridge, and thus became London's seventh department store.\nHouse of Fraser owns and operates several department stores across the UK.\nHarvey Nichols of Sloane Street, Knightsbridge is Harrods' closest competitor.\nDebenhams is one of the UK's most popular department stores.\nFenwick was founded in 1882 in Newcastle upon Tyne. Its flagship Newcastle store is one of the largest department stores in the country. The company is still family owned and is one of the largest independent department store chains in the country.John Lewis Newcastle (formerly Bainbridge) in Newcastle upon Tyne is the world's oldest department store. It is still known to many of its customers as Bainbridge, despite the name change to 'John Lewis'. The Newcastle institution dates back to 1838 when Emerson Muschamp Bainbridge, aged 21, went into partnership with William Alder Dunn and opened a draper's and fashion in Market Street, Newcastle. In terms of retailing history, one of the most significant facts about the Newcastle Bainbridge shop is that as early as 1849 weekly takings were recorded by department, making it the earliest of all department stores. This ledger survives and is kept in the John Lewis archives. John Lewis bought the Bainbridge store in 1952.\nJohn Lewis Newcastle retained its original name of Bainbridge until 2002, when the store was rebranded as John Lewis Newcastle.\nAlso, Kendals in Manchester can lay claim to being one of the oldest department stores in the UK. Beginning as a small shop owned by S. and J. Watts in 1796, its sold a variety of goods. Kendal Milne and Faulkner purchased the business in 1835. Expanding the space, rather than using it as a typical warehouse simply to showcase textiles, it became a vast bazaar. Serving Manchester's upmarket clientele for over 200 years, it was taken over by House of Fraser and recently rebranded as House of Fraser Manchester \u2013 although most Mancunians still refer to it as Kendals. The Kendal Milne signage still remains over the main entrance to the art deco building in the city's Deansgate.\nIn Edinburgh, Jenners saw a similar development. It started as a drapery shop in 1838. By 1890 it had grown into Scotland's largest retail shop by gobbling up all of the small shops in the neighbourhood. In 1895, after a devastating fire, a new ultra-modern building opened, with lavish electrical lighting, hydraulic lifts and air conditioning. Four hours after the grand opening, 25,000 people had already visited the store.\nSee also List of department stores of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nArchitecturally, these multifloored \"palaces of consumption\" often featured ornate cast-iron facades with vast, open interiors. At times they boasted fanciful domes and skylights that flooded the interiors with natural light in the days before electrification. Plate-glass windows on the street level allowed elaborate displays of the treasures within, thus making \"window shopping\" a new urban leisure activity. Since the store itself was palatial, this focus on display created an atmosphere. It produced the proper environment for purveying goods that were seen as marks of achievement instead of necessities. Everything was ready-made; rather than bolts of cloth, here were racks of dresses. These were items for instant use, for immediate gratification.Most major cities had distinctive local department stores, which anchored the downtown shopping district until the arrival of the shopping centres in the 1960s.  Washington, for example, after 1887 had Woodward & Lothrop and Garfinckel's starting in 1905.  Garfield's went bankrupt in 1990, as did Woodward & Lothrop in 1994.  Baltimore had four major department stores: Hutzler's was the prestige leader, followed by Hecht's, Hochschild's and Stewart's. They all operated branches in the suburbs, but all closed in the late twentieth century. By 2015, most locally owned department stores around the country had been consolidated into larger chains, or had closed down entirely.\n\n\n==== Chains and variety stores ====\nChain department stores grew rapidly after 1920, and provided competition for the downtown upscale department stores, as well as local department stores in small cities.\nMany if not most of these were part of three large retail chains:  Allied Stores, Federated Stores, and Mercantile Stores.\nMid-level retailers included Sears, Montgomery Ward, and J. C. Penney.  Penney's had four stores in 1908, 312 in 1920, and 1452 in 1930. \nSears, Roebuck & Company, a giant mail-order house, opened its first eight retail stores in 1925, and operated 338 by 1930, and 595 by 1940.  The chains reached a middle-class audience that was more interested in value than in upscale fashions.  Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women, especially with lines of hardware and building materials. It deemphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability, and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk. Some of its stores were oriented to motorists \u2013 set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience; had ample, free, off-street parking; and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, \"windowless\" stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns.At the lower end of the scale were the variety stores, especially the dime stores, led by Woolworth, Kresge, and Kress. They operated over 4,200 stores in 1930.  By the 21st century, the dime store disappeared and the niche of low-cost, high turnover merchandise was taken over by the dollar stores.The 2000s have seen a worldwide decline in department stores with the rise of e-commerce. The number of companies operating department stores dropped from 95 (operating 9,969 stores) in 2006 to 68 (operating 9,456 stores) in 2013.\n\n\n==== Segmentation ====\n\nDepartment stores tend to target different socio-economic and geographic segments:\n\nUpscale/Luxury: Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus/Bergdorf Goodman\nMiddle market/Upscale: Nordstrom, Macy's, Belk, Lord + Taylor, Von Maur,  Dillard's\nOff-price retailers: Nordstrom Rack, Century 21, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, Ross Dress for Less, and Burlington are stores that sell designer goods at lower prices, often on a surplus basis.\nMiddle market/Downscale: JCPenney, Boscov's, Kohl's, Sears\nDiscount stores: Kmart, Meijer, Target, WalmartStores that carry a general line of groceries and other product lines similar to those of department stores are considered warehouse clubs or supercenters. Warehouse clubs require a nominal annual membership fee, while supercenters do not. Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Sam's Club are examples of warehouse clubs.\n\n\n==== Salt Lake City ====\nOn 1 March 1869, Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institution opened in Salt Lake City as a new community store that became the first incorporated department store in America in 1870. A new 3-story brick and iron store was built in 1876, noted for its unique architecture and striped awnings.  This store was replaced by an enclosed shopping center in 1973, and the new Zion department store preserved the gilt-edged ornate facade of the old structure.In 1999, the May Department Stores bought a 14-store ZCMI chain and rebranded it as \"Meier & Frank\", a May property with eight stores in Oregon and Washington. Subsequently, May Department Stores completed a merger with Federated Department Stores and the Meier & Frank brand ZCMI stores became Macy's stores, effective late 2006.\nThe original facade of the ZCMI store was again preserved during the late 2000s construction of city creek center. The original plans removed the facade however public outcry persuaded the retaining of the beautiful historic architecture. The facade can still be seen from the TRAX station that runs between the new complex.\n\n\n==== Detroit ====\n\nIn 1881, Joseph Lowthian Hudson opened a small men's clothing store in Detroit. After 10 years he had eight stores in the midwest and was the most profitable clothing retailer in the country.  In 1893, he began construction of J. L. Hudson Department Store at Gratiot and Farmer Streets in Detroit. The store grew over the years and a 25-story tower was added in 1928.  The final section was a 12-story addition in 1946, giving the entire complex 49 acres (20 ha) of floor space.After World War II Hudson's realized that the limited parking space at its downtown skyscraper would increasingly be a problem for its customers.  The solution in 1954 was to open the Northland Center in nearby Southfield, just beyond the city limits.  It was the largest suburban shopping center in the world, and quickly became the main shopping destination for northern and western Detroit, and for much of the suburbs.  By 1961 the downtown skyscraper accounted for only half of Hudson's sales; it closed in 1983. The Northland Center Hudson's, rebranded Macy's in 2006 following acquisition by Federated Department Stores, was closed along with the remaining stores in the center in March 2015 due to the center's high storefront vacancy, decaying infrastructure, and financial mismanagement.In 1969 Hudson's merged with the Dayton's to create Dayton-Hudson Corporation headquartered in Minneapolis.\n\n\n==== Minneapolis ====\nGeorge Dayton had founded his Dayton's Dry Goods store in Minneapolis in 1902 and the AMC cooperative in 1912.  His descendants built Southdale Center in 1956, opened the Target discount store chain in 1962 and the B. Dalton Bookseller chain in 1966. Dayton's grew to 19 stores under the Dayton's name plus five other regional names acquired by Dayton-Hudson. The Dayton-Hudson Corporation closed the flagship J. L. Hudson Department Store in downtown Detroit in 1983, but expanded its other retail operations. It acquired Mervyn's in 1978, Marshall Field's in 1990, and renamed itself the Target Corporation in 2000. In 2002, Dayton's and Hudson's were consolidated into the Marshall Field's name.  In 2005, May Department Stores acquired all of the Marshall Field's stores and shortly thereafter, Macy's acquired May.\n\n\n==== Pittsburgh ====\nIn 1849, Horne's began operations and soon became a leading Pittsburgh department store. In 1879, it opened a seven-story landmark which was the first department store in the city's downtown.  In 1972, Associated Dry Goods acquired Horne's, and ADG expanded operations of Horne's to several stores in suburban centers throughout the Pittsburgh region as well as in Erie, Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio. In December 1986, Horne's was acquired by a local investor group following ADG's acquisition by May Department Stores. By 1994, Federated Department Stores acquired the remaining ten Horne's stores and merged them with its Lazarus division, completely ceasing all operations of any store under the Horne's name.\nKaufmann's was founded in Pittsburgh in 1871 by Jacob and Isaac Kaufmann. In 1877, the brothers moved downtown to a location that became known as The Big Store. \"The Big Store\" featured a large landmark outdoor clock that became a popular meeting place and city icon.\n\n\n=== Venezuela ===\nIn Venezuela the biggest chains are Beco and Traki.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of department stores by country\nList of department stores of the United Kingdom\nList of department stores of the United States\nList of defunct department stores of the United States\nDistribution, Retail, Marketing\nHistory of retailing in the modern era\nTypes of retail outlets\n\n\n=== Major chains ===\nAssociated Dry Goods\nBelk\nBergdorf Goodman\nBloomingdale's\nCarrefour\nDe Bienkoff\nDillard's\nEl Corte Ingl\u00e9s\nGaleries Lafayette\nHudson's Bay Company\nJCPenney\nLord & Taylor\nMacy's\nMarshall Field's\nThe May Department Stores Company\nNeiman Marcus\nNordstrom\nSears\nVon Maur\nWalmart\nWoolworth\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe rise of the department store in Britain\nA.T.

        "wiki": "The Pavillon Le Corbusier is a Swiss art museum in Z\u00fcrich-Seefeld at Z\u00fcrichhorn dedicated to the work of the Swiss architect Le Corbusier. In 1960 Heidi Weber had the vision to establish a museum designed by Le Corbusier \u2013 this building should exhibit his works of art in an ideal environment created by the architect himself in the then Centre Le Corbusier or Heidi Weber Museum. In April 2014 the building and museum went over to the city of Z\u00fcrich, and was renamed in May 2016.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe building is located on the Z\u00fcrichsee lake shore nearby Z\u00fcrichhorn in the Seefeld quarter. It can be reached by foot (20 minutes from Bellevueplatz\u2013Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz) or by public transportation: Trams 2 and 4 and bus line 33 to stops H\u00f6schgasse or Fr\u00f6hlichstrasse, or bus lines 912 and 916 from Bellevue to Chinagarten, or by the Limmat boats operated by the Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG) towards Z\u00fcrichhorn.\n\n\n== Centre Le Corbusier building ==\nIt is the last building designed by Le Corbusier marking a radical change of his achievement of using concrete and stone, framed in steel and glass, in the 1960s created as a signpost for the future. Le Corbusier made intensive use of prefabricated steel elements combined with multi-coloured enamelled plates fitted to the central core, and above the complex he designed a 'free-floating' roof to keep the house protected from the rain and the sun.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe most prominent architectural element, the roof, consists of two square parts, each side having a surface of 12 x 12 metres (39 ft). The total ground surface measures 12 x 26.3 metres (86 ft), consisting of welded metal sheets and having a weight of 40 tons. The roof was prefabricated and thereafter, in the biggest possible units, transported to the building site, where it was assembled on the ground. The two finally welded parts of the roof were then lifted to their final height (9 metres (30 ft)) by a crane and fixed on the pillars. With the frame thus completed, the construction process benefited from the independent roof protection which was at that time already in its proper place. It consists of cubes 2.26 x 2.26 metres (7.4 ft) which were assembled on the site. Walls, windows, ceilings and floors were then screwed onto the steel frame. The walls consist of enamelled panels measuring 1.13 metres (3.7 ft) x 2.26 metres (7.4 ft). The placing of these enamel panels was planned according to a particular rhythmic system. Finally, the entire building complex was placed on a concrete ground floor. The building has two floors \u2013 five single-storied and one double-storied rooms. When constructing the building complex, more than 20,000 bolts were used.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe Centre Le Corbusier can be considered a Gesamtkunstwerk, i.e. a total work of art, and reflects the harmonic unity of Le Corbusier's architecture, sculptures, paintings, furniture designs and his writings, which is unique and possibly the only one such existing structure in the world. In 1968/69 J\u00fcrg Gasser's comprehensive photographic survey related to Chandigarh was exhibited; the Z\u00fcrich photographer had visited the new capital of India's constituent state of Punjab on behalf of Heidi Weber. While Heidi Weber removed Le Corbusier's  sculptures, designs and mementos in mid-May 2016 for personal reasons, the city of Z\u00fcrich as the new owner replaced these items from others sources respectively collections.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1960 Le Corbusier was mandated by Heidi Weber, a Swiss art collector and patron, to conceive a public exhibition building. One year later, the first drawings for a building to be constructed in concrete were presented, in 1962 the concept was changed to a steel building. Two years later the construction was started. In 1965 Le Corbusier died, and on 15 July 1967, the Centre Le Corbusier was officially inaugurated. On 13 May 1964 the city government presented the plot of land for the museum in construction law for 50 years free of charge. Therefore, on 13 May 2014 the building became the property of the city of Z\u00fcrich represented by the newly created public Heidi Weber Foundation \u2013 Centre Le Corbusier. The board of trustees is represented by the city as well as by Mrs Heidi Weber: I welcome this solution. It helps me to be able to enter the house in new hands.By April 2016 the Heidi Weber Foundation \u2013 Centre Le Corbusier preserved the last building designed by Le Corbusier, organized exhibitions, and collected and documents related to the architect's work. In an interview end of May 2016, Heidi Weber stated that she's disappointed that the city of Z\u00fcrich renamed the museum and building in Pavillon Le Corbusier, while ignoring the well-established name Heidi Weber Museum. Otherwise, municipal officials stated that the museum's name Centre Le Corbusier \u2013 Heidi Weber Museum was damned by Mrs Weber. In mid-May 2016 Heidi Weber vacated the museum and removed images, sketches, sculptures, tapestry, furniture, the original models of the building, and an archive of Corbusier's letters and notes, after negotiations with the city of Z\u00fcrich failed from her perspective. An agreement with Heidi Weber had failed at their price expectations, the mayor's office annotated. Weber has pursued legal action to have her name restored to the museum.Mid-2016 the museum was admininistered by the cultural department of the city of Z\u00fcrich, after the establishment of a foundation no longer was to realize, according to the city's officials, due to changes in the law. While a plaque at the museum's entrance points Weber's merits and hold the gratitude of the city of Z\u00fcrich, Weber negotiates with the cities of Shanghai and Santiago de Chile on the opening of a Corbusier-house, her son complemented in the interview end of May 2016. The museum was run by Eva Wagner from 2014 to 2017. During this period, there were four temporary exhibitions on the work and personality of Le Corbusier, as well as works by the Swiss architect. Since then, the pavilion has attracted a total of around 35,000 visitors in the summer months. On 1 October 2017 the museum closed and the interim operation ended.\n\n\n== Reorganisation and renovation ==\nThe listed pavilion will be renovated until spring 2019. From then on, the Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung will operate the pavilion. A jury of experts unanimously chose the concept of the museum in September 2017 because it convinced with an \"attractive, tailor-made programme for exhibitions and accompanying events\". In December 2016, the city parliament had approved operating subsidies of CHF 500,000 per annum for the new sponsorship for the years 2019 to 2022. In addition, the city will be exempted from rent of CHF 220,000 per annum.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage of national importance ==\nThe museum is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nHeidi Weber \u2013 50 Years Ambassador for Le Corbusier 1958\u20132008.

          "Undergoing external renovations at the moment making it a little difficult to find the entrance, it is worth persevering as it has a manageable sized collection of Italian, Dutch and Swiss art as well as some of the impressionists. Quite a few Chagall as well which makes it",
          "There are a number of small art museums around the world that hold unique works of magic - of those, I know The Whitechapel Gallery in London, The Art Institut in Chicago, the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet. The Rodin Museum, The Picasso museums in Paris and the two museums in Lucerne",
          "I'm not sure I'd call this a museum. Not a lot of art, the layout was confusing, and we kept getting conflicting information about pricing for exhibits.",
          "common artists are shown - entrance a bit hard to find - sometimes interesting projects - small bookshop",
          "I love art museums and Kunsthalle Zurich is definitely worth a visit if you are in Zurich. The museum is more interesting on the iside that the outside so do not judge it by the skin. There are different exhibitions and there are also galleries in the building, and the area is",
          "This venue is home to a great selection of galleries at two museums, a dream come true for any contemporary art lover. Groundbreaking shows and cool bookshops complete the picture. I enjoyed it a lot and wish there were more places like this around Europe.",
          "Although it is not much trouble to reach the Kunsthalle, by tram from the center of the city, for us it was a very disappointing experience. In a very big building the entrance of the Kunsthalle is hardly indicated, you can reach it by a construction elevator .There are several",
          "Appart from the fact that it is very expensive (12 chf) for such a small museum (2 rooms with 5 artwork each). We had the joy to look at 3 photos of electric plug, some carpets and a coat-hanger. For the next visitors, focus rather on the Pictet award exhibition which is free,",
          "I suppose it depends on what the current exhibitions are, but what I saw was worthless. The private galleries in the same building had some interesting stuff, though.",
          "It's a really nice place to visit if you like contemporary art. The curator did a great job on the display, everything flows perfectly. On Thursday the entrance is free from 17:00-20:00,so if you are in Zurich and have time to enjoy art, this is a place worth visiting.",
          "Great art book shop, superb mix of galleries on three floors, cool(ing) architecture, in fun quartier of Zurich. The Ragnar Kjartansson video installation in the Migros Museum part of Kunsthalle was mind-blowing.",
          "Worst kind of contemporary art. That's not an objective statement; you should go and judge for yourself, but I couldn't stand to look at it.",
          "Extremely pleasant, & a bit more manageable than comparable institutions (e.g., The Louvre & Prado). A worthy collection of Flemish, Italian & Spanish masters, but also has a fine sampling of Swiss art -- as you might expect, a lot of the landscapes are spectacular. Looking",
          "I took my time and only visited the top floor with the impressionist paintings. The collection is excellent and very well displayed. I took the audio tour which was a fantastic addition to my tour especially as there were so many paintings with commentary. From the outside"

          "This art display is far out of the way of the city and shows a limited selection of artwork. The building is huge and surprisingly empty. It is free entry with the Zurich pass, I would say that is the only reason for you to come and visit it, otherwise best to skip and do something else",

It is one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in Switzerland and has become synonymous with wealth and the Swiss banks, being the location of the headquarters of both UBS and Credit Suisse.\nThe site of the square lay without the medieval city walls, and was incorporated into the town with the construction of the new ramparts in 1642. During the 17th century, it served as a livestock market, known as S\u00e4um\u00e4rt (\"pig market\"), renamed to Neumarkt (\"new market\") in 1819 and finally to its current name following the construction of Bahnhofstrasse (1865). The hotel Baur en Ville on the eastern end of the square opened in 1838. Paradeplatz was the scene of clashes between insurgents and cantonal troops during the 1839 Z\u00fcriputsch.  \nThe Confiserie Spr\u00fcngli at the southern end opened in 1859. The Credit Suisse (formerly Kreditanstalt) building at the northern end dates to 1873, the UBS (formerly Bankverein) building at the western end to 1897\u201399. The first horse-drawn trams circulated in 1882 and were electrified in 1896.\nParadeplatz is one of the main nodal points of the Z\u00fcrich tram network, and the stop is served by lines 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 and 17. \n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Paradeplatz Z\u00fcrich at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Difficult to understand why this is listed. As another reviewer remarked, it's a landmark, not an attraction. If you look across from the square to the other side of Bahnhofstrasse, you'll see a couple of nice buildings - but strictly speaking they're not in the square. It's",
          "Paradeplatz is a very central square in Zurich which lies also at the Bahnhofstrasse. once you're there it's really close to go to Fraumunster church, to the old city, to the Limmat and to several other attractions. in additional to that there are a few banks there",

          "I am not so sure this is a sight as much as a landmark so that you know where you are. Sprugeli is there. Our guide told us the history ... but this would not make my top 10 Zurich list.",
          "Rolex, Gucci, Armani, Jimmy Choo, name the brand and you have it there. You require really deep pockets to get something from here but of course the costliest street in the world is a must walk to see all the big brands and labels assembled under one roof. I didn't buy anything",
          "What is special here???? Well, it is at the city center, but there is not much to tell about... You can walk up from there to the really old town, but Parade Platz is not worthy itself",
          "It is the center of the city where the trams travel trough to different parts of Z\u00fcrich - there are many nice restaurants to choose from and it is near the Lake of Z\u00fcrich",
          "This place was the most important to find your group or your mate near can shopping, banking, taking your cafe..etc",
          "Paradeplatz should really be considered the center of urban Zurich. On one side is the Zeughauskeller, a one-time armory (translation of the name) with great robust and hearty fare, on all other sides are shops, hotels, restaurants, and a tram/bus hub. The access to the square",
          "There are many banks located at Paradeplatz. It is in the middle of Bahnhofstrasse, which is the main shopping street in Zurich. Very nice, very expensive.",
          "It's kinda zero point in Z\u00fcrich, where you may find UBS AG, Credit Suisse and HSBC including lots of Hotel, restaurants, bars and Shopping mall around this area...even though it sounds like business area but still you have chance get around for fun!",
          "If you want to see the headquarters of the Swiss banks UBS and CS, go there. Also if you wish to indulge in some luxury shopping. Other than that there is not too much to do there in my opinion. But it is a famous place in Switzerland for sure...",
          "this is the place where everything comes together. Spruengli has an amazing brunch on the weekend that is not to be missed. Go across to Credit Swiss and check out what art exhibit is going on. Also this is where the most expensive stores from Bahnhofstrasse are.",
          "Is a place with plenty of cafeterias, restaurants and shops. Nothing impressive, but the place one will cross walking the Bahnhofstrasse.",
          "I agree with the other posters. I don't even consider this a \"Square\" as European standards go. I'm not saying it's not worth walking by because you will most likely do that anyway just walking around in the Bahnhofstrasse area. But there isn't anything significant to see.",
          "This is the place most of the strassebahn stops, it really situated in the centre of Zurich. You can easily access the bahnhofstarsse from here or going somewhere else around.",
          "Except if you like to visit banks, there is nothing extremely spectacular to see there for a tourist, except maybe the Spr\u00fcngli Konditorei.",
          "Paradeplatz is great to just sit down and watch the world go by. Sprungli is located at Paradeplatz too which makes the day even more enjoyable",
          "The surrounding buildings are beautiful, and many trams stop here, easily accessible. Sprungli here is a must-visit.",
          "Nothing to see which is unusual. But don't miss the Spruengli cafe",
          "The square doesn't look that spectacular, I agree. But be aware that you stand in the middle of some of the main financial institutes worldwide! And that it once served as pig-market.. :) Don't miss to: - buy some \"Luxemburgerli\" at the Spr\u00fcngli shop (pricey but a must-try!) -",
          "There's nothing there. Really. Just a tram stop and a couple of bank head offices",
          "We used the trams quite a bit and there is a very good interchange here and of course some very nice shopping in the adjacent little cobbled streets.",
          "Great to see this great Winter into Spring festival. Unexpected and colourful. Check the Zurich tourist board for other such parades - the Swiss really let their hair down when given the chance!",
          "Sprungli, UBS, Credit Suisse and the Savoy Hotel dominate this massive square in down town Zurich. Steps away from the old town, at one end of the Bahnhofstrasse with connections for trams in any direction.",
          "A landmark in Zurich, a place starred in many films, it is the heart of the banking metropole. It is both traditional and forward looking and busy with people in suits all day long. It belongs to Zurich local culture.",
          "Basically just a bunch of tram stops. No special shops.",
          "It's a really nice place where both Credit Suisse and UBS banks are. Very well connected with several tram lines. Also a lot of lovely shops around it. It's worth it!",
          "Don't know what the fuss is about really. Just stops for several trams. nothing else.",
          "Had a wonderful time buying Luxemburgerli at Sprungli. Next time we will check out the coffee house.",
          "Too much attitude here for my liking. I walk by this area most days and always amused by the attitudes I encounter.",
          "Huge traditional, atmospheric restaurant...20 different kinds of sausage with Swiss specialities...great service and experience and not over the top expensive!",
          "not really a charming spot per se but central to the tram system (in addition to bellevue, central, and hauptbanhoff) and the banhofstrasse main shopping st - you'll most like end up here at some pt on a zurich visit!",
          "It is staid and unremarkable but it has the headquarters of the two largest Swiss banks and the famous Spr\u00fcngli of fresh Luxemb\u00fcrgerli tradition (creamy macarron-type cookies)",
          "It was a dark and cold day and we arranged to meet my brother that evening at the Paradeplatz. Whilst walking from the railway station and doing some window-shopping it started to rain. Not knowing how far we still had to go, we kept walking until we found it and my brother. The",
          "Not sure why Paradeplatz would be an attraction in and of itself. If you walk from the Main station down to the lake via Bahnhofstrasse, you'll cross paradeplatz which I mainly think of as a tram stop. It does have a nice art deco style kiosk building in the middle of the",
          "Paradeplatz is simply a tram station. There is absolutely nothing to rate here.",
          "You can't miss it, so you will probably get there even if it isn't on your list. Part of the Occupy movement was here when we went and that was interesting to see. Otherwise, you can catch several trams from this location.",
          "Zurich is not a big town and accordingly its places are mostly small. Paradeplatz is flanked by the two giants: Credit Suisse and UBS. Credit Suisse resides in an old and impressive building while unfortunately UBS HQs stay in a miodern office building that lacks personality and",

        "wiki": "The Basel museums encompass a series of museums in the city of Basel, Switzerland, and the neighboring region. They represent a broad spectrum of collections with a marked concentration in the fine arts and house numerous holdings of international significance. With at least three dozen institutions, not including the local history collections in the surrounding communities, the region offers an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other metropolitan areas of similar size. They draw some one and a half million visitors annually.\nConstituting an essential and defining component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museums of the canton of Basel-City arose from the 1661 purchase of the private Amerbach Cabinet by the city and the University of Basel and thus represent the oldest civic museum collection in continuous existence. Since the 1980s, a number of collections have been made public in new purpose-built structures that have achieved renown as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\n\n== Museum landscape ==\nThe main focus of collecting among Basel museums is the fine arts \u2013 painting, drawing and sculpture. More than a dozen museums cover a spectrum that extends from antiquity up to the present and includes historic and established works of art as well as pioneering creations. In particular, the latter category has been made increasingly accessible to the public over the past two decades in a series of newly opened museums. There are collections with more of a local and regional character, yet a number of area museums, especially the larger institutions, are noted for their international orientation and reach. In addition, Basel benefits from a long tradition of collecting that, in contrast to many other museums in Central Europe, was not disrupted by the wars of the 20th century, as well as from the city's well-established connections to the market of art dealers and art collectors \u2013 such as through Art Basel.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nNumerous museums address various themes of cultural history and ethnology while other institutions feature technical and scientific collections. The museums continue to be oriented to the scholarly tasks of collecting, conserving and exhibiting as well as research and education or at least view these as part of their activities. Consistent with museological trends seen elsewhere, however, the traditional self-image has evolved since the 1960s. Alongside the new forms of public outreach (museum education and didactics), institutional hybrid forms have arisen that actively embrace a sociopolitically relevant role and in which museum operations constitute just one facet, albeit a highly important one, of a more comprehensive cultural institution.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWith the city's position at the junction of the \"Dreil\u00e4ndereck\" (Three-Countries Corner) and the compact municipal boundaries within the Basel region, most of Basel's museums are located in the city of Basel and thus in the canton of Basel-City but quite a few of museums lie in the canton of Basel-Country. The Basel museum landscape can also be said to extend to the museums of the greater metropolitan area, such as those in the neighboring towns of L\u00f6rrach, Saint-Louis and Weil am Rhein, with the latter included in the annual Basel Museum Night through the participation of Vitra Design Museum in Weil. In view of the numerous municipal, regional and national administrative units that come together here as well as the broader agglomeration, it is difficult to produce a conclusive figure for the number of Basel museums. Yet even when taking a narrowly drawn perimeter, the total comes to at least three dozen institutions that house collections and make them accessible to the public. The Basel museums are also part of the German-French-Swiss \"Upper Rhine Museum Pass\" that was introduced in 1999. This covers a much wider area than the Basel region, however, extending via Strasbourg up to Mannheim.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWith the increasing aestheticization of everyday life, the architecture of museums has taken on special significance since the 1980s. A striking number of exhibition structures have incorporated a vocabulary of postmodern and deconstructivist forms. In and around Basel, new buildings, additions or renovations have been constructed from designs by nationally and internationally renowned architects (Renzo Piano, Zaha Hadid, Frank O. Gehry, Wilfried and Katharina Steib, Herzog & de Meuron, Mario Botta) and celebrated as examples of avant-garde museum architecture. In other area museums, by contrast, the building fabric is old to very old, consisting of former residential and commercial buildings or monasteries and churches that have been converted for exhibition purposes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe museums are a central aspect of Basel's touristic appeal and hence an important economic factor. A number of Basel's museums are public institutions but the majority are privately sponsored, backed in most cases by foundations. Helping to generate the high density of museums compared to other cities and metropolitan areas of similar size, these private collections have also made a substantial contribution to the high level of museum quality. The private collections nearly all came into being after the Second World War. Most of the public museums, by contrast, date from before the war. In fact, the collections of the five publicly run museums of the canton of Basel-City have histories that go back several centuries.\n\n\n== Development of the museums ==\n\n\n=== Museums in the city ===\n\n\n==== Early collections ====\n\nThe origins of the first public collection are closely linked to the University of Basel and the early modern era collections of books, art and natural curiosities, of which there were quite a few in Basel. Prominent among them, the Amerbach printer family (founded by Johann Amerbach) had collected a substantial number of books, paintings, goldsmith works, coins and natural objects during the 16th century. In 1661, the Amerbach Cabinet was on the verge of being disbanded following a purchase offer from Amsterdam, then the European center for the trade in collector's items. At the urging of the mayor Johann Rudolf Wettstein, the city and university decided to jointly purchase the collection in order to keep it in Basel. Installed in the Haus zur M\u00fccke just off Cathedral Square in 1671, the collection did not operate like a museum. It principally served as a library for university scholars, with only a few parlors on the first floor reserved for works of art and natural objects. Two librarians were in charge of administering the overall collection.\n\nBeginning in the late 18th century, Basel saw an acceleration in the growth of collections of books and objects inspired by Enlightenment-era ideals of education and refinement. Significant holdings of antiquities, coins, fossils and natural curiosities made their way into the Haus zur M\u00fccke through purchases, gifts or bequests by private collectors. An especially important addition came in 1823 with the contents of the Museum Faesch, a Basel collection from the 17th century. The first coherent ethnological collection was formed from the \"Mexican cabinet\" that had been assembled by the merchant Lukas Vischer from 1828 to 1837 during his travels in Central America. In 1821, the natural objects and artifacts were separated out from the collections in the Haus zur M\u00fccke and an independent museum of natural history was established at the Falkensteiner Hof, likewise located right off Cathedral Square, which also included the instrument cabinets of the physics and chemistry institutes.The city's official repository for art was the Basel Town Hall (Rathaus) whose rich ornamentation and upkeep represented a constant undertaking for the city and a source of commissions for numerous artists from the early 16th century onward. The city armory likely had a \"museum corner\" starting in the 16th century. Following common practice, weapons that had become unfit for war were decommissioned for disposal. In Basel, however, a substantial number of them were preserved, which means that the armory caretakers wished to store the obsolete medieval or early modern militaria for the sake of memory value. The most prominent examples were the real and supposed trophies of the Burgundian booty from 1476, which had fallen to Basel and remained on display to curious onlookers centuries later. In contrast, the care and storage of the Basel Cathedral Treasury that had lost its liturgical value in the Reformation did not bear the character of a museum. Locked away in the cathedral sacristy for three centuries, the reliquaries and other religious objects remained inaccessible and out of view until 1833 and were merely listed as book value in the state budgets.\n\n\n==== First museum building ====\n\nIn 1767, the university professor Johann Jakob d\u2019Annone had the paintings and other objects moved to the previously empty ground floor of the Haus zur M\u00fccke to create more space for the books on the first floor, and also provided for a more systematic organization. A few decades later, however, the building and its infrastructure no longer accommodated the increased volume of visitors (with the facility open four days of the week starting in 1829) and the modern culture of knowledge established through the Enlightenment. Moreover, a comprehensive index of the holdings was lacking, having been \"altogether impossible heretofore in the inadequate premises where some pieces lay buried in darkened recesses for decades beneath an inch-thick layer of dust.\"The need for space was resolved in 1849 with the removal of the collection to the multi-purpose building by Melchior Berri on Augustinergasse \u2013 simply named the \"Museum\" \u2013 on the site of the former Augustinian monastery. It was financed with a one-time contribution from the canton along with citizen donations. The late classicistic monumental edifice with decorative painting and frescoes by Arnold B\u00f6cklin is a comparatively early example of a civic museum and the first major museum in Basel. While taking clear inspiration from Karl Friedrich Schinkel and his Academy of Architecture in Berlin, the allocation of spaces and functions here combined university facilities with a library and natural history and art collections. This also served the institutional requirements of the university. Further examples of collections could be found in most of the subsidiary institutes \u2013 i.e., facilities with demonstration objects for instruction and research purposes. These included the instruments of the chemistry and physics institutes and the utensils of the anatomical institute.\n\n\n==== Division of the public collections into state museums ====\n \nParallel to the specialization of the educational and research disciplines that took hold at the beginning of the 19th century, Basel's wide-ranging holdings of objects evolved into institutional collections divided according to various scientific fields. They were very different from the cabinets of curiosities that, according to the Basel professor Wilhelm Wackernagel, had merely involved \"[mindless grabbing] at curiosities with a half-pedantic, half-childish zeal\". The Natural History Museum (Naturhistorisches Museum) founded in 1821 was the first step in this new direction. In 1836, the art collection was made legally independent from the university library with a separate publicly funded art commission to oversee it. In 1856, the \"medieval collection\" took up residence in auxiliary rooms and annexes of the Basel Cathedral (Bishop's Court, St. Nicholas Chapel), having been established earlier that year with inventories from the Museum on Augustinergasse based on the model of the German National Museum in Nuremberg. In 1887, castings of ancient sculptures were put on display in the Sculpture Hall of the Basel Art Association (Basler Kunstverein). Meanwhile, in 1874, the chemistry and physics institutes had moved into the new Bernoullianum building for the study of the natural sciences, whereupon their holdings of objects shed their collection character in favor of laboratory facilities. The canton had difficulty amassing funding and support for the creation of another museum for its collections. The Museum on Augustinergasse had represented a formidable beginning, yet remained the only one of its kind for nearly fifty years.\n\nIn 1892, the \"antiquarian collection\" (small artifacts of antiquity, excluding ethnological objects) was joined with the medieval collection of the Basel Cathedral and historical weapons from the Basel Armory to form the Historical Museum Basel (Historisches Museum Basel), with exhibition space in the reconverted Barf\u00fcsser Church from 1894 onwards. Today this museum houses the Upper Rhine's most comprehensive collection of cultural history, showing artisanal crafts (Cathedral Treasury, goldsmith works, stained glass) and objects of everyday culture (furnishings, tapestries, coin cabinet). Major emphasis is placed on the Late Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque periods. The entire inventory of books was incorporated into the collection of the new University Library in 1896. The \"ethnographic collection\", which was given the title Collection of Ethnology (Sammlung f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde) in 1905, moved into new space created by an addition to the Museum on Augustinergasse in 1917, where it became the Museum of Ethnology (Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde). With holdings of approximately 300,000 objects and a comparable number of historical photographs, it is the largest ethnological museum in Switzerland and one of the largest in Europe. The collection includes objects from Europe, Ancient Egypt, Africa, Asia (Tibet and Bali Collections), Ancient America and Oceania. In 1944, the federal administration distinguished its European holdings as the Swiss Museum of Ethnology (Schweizerisches Museum f\u00fcr Volkskunde). However, since 1997 this division no longer exists; non-European and European collections are now joined in the Basel Museum of Cultures (Museum der Kulturen Basel), whose name intentionally expresses a change in emphasis from the presentation of \u201cforeign\u201d cultures to intercultural dialogue. The Natural History Museum Basel (Naturhistorisches Museum Basel), which features most areas of the natural sciences (anthropology, mineralogy, paleontology, vertebrates, insects including the Frey Collection of Beetles and other invertebrates), has not only remained in its original location since 1849 but has also retained its traditional name. Its collections, comprising nearly eight million objects which are also dedicated to scientific research, bear the title \"Archives of Life\".\n\nThe public art collection was installed in the upper story of the Museum on Augustinergasse in 1849. Its continuing growth led to increasing spatial demands that could not be met at that location. In 1936, after a planning period of roughly three decades, the art collection moved into the Kunstmuseum Basel. Satellite locations had already been established in 1922 at the Augustinerhof on Augustinergasse (collection of prints and drawings) and at the Bachofenhaus on Cathedral Square (Bachofen Collection with additional holdings). The greater part of the art collection was temporarily housed in the Kunsthalle from 1928 until 1936. The Kunstmuseum's gallery of paintings and collection of prints and drawings comprise the largest and most significant public art collection in Switzerland. With an emphasis on paintings and drawings by artists of the Upper Rhine from 1400 to 1600 (Holbein family, Witz, Cranach the Elder, Gr\u00fcnewald) and art of the 19th to 21st centuries (B\u00f6cklin, van Gogh, C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin, Cubism with Picasso and Braque, German Expressionism, postwar American art), it also ranks as one of the leading international museums of its kind. Since the removal of the art collection to new quarters, the Museum on Augustinergasse has served as the exclusive domain of the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Cultures/Museum of Ethnology (V\u00f6lkerkundemuseum/Museum der Kulturen). A major expansion of the public museum collections occurred in 1961 with the founding of the Basel Museum of Ancient Art and Ludwig Collection (Antikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig). This new institution combined previous holdings from the Historical Museum (small artifacts of antiquity) and Kunstmuseum (sculptures) with acquisitions from private collections, which are displayed in two neoclassical villas located opposite the Kunstmuseum. The Museum of Ancient Art opened in the first villa in 1966 and expanded into the adjacent structure, also built by architect Melchior Berri, in 1988. It is the only Swiss museum devoted exclusively to the art of the Mediterranean area (mainly Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Italic and Roman cultures, as well as Levante and the Near East) from the 4th millennium B.C. to the 7th century A.D. The collections of Greek vases, Antique sculptures and Ancient Egyptian artifacts occupy a central position within its holdings.\n\n\n==== Satellite locations of the state museums ====\n \nThe growing spatial needs of the collections that were housed in the Museum on Augustinergasse led to the incorporation of neighboring buildings. Similarly, the other museums also expanded. The Historical Museum in Barf\u00fcsser Church acquired the following satellite locations: the Museum of Domestic Life (Wohnmuseum) in the Segerhof (1926\u201334) and its successor in the Haus zum Kirschgarten since 1951, the Museum of Domestic Culture in Basel (Museum der Basler Wohnkultur); the Museum of Music (Musikmuseum), featuring five centuries of European musical history based on the musical instrument collection founded in 1943, which has been displayed since 2000 in the former prison Lohnhof; the carriage and sleigh collection in Br\u00fcglingen, established in 1981. Replica casts of ancient sculptures that were originally on display in the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturenhalle), but moved into storage in 1927 due to a lack of public interest, became part of the Museum of Ancient Art (Antikenmuseum) in 1961 and again received their own exhibition space in 1963 in the new Basel Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle Basel). It features the world's only complete reconstruction of architectural sculpture from the Parthenon in Athens. The Public Art Collection (\u00d6ffentliche Kunstsammlung) also expanded into a second building in 1981 with the Museum of Contemporary Art (Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwartskunst) in St. Alban-Tal. As the first public exhibition building project in Europe, it is devoted exclusively to the presentation of contemporary works and artistic production since 1960. In addition to classic media such as painting and sculpture, its acquisitions also include video art.\n\n\n==== Defunct and semi-public museums ====\n \nThe Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) was founded in 1878 by the Society of Trades and Craftsmen as a forum for the presentation of local arts and crafts. It became a semi-public institution in 1886 before coming under full public sponsorship in 1914. Renamed the Museum of Design (Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung) in 1989 due to its broadening thematic spectrum, it was closed in 1996. Affected by the same cuts in public funding was the architecturally oriented City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und M\u00fcnstermuseum), established in 1939 under the auspices of the public agency for the preservation of historic monuments in the former convent of Kleines Klingental. The holdings of the Museum of Design were distributed among other institutions, with the transferral of its library and poster collection to the School of Design (Schule f\u00fcr Gestaltung). Thanks to the support of a foundation, the City and Cathedral Museum remains on the same premises under the present name Kleines Klingental Museum.\nThe Swiss Firefighting Museum (Schweizerisches Feuerwehrmuseum), founded in 1957 as the Basel Firefighting Museum, is housed on the premises of the cantonal Fire Brigade but does not have the status of a public museum and is not administered by the canton. Its collection, which includes permanent loans from the Historical Museum, features documents that date back to the 13th century. The H\u00f6rnli Cemetery Collection (Sammlung Friedhof H\u00f6rnli) operates under similar conditions: It has been located on the property of the canton's Central Cemetery since 1994 but is funded and run by a private association. On display are burial objects such as urns, documents on the history of cremation, hearses, coffins, cemetery regulations, graveyard crosses, glass pearl chains and memorial keepsakes.\n\n\n==== Additional museums ====\n\nThe first museum that was not supported and administered by the canton of Basel-City was established in 1860 in a large room at the Basel Mission. It presented ritual and cultural objects from the countries and ethnic groups among which the Basel Mission was active, as well as a portrait gallery of its missionaries. However, parts of this exhibit were later sold to the canton and the gallery space was closed. The concept of a multi-purpose building, following the example of the Museum on Augustinergasse, was embraced by the Basel Art Society (Basler Kunstverein), which erected the Kunsthalle on Steinenberg between 1869 and 1872. In addition to exhibition space and administrative offices, this building housed a library and studio space for sculptors. A building wing added in 1885 accommodated the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle), where the previously mentioned casts of Antique statues from the Museum on Augustinergasse were displayed from 1886 to 1927. The former Artists House (K\u00fcnstlerhaus) now defines itself \u201cas a hub between artists and art agents and as a place that brings together local and international developments.\u201d The next privately initiated museum was the above-mentioned Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum); founded in 1878, it came under cantonal administration just eight years later. The Anatomical Museum (Anatomisches Museum) of the University of Basel dates back to the acquisitional activities of Carl Gustav Jung in the 1820s. As the Collection of Pathology and Anatomy (Pathologisch-Anatomische Sammlung), it moved into its own building in 1880. Two especially significant objects in this collection are the oldest anatomical specimen in the world (prepared by Andreas Vesalius in Basel in 1543) and a skeleton prepared by Felix Platter in 1573.The Museum of Pharmacy (Pharmazie-Historisches Museum, originally the Historical Apothecary Collection) followed in 1924 after the donation of a private collection to the University of Basel. It is one of the world's largest collections on the history of pharmacy, encompassing old pharmaceuticals and early apothecary objects, laboratory utensils, ceramics, instruments, books, arts and crafts. The Swiss Gymnastics and Sports Museum (Schweizerische Turn- und Sportmuseum), established in 1945, was renamed as the Swiss Sport Museum in 1977. Sponsored by a foundation (Stiftung Sportmuseum Schweiz), its major focus is on ball sports, cycling, gymnastics and winter sports. The shipping museum Transport Hub Switzerland (Verkehrsdrehscheibe Schweiz) emerged from a 1954 exhibition by the Swiss Shipping Company (Schweizerische Reederei) in the Rhine ports of Basel, entitled \u201cOur Path to the Sea.\u201d It is also supported and run by an association of private citizens. The Swiss Historical Paper Collection (Schweizerische Papierhistorische Sammlung) was an affiliate of the Museum of Ethnology (Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde) from 1954 to 1979 before moving into independent quarters in the Gallician Mill, located in the former industrial district of St. Alban, in 1980. Now known as the Swiss Museum for Paper, Writing and Printing (Schweizerisches Museum f\u00fcr Papier, Schrift und Druck), it is sponsored by the Basel Paper Mill Foundation (Stiftung Basler Papierm\u00fchle). The Jewish Museum of Switzerland (J\u00fcdisches Museum Schweiz), which presents the cultural history of Jews in Switzerland and in Basel including documents from the First Zionist Congress held in Basel in 1897, was founded by the Society for the Jewish Museum of Switzerland in 1966.\n\nLike the Kleines Klingental Museum, the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) is located in the building complex of the former Klingental convent. Opened in 1974, the gallery serves as a presentation platform for the current work of artists living in Basel and aims to support emerging artistic talents. It is sponsored by the Klingental Gallery Society (Verein Ausstellungsraum Klingental). The Caricature and Cartoon Museum Basel (Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel), by contrast, was initiated by an individual, the collector and patron Dieter Burckhardt. Founded in 1979, it is devoted to caricatures, cartoons, comics, parodies and pastiches. The eponymous foundation (Stiftung Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel) is a dependent affiliate of the Christoph Merian Foundation. The exhibition galleries have been located in a structure from the Late Gothic period since 1996, following the completion of renovations and a new building addition by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Swiss Architecture Museum (Schweizerisches Architekturmuseum), founded in 1984, has resided since 2004 in the building complex of the Kunsthalle, which was completely renovated and redesigned by the architectural offices Miller & Maranta and Peter M\u00e4rkli. The museum, sponsored by the Architecture Museum Foundation, presents alternating exhibitions on topics of international architecture and urbanism. An advantageous factor is the unusual concentration of internationally renowned architectural firms in Basel; Herzog & de Meuron, in particular, have made significant contributions to regional museum architecture.\nOpened in 1996, the Tinguely Museum features a permanent exhibition on the life and work of the artist Jean Tinguely. The museum's temporary exhibitions present works by friends and contemporaries of Tinguely, as well as other modern artists. Designed by Mario Botta, the museum is financed entirely by the Basel pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche. The Dollhouse Museum (Puppenhausmuseum) was founded in 1998 by its patron and owner Gigi Oeri, who built up the collection herself. In addition to dolls, dollhouses and miniature shops from the 19th and 20th century, it displays the world's largest collection of teddy bears. The media art space [plug.in] opened its doors in 2000 with the backing of the Forum for New Media Association (Verein Forum f\u00fcr neue Medien), which had been founded the previous year. It realizes exhibitions and projects, provides artists with international networking opportunities and helps convey works of media art to the general public. With one of the world's most extensive collections of photographs (around 300,000 works with an emphasis on industrial society in the 19th century), the Herzog Foundation has exhibited its holdings since 2002 in a \u201cLaboratory for Photography\u201d. Located in the Dreispitz industrial sector, the warehouse converted by Herzog & de Meuron encompasses the collection along with a reference library on the history of photography and two additional rooms for study, teaching and research purposes.\n\n\n=== Museums in surrounding communities ===\nMany of the small and mid-sized municipalities around Basel have museums of local history and culture that are not presented in the following. Mention is given to institutions whose scope extends beyond the local level and which are generally open to the public several days a week.\n\n\n==== Collections of natural, cultural and technological history ====\nThe oldest museum in the Basel region outside the city is the Museum of Canton Basel-Country (Museum des Kantons Basel-Landschaft) in Liestal, nowadays called Museum.BL. It was founded in 1837 as a \"Cabinet of Natural Curiosities\" (Naturaliencabinett) and up through the 1930s primarily took up objects of natural history into the collections. Since then, the emphasis has shifted toward cultural history. The diversity of the collection allows the museum to address wide-ranging themes related to the environment, history and the present day. The Museum am Burghof in L\u00f6rrach traces its origins to the L\u00f6rrach Antiquities Association (L\u00f6rracher Altertumsverein) founded in 1882, which bequeathed its collection to the town of L\u00f6rrach in 1927. Commencing operations in 1932 as the Museum of Local History (Heimatmuseum), the current permanent exhibition \u201cExpoTriRhena\u201d presents the history, present-day culture and divisions and similarities within the \"Dreil\u00e4ndereck\" (Three-Countries Corner) border region where Germany, France and Switzerland meet.\n\nOpened in 1957, the Roman Museum at Augst (R\u00f6mermuseum Augst) is an open-air museum on the grounds of the former Roman city of Augusta Raurica, which has been the subject of excavations going back to the Renaissance. The exhibits feature numerous archaeological finds, including the largest silver treasure from Late Antiquity. The adjacent reconstruction of a Roman House (R\u00f6merhaus) was a gift of the Basel patron Ren\u00e9 Clavel while the museum and the entire archaeological park constitute a departmental division of Basel-Country. Located in the Br\u00fcglinger Plateau, the Mill Museum (M\u00fchlemuseum) of the Christoph Merian Foundation is housed in the water mill of the former Br\u00fcglingen farming estate. The structure was converted into a museum in 1966 and presents the history of the mill and the work of millers from the Bronze Age up to the 20th century. The mill is still functional, allowing periodic demonstrations of the operational sequence from the water-powered mill wheel to the rotating millstone.\nOpened to the public in 1972, the Toy Museum and Village and Wine Cultivation Museum (Spielzeugmuseum, Dorf- und Rebbaumuseum) in Riehen complements its exhibits of village history and wine growing with one of the most significant collections of European toys. The toys are drawn from private collections as well as loans from the Museum of Cultures (Museum der Kulturen). The museum is operated as a division of the municipal administration of Riehen. The Museum of Music Automatons (Museum f\u00fcr Musikautomaten) in Seewen, located on the outermost periphery of the Basel museum territory, houses one of the world's largest and most well known collections of Swiss music boxes, disc music boxes, musical timepieces and jewelry and other mechanical musical automatons. It opened to the public in 1979 as a private museum of the collector Heinrich Weiss and was gifted to the Swiss Confederation in 1990. A newly remodeled and expanded facility for presentation of the exhibits was completed in 2000. Finally, the Museum of Electricity (Elektrizit\u00e4tsmuseum) of the electric utility Elektra Birseck opened its doors in M\u00fcnchenstein in 1997. Exhibits explore the history and development of power production and its use. The collection contains rare historic equipment and is complemented by a laboratory in which visitors can experiment with electric power.\n\n\n==== Emphasis on art collections ====\n\nSince the late 1980s, the Basel region has seen a proliferation of new museums addressing themes of art and design, especially concerning works from more recent years. The Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein presents a broad range of design topics, with a special emphasis on furniture and interior design. Though originally based on the private collection of chairs and other furniture assembled by Rolf Fehlbaum, the owner of the Vitra furniture company, the museum was established as an independent institution. The Vitra building complex has made notable contributions to the body of avant-garde architecture in the Basel region. In addition to the 1989 museum by Frank O. Gehry, the grounds feature structures by Zaha Hadid, Nicholas Grimshaw, Tadao Ando and \u00c1lvaro Siza. In 1982, the Beyeler Foundation assumed ownership of the art collection of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler, which the couple had built up over half a century. Since 1997, the works of classical modern art have been exhibited in a building designed by Renzo Piano in the town of Riehen. Featured artists include Degas, Monet, C\u00e9zanne, van Gogh, Picasso, Rothko, Warhol, Lichtenstein and Bacon. The trees in the park surrounding the highly acclaimed building were wrapped by Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1998.\n\nWith the creation of the Basel-Country Art Museum (Kunsthaus Baselland) in Muttenz, the Basel-Country Art Association (Kunstverein Baselland) was given its own dedicated exhibition building in 1997. The Art Museum is devoted to contemporary art and presents temporary exhibitions of current projects by regional and international artists. Opened in 1998, Riehen Art Space (Kunst Raum Riehen) is another public institution with a similar thematic orientation. It serves the municipality of Riehen and its art commission with exhibitions of contemporary works of art from the region. Established in 2001, the Sculpture at Schoenthal Foundation in the former Sch\u00f6nthal monastery presents over twenty works by international and Swiss artists in a permanently accessible sculpture park under the motto \u201cArt and Nature in Dialogue\u201d. A Romanesque-era church has been converted into a gallery for temporary exhibitions of contemporary artists. In 2003, the Schaulager (or \u201cviewing warehouse\u201d) of the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation was opened in M\u00fcnchenstein. Centered on the avant-garde art collection of the foundation, the institute functions as a mix between public museum, art storage facility and art research institute. The polygonal building is a design by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Fernet Branca Contemporary Art Space (Espace d\u2019Art Contemporain Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, the Alsatian town just across the border from Basel, is located in the former Fernet-Branca spirits distillery that was decommissioned in 2000. Since 2004, the museum has presented temporary exhibitions on contemporary art themes and artists. The museum's operations are supported by the Association for the Fernet Branca Contemporary Art Museum (Association pour le Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Contemporain Fernet Branca).\n\n\n== Museum promotion and museum policy ==\n\n\n=== Primacy of the library ===\n\nMany museums can be traced back to courtly collections \u2013 at least in terms of the original set of holdings. Since the 19th century, in contrast, Basel has embraced a culture of remembrance of having created the oldest existing civic museum collection through its purchase of the Amerbach Cabinet in the year 1661. The acquisition of a collection from the 16th century fits with the historical and documentary interest in art that was prevalent at the time. In fact, however, the purchase was chiefly prompted by a desire to enhance the university's inventory of books with the extensive book holdings of the Amerbach Cabinet. The Haus zur M\u00fccke community hall that housed the university-administered collection was called the \u201cLibrary\u201d in recognition of its primary function. The role as the city's art repository did not shift from the Basel Town Hall (Rathaus) to the Haus zur M\u00fccke until the latter half of the 18th century. The Passion Altarpiece by Holbein that had been one of the main visitor attractions since the Reformation was moved over in 1770, followed by several additional paintings from the town council's inventories in 1771 and Holbein's organ doors from the Cathedral in 1786. Despite this weighting of the collections, the official legal status remained unchanged for quite some time. The natural history holdings and art collection were not split off from the library until 1821 and 1836, respectively.\nAt the end of the 18th century, civic museum culture was still in the early stages of its development, as illustrated by the very limited opening hours of the Haus zur M\u00fccke (Thursday afternoon from two to four in the afternoon, otherwise on request). The first records of regular gallery visits by city residents and outside visitors date to this period. In the three centuries before and after 1800, most of the collection activities involved objects of natural history, with a substantial number of acquisitions and gifts in this area. The numerous top-level art objects that made their way to Basel in the 1790s from Revolutionary France, on the other hand, did not find a wide audience of buyers and in most cases were resold.\n\n\n=== Transfer to the state and popular education ===\nFor the republican and monarchical civic states of the 19th century, collections in the form of public museums became emblems of self-determination. The carting off of large numbers of artworks to Paris during the Napoleonic Wars had created an awareness of the identity-shaping power of art. Institutional role models were the \u201cMus\u00e9e fran\u00e7ais\u201d in the Louvre and the \u201cMus\u00e9e des monuments fran\u00e7ais\u201d in a former Augustinian convent, which closed in 1816. The maintenance of programmatic museum collections and the construction of museum buildings became one of the most prominent and defining national functions.In the case of Basel, however, it was the increasing need for space in the Haus zur M\u00fccke that prompted deliberations regarding construction of a new building. The discussion concerning the right location for the public collection took on a political dimension following the division of the canton into city and regional sections. The University Act (Universit\u00e4tsgesetz) of 1818 had made the corporatively autonomous university a cantonal educational establishment, with the university holdings thus owned indirectly by the state. According to the arbitral decision governing the cantonal split, two-thirds of the university's collection belonged to the regional canton and had to be purchased by the city canton. The ensuing consternation in the city led to the Administration and Use of University Holdings Act (Gesetz \u00fcber Verwaltung und Verwendung des Universit\u00e4tsgutes) of 1836 that such goods were indissolubly tied to the locality of the city of Basel for the purposes of education. This provision has remained in effect to the present day.\n\nThese occurrences led to the founding of the Voluntary Academic Society of Basel (Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft) in 1835, which began supporting the collections in financial terms and through purchases and gifts as part of its general promotion of the university. Yet the greatest momentum for the museum building came from natural science circles centered on the physics and chemistry professor Peter Merian, who was likely responsible for securing a dedicated annual budget for the Natural History Museum \u2013 the only state collection with this distinction. A combination of academic institution, library and laboratories, the establishment of the Natural History Museum at the Falkensteiner Hof also provided a model for the museum building. The fact that a primary museum building was ultimately created instead of a university-affiliated building was due to the university's poor standing among wide sections of the merchant and industrialist classes. In these sectors, the university was considered a backward-looking institution. The museum, by contrast, was seen as a driving force for practical popular education and the community was willing to support its construction with private contributions as part of a wider process of renewal in the city.\n\nAt the instigation of Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein, the Voluntary Museum Association of Basel (Freiwilliger Museumsverein) was initiated in 1850 as the successor to an earlier association founded in 1841 for the construction of the museum. Modelled after the Royal Institution in London, it was established to \u201cstimulate the appreciation of science and art\u201d. Open to all residents of Basel, the association promoted the collections with financial means and sought to generate interest in the museum through public lectures to which women were also admitted. It was unable to sustain the initial enthusiasm, however, and experienced losses in membership despite Basel's rapid population growth in the latter half of the century. The museum did not embrace the function of popular education that had been promoted by its founders and supporters. The ideational socialization role of the museum was very slow to proceed, with the museum long holding onto former organizational structures. The art collection furthermore did not get an academically trained conservator until 1887. In addition, the renewed University Act of 1866 discontinued regular state appropriations for the antiquarian, medieval and art collections and left them dependent on proceeds from entry fees and the support of associations and private individuals, the most significant of these being the Birrmann Foundation and the Emilie Linder Foundation on behalf of the art collection. It was this support that enabled an active collection policy that went beyond the receipt of inherited cultural assets.\n\n\n=== Civic culture of remembrance and modernism ===\n\nFrom the outset, the museum authorities charged the collections with a federal mission, wanting them to exert a \u201cbeneficial and salutary influence on the entire Fatherland\u201d. The \u201cunofficial national gallery\u201d grew over time, primarily through acquisitions of Swiss works of art. When negotiations got underway in 1883 regarding the establishment of a federal museum, the canton of Basel-City sought to be chosen as the location for the new institution and proposed its collections of cultural history as the nucleus of the museum, systematically expanding them in light of its candidacy. While the Swiss National Museum (Schweizerisches Landesmuseum) ended up in Zurich, plans were nevertheless realized for a history museum that was no longer generally Swiss but specifically related to Basel, located in the historic former Barf\u00fcsser Church from the High Gothic period. The establishment of the Historical Museum \u201cwas a self-assured display of Basel\u2019s art-mindedness and craftsmanship, a mix of educational corridor and enfilade of stalls\u201d. The transfer of the Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) to the state a few years earlier as an arena of contemporary achievements can likewise be seen under the aspect of civic pride and reinvented sense of commonality in which the citizenry understood its ideals and capabilities as a foundation of state and society.\n\nWhile the collections had clearly established their international standing, this appreciation did not become rooted in the cultural awareness of a broader range of social classes until the end of the 19th century. The historic culture of remembrance that was growing in importance and impact at the time was strongly linked with the medieval collection and the many Late Medieval and Renaissance works of the Upper Rhine in the Kunstmuseum. In the years since, Basel has also cultivated its claim of possessing the oldest municipal art collection in continuous existence through its acquisition of the Amerbach Cabinet. On the occasion of two major public celebrations in 1892 (500th anniversary of Greater Basel's acquisition of Lesser Basel) and 1901 (Basel's 400th anniversary as part of the Swiss Confederation), Basel presented the civically minded portion of the population (and hence the base of support for the museums) with a series of identity-shaping historical and patriotic gestures that borrowed from the store of images from the past available in the museums.\n[[File:Franz Marc-The Fate of the Animals-1913.jpg|thumb|Franz Marc: Animal Destinies, 1913. The painting was offered by the German Reich in 1939 as \u201cdegenerate art\u201d and purchased by the city of Basel.]]\nWith the epochal break of the First World War and in light of societal and cultural developments, the Basel museums became concerned with the citizenry's assertions of legitimacy and quest for recognition and their representation within these very same institutions. The discussions regarding the relationship of the museums to modernism took on particular relevance in the area of the fine arts. The construction of a dedicated museum for Basel's art collection ignited a \u201cmonumentality debate\u201d in the late 1920s, in which the proponents of functionally oriented New Building (Neues Bauen) rejected the timelessly classic palatial form that was ultimately chosen as a demonstration of power by a conservative and \u201cintellectually spent\u201d notion of culture. In contrast to the form of architectural expression and the general anti-modernistic spirit of the 1930s, the acquisitions from the 1920s up to the outbreak of the Second World War took a decisively modern tack. In 1934, the public art collection added its first painting by Vincent van Gogh along with an ensemble of 134 drawings by Paul C\u00e9zanne. Founded in 1933, the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation supported the Kunstmuseum in these efforts and took up residence in the facility with its works of contemporary art in 1940. The breakthrough in altering the overall profile came with the special funding credit provided by the Basel-City parliament in 1939 at the instigation of museum director Georg Schmidt for the purchase of German museum holdings that the National Socialists had vilified as \u201cdegenerate art\u201d.\n\nThe establishment of classical modernism at the Kunstmuseum continued with ongoing acquisitions of postwar-era art, in particular with works by American artists. In Basel's claim to being a \u201cMuseum City\u201d, the highly controversial and unsuccessful referendum against the purchase of two Picasso paintings in 1967 holds considerable importance and constitutes a key moment in Basel's culture of remembrance in regard to the fusing of society and museum.\n\n\n=== Democratization, popularization ===\nDespite the affirmation by voters, traditional museums found themselves in a prolonged crisis beginning in the late 1960s. Not limited to Basel, this crisis originated in the profound sociopolitical reevaluation of culture of the era. The acquisitions of the State Art Credit and the 1967 Christmas exhibition at Kunsthalle Basel set off fierce protests among the loosely organized association of rejected artists, which became known as the Farnsburg Group (Farnsburgergruppe). Even the cantonal parliament got involved in addressing the concerns. The events raised the question of whether Basel was \u201cjust a museum city\u201d \u2013 here meant in a derogatory sense \u2013 and prompted a broadly cast debate over the fostering of young artists and the functioning of the museums. The establishment of the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) several years later was a direct consequence of the shortcomings that had been identified.\n\nThe democratization that took hold in the 1960s meant doing away with the elite in favor of the egalitarian, dispelling fears of the new and unknown. With a focus on the constructivist  works of the 1960s associated with the \u201cNew Tendencies\u201d (Nouvelles Tendances) movement, the short-lived Progressive Museum (1968\u20131974) set out to \u201cestablish a modern collection that would be accessible to the public from the very beginning\u201d and wanted to avoid any sort of \u201csecularized ceremony\u201d. The expansion of education and communication, likewise a mandate stemming from this era, could only be achieved through an increase in funding. Since the mid-1970s, however, increasingly tight budgets and persistent financial difficulties in the public sector have exerted a palpable impact on museums. The museum studies program at the University of Basel could only be offered from 1992 to 1994 due to funding shortages. In the mid-1990s, a government resolution cut the budget of the state museums by ten percent, leading to the 1996 closure of two museums, the Museum of Design (Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung) and the City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und M\u00fcnstermuseum). The ensuing debate and the pressure from a public referendum in support of the city's museums led to the adoption of the Basel-City Museums Act (Museumsgesetz) of 1999, which placed the holdings of the remaining five state museums (Museum of Ancient Art, Historical Museum, Kunstmuseum, Museum of Cultures, Natural History Museum) in the hands of the parliament. As a central component of cultural expenditures, the museums have also been included in the intensified negotiations over the past several years between the two Basel cantons regarding payment for the city-provided services within the framework of a fiscal equalization scheme.\n\nSince the 1980s, the museums have experienced simultaneous trends toward popularization and aestheticization. The ensuing decades have been marked by a wave of new museum buildings whose avant-garde architecture has achieved international prominence. Contributing considerably to popularization was the exhibition concept of the Mus\u00e9e Sentimental, which focuses on the world of un-prosaic everyday culture and experience and led to a 1989 exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Design (Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung). The annual Basel Museum Night tallies around a hundred thousand museum visits while the museums attract a total of approximately 1.4 million visitors throughout the year (as of 2006). The general population credits the museums with \u201ca leading role in providing leisure-time opportunities for education and learning\u201d. Museums operate in an environment that is increasingly subject to the conditions of both the leisure market and the free market, and are recognized as an important economic and locational factor. In contrast to the state, the use of private funds in the museum field has grown considerably. Funding from patrons or sponsors plays an increasingly significant role in the financing of exhibitions, parts of collections or entire museums and is thus highly sought after. This competitive situation is further reflected in the considerable institutional autonomy of the Basel-City museums, which are the only governmental enterprises in the canton operating under the private-sector influenced method of New Public Management.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nBirkner, Othmar; Rebsamen, Hanspeter (1986).

        "wiki": "Z\u00fcrich (Alemannic German: Z\u00fcri; French: Zurich; Italian: Zurigo; Romansh: Turitg) is the largest city in Switzerland and the capital of the canton of Z\u00fcrich. It is located in north-central Switzerland at the northwestern tip of Lake Z\u00fcrich. As of January 2020 the municipality has 434,335 inhabitants, the urban area (agglomeration) 1.315 million (2009) and the Z\u00fcrich metropolitan area 1.83 million (2011). Z\u00fcrich is a hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Both Zurich Airport and railway station are the largest and busiest in the country.\nPermanently settled for over 2,000 years, Z\u00fcrich was founded by the Romans, who, in 15 BC, called it Turicum. However, early settlements have been found dating back more than 6,400 years (although this only indicates human presence in the area and not the presence of a town that early). During the Middle Ages, Z\u00fcrich gained the independent and privileged status of imperial immediacy and, in 1519, became a primary centre of the Protestant Reformation in Europe under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli.The official language of Z\u00fcrich is German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Z\u00fcrich German.\nMany museums and art galleries can be found in the city, including the Swiss National Museum, the Kunsthaus and newer Theater 11 in Oerlikon. Schauspielhaus Z\u00fcrich is one of the most important theatres in the German-speaking world.Z\u00fcrich is among the world's largest financial centres despite having a relatively small population. The city is home to many financial institutions and banking companies. Many of Switzerland's research and development centres are concentrated in the Greater Z\u00fcrich area and the low tax rates and canton funding subsidies attract overseas companies to set up their headquarters or finance treasury services in the city.Monocle's 2012 \"Quality of Life Survey\" ranked Z\u00fcrich first on a list of the top 25 cities in the world \"to make a base within\". In 2019 Z\u00fcrich was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Geneva and Basel.\n\n\n== Name ==\nIn German, the city name is written Z\u00fcrich, and pronounced [\u02c8tsy\u02d0r\u026a\u00e7] in Swiss Standard German. In Z\u00fcrich German, the local dialect of Swiss German, the name is pronounced without the final consonant, as Z\u00fcri [\u02c8tsyri], although the adjective remains Z\u00fcrcher(in) [\u02c8tsyrx\u0259r(\u026an)]. The city is called Zurich [zy\u0281ik] in French, Zurigo [dzu\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0261o] in Italian, and Turitg [tu\u02c8rit\u0255] (listen) in Romansh.\nIn English, the name used to be written as Zurich, without the umlaut. Even so, standard English practice for German names is to either preserve the umlaut or replace it with the base letter followed by e (i.e. Zuerich). It is pronounced  ZEWR-ik, and more recently sometimes also with /ts/, as in German.The earliest known form of the city's name is Turicum, attested on a tombstone of the late 2nd century AD in the form STA(tio) TURICEN(sis) (\"Turicum tax post\").  The name is interpreted as a derivation from a given name, possibly Gaulish personal name T\u016bros, for a reconstructed native form of the toponym of *Tur\u012bcon. The Latin stress on the long vowel of the Gaulish name, [t\u028a\u02c8ri\u02d0k\u00f5\u02d0], was lost in German [\u02c8tsy\u02d0r\u026a\u00e7] but is preserved in Italian [dzu\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0261o] and in Romansh [tu\u02c8rit\u0255]. The first development towards its later, Germanic form is attested as early as the 6th century with the form Ziurichi. From the 9th century onward, the name is established in an Old High German form Zuri(c)h (857 in villa Zurih, 924 in Zurich curtem, 1416 Z\u00fcrich Stadt). In the early modern period, the name became associated with the name of the Tigurini, and the name Tigurum rather than the historical Turicum is sometimes encountered in Modern Latin contexts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nSettlements of the Neolithic and Bronze Age were found around Lake Z\u00fcrich. Traces of pre-Roman Celtic, La T\u00e8ne settlements were discovered near the Lindenhof, a morainic hill dominating the SE - NW waterway constituted by Lake Zurich and the river Limmat. In Roman times, during the conquest of the alpine region in 15 BC, the Romans built a castellum on the Lindenhof.  Later here was erected Turicum (a toponym of clear Celtic origin), a tax-collecting point for goods trafficked on the Limmat, which constituted part of the border between Gallia Belgica (from AD 90 Germania Superior) and Raetia: this customs point developed later into a vicus. After Emperor Constantine's reforms in AD 318, the border between Gaul and Italy (two of the four praetorian prefectures of the Roman Empire) was located east of Turicum, crossing the river Linth between Lake Walen and Lake Z\u00fcrich, where a castle and garrison looked over Turicum's safety. The earliest written record of the town dates from the 2nd century, with a tombstone referring to it as to the Statio Turicensis Quadragesima Galliarum (\"Z\u00fcrich post for collecting the 2.5% value tax of the Galliae\"), discovered at the Lindenhof.In the 5th century, the Germanic Alemanni tribe settled in the Swiss Plateau. The Roman castle remained standing until the 7th century. A Carolingian castle, built on the site of the Roman castle by the grandson of Charlemagne, Louis the German, is mentioned in 835 (in castro Turicino iuxta fluvium Lindemaci). Louis also founded the Fraum\u00fcnster abbey in 853 for his daughter Hildegard. He endowed the Benedictine convent with the lands of Z\u00fcrich, Uri, and the Albis forest, and granted the convent immunity, placing it under his direct authority. In 1045, King Henry III granted the convent the right to hold markets, collect tolls, and mint coins, and thus effectively made the abbess the ruler of the city.Z\u00fcrich gained Imperial immediacy (Reichsunmittelbar, becoming an Imperial free city) in 1218 with the extinction of the main line of the Z\u00e4hringer family and attained a status comparable to statehood. During the 1230s, a city wall was built, enclosing 38 hectares, when the earliest stone houses on the Rennweg were built as well. The Carolingian castle was used as a quarry, as it had started to fall into ruin.Emperor Frederick II promoted the abbess of the Fraum\u00fcnster to the rank of a duchess in 1234. The abbess nominated the mayor, and she frequently delegated the minting of coins to citizens of the city. The political power of the convent slowly waned in the 14th century, beginning with the establishment of the Zunftordnung (guild laws) in 1336 by Rudolf Brun, who also became the first independent mayor, i.e. not nominated by the abbess.\nAn important event in the early 14th century was the completion of the Manesse Codex, a key source of medieval German poetry. The famous illuminated manuscript \u2013 described as \"the most beautifully illumined German manuscript in centuries;\" \u2013 was commissioned by the Manesse family of Z\u00fcrich, copied and illustrated in the city at some time between 1304 and 1340. Producing such a work was a highly expensive prestige project, requiring several years work by highly skilled scribes and miniature painters, and it clearly testifies to the increasing wealth and pride of Z\u00fcrich citizens in this period.\n\n\n==== Archaeological findings ====\nA female who died in about 200 B.C found buried in a carved tree trunk during a construction project at the Kern school complex in March 2017 in Aussersihl. Archaeologists revealed that she was approximately 40 years old when she died and likely carried out little physical labor when she was alive. A sheepskin coat, a belt chain, a fancy wool dress, a scarf and a pendant made of glass and amber beads were also discovered with the woman.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nOn 1 May 1351, the citizens of Z\u00fcrich had to swear allegiance before representatives of the cantons of Lucerne, Schwyz, Uri and Unterwalden, the other members of the Swiss Confederacy. Thus, Z\u00fcrich became the fifth member of the Confederacy, which was at that time a loose confederation of de facto independent states. Z\u00fcrich was the presiding canton of the Diet from 1468 to 1519. This authority was the executive council and lawmaking body of the confederacy, from the Middle Ages until the establishment of the Swiss federal state in 1848. Z\u00fcrich was temporarily expelled from the confederacy in 1440 due to a war with the other member states over the territory of Toggenburg (the Old Z\u00fcrich War). Neither side had attained significant victory when peace was agreed upon in 1446, and Z\u00fcrich was readmitted to the confederation in 1450.\n\nZwingli started the Swiss Reformation at the time when he was the main preacher in the 1520s, at the Grossm\u00fcnster. He lived there from 1484 until his death in 1531. The Z\u00fcrich Bible, based on that of Zwingli, was issued in 1531. The Reformation resulted in major changes in state matters and civil life in Z\u00fcrich, spreading also to a number of other cantons. Several cantons remained Catholic and became the basis of serious conflicts that eventually led to the outbreak of the Wars of Kappel.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the Council of Z\u00fcrich adopted an isolationist attitude, resulting in a second ring of imposing fortifications built in 1624. The Thirty Years' War which raged across Europe motivated the city to build these walls. The fortifications required a lot of resources, which were taken from subject territories without reaching any agreement. The following revolts were crushed brutally. In 1648, Z\u00fcrich proclaimed itself a republic, shedding its former status of a free imperial city. In this time the political system of Z\u00fcrich was an oligarchy (Patriziat): the dominant families of the city were the following ones: Bonstetten, Brun, B\u00fcrkli, Escher vom Glas, Escher vom Luchs, Hirzel, Jori (or von Jori), Kilchsperger, Landenberg, Manesse, Meiss, Meyer von Knonau, M\u00fclner, von Orelli.\n\nThe Helvetic Revolution of 1798 saw the fall of the Ancien R\u00e9gime. Z\u00fcrich lost control of the land and its economic privileges, and the city and the canton separated their possessions between 1803\u201305. In 1839, the city had to yield to the demands of its urban subjects, following the Z\u00fcriputsch of 6 September. Most of the ramparts built in the 17th century were torn down, without ever having been besieged, to allay rural concerns over the city's hegemony. The Treaty of Z\u00fcrich between Austria, France, and Sardinia was signed in 1859.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nZ\u00fcrich was the Federal capital for 1839\u201340, and consequently, the victory of the Conservative party there in 1839 caused a great stir throughout Switzerland. But when in 1845 the Radicals regained power at Z\u00fcrich, which was again the Federal capital for 1845\u201346, Z\u00fcrich took the lead in opposing the Sonderbund cantons. Following the Sonderbund war and the formation of the Swiss Federal State, Z\u00fcrich voted in favour of the Federal constitutions of 1848 and of 1874. The enormous immigration from the country districts into the town from the 1830s onwards created an industrial class which, though \"settled\" in the town, did not possess the privileges of burghership, and consequently had no share in the municipal government. First of all in 1860 the town schools, hitherto open to \"settlers\" only on paying high fees, were made accessible to all, next in 1875 ten years' residence ipso facto conferred the right of burghership, and in 1893 the eleven outlying districts were incorporated within the town proper.\n\nExtensive developments took place during the 19th century. From 1847, the Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn, the first railway on Swiss territory, connected Z\u00fcrich with Baden, putting the Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof at the origin of the Swiss rail network. The present building of the Hauptbahnhof (the main railway station) dates to 1871. Z\u00fcrich's Bahnhofstrasse (Station Street) was laid out in 1867, and the Z\u00fcrich Stock Exchange was founded in 1877. Industrialisation led to migration into the cities and to rapid population growth, particularly in the suburbs of Z\u00fcrich.\nThe Quaianlagen are an important milestone in the development of the modern city of Z\u00fcrich, as the construction of the new lake front transformed Z\u00fcrich from a small medieval town on the rivers Limmat and Sihl to an attractive modern city on the Z\u00fcrichsee shore, under the guidance of the city engineer Arnold B\u00fcrkli.In 1893, the twelve outlying districts were incorporated into Z\u00fcrich, including Aussersihl, the workman's quarter on the left bank of the Sihl, and additional land was reclaimed from Lake Z\u00fcrich.In 1934, eight additional districts in the north and west of Z\u00fcrich were incorporated.\nZ\u00fcrich was accidentally bombed during World War II.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\n\nThe blue and white coat of arms of Z\u00fcrich is attested from 1389 and was derived from banners with blue and white stripes in use since 1315. The first certain testimony of banners with the same design is from 1434. The coat of arms is flanked by two lions. The red Schwenkel on top of the banner had varying interpretations: For the people of Z\u00fcrich, it was a mark of honour, granted by Rudolph I. Z\u00fcrich's neighbours mocked it as a sign of shame, commemorating the loss of the banner at Winterthur in 1292. Today, the Canton of Z\u00fcrich uses the same coat of arms as the city.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City districts ===\n\nThe previous boundaries of the city of Z\u00fcrich (before 1893) were more or less synonymous with the location of the old town. Two large expansions of the city limits occurred in 1893 and in 1934 when the city of Z\u00fcrich merged with many surrounding municipalities, that had been growing increasingly together since the 19th century. Today, the city is divided into twelve districts (known as Kreis in German), numbered 1 to 12, each one of which contains between one and four neighborhoods:\n\nKreis 1, known as Altstadt, contains the old town, both to the east and west of the start of the Limmat. District 1 contains the neighbourhoods of Hochschulen, Rathaus, Lindenhof, and City.\nKreis 2 lies along the west side of Lake Z\u00fcrich, and contains the neighbourhoods of Enge, Wollishofen and Leimbach.\nKreis 3, known as Wiedikon is between the Sihl and the Uetliberg, and contains the neighbourhoods of Alt-Wiedikon, Sihlfeld and Friesenberg.\nKreis 4, known as Aussersihl lies between the Sihl and the train tracks leaving Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof, and contains the neighbourhoods of Werd, Langstrasse, and Hard.\nKreis 5, known as Industriequartier, is between the Limmat and the train tracks leaving Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof, it contains the former industrial area of Z\u00fcrich which has gone under a large-scale rezoning to create upscale modern housing, retail and commercial real estate. It contains the neighborhoods of Gewerbeschule, and Escher-Wyss.\nKreis 6 is on the edge of the Z\u00fcrichberg, a hill overlooking the eastern part of the city. District 6 contains the neighbourhoods of Oberstrass and Unterstrass.\nKreis 7 is on the edge of the Adlisberg hill as well as the Z\u00fcrichberg, on the eastern side of the city. District 7 contains the neighbourhoods of Fluntern, Hottingen, and Hirslanden. These neighbourhoods are home to Z\u00fcrich's wealthiest and more prominent residents. The neighbourhood Witikon also belongs to district 7.\nKreis 8, officially called Riesbach, but colloquially known as Seefeld, lies on the eastern side of Lake Z\u00fcrich. District 8 consists of the neighbourhoods of Seefeld, M\u00fchlebach, and Weinegg.\nKreis 9 is between the Limmat to the north and the Uetliberg to the south. It contains the neighbourhoods Altstetten and Albisrieden.\nKreis 10 is to the east of the Limmat and to the south of the H\u00f6nggerberg and K\u00e4ferberg hills. District 10 contains the neighbourhoods of H\u00f6ngg and Wipkingen.\nKreis 11 is in the area north of the H\u00f6nggerberg and K\u00e4ferberg and between the Glatt Valley and the Katzensee (Cats Lake). It contains the neighbourhoods of Affoltern, Oerlikon and Seebach.\nKreis 12, known as Schwamendingen, is located in the Glattal (Glatt valley) on the northern side of the Z\u00fcrichberg. District 12 contains the neighbourhoods of Saatlen, Schwamendigen Mitte, and Hirzenbach.Most of the district boundaries are fairly similar to the original boundaries of the previously existing municipalities before they were incorporated into the city of Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe City Council (Stadtrat) constitutes the executive government of the City of Z\u00fcrich and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of nine councilors, each presiding over a department. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the City Council. The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. The mayor (German: Stadtpr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election by a system of Majorz while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. Any resident of Zurich allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. In the mandate period 2018\u20132022 (Legislatur) the City Council is presided by mayor Corine Mauch. The executive body holds its meetings in the City Hall (German: Stadthaus), on the left bank of the Limmat. The building was built in 1883 in Renaissance style.\nAs of May 2018, the Z\u00fcrich City Council is made up of three representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party, one of whom is the mayor), two members each of the Green Party and the FDP (Free Democratic Party), and one member each of GLP (Green Liberal Party) and AL (Alternative Left Party), giving the left parties a combined seven out of nine seats. The last regular election was held on 4 March 2018.\n\nClaudia Cuche-Curti is Town Chronicler (Stadtschreiberin) since 2012, and Peter Saile is Legal Counsel (Rechtskonsulent) since 2000 for the City Council.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe Municipal Council (Gemeinderat) holds the legislative power. It is made up of 125 members (Gemeindrat / Gemeinder\u00e4tin), with elections held every four years. The Municipal Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the City Council and the administration. The sessions of the Municipal Council are held in public. Unlike those of the City Council, the members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession but are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Z\u00fcrich allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The legislative body holds its meetings in the town hall (Rathaus), on the right bank of the Limmat opposite to the City Hall (Stadthaus).The last election of the Municipal Council was held on 4 March 2018 for the mandate period of 2018\u20132022. As of May 2018, the Municipal Council consist of 43 members of the Social Democratic Party (SP), 21 The Liberals (FDP), 17 members of the Swiss People's Party (SVP), 16 Green Party (GPS), 14 Green Liberal Party (GLP), 10 Alternative List (AL), and four members of the Evangelical People's Party (EVP), giving the left parties an absolute majority of 69.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the SPS which received 25.6% (-6) of the vote. The next four most popular parties were the GPS (20.9%, +9.7), GLP (15.7%, +6.4), SVP (13.7%, -4.3), the FDP (11.8%, -2.2), the AL (4%, new), and the CVP (3.5%, -0.2). In the federal election, a total of 110,760 voters were cast, and the voter turnout was 47.7%.In the 2015 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the SPS which received 31.6% of the vote. The next four most popular parties were the SVP (18%), the FDP (14%), the GPS (10.7%), the GLP (9.2%). In the federal election, a total of 114,377 voters were cast, and the voter turnout was 46.2%.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\n\n==== Twin towns and sister cities ====\nZ\u00fcrich is partnered with two sister cities: Kunming and San Francisco.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nZ\u00fcrich is situated at 408 m (1,339 ft) above sea level on the lower (northern) end of Lake Z\u00fcrich (Z\u00fcrichsee) about 30 kilometers (19 mi) north of the Alps, nestling between the wooded hills on the west and east side. The Old Town stretches on both sides of the Limmat, which flows from the lake, running northwards at first and then gradually turning into a curve to the west. The geographic (and historic) centre of the city is the Lindenhof, a small natural hill on the west bank of the Limmat, about 700 m (2,300 ft) north of where the river issues from Lake Z\u00fcrich. Today the incorporated city stretches somewhat beyond the natural confines of the hills and includes some districts to the northeast in the Glatt Valley (Glattal) and to the north in the Limmat Valley (Limmattal). The boundaries of the older city are easy to recognize by the Schanzengraben canal. This artificial watercourse has been used for the construction of the third fortress in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe municipality of Z\u00fcrich has an area of 91.88 km2 (35.48 sq mi), of which 4.1 km2 (1.6 sq mi) is made up of Lake Z\u00fcrich. The area includes a section of the northern Swiss Plateau. The banks of the Limmat constitute the densest part of the city. The river is oriented in the southeast\u2013northwest direction, with the flat valley floor having a width of two to two to three kilometres (1.2 to 1.9 miles). The partially channeled and straightened Limmat does not flow in the central part of the valley, but always along its right (northeastern) side. The Sihl meets with the Limmat at the end of Platzspitz, which borders the Swiss National Museum. The Limmat reaches the lowest point of the municipality in Oberengstringen at 392 m (1,286 ft) above sea level.\n\nOn its west side, the Limmat valley is flanked by the wooded heights of the Albis chain, which runs along the western border. The Uetliberg is, with 869 m (2,851 ft) above sea level, the highest elevation of the surrounding area. Its summit can be reached easily by the Uetlibergbahn. From the platform of the observation tower on the summit, an impressive panorama of the city, the lake, and the Alps can be seen.\nThe northeast side of the Limmat valley includes a range of hills, which marks the watershed between the Limmat and the Glatt. From the northwest to the southeast, the height of the mostly wooded knolls generally increases: the Gubrist (615 m or 2,018 ft), the H\u00f6nggerberg (541 m or 1,775 ft), the K\u00e4ferberg (571 m or 1,873 ft), the Z\u00fcrichberg (676 m or 2,218 ft), the Adlisberg (701 m or 2,300 ft) and the \u00d6schbrig (696 m or 2,283 ft). Between the K\u00e4ferberg and the Z\u00fcrichberg is located the saddle of the Milchbuck (about 470 m or 1,540 ft), an important passage from the Limmat valley to the Glatt valley.\nThe northernmost part of the municipality extends to the plain of the Glatt valley and to the saddle which makes the connection between the Glattal and Furttal. Also, a part of the Katzensee (nature reserve) and the B\u00fcsisee, both of which are drained by the Katzenbach to Glatt, belong to the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZ\u00fcrich has, depending on the definition used, an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but in the higher areas it is defined as a humid continental climate (Dfb, using 0 \u00b0C isoterm) with warm summers and four distinct seasons. Decisive for the climate of Z\u00fcrich are both the winds from westerly directions, which often result in precipitation and, on the other hand, the Bise (east or north-east wind), which is usually associated with high-pressure situations, but cooler weather phases with temperatures lower than the average. The Foehn wind, which plays an important role in the northern alpine valleys also has some impact on Z\u00fcrich.The annual mean temperature at the measuring station of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology in Z\u00fcrich-Fluntern (556 m[1,824 ft] above sea level on the slope of the Z\u00fcrichberg, 150 m[490 ft] above the level of the city centre) is 9.3 \u00b0C (48.7 \u00b0F). The lowest monthly mean of daily minimum temperature are measured in January with \u22122.0 \u00b0C (28.4 \u00b0F) and the highest monthly mean of daily maximum temperature are measured in July with 24.0 \u00b0C (75.2 \u00b0F). On average there are 74.9 days in which the minimum temperature is below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) (so-called frost days), and 23.7 days in which the maximum temperature is below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) (so-called ice days). There are on average of 30 so-called summer days (maximum temperature equal to or above 25 \u00b0C [77 \u00b0F]) throughout the year, while so-called heat days (with maximum temperature equal to or above 30 \u00b0C [86 \u00b0F]) are 5.8 days.The average high temperature in July is 24.0 \u00b0C (75.2 \u00b0F) and average low temperature is 14 \u00b0C (57.2 \u00b0F). The highest recorded temperature in Z\u00fcrich was 37.7 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F), recorded on July 1947, and typically the warmest day reaches an average of 32.2 \u00b0C (90.0 \u00b0F).Spring and autumn are generally cool to mild, but sometimes with large differences between warm and cold days even during the same year. The highest temperature of the month March in 2014 was on the 20th at 20.6 \u00b0C (69.1 \u00b0F) during a sunny afternoon and the lowest temperature was on the 25th at \u22120.4 \u00b0C (31.3 \u00b0F) during the night/early morning. Record low of average daily temperatures in March since 1864 is \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F) and record high of average daily temperatures in March is 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). Record low of average daily temperatures in October is \u221216 \u00b0C (3 \u00b0F) and record high of average daily temperatures in October is 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).Z\u00fcrich has an average of 1,544 hours of sunshine per year and shines on 38% of its potential time throughout the year. During the months April until September the sun shines between 150 and 215 hours per month. The 1,134 millimetres (44.6 in) rainfall spread on 133.9 days with precipitation throughout the year. Roughly about every third day you will encounter at least some precipitation, which is very much a Swiss average. During the warmer half of the year and especially during the three summer months, the strength of rainfall is higher than those measured in winter, but the days with precipitation stays about the same throughout the year (in average 9.9\u201312.7 days per month). October has the lowest number (9.9) of days with some precipitation. There is an average of 59.5 so-called bright days (number of days with sunshine duration greater than 80%) through the year, the most in July and August (7.4, 7.7 days), and the least in January and December (2.7, 1.8 days). The average number of days with sunshine duration less than 20%, so-called cloudy days, is 158.4 days, while the most cloudy days are in November (17.8 days), December (21.7 days), and January with 19 days.\n\n\n=== Climate protection ===\nThe city is among the world-leaders in protecting the climate by following a manifold approach. In November 2008 the people of Z\u00fcrich voted in a public referendum to write into law the quantifiable and fixed deadline of one tonne of CO2 per person per annum by 2050. This forces any decision of the executive to support this goal, even if the costs are higher in all dimensions. Some examples are the new disinfection section of the public city hospital in Triemli (Minergie-P quality \u2013 passive house), the continued optimisation and creation of public transportation, enlargement of the bicycle-only network, research and projects for renewable energy and enclosure of speed-ways.\n\n\n=== Urban area ===\nThe areas surrounding the Limmat are almost completely developed with residential, industrial, and commercial zones. The sunny and desirable residential areas in the hills overlooking Z\u00fcrich, Waidberg and Z\u00fcrichberg, and the bottom part of the slope on the western side of the valley on the Uetliberg, are also densely built.\nThe \"green lungs\" of the city include the vast forest areas of Adlisberg, Z\u00fcrichberg, K\u00e4ferberg, H\u00f6nggerberg and Uetliberg. Major parks are also located along the lakeshore (Z\u00fcrichhorn and Enge), while smaller parks dot the city. Larger contiguous agricultural lands are located near Affoltern and Seebach. Of the total area of the municipality of Z\u00fcrich (in 1996, without the lake), 45.4% is residential, industrial and commercial, 15.5% is transportation infrastructure, 26.5% is forest, 11%: is agriculture and 1.2% is water.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nPublic transport is extremely popular in Z\u00fcrich, and its inhabitants use public transport in large numbers. About 70% of the visitors to the city use the tram or bus, and about half of the journeys within the municipality take place on public transport. Within Z\u00fcrich and throughout the canton of Z\u00fcrich, the ZVV network of public transport has traffic density ratings among the highest worldwide. When adding frequency, which in Z\u00fcrich can be as often as seven minutes, it does become the densest across all dimensions. Three means of mass-transit exist: the S-Bahn (local trains), trams, and buses (both diesel and electric, also called trolley buses). In addition, the public transport network includes boats on the lake and river, funicular railways and even the Luftseilbahn Adliswil-Felsenegg (LAF), a cable car between Adliswil and Felsenegg. Tickets purchased for a trip are valid on all means of public transportation (train, tram, bus, boat). The Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (commonly abbreviated to ZSG) operates passenger vessels on the Limmat and the Lake Z\u00fcrich, connecting surrounding towns between Z\u00fcrich and Rapperswil.\n\nZ\u00fcrich is a mixed hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof (Z\u00fcrich HB) is the largest and busiest station in Switzerland and is an important railway hub in Europe. There are between 350,000 and 500,000 commuters daily making use of this central network node \u2013 a significant figure in comparison to Z\u00fcrich's population. With regard to the number of trains daily entering and leaving a single railway station, Z\u00fcrich HB is the world's most frequently served railway station, with nearly 3,000 trains every day. Among the 16 railway stations (and 10 additional train stops) within Z\u00fcrich's city borders, there are five other major passenger railway stations. Three of them belong to the ten most frequented railway stations in Switzerland: Stadelhofen, Oerlikon, Altstetten, Hardbr\u00fccke, and Enge. The railway network is mainly operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS), but Z\u00fcrich is also served by major EuroCity trains from the neighbouring countries and is a destination for both French/Swiss (TGV Lyria) and German (ICE) high-speed trains, as well as by Austrian RailJet.\n\n\n=== Zurich Airport ===\nZurich Airport is located less than 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) northeast of the city in Kloten. Zurich Airport has its own railway station, which is located underground. It is directly connected to Z\u00fcrich and most of the major Swiss cities. Zurich Airport is served by more than 60 passenger airlines from around the world. It is also served by one cargo airline and is a hub for Swiss International Air Lines. There is also an airfield in D\u00fcbendorf.\n\n\n=== Road traffic ===\nThe A1, A3 and A4 motorways pass close to Z\u00fcrich. The A1 heads west towards Bern and Geneva and eastwards towards St. Gallen; the A4 leads northwards to Schaffhausen and southwards to Altdorf connecting with the A2 towards Chiasso; and the A3 heads northwest towards Basel and southeast along Lake Z\u00fcrich and Lake Walen towards Sargans.\n\n\n=== Bicycle transport ===\nIn 2012, the city council launched a program to improve the city's attractiveness for bicycle traffic. The so-called \"Masterplan Velo\" is part of the superordinate framework Stadtverkehr 2025 which shapes the future of the different means of transport. Research revealed that infrastructure and the social environment are essential factors in improving a city's appeal to bicycle traffic. Three main goals are specified: First, the modal share of bicycle traffic should be enhanced to twice the value of 2011 by 2015. Second, cyclists' safety should be improved to lower the overall accident risk. Third, cycling should be established as an everyday means of transport with a special focus on children and young people.\nIn terms of infrastructure, the city aims to build up a network of distinctive bicycle routes in order to achieve these objectives. At a final stage, the network will consist of main routes (Hauptrouten) for everyday use and comfort routes (Komfortrouten), with the latter focussing on leisure cycling. Additional measures such as special Velostationen providing bike related services are expected to help to further improve the quality. One of the key projects of the system is a tunnel beneath the tracks of the main railway station planned to combine a main connection with staffed possibilities where commuters can leave their bikes throughout the day. Apart from infrastructural measures, further approaches are planned in the fields of communication, education and administration.\nHowever, these efforts cause critique, mainly due to postponing. The institution of the bike tunnel at the main railway station, originally planned for 2016, is currently (2016) delayed to at least 2019. Pro Velo, a nationwide interest group, has publicly questioned whether the masterplan already failed. The critique aims at badly governed traffic management at construction sites, missing possibilities to park bikes in the city as well as rather diffident ambitions. In response, the responsible city department points to the big investments made every year and mentions ongoing discussions that would finally lead to even better results.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nThere are 415,367 people living in Z\u00fcrich (as of 31 December 2018), making it Switzerland's largest city. Of registered inhabitants (in 2016), 32% (133,473) do not hold Swiss citizenship. Of these, German citizens make up the largest group with 8% (33,548), followed by Italians 3.5% (14,543). The population of the city including suburbs totals 1.19 million people. The entire metropolitan area (including the cities of Winterthur, Baden, Brugg, Schaffhausen, Frauenfeld, Uster/Wetzikon, Rapperswil-Jona and Zug) has a population of around 1.83 million people.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe official formal language used by: governmental institutions, print, news, schools/universities, courts, theatres and in any kind of written form is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, while the spoken language is Z\u00fcrich German (Z\u00fcrit\u00fc\u00fctsch), one of the several more or less distinguishable, but mutually intelligible Swiss German dialects of Switzerland with roots in the medieval Alemannic German dialect groups. However, because of Z\u00fcrich's national importance, and therefore its existing high fluctuation, one can hear all kinds of Swiss German dialects spoken by its inhabitants and commuters. As of the December 2010 census, 69.3% of the population speaks diglossic Swiss German/Swiss Standard German as their mother-tongue at home. Some 22.7% of inhabitants speak Standard German in their family environment (\"at home\"). Dramatically increasing, according to the last census in 2000, 8.8% now speak English. Italian follows behind at 7.1% of the population then French at 4.5%. Other languages spoken here include: Croatian and Serbian (4.1%), Spanish (3.9%), Portuguese (3.1%) and Albanian (2.3%). (Multiple choices were possible.) Thus 20% of the population speak two or more languages at home.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nBefore the Protestant Reformation reached Z\u00fcrich, it was de jure and de facto Roman Catholic.\nThe Protestant Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli made Z\u00fcrich both a theological centre and a stronghold of Protestantism in Switzerland. Another Swiss city with a comparable status was Geneva, the so-called Protestant Rome, where John Calvin and his Protestant Reformers operated. Z\u00fcrich attracted other influential Protestant Reformers like Heinrich Bullinger. Zwingli translated the Bible (Z\u00fcrich Bible) into the local variety of German and introduced the Reformation by winning support of the magistrates, the princess abbess Katharina von Zimmern and the largely peasant population of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich. The canton unanimously adopted the Reformed tradition as represented by Zwingli. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants tormented the Swiss Confederacy. Zwingli died for political and religious reasons by defending the Canton of Z\u00fcrich in the Battle of Kappel. Bullinger took over his role as the city's spiritual leader.\nIn 1970, about 53% of the population were Swiss Reformed, while almost 40% were Roman Catholic. Since then both large Swiss churches, the Roman Catholic Church and Swiss Reformed Church, have been constantly losing members, though for the Catholic Church the decrease started 20 years later in around 1990. Nevertheless, for the last twenty years both confessions have been reduced by 10% to the current figures (census 2010): 30% Roman Catholic and 26% Swiss Reformed (organized in Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich). In 1970, only 2% of Z\u00fcrich's inhabitants claimed to be not affiliated with any religious confession. In accordance with the loss by the large Swiss churches, the number of people declaring themselves as non-affiliated rose to 17% in the year 2000. In the last ten years, this figure rose to more than 25%. For the group of people, being between 24 and 44 years old, this is as high as one in every third person.5% of Z\u00fcrich's inhabitants are Muslims, a slight decrease of 1% compared to the year 2000. The Mahmood Mosque Z\u00fcrich, situated in Forchstrasse is the first mosque built in Switzerland.The population of Jewish ethnicity and religion has been more or less constant since 1970 at about 1%. The Synagoge Z\u00fcrich L\u00f6wenstrasse is the oldest and largest synagogue of Z\u00fcrich.Nearly one tenth of the city's population are members of non-state-recognized Christian denominations (for example the Eastern Orthodox Church).More than 2% of Z\u00fcrich's population account for non-monotheistic religions (such as Buddhism or Hinduism).\n\n\n=== Social ===\nThe level of unemployment in Z\u00fcrich was 3.2% in July 2012.

          "We discovered this museum after a local suggested it and it was great. Access is super easy from Zurich. Just take the little cable train and a few minutes later you are at the museum. Free entry was also a pleasant surprise. The are plenty of well kept and displayed animals",

          "Consider the visit is free, it is quite an interesting and fun way to spend 2 hours. Unfortunately, most of the information are not available in English. However they do have a wide range of animal exhibits that look very realistic from furry pets, hunters, sharks and some",

          "I'll agree with the last review that, this is free and therefore well worth your time in a rather expensive city. Measuring the museum relative to other museums, though, it's fairly small in both physical size and collection. I found the palaeontology section most interesting,",
          "I actually only went as part of a tour (unpaid, unofficial - by our language teacher!) of the University. I couldn't believe it was free! It's a little like walking through a tribute to taxidermy, but it was really interesting. There are all sorts of animals in there - there's",

          "There wasn't a whole lot in english but that was fine. It was bigger than I thought it would be. The best part for me was the anxiety exhibit that I didn't know was there. Would be great for kids or even a rainy afternoon. It was easy to find and free!",
          "If you like stuffed animals, this is the museum for you! It's free from the university, so I can't understand how it can be rated badly, except maybe by someone who didn't realize that it has exhibitions of dead, stuffed animals. When your expectations are appropriate and you",

Parts of its collections are housed opposite the museum's main building on Limmatstrasse (the Plakatraum, or Poster Collection), and in a commercial building on F\u00f6rrlibuckstrasse (the Design Collection and Graphics Collection). Until January 2017, the museum also operated the Museum Bellerive, located in a former villa on the shores of Lake Zurich. Since 2018, the city operates the Z\u00fcrcher Architekturzentrum (Zurich Center for Architecture) in the former villa.\n\n\n== History and buildings ==\nSituated in Zurich's former School of Arts and Crafts the Museum of Design's main building contains an exhibition hall, gallery, reception area, cafeteria, shop and the vestibule to the lecture hall. The Museum of Design developed out of the Museum of Arts and Crafts, which was founded in 1875. In 1933, the museum and the School of Arts and Crafts (today known as the Zurich University of the Arts) moved into its present building designed by Adolf Steger and Karl Egender. In its combination of aesthetic and functional qualities, the building exemplifies the Modern Architecture movement in Switzerland. In 1968 the Museum of Design acquired the former home of the textile manufacturer Julian Bloch and moved part of its Applied Art collection into it. Renamed the Museum Bellerive, the building housed the collection of glass, ceramic, wood, metal and textiles until 2017, when the museum was closed. Its collection was moved to a new location at Toni Areal, a building complexed opened in 2014 which is shared with the University of the Arts and the University of Applied Sciences.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe Museum of Design shows between five and seven temporary exhibitions annually in the hall and the gallery of the main building, small interventions within the museum, and temporary exhibitions at Toni Areal and in the Plakatraum. Most of the exhibitions shown in the Museum of Design are produced in-house and are developed in dialogue with the museum collections or through research projects. Exhibitions loaned from other institutions make up a small part of the exhibition program.\nExhibitions are accompanied by a program of tours, symposia, panel discussions, talks with artists, film and theatre performances and concerts. A specifically tailored educational program is devised for each exhibition.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe four collections of the Museum of Design emerged from a teaching collection amassed by the Museum of Arts and Crafts.\n\n\n=== Poster Collection (Plakatraum) ===\nThe Poster Collection comprises 330,000 posters (of which 120,000 have been photographed and indexed) and documents the international history of the poster from its mid-19th-century origins to the present day.\nThe collection includes political, cultural and commercial posters. For reasons explicable in terms of design history the geographical focal points are Switzerland, Europe, Japan, Cuba, the former Soviet Union and the United States.\n\n\n=== Design Collection ===\nThe Design Collection includes 10,000 products and 20,000 examples of packaging produced by famous designers, as well as representative examples of anonymous everyday design. Mass-produced products from the 20th century and the present are collected, with emphasis placed on Swiss design.\nThrough its permanent loans from the field of product design (an area that has been subsidized by the Swiss Federal Office of Culture since 1989) the Swiss Confederation makes available objects that pertain to the current design discourse. Parallel to the collection of objects, an archive for Swiss Design is being built up that benefits and assists scholarly research in the field. The archive contains concepts, project studies, design drawings, user guides, patent specifications, advertising material and source texts, as well as parts of the archives of design studios, companies and associations.\n\n\n=== Graphics Collection ===\nThe Graphics Collection has existed since the museum was founded. It documents the aesthetic and cultural transformation of graphics in everyday life from Gutenberg to the present.\nOriginally intended as an international collection of examples, the Graphics Collection includes almost all graphic disciplines that were of importance for teaching at the former School of Arts and Crafts. The core was initially formed by drawings, prints and illustrated books, as well as textbooks from the 15th to the 20th century. Press work, East Asian works, artists books, photographs and commercial art were added later.\nToday collecting concentrates on advertising and information graphics, fonts, typography and book design. The collection is developed further by acquiring current works by innovative graphic designers, advertising agencies, the legacies of important designers as well as examples of the corporate design of important companies.\n\n\n=== Applied Art Collection ===\n\nThe Applied Art Collection includes over 15,000 pieces. Originally assembled as a study collection by the Museum of Art and Design, the collection contains diverse objects in the areas of glass, ceramics, textiles and furniture spanning the 19th and 20th centuries. In geographical terms, it concentrates on Europe, the USA and modern Japan. Its  Jugendstil department contains works by William Morris, Emile Gall\u00e9, Ren\u00e9 Lalique, Hermann Obrist and Henry van de Velde.  It has a collection of marionettes and puppets that includes works by Sophie Taeuber-Arp and Alexandra Exter. The museum's collection of musical instruments is composed of around 200 historic pieces. Its glass department is particularly strong in objects made from 1880 to after 1970 and includes glass designed and/or made by Jaroslava Brychtov\u00e1 and Stanislav Libensk\u00fd, Pavel Hlava, Eric H\u00f6glund, Livio Seguso and Jan Zoritchak. The Studio Glass generation of artists is represented in objects by, among others, Dale Chihuly, Erwin Eisch, Marvin Lipofsky, Harvey Littleton and Mary Shaffer.\n\n\n=== Pavillon Le Corbusier ===\n\nThe Pavillon Le Corbusier will be renovated until spring 2019. From then on, the Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung will operate the pavilion. A jury of experts unanimously chose the concept in September 2017 since the concept convinced with an \"attractive, tailor-made programme for exhibitions and accompanying events\". In December 2016, the city parliament had approved operating subsidies of CHF 500,000 per annum for the new sponsorship for the years 2019 to 2022. In addition, the city will be exempted from rent of CHF 220,000 per annum.\n\n\n== Research and services ==\nThe contents of the collections are continuously analyzed and researched in collaboration with the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) as well as other university-level institutions with the aim of contextually positioning them from a present-day viewpoint and opening them up for cross-disciplinary projects. In addition to study, documentation and conservation, other services such as research, specialist evaluations and reproductions are also offered.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nThe Museum of Design produces publications, either self-printed or in collaboration with well-known publishing houses, which function as an important part of the exhibition program. These include thematically organized series such as the \"Design Collection\" or the \"Poster Collection\" as well as anthologies of classic design history and current themes, and monographs about pioneers in the fields of theory and practice.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuseum of Design Z\u00fcrich (in English)\nThe Museum's collections online",

        "wiki": "Sukkulenten-Sammlung Z\u00fcrich, literally succulent plant collection of the city of Z\u00fcrich, is a botanical garden in the Swiss municipality of Z\u00fcrich. It also houses a botanic library, a herbarium and the International Organizations for Succulent Plant Research (IOS).\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe greenhouses are located in district of Enge, on Z\u00fcrichsee (Lake Zurich). They are a part of the Quaianlagen promenades, and are located on the southwestern lake shore. The collection is separated by the Mythenquai road from the lower lake shore promenade and the Enge harbour area, at the park facilities of the Mythenquai lido near the lower entrance to the Rieterpark.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt the end of the 1920s, Jakob Gasser, a cactus grower from Z\u00fcrich, tried to sell his collection of about 1,500 succulents to the city government of Z\u00fcrich, but the venture failed. in 1929, Julius Brann Gassersche, a store owner, acquired the unique collection and made a gift of it to the city of Z\u00fcrich. The collection was housed in the greenhouses at the former site of the municipal gardens (Stadtg\u00e4rtnerei) at Mythenquai, and established as St\u00e4dtische Kakteensammlung, meaning urban cactus collection.Formally established in 1931, the collection houses one of the largest and most important collections of succulent plants. The main complex was built in 1947 and inaugurated in 1948. The succulent collection started in the existing greenhouse at Mythenquai, and was extended in 1948, 1954, 1961, 1984. In 2011, the entrance area was rebuilt and information for visitors improved. There are plans to redesign the Mythenquai area, including a renovation of the greenhouses.\n\n\n== Collection and structure ==\nSucculents are plants from arid areas that survive by storing water, including Agaves, Aloes and stonecrop family, in addition to Cacti and thick leaf plants. The collection features more than 6,500 different types of succulent plants from more than 80 different plant families of Orchidaceae, Crassulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Aizoaceae, Cactaceae and Apocynaceae. The collection is funded by Gr\u00fcn Stadt Z\u00fcrich and by the booster association, F\u00f6rderverein der Sukkulenten-Sammlung Z\u00fcrich. Although internationally known for its scientific objectives, the Sukkulenten-Sammlung is perceived by the public as a collection. Periodic special displays provide an insight into the survival mechanisms used by succulents.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nSurrounded by a park on the lake, the facilities house over 25,000 exotic plants in about 6,500 species and varieties on 4,750 square metres (1.17 acres), including 700 square metres (0.17 acres) in six greenhouses, 16 heated cold frame boxes and an outdoor area. The staff consists of nine employees who take care of 50,000 visitors annually. The greenhouses are open daily.\n\n\n== IOS library, database and herbarium ==\nSince about 1947, the institution has been involved in an international seed exchange between botanical institutes and gardens around the world. Currently, there are more than 200 botanical gardens involved. In addition, Sukkulenten-Sammlung houses a specialized library on succulent plants. These books are not allowed to leave the library, but can be seen when the collection is open. The library contains more than 30,187 titles.The herbarium was founded in 1950, simultaneously with the International Organizations for Succulent Plant Research (IOS), and has an extensive archive of plants with approximately 20,000 specimens and a meticulous tracking database. It is now under the patronage of the Swiss UNESCO commission.\n\n\n== F\u00f6rderverein association ==\nDespite the uniqueness of the collection, in 1996 the municipal council (Gemeinderat) of the city of Z\u00fcrich sought to either outsource the collection of succulents or to close the collection entirely. This political pressure led to the founding of the boosting association F\u00f6rderverein der Sukkulenten-Sammlung Z\u00fcrich. The council then decided to suspend the motion, until it became clear whether the Canton of Z\u00fcrich and the federal authorities would become involved in co-financing.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage of national importance ==\nSukkulenten-Sammlung Z\u00fcrich is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nGartenbiografien: Orte erz\u00e4hlen. vdf Hochschulverlag AG, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich 2013, ISBN 978-3-7281-3579-7.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSukkulenten-Sammlung Z\u00fcrich website (in German)\nF\u00f6rderverein (in German)\nIOSweb.org: International Organizations for Succulent Plant Research website",

        "wiki": "Jules Marcou (April 20, 1824 \u2013 April 17, 1898) was a French, Swiss and American geologist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born at Salins, in the d\u00e9partement of Jura, in France. He was educated at Besan\u00e7on and at the Coll\u00e8ge Saint Louis, Paris.  After completing his studies, he made several excursions through Switzerland to recover his health. These travels led him to devote himself to natural science. During these travels, he met Jules Thurmann (1804-1855), who introduced him to Louis Agassiz.During 1845, he worked with Thurmann on a geological survey of the Jura mountains. He was appointed assistant of the mineralogical department of the Sorbonne in 1846, and also classified its collection of fossils. During this time, he conducted geological investigations in various parts of Europe. In 1847 he went to North America as traveling geologist for the Jardin des Plantes, charged with studying the United States and the English possessions in North America. The next year, he joined Agassiz in Boston, and accompanied him to the Lake Superior region, visiting the copper mines of the Keweenaw Peninsula, Lake Huron, and Niagara. After six months, he returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and sent minerals he had collected to Paris.During January 1849, Marcou directed his attention to the geology of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Later he crossed the Allegheny Mountains, visiting the Mammoth Cave and other localities, and then traversed Canada. He returned to Europe for a short time in 1850. In 1853 he published a Geological Map of the United States, and the British Provinces of North America. In 1853 he was hired by the United States government to serve as a geologist for the Pacific Railroad Survey along the 35th parallel, one of a series of explorations of the American West to find possible routes for a transcontinental railroad. In this role he became the first geologist to cross the United States. He subsequently made a geological section extending from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean.In 1855 he became professor of geology and palaeontology at the polytechnic school of Z\u00fcrich, but relinquished this office in 1859.  His Lettres sur les roches du Jura et leur distribution g\u00e9ographique dans les deux h\u00e9misph\u00e8res (published 1857...1860) included one of the earliest proposals that a land bridge had once existed between the Old World and New World.\nIn 1861 again returned to the United States, when he assisted Louis Agassiz in initiating the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and was in charge of its palaeontological division from 1860 to 1864. Subsequently, he devoted himself to scientific research until 1875, when he again began service for the United States government, and accompanied the Wheeler Survey to Southern California.Jules Marcou married Jane Belknap of Boston in 1850. They had two children. He died at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1898 and was interred there in Mount Auburn Cemetery.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nLife, letters, and works of Louis Agassiz (1895)\nCretaceous formations of the Jura\nDyas (Permian) of Nebraska\nTaconic rocks of Vermont and Canada\nAmerican Geological Classification and Nomenclature (1888)\nGeological Map of the World (1861, 2nd ed. 1875)\nA Little More Light on the United States Geological Survey (1892)\nLettres sur les roches du Jura et leur distribution g\u00e9ographique dans les deux h\u00e9misph\u00e8res (1857-1860)\nGeology of North America (1858)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof (often shortened to Z\u00fcrich HB) (Z\u00fcrich Main Station or Z\u00fcrich Central Station) is the largest railway station in Switzerland. Z\u00fcrich is a major railway hub, with services to and from across Switzerland and neighbouring countries such as Germany, Italy, Austria, and France. The station was originally constructed as the terminus of the Spanisch Br\u00f6tli Bahn, the first railway built completely within Switzerland. Serving up to 2,915 trains per day, Z\u00fcrich HB is one of the busiest railway stations in the world.\nThe station can be found at the northern end of the Altstadt, or old town, in central Z\u00fcrich, near the confluence of the rivers Limmat and Sihl. The station is on several levels, with platforms both at ground and below ground level, and tied together by underground passages and the ShopVille shopping mall. The Sihl passes through the station in a tunnel with railway tracks both above and below. The station's railway yards extend about 4 km (2.5 mi) to the west.\nThe station is included in the Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National Significance.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The first station ===\n\nThe first Z\u00fcrich railway station was built by Gustav Albert Wegmann, on what were then the north-western outskirts of the city. It occupied a piece of land between the rivers Limmat and Sihl, and trains accessed it from the west via a bridge over the Sihl. At the eastern end of the station was a turntable, used for turning locomotives. This basic terminal station layout, with all trains arriving from the west, was to set the basic design of the station for the next 143 years.\nThe new station was the initially the terminus of the Swiss Northern Railway, more often called the Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn, which opened on 9 August 1847 and linked Z\u00fcrich with Baden. Initially the railway lines in the station were laid to a gauge of 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in), perhaps because the same gauge was used at the contemporaneous and nearby Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway.From the opening of the station, the railways of northern Switzerland developed rapidly, and by 1853 the Swiss Northern Railway had been merged into the Swiss Northeastern Railway (Schweizerische Nordostbahn; NOB). Also in 1853, the tracks in the station were regauged to the standard gauge (1,435 mm or 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in) that is still used by all lines in the station.  In 1856, the NOB completed its line from the station to Winterthur via the Wipkingen Tunnel and Oerlikon. In 1858, the NOB completed its line from Baden via Brugg to Aarau, where it connected with the Swiss Central Railway (Schweizerische Centralbahn; SCB), thus providing connections to Basel, Solothurn and Lausanne.\nWith further railways planned, it became clear that the 1847 station was not large enough. A rebuild was started to meet Z\u00fcrich's increased transport needs, albeit on the same site and using the same basic layout.\n\n\n=== The 1871 station ===\n\nIn 1871, the replacement station building opened, to a design by architect Jakob Friedrich Wanner. Its main entrance is a triumphal arch facing the end of the then newly built Bahnhofstrasse. In front of the arch stands a monument to the railway pioneer Alfred Escher.  The magnificent sandstone neo-Renaissance building features richly decorated lobbies and atriums, restaurants and halls. Originally housed inside it was the headquarters of the Schweizerische Nordostbahn (NOB). The train shed, spanned by iron trusses, initially covered six tracks. Its stone walls with arches and arched windows portrayed a simple, monumental impression of space.\nThe station was named Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof in 1893, to reflect that year's incorporation of many of Z\u00fcrich's suburbs into an enlarged municipality.  In 1902, the year in which the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) took over the Schweizerische Centralbahn and the NOB, the tracks inside the eastern end of the train shed were lifted, due to a lack of space.  Since then, these tracks have terminated at a more central location, immediately to the north of the Bahnhofstrasse.  Also in 1902, four more tracks and a north wing with a restaurant and railway mail service were added to the north of the train shed.  In the vacant space left inside the train shed, new rooms were built for baggage handling.\nOn 18 February 1916, the SBB decided that electrification of its network would be by the high-tension single-phase alternating current system that is still used on all routes. On 5 February 1923, the electrified Zug\u2013Z\u00fcrich railway was put into operation, the first electrified line to Zurich. By 1927 all routes from Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof had been electrified.\nIn 1933, the station's simple concourse and the iron and glass train shed were created with seven and a half arches to cover 16 tracks. As part of that work, the main shed was shortened by two segments.\nIn the 1940s, the line between Z\u00fcrich and Geneva served as a \"parade route\".  The first lightweight steel express train had entered service on this route in 1937. By 11 June 1960, the SBB network was largely electrified. In the following year, the SBB introduced its first four-system electric trains under the Trans Europ Express banner, and thereby increased the Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof's international importance.\nIn 1963, about 500 metres before the concourse, an imposing six-storey concrete cube arose in the station yard. It was designed by SBB architect Max Vogt, and it has been the home of the Zentralstellwerk Z\u00fcrich (central signalling control) since 1966.  The then state-of-the-art relay-controlled interlocking system replaced the decentralised mechanical and electro-mechanical signal boxes in the station throat, including the Stellwerk \u00abSeufzerbr\u00fccke\u00bb (\"Bridge of Sighs\" signal box), which had spanned the entire station throat just east of the Langstrasse.\nThe signalling control system was modernised to coincide with the commissioning of the Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn.  It is equipped with a computerised controller that performs the standard operations.  Apart from the tracks and points (switches) of the \"Sihlpost station\" (which are controlled by an electronic control system), the entire control of the points and signals in the Langstrasse\u2013Concourse section is still largely under relay control, in some cases with the original relay sets installed in 1966.\nThe immense station yard, with its platform tracks and station building, is a bottleneck for the city of Z\u00fcrich. The Limmat and the Sihl were further bottlenecks, and the combination of the three led to gridlock in the 1950s and 1960s. In parallel, there were plans for a subway system. Although the people voted against it in 1962, the city's Civil Engineering Department had already started to convert the Bahnhofplatz for the purpose of a possible underground line.\n\n\n=== ShopVille and S-Bahn ===\n\nOn 1 October 1970, construction of the Bahnhofplatz, as well as the pedestrian and shopping arcade ShopVille was completed. Upon its opening, the Bahnhofplatz became a pedestrian-free zone, and the underground ShopVille the only access to the station. Contrary to expectations, ShopVille did not capture the support of the people, who, in 1973, voted even more emphatically to reject a subway system.\nIn the 1980s, ShopVille became a drug-dealing hub, due to its proximity to the Autonomen Jugendzentrum Z\u00fcrich (\"Autonomous Youth Center Z\u00fcrich\"). Its low point was reached at the end of the decade, when travellers avoided all parts of it other than the concourse and the tram stop. Consequently, there were several night-time closures by mesh fences. However, the solution to this problem was foreseeable, as the people had agreed on 29 November 1981 to the construction of the Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn and the extension of the Sihltal Z\u00fcrich Uetliberg Bahn to the Hauptbahnhof.\nThe 2.1 km (1.3 mi) long Hirschengraben Tunnel was built for the S-Bahn from the Hauptbahnhof to Z\u00fcrich Stadelhofen. This new line continued through the Z\u00fcrichberg Tunnel to Stettbach, with connections to the existing lines to Dietlikon and D\u00fcbendorf. In the Hauptbahnhof, two underground stations were constructed. For the S-Bahn, a four-track station with the working title Museumstrasse was built, and the Sihltal Z\u00fcrich Uetliberg Bahn was extended to the SZU station, which had once been intended for the never-realized U-Bahn.\nThe opening of the S-Bahn was on 27 May 1990, and since then, the ShopVille arcades have connected the two underground stations with the main hall. Black and white striped marble walls and granite floors are the main design features of what is one of the largest shopping centres in Switzerland. In 1996, the main hall was cleared of its temporary installations. In 1997, the train shed was fitted on both sides with pitched roofs on sloping concrete supports, designed by local architects Marcel Meili and Markus Peter.\n\n\n=== L\u00f6wenstrasse station ===\n\nThe planning of the S-Bahn and the Rail 2000 long-haul project raised the idea of building the Weinberg Tunnel, a through route from Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof to Oerlikon. That proposal was initially postponed, but the great success of the S-Bahn led to an expansion of services and, consequently, to capacity constraints.  Plans were made to expand existing rail lines within Z\u00fcrich leading to the north, but this encountered resistance from the population living near those rail lines.  As an alternative the construction of the Weinberg tunnel and four additional underground tracks in the railway station was suggested and confirmed by a referendum.\nIn 2002, an architectural competition was held for the new L\u00f6wenstrasse transit station, won by the architect Jean-Pierre D\u00fcrig. On 22 December 2006, the Federal Office of Transport approved the building of the tunnel and a third underground four-track L\u00f6wenstrasse station.  In September 2007, construction began on the project, nicknamed \"Durchmesserlinie\" (cross-city link). On 14 June 2014, the new platforms and tunnels were opened.\nThe new line runs from the Altstetten railway station, crosses the Z\u00fcrich HB station throat on a bridge, and leads into the underground L\u00f6wenstrasse station. From there, it goes through the new, approximately 5 km (3.1 mi) long Weinberg Tunnel in a long left-hand curve under the existing Z\u00fcrich HB\u2013Stadelhofen line.  It then ends at the level of the portals of the existing Wipkinger Tunnels in Oerlikon, where it connects with the northbound lines, including the line to Z\u00fcrich Airport and Winterthur.In 2007, the SBB and Deutsche Bahn entered into a station partnership between the Z\u00fcrich HB and the Berlin Hauptbahnhof to promote knowledge sharing between operators of similarly sized stations.\n\n\n== Layout and facilities ==\n\n\n=== Layout ===\n\nThe station is aligned approximately east to west, at the northern edge of the city centre and the northern end of Bahnhofstrasse, the city's main shopping street. It is split over three principal levels, with the ground level housing sixteen terminal platform tracks and the station's main concourse. Below this level are a series of pedestrian passageways, the ShopVille shopping centre, and the course of the Sihl. At the lowest level, and parallel to the terminal platforms at ground level, are ten underground platform tracks, of which two are terminal and eight are through.The station's main concourse itself comprises two sections. To the east is the Haupthalle (Main Hall), which was the train hall of the 1871 station but is now a pedestrian circulation space. The Haupthalle is surrounded on three sides by station buildings, whilst to the west it opens onto the Querhalle (Cross Hall), which stretches across the head of the ground level terminal platforms. These platforms, comprising two side platforms and seven island platforms, are sheltered by the 1933-built train shed and are served by tracks numbered 3 to 18.At the middle level, the station site is crossed north to south by four pedestrian passageways. The eastern three of these, the Passage Bahnhofstrasse, the Passage L\u00f6wenstrasse and the Passage Gessnerallee, form an interconnected complex with the ShopVille shopping complex and give direct access to all the station's platforms as well as to the surrounding streets. An intermediate underground level, immediately below the Haupthalle, connects these passageways with the concourse. The westernmost passage, the Passage Sihlquai, lies to the west of the Sihl, which passes under the station from north to south at the same level as the passageways. Because of the presence of the river channel, the Sihlquai passage has no direct connection to the other passageways, but it connects to streets to the north and south of the station, and to all platforms except that serving tracks 21 and 22.At the lowest level, there are three groups of underground platforms. The most southerly are terminal tracks 21 and 22, with a single island platform, and accessible only to trains on the SZU's Uetliberg and Sihltal lines. To the north of these are two island platforms serving tracks 31 to 34, known as the L\u00f6wenstrasse station, which link to the station's western rail approaches, and to an eastern approach via the Weinberg tunnel from Oerlikon station. Some distance to the north of these are two further island platforms serving tracks 41 to 44, known as the Museumstrasse station, which also link to the station's western approaches, and to an eastern approach via the Hirschengraben Tunnel from Stadelhofen station.\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\n\nUnderneath the Bahnhofplatz and the station is the large underground shopping centre called \"ShopVille\" of over 200 shops or other businesses. It benefits from the Swiss employment law rule that while generally labour on Sundays is not allowed, it is allowed in \"centres of public transport\". The huge underground \"Rail City\" is, therefore, usually bustling on Sundays even while the streets of Zurich are largely empty.Events take place regularly in the Haupthalle, including \"open air\" cinema; vegetable, flea and Christmas markets; and events such as skating, beach volleyball and the \"warm up\" for the Street Parade.\nSince 8 June 2009, Z\u00fcrich HB has been the site of the first SBB Lounge. This waiting room was exclusively for holders of a first-class general subscription or a valid international first-class ticket or for frequent traveller program members of the Railteam partner railways.  However, the lounge was closed in 2016.\nThe station also has its own chapel, jointly run by the Evangelical Reformed and the Roman Catholic churches, but open to travellers of all denominations or religions. The chapel is located on the intermediate underground level, immediately below the Haupthalle.\n\n\n=== Station bells, clock and lights ===\nThere are station bells above the rear exit of the large hall. In the 1847 station, bells rang before each departure of the Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn. The signal order prescribed as follows: \"10 minutes before the departure of a train, one [bell]; 5 minutes before the same, two [bells]; and immediately prior to departure, three bells\". For the 1871 renovations, the architect Jakob Friedrich Wanner gave the station clock the place of honour in the portal above the main entrance, and the bells were placed in a small tower in the east facade.\nOn 12 September 2006, to commemorate the station's 150th anniversary, the ETH Z\u00fcrich installed the NOVA, a three-dimensional, bivalent display, which consists of 25,000 individually addressable light balls. It represents a play of light of several colours, but can also represent cinematic sequences. It is expected to remain hanging in the station until further notice.\n\n\n== Operation ==\n\nZ\u00fcrich HB is served by more than 2,900 trains daily. In 2012, it had an average of 414,000 passengers each working day. The station is busy at all times, with trains running from 05:00 until 01:00 during the week. From Friday night to Sunday morning, trains run all day and all night as part of the ZVV Nachtnetz (night network).\n\n\n=== Tracks ===\nThe station has four distinct groups of tracks, giving a total of 26 tracks:\n\nTracks 3 to 18 are terminal tracks located at ground level, served by two side platforms and seven island platforms. These are used by long-distance trains from throughout Switzerland, and by international trains such as the EuroCity, Cisalpino, InterCityExpress and TGV.\nTracks 21 and 22 are underground terminal tracks, served by a single island platform, and located on the southern side of the station. These are used by SZU S-Bahn trains, heading west and south towards Uetliberg and the Sihl valley.\nTracks 31 to 34 are underground through tracks, served by a pair of island platforms, and located just to the north of tracks 21 and 22. These are used by long-distance and S-Bahn trains running to and from Oerlikon station via the Weinberg Tunnel.\nTracks 41 to 44  are underground through tracks, served by a pair of island platforms, and located on the northern side of the station. These are used by S-Bahn trains running via the Hirschengraben Tunnel and Z\u00fcrich Stadelhofen station.\n\n\n=== International services ===\nThe following international services call at Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof:\nIntercity Express: four round-trips per day over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden line to Hamburg-Altona.\nTGV Lyria: Service every two hours over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden line to Paris-Lyon.\nEuroCity:Transalpin: Single round-trip per day over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Winterthur line to Graz Hauptbahnhof.\nService every two hours over the Lake Z\u00fcrich left-bank line to Milano Centrale.\nThree round-trips per day over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Winterthur line to M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof.\nSingle round-trip per day over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden line to Hamburg-Altona.InterCity: Service every two hours over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Winterthur railway to Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof.\nRailjet Express: Four round-trips per day over the Lake Z\u00fcrich left-bank line to Vienna, Budapest, or Bratislava.\nNightjet/EuroNight: Overnight train over the Lake Z\u00fcrich left-bank line to Graz, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, or Zagreb.\n\n\n=== Domestic long-distance traffic ===\nThe following long-distance services call at Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof:\nInterCity:Half-hourly service over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden and Z\u00fcrich\u2013Winterthur lines between Geneva Airport/Lausanne and St. Gallen.\nInfrequent service over the Lake Z\u00fcrich left-bank line to Lugano.\nHourly service over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden and Lake Z\u00fcrich left-bank lines between Basel SBB and Chur.\nHourly service over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden line to Lausanne.\nHourly service over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden and Z\u00fcrich\u2013Winterthur lines between Brig and Romanshorn.InterRegio:Hourly service over the Lake Z\u00fcrich left-bank line to Chur.\nHalf-hourly service over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden line to Bern.\nFive round-trips daily over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden and Z\u00fcrich\u2013Winterthur lines between Basel SBB and Z\u00fcrich Airport.\nHourly service over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden line to Basel SBB.\nService every two hours over the Sihltal line to Erstfeld.\nHalf-hourly service over the Lake Z\u00fcrich left-bank line to Lucerne.RegioExpress:Hourly service over the Lake Z\u00fcrich left-bank line to Chur.\nHourly service over the Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden line to Schaffhausen.\n\n\n=== S-Bahn services ===\nSince the commissioning of the Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn in May 1990, the Hauptbahnhof has been the central node of the Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn Stammnetz (core network). As such, it is the nodal point where S-Bahn lines S2, S3, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S12, S14, S15, S16, S19, S20, S21, S24 and S25, the Sihltal Z\u00fcrich Uetliberg Bahn (S4 and S10) and Z\u00fcrich trams interconnect.\n\n\n=== Urban public transport ===\nAround the station, the trams and trolleybuses of the Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich (VBZ) provide local public transport services. The Hauptbahnhof is one of the most important nodes of the Z\u00fcrich tramway network.\nThe main station is accessible from five tram and bus stops:\n\nSihlquai|HB to the north next to exit Shilquai via the most western underpass, tram lines 4, 13, and 17;\nBahnhofquai|HB to the east via the main hall, tram lines 4, 11, 13, 14, 17 and trolleybus 46;\nBahnhofplatz|HB to the south via traverse hall, main hall, or underground ShopVille, tram lines 3, 6, 10, 14 and trolleybus 31;\nBahnhofstrasse|HB just south of Bahnhofplatz via main hall or underground ShopVille, tram lines 6, 7, 11, 13 and 17;\nSihlpost|HB 300m to the south-west from exit Europaallee via the most western underpass, tram lines 3, 14 and trolleybus 31.\n\n\n=== Train operations ===\nDue to its central location in Switzerland and in Europe, the station was quickly able to establish itself as an important railway junction. Most trains running through several European countries operated through Switzerland. In addition, a majority of Swiss mainline trains travelled to or from Z\u00fcrich. For the clock-face timetable introduced to Switzerland in 1982, Z\u00fcrich is the \"pacemaker\". Delays and other disruptions at Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof sometimes affect the whole of Switzerland.\nLong-distance trains meet in Z\u00fcrich on the hour and half-hour, and thus connect with each other. In cases of delays, connecting trains wait a maximum of 3 minutes beyond the scheduled departure time, except for some international trains and the late night trains. S-Bahn services do not wait for late connecting trains, but the long-distance trains - contrary to popular opinion - usually wait for delayed S-Bahn trains (also for a maximum of 3 minutes).\n\n\n=== Flood risk ===\nThe Sihl passes through the station in a tunnel, with platforms above and below the river, and public circulation areas to either side. The tunnel comprises 5 culverts with a length of 190 metres (623 ft) and a clear opening of 12 metres (39 ft) by 3 metres (10 ft) each. This limits the river's flow capacity, raising concerns about the capacity of the tunnel to deal with extreme flood events. Additionally, during the building of the new L\u00f6wenstrasse platforms, it was necessary to temporarily close part of this tunnel, thus reducing the capacity even further.Some 50 kilometres (31 mi) upstream of the station lies the Sihlsee, Switzerland's largest artificial lake, which is impounded by a 33-metre (108 ft) high dam. Studies showed that a failure of this dam could lead to an 8-metre (26 ft) high flood wave reaching the Hauptbahnhof within 2 hours. This threat has led the City of Z\u00fcrich to develop, publish and test evacuation plans for the affected areas of the city, and especially the station area.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistory of rail transport in Switzerland\nRail transport in Switzerland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Further reading ===\n\n\n==== Books ====\nBosshard, Martin (2004).

        "wiki": "The Arboretum is a botanical garden, public park and arboretum in Switzerland. The garden is part of the so-called Quaianlagen, a series of lakefronts in Z\u00fcrich. The area also houses a lido, a public bath with a lake sauna, and the Voliere Z\u00fcrich including the Vogelpflegestation, a unique sanatorium for birds.\n\n\n== Location ==\nArboretum is situated in Z\u00fcrich-Enge, as of today being a district of the city of Z\u00fcrich, on Z\u00fcrichsee lake shore being a part of the so-called Quaianlagen initiated by Arnold B\u00fcrkli. The park is separated by the General-Guisan-Quai and Mythenquai roads, from the lower lake shore promenade and the Enge harbour area.\nPublic transport is provided by the Z\u00fcrich Tram route 5, as well by the VBZ bus lines 161 and 165 at the Rentenanstalt stop.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Arboretum is an important part of the historical lake quays (German: Quaianlagen) which were inaugurated in 1887. The quays are an important milestone in the development of the modern city of Z\u00fcrich, as by the construction of the new lake front, Z\u00fcrich was transformed from the medieval small town on the Limmat and Sihl rivers to an attractive modern city on the Z\u00fcrichsee lake shore.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Arboretum was created according to the then-current style of a public garden. Originally, it was intended as a cultivated and richly equipped, but otherwise conventional parkland. Shortly before the construction work started, a group of botany and geology professors made proposals to enrich the park concept, in due consideration of scientific aspects. A tree collection with exotic plants, a rock collection, and an Alpine panorama accounting the Glarus Alps view from the park should provide to the citizens a piece of education on a Sunday stroll. The affiliated formed Arboretum Kommission comprised also the landscape architects Evariste Mertens and Otto Froebel and the botany Professor Carl Schr\u00f6ter, who managed to communicate science and beauty in the new park. In 1886 the work for the design of the plant started, and Otto Froebel teamed up with his professional colleagues Evariste Mertens. Cleverly, they modeled the fresh lake level terrain wrested from and the park in the style of the late garden laid, and succeeded in the picturesque grouping of trees. The scientific concept is rounded off by a rock collection, as well as the first alpine panorama of Z\u00fcrich. The trees of the so-called China-group on the lake shore hide three one-man bunkers, which were built in 1942 to 'protect' the lower lake basin; since 1992, the bunkers are under cantonal conservation. The Arboretum is obtained largely in its original composition, but in the 1980s it became an urgent task to continue the original scientific concept in the replanting, however, larger groups of trees had to be replaced and new planted trees had to be integrated in the existing planting concept. The basis for the development of the park maintenance according to the original concept was introduced in 1985.\n\n\n== Collection and structure ==\nToday it presents many trees in mature beauty. The trees developed in over a hundred years enormously; many groups of trees have reached their maximum, others have already been renewed. The challenge of the coming decades is to renew the tree collection the scientific concept of the past, to also future generations to the refined richness of the botanical collection to be true to. The Arboretum is maintained as first historic park system in Zurich since 1985 according to garden conservation aspects.\n\n\n=== Segments according to Professor Schr\u00f6ter ===\nBased on the concept of Professor Schr\u00f6ter, the tree collection is divided into three segments:\nThe largest segment comprises nine sections and groups of trees that originate from different regions of the world. In the early 19th century, the choice of the trees was unconventional, among them species from southern Switzerland, the Alps, the Jura Mountains, the Mediterranean and the Middle East, the southern and eastern states of the US, from California, Canada, Japan and China.\nThe second segment includes four systematic floral districts, and trees of the same plant families, among them Elms, Maples, Ash trees and Beech.\nSituated on the small lake shore hill, the third segment consists solely of the plants of the Tertiary flora, i.e. of the formation of the Alps. These trees had been native to Central Europe before the Late Glacial Maximum including plants spread from Scandinavia to the southern area of Europe.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Attractions of the tree collection ===\nA striking solitaire is the Magnolia acuminata at the sculpture of Aphrodite (1921) by the Danish sculptor Einar Utzon-Frank towards the General-Guisan-Quai. The tree was imported from the USA respectively the east coast between the states of New York and Georgia, and wears from late spring to early summer blue-gray flowers, changed to pink in early autumn fruits and later deep red cucumbers. Its down to earth reaching, strong branches predestine it almost to become a popular climbing tree for children. In addition, the China group also is represented by Prunus serotina and Toona sinensis, a cedar, which is native to northern and western China.At the Enge lido is situated an impressive Beech group whose branches are cascading to the ground. Inside the group of trees are also powerful green-leaved trees, but also the purple Fagus sylvatica f. purpurea, and the outer ends form narrow-leaved Beeches. In the summer when the trees are in full leaf, they form a tree cathedral, in those shadows reigns a soothing coolness and soft twilight. Since 2006 an open gap in the middle of the group, as the central Beech unfortunately had to be cut. The death of the otherwise durable Beech is also a result of poor soil conditions, which occur on the artificial lake shore bed. Just steps away, there is a beautiful example of a tree grafting; aFraxinus americana graftage based on a slower growing surface, thus the strain at the intersection is almost seamlessly thicker.The lakeward side of the easterly hill section is meant by the garden architects as an open-minded moraine, and an alpinum, a collection of mountain plants, but some years later was abandoned as one of the 'garden fashions' of the 19th century. The high maintenance perennial planting was replaced with flowers shrubs as being much more easier to care by the park maintenance workers. Since 1988 the alpine garden blooms again, but the mountain plants are found only on the sunniest places to the southwest, and rather robust blooms perennials, including Sedums and Hylotelephium from the nearby Sukkulentensammlung. The original rock formation on the lake shore was intended, to lead the eye of the observer in the distance to the Alps. The information board that is illustrating the Alpine panorama is supposed to have been the first of its kind in Z\u00fcrich, to round off the concept of education and edification of the Z\u00fcrich citizenship. Around the increased park benches at the hill, there is arranged tree group that consists almost entirely of dark Pinophytas. The garden architectes intended to extend the perspective by planting initially bright tree species with small leaves, seamlessly to dark-leaved species, and finally to exit the arboretum towards the Enge harbour in a perspective sense to evergreen species. After the devastation of the Lothar storm in December 1999, this group of trees had to be overall replaced, based on the first tree inventory of 1898. The total renewal of the group had the advantage that all trees have the identical starting conditions and sufficient light to flourish in a few decades to ensure original character of the arboretum.\n\n\n== Aviary and bird's sanatory ==\n\nThe Arboreturm also houses a small aviary and the so-called Vogelpflegestation, meaning a unique veterinary hospital for wild birds. It claims to be the most important emergency department in Switzerland for injured and sick wild birds, and also for young birds that were fallen from their nests. Established in 1902, it is focused on the bird rescue and the publicity for the population, and therefore houses a unique competence center for native and exotic birds emerged. The foundation is financed by contributions and donations from its about 700 members, and by donations from individuals and prestigious foundations. The bird care station has a reputation, which goes far beyond the Swiss borders. For tourists, in particular for ornithologists, it is a very attractive point of attraction due to its unique portfolio of exotic birds. But also the townspeople themselves, use the wheelchair visitors hall of the aviary to expand their knowledge of the world of birds, of which approximately 111 exotics in 33 species are represented. Each year there are around 45,000 visitors, including many tourists, who get free information about some of the rarest bird species of Switzerland in eight naturally designed inn walks and three landscape-like outdoor enclosures.\n\n\n== Seebad Enge ==\n\nThe lido of the Arboretum is also a very popular public bath, and also houses the swimming Seebad Enge, which is also a unique Z\u00fcrichsee lake shore sauna during winter season. The swimming lido consists of a building construction that is anchored in the lake. Conceived by Robert Landolt, the two-piece bathing complex was built in 1959/60, since 1999 it is private-owned and provides an open lake side sauna and gastronomy which were installed in 2003/04.\n\n\n== Arnold B\u00fcrkli Memorial ==\n\nAt the foot of the lake shore hill that elevates around 3 metres (10 ft), the Arnold B\u00fcrkli memorial honors the tireless creating engineer being the driving force behind the new quays. The simple monument was inaugurated in 1899, five years after his death, at B\u00fcrkli's favorite place in the Arboretum, or by the words of the sculptor Richard Kissling, in the midst of his creation.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage of national importance ==\nThe Arboretum Z\u00fcrich is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nGartenbiografien: Orte erz\u00e4hlen. vdf Hochschulverlag AG, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich 2013, ISBN 978-3-7281-3579-7.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website Gr\u00fcn Stadt Z\u00fcrich (in German)\nVoliere Z\u00fcrich \u2013 Vogelpflegestation (in German)",

        "wiki": "SIX operates the infrastructure for the Swiss financial centre. The company provides services relating to securities transactions, the processing of financial information, payment transactions and is building a digital infrastructure. The company name SIX is an abbreviation and stands for Swiss Infrastructure and Exchange. SIX is internationally active, with its headquarters in Zurich.\n\n\n== Company history ==\n\n\n=== 1930: Foundation of Ticker AG and subscription to the new stock exchange ===\nTicker AG in Zurich was founded with the purpose of transmitting stock market prices. It was the predecessor of Telekurs AG, which later merged with other companies to form SIX.With the opening of the new exchange, the ticker system also began to broadcast. This stock exchange ticker, one of the first on the European continent and a special application of the local telegraph, transmitted the Zurich stock exchange prices, the closing prices of other Swiss and important foreign stock exchanges in italics on a narrow strip of paper to any number of recipients.\n\n\n=== 1961: Stock Exchange Television ===\nTicker AG introduced the first stock exchange television ever and aroused media interest with this novelty: The prices of up to ninety stocks could be followed on screen. The Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung described stock exchange television as a world first and devoted a technology supplement to this technical development.Ticker AG changed its name to Telekurs AG.\n\n\n=== 1987: Commissioning Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) ===\nThe new online clearing system was based on a central computer system at Telekurs with online access for participants. Primarily, only payments in Swiss francs are processed.\n\n\n=== 1993: Foundation of the Swiss Stock Exchange ===\nThe stock exchanges in Geneva, Basel and Zurich merged to form the Swiss Exchange.\n\n\n=== 1995: Electronic stock exchange trading and Swiss Value Chain ===\nThe Swiss Exchange launched electronic stock exchange trading with integrated settlement and custody and discontinued ring trading the following year. The prerequisite for this step was a link to the SECOM System for SEGA and to the interbank payment system SIC, which operated Telekurs.\n\n\n=== 1999: euroSIC internationalizes payments ===\nThe clearing system for euro payments, euroSIC, began operations and provided the Swiss banks with access to the European payment systems.  SEGA merged with INTERSETTLE to form the SIS Group. INTERSETTLE was previously responsible for securities settlement downstream of stock exchange trading.\n\n\n=== 2001: SIS acquires the world's most important collection of historical securities and establishes a foundation ===\nThe opening of the Wertpapierwelt in Olten as the first international museum for historical securities followed in July 2003, and today the exhibition can be seen at the Swiss Finance Museum in Zurich.\n\n\n=== 2005: Cartel law proceedings ===\nIn 2005, SIX Multipay Ltd launched a DCC function (dynamic currency conversion), which was only available on the payment card terminals of SIX Card Solutions Ltd. The Commission of Competition (Weko) intervened and accused the SIX subsidiary of abusing its dominant position. In December 2006, SIX Multipay Ltd also made the DCC function available to other terminal providers and disclosed the interface information. Four years later, the Weko imposed a fine of seven million Swiss francs on SIX.\n\n\n=== 2008: Merger and change of name ===\nThe SWX Group, SIS Group and Telekurs Group merged on 1 January to form Swiss Financial Markets Services AG. The company thus covered the business areas of securities trading, stock exchange transactions, financial information and payment transactions.On 21 August 2008, Swiss Financial Markets Services Ltd was renamed SIX Group Ltd.\n\n\n=== 2016: Mobile payment with TWINT ===\nTogether with various Swiss banks, SIX launched and established the mobile payment solution TWINT.\n\n\n=== 2018: Partnership with Worldline ===\nSIX entered into a strategic partnership with Worldline. Worldline acquired SIX Payment Services and SIX holds a 27% stake in Worldline.\n\n\n== Services (Selection) ==\n\n\n=== Securities trading via SIX Swiss Exchange ===\n\nSIX operates the Swiss Stock Exchange. The core functions of SIX Swiss Exchange are the admission of securities, the operation of the trading platform, the monitoring of trading and the distribution of market information. Shares, bonds, derivatives, investment funds and certificates, among others, are traded on the joint trading platform of the SIX Swiss Exchange and SIX Structured Products Exchange. In addition, SIX calculates indices such as the Swiss Market Index.\nAs an independent unit within SIX, Exchange Regulation assumes all tasks within the framework of the self-regulation provided for by the Stock Exchange Act. The unit is separate from the operational business and issues rules for issuers and participants, monitors trading and enforces the rules.\n\n\n=== Post-trade settlement and other securities services ===\nOnce an exchange trade has taken place, SIX takes over all subsequent processes. The SIX Securities Services division acts as a counterparty between trading parties throughout Europe (central counterparty). This service serves to reduce the risks of both buyers and sellers (clearing). Thereafter, SIX settles the transactions electronically (settlement). This includes real-time payments from one bank to another.SIX also operates systems that protect assets and documents from unauthorized access (custody). The company acts as the central securities depository for Switzerland in this area. It holds in safe custody most of the financial instruments issued under Swiss law. However, SIX also offers its custody service internationally.\nThe \u00abSecurities Services\u00bb division also includes platforms for direct debits and e-bills as well as the electronic information portal for land register data in Switzerland. It is called Terravis and enables mortgage, property and commercial register transactions. SIX Interbank Clearing operates the SIC and euroSIC payment systems in Switzerland and beyond its borders. It thus enables financial institutions worldwide to settle their large-value and retail payments in Swiss francs and euro.\n\n\n=== Financial Information ===\nSIX obtains real-time financial data from international stock exchanges and companies and distributes it further. This includes basic information on listed companies (reference data) and information on measures affecting the capital and voting rights of shareholders (corporate actions). In addition, SIX clients can keep up to date on prices and market rates for around 15 million financial instruments. Based on SIX financial data, banks and other market participants decide on financial transactions and assess investment risks.\n\n\n=== Cashless payment transactions ===\nSIX processes mobile payment as well as credit card, debit card and prepaid card payments in Switzerland, Austria and Luxembourg as well as in many other European countries. SIX also enables cash to be withdrawn from cash dispenser. With its infrastructure, SIX also creates the necessary secure conditions for hotel, catering and retail to be able to make hotel, catering and retail payments online or at POS terminal. be able to accept mobile payment and payment cards. In Austria, SIX occasionally issued payment cards itself. SIX Payment Services AG was sold in 2018 to Worldline.\n\n\n== Owner ==\nSIX is owned by around 130 national and international financial institutions, which are also the main users of its services. The company is not listed on the stock exchange.\n\n\n== Initiatives ==\nSIX supports the Swiss Finance Museum (formerly Wertpapierwelt in Olten). The museum presents a multimedia exhibition on the origins of the economic system and the importance of the Swiss financial market and its infrastructure.SIX is a founding member of the FinTech Incubator and Accelerator F10. Here, for example, SIX employees work together with start-ups to further develop financial technology in Switzerland. SIX intends to offer an open banking hub for business customers before the end of 2019. Among others, the two accounting software providers Abacus and Klara will use the Hub. Banks can also open their IT interface to the hub. UBS, Credit Suisse, Z\u00fcrcher Kantonalbank, Valiant Bank as well as Raiffeisen Schweiz participate at the project.\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite SIX\n\n\n== References ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Predigerkirche is one of the four main churches of the old town of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, besides Fraum\u00fcnster, Grossm\u00fcnster and St. Peter. First built in 1231 AD as a Romanesque church of the then Dominican Predigerkloster, the Basilica was converted in the first half of the 14th century, the choir between 1308 and 1350 rebuilt, and a for that time unusual high bell tower was built, regarded as most high Gothic edifice in Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLocated nearby the medieval Neumarkt quarter, the church that commonly is named Predigerkirche was mentioned for the first time in 1234 AD as the Predigerkloster monastery of the Dominican Order. The first Dominican friars settled, according to the chronicler Heinrich Brennwald, outside of the city walls of medieval Z\u00fcrich at Stadelhofen in 1230, and the construction of a new convent in Z\u00fcrich was first mentioned in 1231. Initially, against the resistance of the Grossm\u00fcnster canons, the Dominican's inclusion in Z\u00fcrich was granted in 1233/1235,  because they tirelessly drove the little foxes in the vineyard of the Lord. The monastery consisted of a Romanesque church at the same place as today, and the monastic buildings built around the adjointed cloister to its west. In 1254 the establishment of a cemetery at Z\u00e4hringerstrasse was allowed to the so-called \"prayer\" (used for Dominican friars, the 'blackfriars') abbey, and repealed in 1843. The order purchased 28 houses in the 13th and early 14th century. The convent was in close connection to the city nobility and landed gentry in Z\u00fcrich and the surrounding area, among them the Bilgeri family (Grimmenturm) and the House of Rapperswil, where they received asylum in Rapperswil after their expulsion by 1348. Memorial measurements had to be held at Grossm\u00fcnster until the 14th century, because thus the most income was achieved. Until the Reformation in Z\u00fcrich all income obtained with the funerals had also to be delivered to the Grossm\u00fcnster abbey. Within the late medieval city, as the other \"mendicant\" orders, the Dominicans have been reduced to the function of area pastors.The convent was abolished on 3 December 1524, the worship in the church was discontinued, and the buildings and income of the monastery were assigned to the Heilig-Geist-Spital, then an hospital of the city of Z\u00fcrich. The pastor of the \"preachers\" was initially subordinated to the parish of the Grossm\u00fcnster, in 1571 raised to the rank of a Grossm\u00fcnster Canon Regular, and in 1575 he was allowed to share the Lord's Supper according to the Reformed lithurgy, the so-called Abendmahlsgottesdienst. In 1614 the church was raised to a separate parish for the Neumarkt and Niederdorf districts within the city, as well as the then independent municipalities of Oberstrass and Unterstrass\u2013Fluntern were assigned to the parish. The French revolutionary troops allowed again the Catholic worship, but after only two years, the parish was reverted into a Reformed church on 17 October 1801. The church is since 1897 property of the Kirchgemeinde Predigern parish. In the 1960s it has been renovated, and re-opened in 1967. As of today Predigern is used as the \"open town church with Ecumenical profile\", in fact built as a parish church, but as a place of encounter and of the church community from the inner city, as well as of the suburban region.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== The first Romanesque church ===\n\nAccording to the building-historical research of the years 1990/96, the first church of the Dominicans was built in 1231 as a distinct Romanesque Basilica including a transept and two small apses in the spiral arms of the transept. The closed choir was fairly spacious, with an area of 10 x 10 metres (33 ft), being a reminiscent of the still existing choir of the former Fraum\u00fcnster basilica, that only a few years before was built. Archaeological finds show that the church had been planned to be originally shorter in the length than it is today. During the construction period, the building was extended on the today's west facade. The first church was very long, measuring 61 metres (200 ft) in the interior of the central nave, but its height of around 12 metres (39 ft) and width of 10 metres (33 ft) rather low. The Romanesque church seems to have caught fire, possibly several times. The fire in the Romanesque choir was arguably even occasion for its new building, as the wall in the western facade had several traces of fire. Probably the original Romanesque western facade had smaller windows then shown in the Murerplan, three narrow, high arched windows, similar to the still extant windows in the choir of the Fraum\u00fcnster church. The entire church had a flat wooden ceiling.The low height and stressed simplicity of the architectural details were according to the restrictive rules in the early days of the Dominicans. This first church building belongs to the few ones that are known from the early days of the order at all, what also explains the unusual transept. Different than from those in the south of the Alps, where transepts in the churches of the mendicant orders were common, in the north that kind of architecture was largely not used after 1250. The model for the shape of the Z\u00fcrich church might be the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna; it is slightly older, and was at that time probably the most important church of the Dominicans, where their founder Saint Dominic was buried in 1221. Both, the Z\u00fcrich and Bolognese churches, show that the early Dominicans were still strongly influenced by older orders like the Cistercians. The first Predigerkirche in Z\u00fcrich also shows that the \"Preachers\" in this early period were no more a poor itinerant order, which had built small churches for their own needs, the needs of just monks. At the time the Z\u00fcrich church was built, it was the largest church in the city.\n\n\n=== The Gothic choir ===\nProbably after a fire, the Romanesque choir was replaced in the first half of the 14th century by a Gothic architecture construction. At the same time, the two easternmost arcades in the nave were replaced by a bigger pair of bow, to make room for a rood screen, and a wooden vault instead of the flat ceiling covering the nave. The towering Gothic choir shows that the \"mendicant\" had abandoned all restraint in relation to the architecture of their churches. The construction of the choir begun soon after 1325. First, the Romanesque chancel was dismantled, followed by the construction on its foundations. The extremely ambitious dimensions of the building were designed in that phase. But already in the 1330s, the construction was set, and remained unfinished for years. The second phase of the building as it was planned, ended in a much more honest construction, and it was saved much substance of the Romansque building, for example, almost the entire Romanesque transept remained. Historical events explain that change: the revolution of 1336 that Rudolf Brun and his entourage brought to power, was followed by a period of economic uncertainty reaching its peak with the plague of 1348/49, the persecution and killing of the Jewish citizens of the so-called Synagogengasse in 1349, as well as the \"Z\u00fcrich night of murder\" (Mordnacht) in 1350, a failed counter coup of Brun's opposition under the son of Johann I (Habsburg-Laufenburg), Johann II. Unlike the Franciscan and the Augustinian orders, the Dominicans in Z\u00fcrich pleaded to the Pope, another opponent of the political situation in Z\u00fcrich, and therefore, the convent was forced to leave the city for several years. His exile led to Winterthur and Kaiserstuhl and finally to Rapperswil, those counts were the most prominent opponents of Brun's regime. This development represents the beginning of the general decline of the Z\u00fcrich Dominican convent.\n\n\n=== Roof structure ===\nThe roof work of the choir was built in two phases between 1317 and 1323 from east to west, as a rafter roof with collar beam position and cross strut. The approximately 28 metres (92 ft) long roof has a roof pitch of 57\u00b0, consists of 24 rafters and includes the polygonal upper fixation of the choir. The roof turret design was developed in 1496, and the belfry in 1475. Due to the strong inclination of the rafter container of about 97 centimetres (38.19 in), a pursuit of spruce and fir was set up in the 17th century. The roof structure was two times repaired what easily is recognizable. The first repair contained, among other things, the installation of the supporting struts, which stabilized the rafter container. Towards to the end of the 17th century, the second repair was implemented, which concentrated on the eastern chancel. One can note that the inclination of the entire roof work is originated by the pressure of the polygonal choir construction.\n\n\n=== Ridge turret respectively bell tower ===\n\nThe 27.1 metres (88.9 ft) high, hexagonal ridge turret is made of oak, and a masterpiece of carpenter technology, towering above the roof ridge, at the same height as the walls of the choir. The dendrochronological analysis show that the belfry construction was done in 1475, which has arisen in the supporting structure of the choir, that was added in 1496. The roof shingles of the open belfry and the hexagonal pointed helmet have been applied in several layers on the wooden formwork. The latest dendrochronological provisions on wooden spire show that this wood was hit in 1628, and the roof turret was built in 1629, followed by several repairs. The bracing cross pieces of the lower frame structure are applied, while there are at the top of the cross pieces of wood mortise and tenon joints. The pediments over the open belfry are crowned with golden knobs, and the roof spouts are decorated with Gargoyles from painted copper sheets. The subsequent installation of two tie rods was done in 1778, and included the removal of the shingle at the bottom of the screen for the installation of tie rods, in order to stabilize the pointed helmet. These were anchored to the belfry and thus passed the bells vibrations directly to the construction of the turret's vault.\n\n\n=== Church bell of 1451 ===\nThe bell in the roof turret dates from 1451 (inscription) and is in Z\u00fcrich the oldest church bell at its original location. The bell is attached with metal bands, which are vertically inserted into the oak basement and into 35 centimetres (13.78 in) horizontal flat iron passes. The bell bearing is remarkable, as the bell's axis protruding from the ridge, unrolling on the hammer-shaped head, and the rolling distance when ringing the bell is only about 7 centimetres (2.76 in). To produce the transverse force connections to the bell axis, it is linked to the outlying platings and under the belfry floor fixed with wooden screws.\n\n\n=== Baroque construction ===\nThe Reformation in Z\u00fcrich was also a struggle of the opponents of the mendicant orders to win the favour of the citizens of Z\u00fcrich. Zwingli forced disputations with combative sermons, the so-called pulpit-war; in spring of 1524 he banned the mendicant preaching, and on 3 December 1524 the repeal of the convents in Z\u00fcrich was forced. The buildings of the Dominican convent were transferred to the then neighboring hospital that was the property of the city government, and the church was deconsecrated. A wall separates since 1541/42 the choir from the nave. In the Gothic choir, the probably then two upper wooden floors served as a grain warehouse, and on the ground floor, the hospital chapel was set up. The nave was used for five large wine presses. The choir was then divided by the catchment of five shelves so that worship for the residents of Niederdorf was held from 1544 until 1607. The upper floors of the choir were now used as the grain chute.The Z\u00fcrich council decided on 21 January 1607, to relocate the worship in the separate nave, and the nave was rebuilt in the Baroque style. A wooden barrel vault was moved and the walls and vaults were covered with stucco. The clerestory and the attic were increased and grown, and a magnificent portal with porch was built on the south side. The reconstruction was carried out from 1609 to 1614 in the early Baroque style \u2013 this construction essentially repeals the present appearance of the church building and its interior. It became the first really redesigned Protestant church in that era. The conception of this sermon space, and the pulpit placed in the middle of the front wall above the baptismal font, was the model for many churches.\n\nThe most important structural changes affected the southern aisle whose southern wall was completely rebuilt with large pointed-arch windows. The two side aisles received a barrel vault and the nave. But the wooden vault above the nave weakened the structure of the church, so that in 1663, in terms of emergency, the still existing powerful buttresses had to be built, to support the southern facade. The increase of the high ship wall by 2 metres (7 ft) also was part of the same emergency measures, as well as a completely new roof. The new zone of the high ship wall was covered with round windows. The choir was once again used for storage purposes in the 19th century and served from 1803 as cantonal and University library. During the fire of 1887, the remaining convent buildings burnt down, as well as parts of the roof of the nave.\n\n\n=== Conversions of 1871/73 until 1899/1900 ===\n\nThe former convent buildings were also used after the abolition of the monastery by the hospital. After the construction of the new hospital in 1842, they became the so-called \"Versorgungsanstalt\" where chronically ill, old and incurable mental patients were housed; the contemporaries complained unsustainable states were solved in 1870, when the Burgh\u00f6lzli sanatory was built. On occasion of the renovation, the still preserved northern transept arm of the Romanesque church was demolished and three new tracery windows were inserted in the so far windowless exempted choir. The convent buildings were sold in 1873 to the city of Zurich, which used it to house destitute citizens. In 1877/79 the western fa\u00e7ade of the church was rebuilt, on the occasion of the conditioning of the tough. When the old convent buildings burned down on 25 June 1887, whose ruins were dismantled in the same year, and the open space was used for celebrations. The northern part of the church, that was detached since the demolition of the cloister buildings, also was new designed by adding aisle windows and pilasters. The stem of the southern portal, which was the main entrance to the church, has been cut and received a sloping roof and an arched position, and so the last connections between the Gothic choir and the former nave inside the church were closed.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Church tower of 1900 ===\n\nThe most important structural changes were new church windows in 1899, a new Gothic Revival style portal on the west facade, and the new tall church bell tower. The tower, by the architect Friedrich Wehrli, was begun in 1898 and completed in 1900 according to the plans of Stadtbaumeister Gustav Gull. The church tower was added after the demolition of the monastery's buildings on the southwest between the Zentralbibliothek (central library) and Predigerkirche (church). It is connected to the former cloister area and is accessible by a gate at its base. The church tower is a stylistic revival of Gothic architecture, particularly the Late Gothic cathedral towers of Grossm\u00fcnster and Fraum\u00fcnster. With its height of 96 metres (315 ft), it overtowers them by over 30 metres (98 ft).\nLike the most present brownstone buildings in Z\u00fcrich, it consists of a granitic sandstone of the lower freshwater molasse. The sandstone facade details and the four gables above the masonry were inspired by the choir of the church. The tower's roof is covered with copper tiles, the gables are covered with a wooden structure, so the 5.2 metres (17.1 ft) high spire weighs just 95 kilograms (209 lb).Renovations of the church tower were made in 1920, 1931, 1957, and 1993, which were traditionally documented inside the tower ball.\n\n\n== Contemporary restorations & renovations ==\n\n\n=== 1960s to 2010s ===\nIn 1965\u22121967 the nave was restored, and the original west facade of the church building largely rebuilt and renovated. At that time the first studies of retaining the Gothic era abbey\u2212choir building for the Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich (literally Z\u00fcrich Central Library) or reuniting it with the former nave were done.  In 1989 a fierce public debate rose on those options, culminating in a cantonal\u2212wide referendum. The proponents for retaining it for civic use won the ballot referendum. In the 1990\u22121996 remodeling of the library, the choir was retained as part of the library, and houses its Musikabteilung (music collections department).In 1974 the facade of the choir building was restored, and the shingles of the roof rider renewed. The leak and weathered roofing was replaced on the basis of existing records in the pointed knob with handmade impregnated roofing shingles. The hue of the top coat was held in an oxide-red tone. The bearing of the weather cock was made accessible, and the pommel balls over the gables and the tower were re-plated in gold.\nOn occasion of the state examination in 2008, there were various defects found in the roof work. The bell almost touched one side of the roof turret-bell tower, although this was to have been addressed in 2006 renovations. To avoid damage to the historic building, the weakened structural parts were restored, strengthened, and when necessary replaced. The hexagonal roof turret's pointed helmet had to be stabilized, and many components were in poor condition, the shingles were very brittle, there were cracked sheet metal seams, and the copper plate did not keep even slight pressure. The main reinforcements and restoration work in the choir building were completed in 2010.\n\n\n=== 2012 restoration ===\nIn 2012 the choir building's owners, including Reformierte Kirchgemeinde Predigern (church congregation) and Zentralbibliothek (central library), and the city of Z\u00fcrich's departments of Praktische Denkmalpflege' and Arch\u00e4ologie des Amts f\u00fcr St\u00e4dtebau, commissioned the Gugler construction company to repair the roof's skylights during the summer season. The restoration work was designed and specified to last for a minimum of 50 years, to avoid any more repetitions of extensive structural work for decades. The renovations, repairs, and additions to the historic roof structure proceeded cautiously and with due diligence research, although both records of the supporting structure and documentation of previous restorations was lacking.In collaboration with the city of Z\u00fcrich, a 60 metres (197 ft) high scaffolding tower was erected. The southwest side hip rafters of fir wood roof of the plant had moisture damage due to leaking roof shingles. It was plated with two dry, one year stored spruce wood parts, that were cope planed, glued together and the cross-sectional dimensions of wood connected with wooden screws. In addition to the general repairs to the structural stabilization of the first stator, the fixing of the rafter positions took was effected. Collar beam and strut pairs were cut off or removed in the roof structure.The respective opposite tower stands of the bell tower were stabilized with a total of three tie rods, and no longer repairable oak timbers were replaced. The iron forged bolt lugs and nails ware extensively restored and  reused. The wooden surfaces of the tower threshold ring, the moisture damage and the weakened old anchoring system of hexagonal roof turret-pointed helmet, required extensive reinforcements and repair measures, so that the existing bell bearings could be obtained.The new roof shingles of the bell tower consist of radially to the root-derived spruce wood, which has been pressure treated prior to assembly. The shingles were placed on the hexagonal spire and the tower shaft offset strengthened with 0.8 millimetres (0.0315 in) thin lead plates, so-called nouques. The shingles were painted with the color Caput Mortuum V (Violet), based on the color analysis on the roof turret itself, on research in the city archives and based on color of the tower of the church and the sandstone used in the choir.The crowning feature (knobs) and the lip contours, eyes and teeth of the Gargoyles were covered with gold leaf. The costs amounted to 1.1 million Swiss Francs.\n\n\n== Pipe organ ==\nThe first pipe organ was installed in 1503 and 24 years later broken in the aftermath of the Reformation struggle. The first early Baroque Protestant church in the southern German culture area is mentioned in 1614, so it is assumened that the organ may have been re-used. In 1879 the first new organ after the Reformation was installed, and in 1911 the organ was enlarged by Goll und Kuhn. In 1923 it was replaced by a new organ.The organ in the gallery was built by Paul Hintermann and Jakob Schmidt on behalf of Kuhn Orgelbau in 1970:\n\nThe slider chests instrument has 46 registers on three manuals and pedals. 1) floating, comp system with 6 combinations.The Kuhn organ of 1970 will be supplemented by a second one, built in 1886 by James Conacher in Huddersfield in northern England, probably in spring 2015.The church organ is owned by the Kirchgemeinde Predigern, and used by the Kantorei zu Predigern. The \"Mittagsmusik im Predigerchor\" concert series is administrated and partially published by the Musikabteilung.\n\n\n== Abbey\u2014Choir building ==\n\n\n=== Grave plate of 1270 ===\n\nOn the north side of the choir building, above the vault shell, the 14th century entrance door to the roof of the Gothic era choir was rediscovered in 1941. The older Romanesque period grave plate was in use as the lintel of the door opening, with its inscribed side facing down. The door jambs and the lintel (repurposed grave plate) were installed with other masonry work during the 14th century construction of the choir building. The grave plate has been walled up there for its future use. It was a remnant of the earlier Romanesque choir building. The machined surface is 74 centimetres (29.1 in) wide, 114 centimetres (44.9 in) respectively 130 centimetres (51.2 in) high; at the foot of about 700 kilograms (1,500 lb) grave plate is a defect. The thickness of the plate is 17 centimetres (6.7 in) at its left and 9 centimetres (3.5 in) at its right side. The material is sandstone from the Buechberg or Bollingen area on Obersee lake share. The backside is not processed, above a seven-petaled flower without hickeys is engraved, the length of each blade is 16 centimetres (6.3 in).Ruchenstein or Galgenen called himself a ministeriality of the House of Rapperswil, mentioned with Rudolf and Ulrich von Galgenen to 1229. Brother Heinrieh von Galgenen (von Ruchenstein) \"Frater ordinis predicatorum domus Turicensis\" appears as a member of the Dominican convent in Z\u00fcrich. The inscription \"Hie est sepultus frater Heinricus de Ruchenstein\" is 70 centimetres (27.6 in) long, and the letters are alternating 9 centimetres (3.5 in) and 8 centimetres (3.1 in) in height. Particularly noteworthy are the stem tubers with majuscule T and I of the early Gothic font type. The font differs sharply from the type of the 11th and 12th century AD, being an early stage of this new phase of development of writing that uses the second third of the 13th century, and was previously represented in the southern part of the Diocese of Constance only by two known examples. Slightly younger is the inscription on the grave stone of Ulrich Regensberg, also used as part of a wall construction in the Oetenbach monastery and dated to 1290/1300, and the endowment inscription of about 1302 in the Zw\u00f6lfbotenkapelle of Grossm\u00fcnster, as well as the murals in the Grimmenturm, which arose before 1307. In the arrangement of the inscription is particularly noteworthy of short, on three lines distributed text, the absence of the date and the absence of a peripheral edge inscription, as well as the simple cross. The seven-leaved rosette is not released. Related to the classification of the piece in the eastern Switzerland epigraphy, it is the oldest surviving piece of this kind, and the oldest surviving grave plate in Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n=== Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich \u2212 Central Library ===\n\nThe abbey\u2212choir building had been used for secular purposes since the 16th century Protestant Reformation, and was transformed by the installation of shelves into a warehouse building. For several centuries it was used as a granary. Since 1914 the choir building has been administrated by the Zentralbibliothek (Z\u00fcrich central library), the main library of both the canton, city and the University of Z\u00fcrich. From 1919 to 1982 it also housed the Staatsarchiv Z\u00fcrich (state archives of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich), before they moved to the Irchelpark campus of the University of Z\u00fcrich.The Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich (literally Z\u00fcrich Central Library) in the Predigern's choir passed over from the church to the University of Z\u00fcrich to the \"agreed plans for library purposes\" according to the \"treaty between the Canton of Z\u00fcrich and the City of Z\u00fcrich regarding the establishment of a Central Library, from 10 December 1910\". On 28 June 1914, the citizens of Z\u00fcrich agreed to the establishment of the Zentralbibliothek, that was according to the plans by Hermann Fietz was built between 1914 and 1917, situated at the former site of the old monastery buildings. Because the wooden shelves were seen as a security risk, they were replaced in 1918/19 by a concrete construction, though already at that time there were objections against this plan. The book magazine built on the place of the old cloister, now directly connected to the Gothic choir and making the 1871 exemption for the time being reversed. From 1917 to 1919, the final transformation of the choir to library purposes took place, and in 1919 the choir was leased to the Canton of Z\u00fcrich, and so the cantonal library was outsourced, however in 1919 moved back and again moved, to make room for the as of today Staatsarchiv des Kantons Z\u00fcrich. Therefore, since 1982 the premise is used for the library, in particular for its Musikabteilung, meaning the music department of the University of Z\u00fcrich.\nBy the cantonal Hochbauamt (literally: building construction departement) the construction works were performed in the Prediger choir in March 1941, mainly in the roof of the choir, where in setting up a makeshift lighting, a medieval grave stone was discovered in the attic, which was walled up there. The door served until 1887 as access to the floor space of the church and the choir was associated with a raised staircase growing on the north side of the choir. The then burned down stair access to the administration building, was not rebuilt 1887. As a result, the doorway was isolated respectively obsolete, and therefore separated from the church with a 25 centimetres (10 in) thick brick wall. The grave plate was taken out by the Hochbaudepartement and placed in the reading room of the archives.\n\n\n=== Musikabteilung \u2212 Music Department ===\nSince 1914 the choir has been administrated by the Zentralbibliothek (Z\u00fcrich central library). Since 1996 the library's Musikabteilung (music collections department) has been located in the choir. The Musikabteilung was founded in 1971, as a scholarly music collection of European importance.\nIn addition to larger stocks of printed music and sound recordings, it compromises one of the largest Wagnerian collections in the world, and has become a major repository of Swiss music manuscripts. The collection includes around 180 legacies of deceased composers, musicians, and musicologists. It also houses corporate archives and historical library collections of important music institutions such as the Opernhaus Z\u00fcrich, the Konzerthalle concert hall, the Z\u00fcrich conservatory, and the Allgemeine Musikgesellschaft (AMG) record label.\nThe music department publishes the materials in its collections periodically as CDs and online. The repertoire ranges from early 16th-century spiritual music of Huldrych Zwingli's 15th century to the late 20th century. The music collection is released under the label \"Musik aus der Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich\", as well as  \"Mittagsmusik im Predigerchor\" for the Predigerkirche pipe organ concert series recordings.\n\n\n== Cultural Heritage ==\nThe Predigerkirche church building and adjoining abbey\u2212choir building are listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A properties of national significance.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nD\u00f6lf Wild, Urs J\u00e4ggin, Felix Wyss: Die Z\u00fcrcher Predigerkirche \u2013 Wichtige Etappen der Baugeschichte.

        "wiki": "The Uetliberg  (also known as \u00dcetliberg) is a mountain in the Swiss plateau, part of the Albis chain, rising to 870 m (2,850 ft). The mountain offers a panoramic view of the entire city of Z\u00fcrich and the Lake of Zurich, and lies on the boundary between the city of Z\u00fcrich and the municipalities of Stallikon and Uitikon. The summit, known as Uto Kulm, is in Stallikon.At the summit, there is the Hotel Uto Kulm, together with two towers. One of these is a look-out tower (access costs CHF 5, rebuilt 1990), whilst the other is the Uetliberg TV-tower (186 m, rebuilt 1990). \nThe summit is easily accessible by train from Z\u00fcrich. Uetliberg railway station lies some 812 m (2,664 ft) from, and 68 m (223 ft) below, the summit of the Uetliberg. It is the terminus of the Uetliberg line, and is linked to Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof by S-Bahn Z\u00fcrich service S10. Trains usually run every half-hour, taking 20 minutes.\nThere are numerous walking paths leading up to the top from Albisg\u00fcetli, Triemli or Albisrieden with frequent water fountains and camping spots. Uetliberg also has a downhill mountain bike track which starts in the camping area at the top of the mountain and finishes next to Triemli railway station, also served by the S10. A panoramic footpath leads along the crest of the Albis ridge to Felsenegg, from where the Adliswil-Felsenegg cable car connects to Adliswil and the S4 S-Bahn service in the valley below.\nThe Uetliberg gives its name to the Z\u00fcrich-based Uto section of the Swiss Alpine Club, and hence to the Uto Peak in the Selkirk Mountains of Canada, which was first climbed by members of the Uto section.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nOppidum Uetliberg\nList of mountains of Switzerland accessible by public transport\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Uetliberg at Wikimedia Commons",

Mountain biking is also common. Please use the marked MTB roads and watch out for hiker! Hiking and running offers many",

          "It's a great picnic spot for people who do not like all the hassle of a big city. It is easily accessible through train from metro. If you have Zurich pass, you can travel for free. And the view of the countryside is breathtaking. I visited there in the month of June and it was",

After a quick lunch with a view at the kiosk (not cheap, but they do have a captive market!), I headed",

          "The train ride up to the Uetliberg station is quick and very easy, probably about 30 minutes each way. Once you get there, there's a small hike up the mountain. It's not too difficult and is only about 5 - 10 minutes. Once you get to the top, there's a viewing area, the TV tower",
          "This is a good day out. Our niece and nephew were visiting us and we took them here. There are a few ways to get here. We took the train from Zurich main station. This gets you very close to the top. There are a few hundred metres to walk from the station. It's uphill, but not",
          "The view from the top is just amazing. If the air is dry and clean, you can easily see the Alps behind Z\u00fcrich lake, and of course Z\u00fcrich itself. Absolutely stunning. Train service is very efficient (as usual in Switzerland).",
          "Very good way to spent a sunday. Was easy to reach with 13tram. The up hiking required some strenghts, but all is doable. Many children and seniors go the same path. Day was full of clouds on lake and Zurich, thus nothing competed with beautiful views to Alps!",
          "Easily reachable by train and a short walk the \u00dcetliberg offers the best view onto Zurich and if weather permits the alps. On good days one can even see the notorious mountain trio Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau. The tower is cool and free, the restaurant not so much.",
          "A short (20 minutes) train ride to Uetliberg followed by a short walk will give you great views of the city of Zurich, Zurich lake and countryside some 1,000m high. Enjoy lunch or just drinks at the hotel at the peak. Avoid going if cloudy or foggy. Highly recommended.",
          "I have two things to add to the other reviews. One is some clarity about the path to the viewing tower. After you exit the train, head away from the station and either go up the stairs or take the road (they lead to the same place). I thought this was a little confusing at first",
          "From the Zurich HB it is about a 25 minute trip (usually leaves on track 21/22). The price is included on a ZurichCard. Great views from the Uetilberg stop. However take the extra 10-15 minute walk to Oto Kulm. The views from there (and the viewing platform even further up)",

          "You can see the masts and viewing platform from anywhere in Zurich. Take the S10 train from the main station. Trains to the top go every half hour in the week and three times an hour at the weekends. You will need to walk about ten minutes to the very top where you can view",

          "So close to Zurich, this is a great little taste of the mountains if you can't get any further out of town. Right at the top is a sitting area and an expensive restaurant. You can of course bring your own picnic. The train runs almost to the top so if you have mobility issues or",
          "I'll try to add to others recent comments: If, like me, you like to have a good spatial perspective on things, including about the entire northeast 1/4 of Switzerland, where Zurich is located in relation to key geological features, and how the town is laid out in relation to the",
          "From Uetliberg theres a beautiful unobstructed view of Z\u00fcrich and Lake Z\u00fcrich and it is just amazing. They were doing construction on the train lines there, so we were dropped of a bit further down the mountain and the walk could be grueling if youre a bad walker as it is uphill",

          "You would have climbed a lot of hills to see the view but have you done it with a train that stops at small stations where people can just board it from right outside their homes to go up the hill when the weather is lovely? It was such a lovely journey with the train also",
          "Here you have a nice trip! You take the small train up the hill, walk a little (5 min) and have an overwhelming view all over the city and the lake of Zurich. There is also a tower to climb, to have an even better sight to all directions. Beautiful! Beside is a restaurant",
          "A short but somewhat vertical train ride from the Bahnhof and you reach Uetilberg, a lookout with spectacular panoramic views of both the city and surrounding towns and rolling hills. There is a hotel with al fresco restaurant up there serving some fantastic looking dishes with",

        "wiki": "Quaianalagen (German, plural; English: quays, or quaysides; from French: des quais) or Seeuferanlagen (German, plural for lakeshore sites) on Lake Z\u00fcrich (German: Z\u00fcrichsee) is a series of lakefronts in Z\u00fcrich. Inaugurated in 1887, the quaysides are considered an important milestone in the development of Z\u00fcrich. The construction of the lake fronts transformed the medieval small town on the rivers Limmat and Sihl to a modern city on the Lake Z\u00fcrich shore. The project was managed by engineer Arnold B\u00fcrkli.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe quays are situated in the districts of Enge, Seefeld and Wollishofen at the lower Lake Z\u00fcrich shore within the city of Z\u00fcrich.  The complete construction includes, among others, the central B\u00fcrkliplatz on the outflow of the Lake Z\u00fcrich, and (from west to east coast) Saffa-Insel, Strandbad Mythenquai, Belvoirpark, Mythenquai, Arboretum, General-Guisan-Quai, Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz, Utoquai, Seebad Utoquai, Seefeldquai, Riesbach Harbour, Centre Le Corbusier, Blatterwiese, Chinagarten, Z\u00fcrichhorn and Strandbad Tiefenbrunnen.The lower lake basin  also houses four of the huge Prehistoric pile dwellings around Lake Z\u00fcrich of the transnational 111 serial sites. The majority of the important sites of the Horgen culture are situated on lakeshore, including: Grosser Hafner on a former lake island; Kleiner Hafner on a peninsula at Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz, at the outflow of the Lake Z\u00fcrich; and Alpenquai, located within an area of about 0.2 hectares (0.49 acres) in the city of Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n== Further points of interests ==\n\n\n=== Blatterwiese ===\nBlatterwiese is a wide and popular neighborhood meadow situated between Seefeldquai and Z\u00fcrichhorn, established in 1839 as a fabrication area, and since then also used as on open public lido. In 1926, the city government acquired the land and broke down the factory building. In 1939, it was the site of the Swiss National Exhibition Landi39, and was also used for the G59 exhibition in 1959. After the horticultural exhibition, the open parkland was taken over by the city government and transformed to a large playground. Between Blatterwiese and Bellerivestrasse, in 1993, the Chinese Garden Z\u00fcrich was inaugurated. The new Spielplatz Blatterwiese began construction in October 2006 and opened in June 2007. Coordinated with the transformation of the adjacent playground, the former partially underground cable car station of the G59 exhibition was rebuilt with a Z\u00fcriWC public toilet. The Centre Le Corbusier (or Heidi Weber Museum), an art museum dedicated to the work of the Swiss architect Le Corbusier, is situated opposite of the playground.\n\n\n=== General-Guisan-Quai ===\nThe Alpenquai on the left bank \u2013 renamed General-Guisan-Quai after Henri Guisan in 1960 \u2013 was created as a terrace-like promenade for the urban population, and four rows of trees were planted. On occasion of the renovation in 2003, the 20th century asphalt-covered surfaces were restored to the original gravel pathways. The original trees, three rows of double-flowered Aesculus hippocastanum Baumannii significantly characterize the appearance of the place. To maintain the same basket-like crown as the elderly chestnut, the young trees are capped at their historical model of the main trunk, the runners are moved to the desired quirl-like crown. In combination with the intervening series of trumpet trees of the species Catalpa bignonioides and Catalpa ovata, the image of a compact roof tree is achieved.Works of art from three generations adorn this path segment: the sculpture of Ganymede by Hermann Hubacher (1959) on the so-called B\u00fcrkliterrasse (named after Arnold B\u00fcrkli) at Quaibr\u00fccke\u2009; the fountain bowl of pink concrete by Christoph Haerle (2003, popularly known as female Ganymede); and the mosaic fountain by Alfred F. Bluntschli (1903) to the east at the Arobetum.\n\n\n=== Hafen Enge ===\nThe Hafen Enge, meaning the harbour area in Enge, is situated between the Arboretum and Strandbad Mythenquai. The harbour itself is used as a private-owned marina. There is a restaurant, Quai61, and a very popular snack bar at the parking facility adjoining the Arboretum, also housing a Z\u00fcriWC. The harbour is in three sections, beginning at the Arboretum. At the parking facility and towards the Mythenquai there are four boathouses, typically for members; on the parking facility at the Mythenquai lido, it is permitted to park private boats in the winter season. The most popular sculpture there is the so-called Z\u00fcri-Leu, a colossal statue of a lion (renewed in 2013), situated at the publicly accessible wave-breaker.\n\n\n=== Hafen Riesbach ===\nThe Hafen Riesbach, or Riesbach harbour area, is situated between Seefeldquai and Blatterwiese. The harbour is used as a private-owned marina. In 2004, the old kiosk at the popular open lido at Riesbachstrasse was replaced by a building with a windowed face. The new polygonal pavilion was designed by the architects Andreas Furrimann and Gabrielle H\u00e4chler, and now houses a small restaurant and an annexed Z\u00fcriWC public toilet. The colour of the windows is reflected by the surroundings, and the pavilion is illuminated in the evening hours. The original seawall front is 200 metres (656 ft) long, and was renovated in 2003 and 2006 but not fully renewed due to risk of collapse; thus the natural stone dry wall was rebuilt in the same way. The Seefeldquai is an important milestone in the work of the landscape architect Willi Neukom, as it combines park designs from different design periods. The stone pillar Klausstud originally stood in the lake and served as a border designation of the medieval right of bann (boundary) of the city republic of Z\u00fcrich. It marked where fishing rights of the urban fishermen ended, and from here the  Einsiedeln Abbey pilgrims proved their honour to the Protestant city by lowering the volume of their prayers and songs. Since the landfills in the construction of the quais, the pillar stands in the middle of the park. The sculpture by Henry Moore is named Sheep Peace, and was donated in 1976.\n\n\n=== Landiwiese ===\nNamed after the Landi39 exhibition, various public events continue to be held here. These include the camp of the Circus Knie when it stages at Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz, numerous youth events, Z\u00fcrcher Theater Spektakel, the SAFFA (Swiss Exhibition for Women's Work) in 1958, and the popular artificial island Saffa-Insel that is connected by a small bridge for thousands of people who like to swim or have fun there. Landiwiese includes a large open meadow with a smaller hard court for sports, and is home to valuable old trees. The festival site is part of the last replenishment on the left lake shore; in 1939, it was named for the Swiss National Exhibition (Landesausstellung), and expanded to its present size. M\u00e4dchen mit erhobenen H\u00e4nden is the most remarkable sculpture at the area; a work of Hermann Haller, created in 1939.\n\n\n=== Mythenquai ===\nOtto C. Banninger's Gottfried Keller memorial (1964) is situated at the Wabengarten, a honeycomb water installation, one of the few relics of the 1959 garden exhibition, G59. It had been constructed for a temporary exhibition, so reductions for bad foundations and water loss occurred in the less-dense pools. A few steps from the shore there's another rare plant in Z\u00fcrich, Taxodium distichum having pneumatophores, originating from Mississippi River up to Missouri. At the marina, Alnus glutinosa were planted after the flood of May 1999, and because the high water table in the vicinity of the lake gets better than their commitments, a group of Paulownia tomentosa. In 2004 the city council (Stadtrat, Z\u00fcrich's executive organ) decided to develop a master plan for this area of the lakeside promenades. Because the adjacent lake police (Wasserschutzpolizei der Stadt Z\u00fcrich) planned a new building, and the public access to Mythenquai had to be reorganized, a general upgrading and redevelopment of the whole area was planned, extending to the parking facilities and Strandbad Mythenquai, Z\u00fcrich's only sand-beach lido.\n\n\n=== Seefeldquai ===\nThe Seefeldquai consists of the popular and historic promenade between Utoquai and Feldeggstrasse at the lakeside environment of the 1970s, leading to Lindenstrasse, opposite of the Mythenquai. It is the southernly extension of the long promenades from Utoquai, having a mix of beaches with sand and gravel areas. Due to fluctuations in the water level, some shore sections had to be secured with boulders. The upright stone pillar Klausstud, named after Saint Nicholas, was the former Bann (boundary) of the medieval city of Z\u00fcrich, situated near the Riesbach harbour. The 1864-built bathhouse was closed in 1887, but as a substitute of the former Riesbach local authorities approved the construction of two new baths, Strandbad Tiefenbrunnen and Seebad Utoquai. From 1975 to 1977, the waterfront between Feldeggstrasse and Lindenstrasse was redesigned by the landscape architect Willi Neukom. The park was designed with pools, hills and sandstone blocks, and smooth transitions to the private property in the present Seefeld district. The curved routing at the Utoquai roadway, one of the busiest in Z\u00fcrich, has been set in deliberate contrast to the orthogonal orientation of the paths towards Z\u00fcrichhorn and Blatterwiese, and was paved with period-typical hexagonal stones. The trees have been integrated into the new design and supplemented with unusual flora, such as beech and hanging pyramidal elms, rhododendrons and azaleas, additional shrub and rose plantings, irises, grasses, and bamboo. In 1999, it was replaced by a more transparent planting, and in 2007, the park area was again upgraded with rose plants.\n\n\n=== Utoquai ===\nThe Utoquai is situated between the effluence of the river Limmat and Bellevueplatz (respectively the Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz (Kleiner Hafner) squares), with the Seefeldquai adjoining to the southeast. The promenade was built in 1887 and planted with chestnut trees as a lawn towards the Seebad Utoquai. It was formed as a high seawall with a wrought iron railing, and small stairs leading to the lake's shore. Traffic planners urged a masterplan be developed in the 1960s, which called for the adjacent Bellerivestrasse to be broadened due to the rapidly growing road traffic. The historic lakeside promenade was to be shifted, and construction implemented in 1971 effected a new promenade on concrete piles directly above the water level. However, the project plans were not fully realized, and the waterside path of the 1970s became an additional part of the existing promenades, preserving the chestnut trees of 1887 and resulting in the present, wide promenade. In 2006, the historic seawall was renewed, and the Utoquai's design is now of different time periods. As the old bathhouse had to make place for the construction, the then-independent municipality Riesbach built two new bathing facilities: Strandbad Tiefenbrunnen (1886) and Seebad Utoquai (1890). The latter was a \"bathing palace\" on stilts with delicate, tower-like structures in the Moorish style. For the first time in Z\u00fcrich, it was permitted for men and women to bathe in the same place. In 1942, the towering domes were enhanced by the construction of wooden sun terraces, and the basic structure of the original bathing room is still preserved. The Utoquai figures in Inventar der sch\u00fctzenswerten G\u00e4rten und Anlagen von kommunaler Bedeutung, being the inventory of estimable gardens and grounds of local importance that was established in 1989.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe site of the former Kratzquartier accommodation and Bauhaus district at the Bausch\u00e4nzli (today's Stadthausanlage) was extended in 1833 by landfill with rubble of the baroque city fortification along the lake shore. This also marked the end of the medieval Kratzquartier as the distinctive urban axis, extending from Zentralhof, Kappelerhof, and M\u00fcnsterhof towards the B\u00fcrkliterrasse, once home to the underprivileged citizens of Z\u00fcrich. The medieval quarter had been thoroughly overhauled between 1836 and 1900, and was entirely demolished for the purpose of building a modern lakeshore city.The population welcomed the decision of the city of Z\u00fcrich and the independent municipalities of Enge and Riesbach to construct the planned lakeside promenades on 4 September 1881. The project, which comprised the whole lower lake basin by the Z\u00fcrichhorn close to the Enge port, was a considerable financial risk for the three communities that were involved. Smart financing models and the \"unwavering optimism of the early years brilliantly mastered this challenge\".The large-scale land reclamation works began in the area of Utoquai in the 1860s, requiring a total of 24.1 million cubic meters (850 million cu ft) of stone material and lake mud for an area of about 200,000 square metres (49 acres). This was brought in by ship and introduced by machines specially designed for this purpose. The typical procedure was to construct a breakwater and then backfill it with less-stable lake marl. Railway construction and excavations of tunnels and cuts in Riesbach also provided material, and municipalities and private organizations were invited to deposit rubble, being compensated for large quantities.Arnold B\u00fcrkli-Ziegler gave up his position as city engineer to be the chief engineer and coordinator of the project. The construction work began in late 1881, with plans to present parts of the quays at the Swiss national exhibition of 1883. But the whole coastal zone had to be transformed in a time-consuming and costly process in public ownership. Previously, nearly the entire lake area was inaccessible to the public, as the shore land belonged to private owners.  A comtemorary commented: \"Z\u00fcrich had a lake, but it [the city] did not see it, and his position [for the public] was almost a secret.\"The inauguration was held in July 1887, and Quaibr\u00fccke became the link between the left (Limmat downstream or southerly) and right side of the lake. The elegant promenade of Utoquai, B\u00fcrkliterrasse (Alpenquai), and the General-Guisan-Quai lined up on the right side of the lake. The Arboretum, as a spacious park facility, became the southerly connection towards Mythenquai and present Wollishofen.The Swiss National Exhibition in 1939 initiated the further extensions of the existing plan. A monorail was built between the two shores of the lake, but was taken down shortly after the exhibition. At Z\u00fcrichhorn, the popular tourist restaurant Casino Z\u00fcrichhorn was removed temporarily to provide space for the buildings of the exhibition, one of which was preserved as the Fischerstube restaurant. In the 1950s, on the fallow area between the railway station Tiefenbrunnen and Z\u00fcrichhorn, the Seebad Tiefenbrunnen lido was erected; in the 1960s, the new building of the restaurant Lakeside and the Centre Le Corbusier were built. As part of the horticultural exhibition 1959 (G59), Seefeldquai underwent important changes: the present natural embankment design in the English landscape style between Riesbach harbour and Z\u00fcrichhorn, the removal of nearly century-old trees, and the replacement of all embankments with sandstone slabs and stones. In the mid-1960s, at the height of the Riesbachstrasse harbour area, some owners sold their property at Seefeldquai; in its place emerged several corporate offices and the private clinic Seepyramyde. The last extension was the Chinagarten Z\u00fcrich at Z\u00fcrichhorn.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nGartenbiografien: Orte erz\u00e4hlen. vdf Hochschulverlag AG, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich 2013, ISBN 978-3-7281-3579-7.\nRoman G.

          "Perhaps we've been spoiled by Vegas, but this was an unremarkable casino. There's the usual step of showing your passport, but at least there was no fee to enter. The slots, mostly unthemed, are spread across multiple floors, and it was needlessly hot throughout the building.",
          "Very modern entrance, large. There is a lot of floor space here, but, not that many choices of machines. Almost looked like they just opened and were not up to speed. Was a way to waste some time, so, I did it!",

          "We visited the casino one night while staying in Zurich. We had Zurich cards, so we got in the casino free and 1 drink was included. Normally there is a $10 cover. This was just like a casino in the US. Same type of slots and tables. It was fun. Not at all crowded. Lots of fun.",

        "wiki": "The Mass No. 2 in E minor, WAB 27, by Anton Bruckner is a setting of the mass ordinary for eight-part mixed choir and fifteen wind instruments.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe bishop of Linz, Franz-Josef Rudigier, had already commissioned a Festive cantata from Bruckner in 1862 to celebrate the laying of the foundation stone of the new cathedral, the Maria-Empf\u00e4ngnis-Dom. In 1866, he asked Bruckner for a mass to celebrate the accomplishment of the construction of the Votive Chapel of the new cathedral. Because of a delay in completing the construction, the celebration of the dedication didn't take place until three years later, on 29 September 1869 on the Neuer Domplatz. The performers were the Liedertafel Frohsinn, the S\u00e4ngerbund and Musikverein of Linz, and the wind band of the k.k. Infanterieregiment 'Ernst Ludwig, Gro\u00dfherzog von Hessen und bei Rhein Nr. 14'. The manuscript and the Widmungspartitur are archived in the episcopate of Linz.Bruckner subjected the work to far-reaching revision in 1869, 1876, and 1882. The second version of 1882 was performed on 4 October 1885 in the Alter Dom, Linz by the Liedertafel Frohsinn, the S\u00e4ngerbund and Musikverein of Linz under the baton of Adalbert Schreyer.\n\n\n== Versions and editions ==\nTwo versions of the mass are available:\n\nVersion 1 of 1866, issued by Nowak in 1977\nVersion 2 of 1882\nFirst edition (Doblinger, 1896), revised by Franz Schalk\nHaas edition (1940, 1949)\nNowak edition (1959)The second version is slightly (26-bar) longer: 753 versus 727 bars. The differences among the two versions concern as well the phrasing as the accompaniment, mainly during the Credo and the Benedictus. As for the symphonies, the first version constitutes the raw material and sounds less polished, mainly during the orchestral transitions, than the later version. The about 150 differences among the two versions are described in detail at the end of the score of the 1882 version.\n\n\n== Setting ==\n\nThe piece is composed for eight-part mixed choir and wind instruments (2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets and 3 trombones).It is based strongly on old-church music tradition, and particularly old Gregorian style singing. The Kyrie is almost entirely made up of a cappella singing for eight voices. The Gloria ends with a fugue, as in Bruckner's other masses. In the Sanctus, Bruckner uses a theme from Palestrina's Missa Brevis.\nAccording to the Catholic practice \u2013 as also in Bruckner\u2019s preceding Messe f\u00fcr den Gr\u00fcndonnerstag, Missa solemnis and Mass No. 1 \u2013 the first verse of the Gloria and the Credo is not composed and has to be intoned by the priest in Gregorian mode before the choir goes on.\nThe setting is divided into six parts.\n\nKyrie \u2013 Ruhig Sostenuto, E minor\nGloria \u2013 Allegro, C major\nCredo \u2013 Allegro, C major\nSanctus \u2013 Andante, G major\nBenedictus \u2013 Moderato, C major\nAgnus Dei \u2013 Andante, E minor veering to E majorTotal duration: about 40 minutes\nPreviously Bruckner had been criticized for \"simply writing symphonies with liturgical text,\" and although the Cecilians were not entirely happy with the inclusion of wind instruments, \"Franz Xaver Witt loved it, no doubt rationalizing the use of wind instruments as necessary under the circumstances of outdoor performance for which Bruckner wrote the piece.\"The Mass in E minor ... is a work without parallel in either 19th- or 20th-century church music. \u2026 Even as Bishop Rudigier was laying the foundation stone for a new cathedral, Bruckner too was beginning to raise a cathedral in music.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\n\n\n=== Version 1 (1866) ===\nThere is only one recording of a music-school performance:\nHans Hauseither, choir and instrumental ensemble of the BORG Wien 1 - CD: issue of the BORG, 1996A live-performance by Hans-Christoph Rademann with the RIAS Choir (23 June 2013) is put in the Bruckner archive (CD - Charter Oak COR-1904).\n\n\n=== Version 2 (1882) ===\nAbout 100 recordings of Bruckner's Mass No. 2 have been issued. The first recording of the mass was by Hermann Odermatt with the Gregorius-Chor and Orchester der Liebfrauenkirche, Z\u00fcrich in 1930 (78 rpm Christschall 37-41).\nOf the recordings from the LP era, Eugen Jochum's recording with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus on Deutsche Grammophon has been remastered to CD. Matthew Best's more recent recording with the Corydon Singers has been critically acclaimed. Other excellent recordings, according to Hans Roelofs, are i.a. those by Roger Norrington, Hellmut Wormsb\u00e4cher, Philippe Herreweghe, Simon Halsey, Frieder Bernius, Ingemar M\u00e5nsson, Helmuth Rilling, Marcus Creed, Winfried Toll and Otto Kargl.\n\nEugen Jochum, choir and members of the Sinfonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, LP: DG 2530 139, 1971 \u2013 CD: DG 423 127-2 (Box set of 4 CD)\nRoger Norrington, Sch\u00fctz Choir London, Philip Jones Wind Ensemble \u2013 CD: London/Decca 430365, 1973\nHellmut Wormsb\u00e4cher, Bergedorfer Kammerchor, members of the Philharmonischen Staatsorchester Hamburg, LP: Telefunken 6.41297, c.\u20091973 (with Schubert's Deutsche Messe); reissued on CD by the choir\nMatthew Best, Corydon Singers and English Chamber Orchestra Wind Ensemble, CD: Hyperion CDA 66177, 1985\nPhilippe Herreweghe, Collegium Vocale Gent & Chapelle Royale Paris, Ensemble Musique oblique, CD: Harmonia Mundi France HMC 901322, 1989\nSimon Halsey, CBSO Wind Ensemble & Chorus, Mass in E minor (No. 2) / Motets \u2013 CD: Conifer CDCF 192, 1990\nFrieder Bernius, Kammerchor Stuttgart & Deutsche Bl\u00e4serphilharmonie - CD: Sony Classical SK 48037, 1991\nIngemar M\u00e5nsson, H\u00e4gersten Motet Choir, ad hoc orchestra, Poulenc, Bruckner \u2013 CD: Caprice CAP 21420, 1991\nHelmuth Rilling, G\u00e4chinger Kantorei and Bach-Collegium Stuttgart, 1996 \u2013 CD: H\u00e4nssler 98.119 (with Te Deum and Psalm 150)\nMarcus Creed, SWR Vokalensemble Stuttgart, Mitglieder des Radio-Sinfonieorchesters Stuttgart des SWR, Anton Bruckner \u2013 Mass in E minor - Motets \u2013 CD: H\u00e4nssler Classic SACD 93.199, 2007\nWinfried Toll, Camerata Vocale Freiburg, brass players of L'arpa festante, CD: Ars Musici 232828, 2008\nOtto Kargl, Domkantorei St. P\u00f6lten, Cappella Nova Graz and Blechbl\u00e4serensemble \u2013 CD: ORF CD 3174, 2013\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAnton Bruckner, S\u00e4mtliche Werke, Kritische Gesamtausgabe \u2013 Band 13: Messe e-Moll (Fassung 1882), Musikwissenschaftlicher Verlag, Robert Haas (Editor), Leipzig, 1940\nAnton Bruckner: S\u00e4mtliche Werke: Band XVII: Messe e-Moll (1866-1882), Musikwissenschaftlicher Verlag der Internationalen Bruckner-Gesellschaft, Leopold Nowak (Editor), Vienna\nXVII/1: 1.

        "wiki": "The Citadel of Qaitbay (or the Fort of Qaitbay; Arabic: \u0642\u0644\u0639\u0629 \u0642\u0627\u064a\u062a\u0628\u0627\u064a\u200e) is a 15th-century defensive fortress located on the Mediterranean sea coast, in Alexandria, Egypt. It was established in 1477 AD (882 AH) by Sultan Al-Ashraf Sayf al-Din Qa'it Bay. The Citadel is situated on the eastern side of the northern tip of Pharos Island at the mouth of the Eastern Harbour.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Qaitbay Citadel in Alexandria is considered one of the most important defensive strongholds, not only in Egypt, but also along the Mediterranean Sea coast. It formulated an important part of the fortification system of Alexandria in the 15th century AD.\n\n\n=== Lighthouse of Alexandria ===\nThe Citadel is situated at the entrance of the eastern harbour on the eastern point of the Pharos Island. It was erected on the exact site of the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The lighthouse continued to function until the time of the Arab conquest, then several disasters occurred and the shape of the lighthouse was changed to some extent, but it still continued to function. Restoration began in the period of Ahmed Ibn Tulun (about 880 AD). During the 11th century an earthquake occurred, causing damage to the octagonal part. The bottom survived, but it could only serve as a watchtower, and a small mosque was built on the top. In the 14th century there was a very destructive earthquake and the whole building was completely destroyed.\n\n\n=== 15th-century fortifications ===\nAbout 1480 AD, the Circassian Mameluke Sultan Al-Ashraf Qaitbay fortified the place as part of his coastal defensive edifices against the Turks, who were threatening Egypt at that time. He built the fortress and placed a mosque inside it. The Citadel continued to function during most of the Mameluke period, the Ottoman period and the Modern period, but after the British bombardment of Alexandria in 1882, it was kept out of the spotlight. It became neglected until the 20th century, when it was restored several times by the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities.\nThe founder of the Citadel of Qaitbay is a Circassian Sultan named Al-Ashraf Abou Anasr Saif El-Din Qaitbay El-Jerkasy Al-Zahiry (1468\u20131496 AD) who was born about 1423 AD (826 AH). He was a Mamluke who had come to Egypt as a young man, less than 20 years old. Bought by Al-Ashraf Bersbay, he remained among his attendants until Al-Ashraf Bersbay died. Then the Sultan Jaqmaq bought Qaitbay, and later gave him his freedom. Qaitbay then went on to occupy various posts. He became the Chief of the Army (Atabec Al-Askar) during the rule of the Sultan Timurbugha. When the Sultan was dethroned, Qaitbay was appointed as a Sultan who was titled Almalek Al-Ashraf on Monday 26th Ragab, 872 AH (1468 AD). He was one of the most important and prominent Mameluke Sultans, ruling for about 29 years. He was a brave king, who tried to initiate a new era with the Ottomans by exchanging embassies and gifts. He was fond of travel and made many prominent journeys.\n\n\n=== The edifice's mason ===\nQaitbay was so fond of art and architecture that he created an important post among the administrative system of the state; it was the Edifices Mason (Shady Al-Ama'er). He built many beneficial constructions in Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem. In Egypt there are about 70 renovated edifices attributed to him, among them are Mosques, Madrasas, Agencies, Fountain houses (Sabils), Kuttabs, houses, military edifices like the Citadels in Alexandria and Rosetta (Nowadays the city of Rashid). These Citadels were built to protect the north of Egypt, mainly against the Ottomans, whose power was increasing in the Mediterranean.\nQagmas Al-Eshaqy, The Edifices Mason, was the architect of the Citadel. Before his arrival in Egypt he was a Mameluke of Djakmaq in Syria. During the rule of Qaitbay he became the edifices mason, and then the Viceroy of Alexandria. He was appointed governor of Syria (Damascus), built a Mosque outside the gate of Rashid (Bab Rashid) as well as a Cenotaph and a Khan. He also renovated the Mosque of El-Sawary outside the gate of Sadrah (Bab Sadrah).\nQagmas was intelligent and modest, as well as the overseer of many constructions during the time of Qaitbay. In 882 AH (1477 AD) the Sultan Qaitbay visited the site of the old lighthouse in Alexandria and ordered a fortress to be built on its foundations. The construction lasted about 2 years, and it is said that Qaitbay spent more than a hundred thousand gold dinars for the work on the Citadel.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nIbn Ayas mentioned that building of this fort started in the month of Rabi Alawal 882 H. He said that the Sultan Qaitbay travelled to Alexandria, accompanied with some other Mameluke princes, to visit the site of the old lighthouse and during this visit he ordered the building of the Citadel.\nIn the month of Shaban 884 H, the Sultan Qaitbay travelled again to Alexandria when the construction was finished. He provided the fort with a brave legion of soldiers and various weapons. He also, as Ibn Ayas mentioned, dedicated several waqfs from which he financed the construction works as well as the salaries of the soldiers.\nThroughout the Mameluke period, and due to its strategic location, the Citadel was well maintained by all the rulers who came after Qaitbay.\n]\n\n\n=== Strengthening of the garrison ===\nThe Sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri gave the Citadel special attention. He visited it several times and increased the strength of the garrison, providing it with various weapons and equipment. It included a large prison made for the princes and the state-men whom the Sultan kept away from his favour for some reason. In the episodes of the year 920 H, Qansuh Al-Ghouri travelled to Alexandria with other princes.\n\n\n=== Approach of the Ottoman threat ===\n\nThey went to the Citadel of Qaitbay where he watched some manoeuvres and military training on the defensive weapons of the Citadel of that era. When he felt the approach of the Ottoman threat, he issued a military decree to forbid weapons to be taken out of the Citadel, he even announced that the death penalty would be the punishment to those who try to steal anything from the Citadel, and he ordered the inscription of this decree on a marble slate fixed to the door leading the court. It says: b-ismi-ll\u0101hi r-ra\u1e25m\u0101ni r-ra\u1e25\u012bmi \u0628\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0645\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0652\u0645\u0670\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0645\u0650 \"In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\".\n\n\"A decree by the order of our master, the noble rank, King Al-Ashraf Abou El-Naser Qansoh El-Ghoury, May God eternalise his reign, that no body should take Makahel weapon, gun powder, tools, or any other thing from the noble tower in Alexandria: and any one of the tower party, whether Mameluke, Slaves or Zarad Kashia, who breaks this (decree) and leaves the tower with something will be hanged at the gate of the tower, deserving the curse of God.\" Dated Rabei Alawal 907 H.\nAfter the Ottoman Turks had conquered Egypt, even they cared for this unique Citadel. They used it for shelter, as they had done with the Citadel of Saladin in Cairo and the Citadels of Damietta, Rosetta, Al Borollos and El-Arish. They kept it in good condition and stationed it with infantry, artillery, a company of drummers and trumpeters, masons and carpenters.\n\n\n=== The Ottoman threat recedes ===\n\nAs the Ottoman military became weak, the Citadel began to lose its military importance. In 1798 AD, during the French expedition of Egypt, it fell into the hands of the French troops, mainly because of the weakness of the Citadel garrison, and the power of the French modern weapons at that time. Inside, the French found some crusader weapons, which dated back to the campaign of Louis IX. These may have been spoils from the Battle of Al Mansurah.\n\n\n=== 19th-century renovation ===\n\nWhen Muhammad Ali Pasha became the ruler of Egypt in 1805, he renovated the old Citadel, restoring and repairing its outer ramparts, and he provided the stronghold with the most modern weapons of the period, particularly the littoral cannons. We can consider the reign of Mohammed Ali as being another golden era for the Citadel.\n\n\n=== The Orabi revolt ===\nThe Citadel retained the interest of Mohammed Ali's successors until the year 1882 when the Orabi Revolt took place. The British fleet bombarded Alexandria on 11 July 1882 and damaged a large part of the city, especially in the area of the Citadel. This attack cracked the fortress, causing great damage. The north and western facades were severely damaged as a result of cannon explosions, aimed directly at the structure. The western facade was completely destroyed, leaving large gaps in it.\n\n\n=== 20th-century renovation ===\nThe Citadel then remained neglected, until 1904 when the Ministry of Defence restored the Upper floors. King Farouk wanted to turn the Citadel into a royal rest house so he ordered a rapid renovation on it.\nAfter the revolution of 1952 the Egyptian Naval troops turned the building into a Maritime Museum. The biggest restoration work dates to 1984, when the Egyptian Antiquities Organization made ambitious plans to restore the fort.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFort Julien, a fortification at Rosetta also built by Qaitbay\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Citadel of Qaitbay at Wikimedia Commons\nQaitbay Citadel photo gallery",

It was built on a low plateau east of central Alexandria overlooking a beach on the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe extensive Montaza Palace grounds first had the Salamlek Palace, built in 1892 by Khedive Abbas II, the last Muhammad Ali Dynasty ruler to hold the Khedive title over the Khedivate of Egypt and Sudan. It was used as a hunting lodge and residence for his companion.The larger Al-Haramlik Palace and royal gardens were added to the Montaza Palace grounds, being built by King Fuad I in 1932, as a summer palace. It is in a mixture of Ottoman and Florentine styles, with two towers. One of these towers rises distinctively high above with elaborated Italian Renaissance design details. The palace has long open arcades facing the sea along each floor.\nPresident Anwar El-Sadat renovated the original Salamlek Palace as an official presidential residence.  It was most recently used by former president Hosni Mubarak.\n\n\n== Public access ==\n\nThe Al-Montaza Park, the former expansive royal gardens of 150 acres (61 ha), are open as a public landscape park and forest reserve.\nThe Al-Haramlik\u2014Montaza Palace is a public museum of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty family history and objects d'art. The Salamlek Palace is now an adjacent hotel.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRas Al Teen Palace\nRoyal Jewelry Museum \u2013 Fatma Al-Zahra Palace\nPalaces in Alexandria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThings to do in Alexandria: \"Montaza Palace\"\nMemphistours: The Montaza Palace royal gardens Park, Al-Haramlik Palace, and Salamlek Palace.",

It is located in the former palace of Princess Fatma Al-Zahra'. The building's halls contain an inestimable collection of jewels and jewelry of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty. 19th-century paintings, statues, and decorative arts are also exhibited in the rooms and lobbies. The museum was first inaugurated on 24 October 1986. After several years of renovations and expansion it was reopened in April 2010.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe museum houses major jewelry pieces and art acquisitions of the dynasty of Muhammad Ali and his descendants, who ruled Egypt for nearly 150 years from 1805 until the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Following the Revolution, the jewelry left by the Royal Family was kept secure and unseen until a 1986 decree by President Mubarak was issued to assign Princess Fatima Al-Zahra' Palace in Alexandria as a special museum to house those pieces.\n\n\n== Palace design ==\nThe palace was built in 1919. Its walls and ceilings are adorned with oil paintings depicting various historical scenes and natural scenery. The palace windows are decorated with lead-inlaid glass artwork also depicting European-style historical scenes. It has 4,185 square metres (45,050 sq ft) of interior space, and is surrounded by gardens.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKing of Egypt\nMuseums in Alexandria\nList of museums in Egypt\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Royal Jewelry Museum at Wikimedia Commons\n\nRoyal Jewelry Museum: anniversary information",

        "wiki": "The Lighthouse of Alexandria, sometimes called the Pharos of Alexandria (; Ancient Greek: \u1f41 \u03a6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f08\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, contemporary Koine Greek pronunciation: [ho p\u02b0\u00e1.ros t\u025b\u0302\u02d0s a.lek.sandr\u011b\u02d0a\u02d0s]), was a lighthouse built by the Ptolemaic Kingdom, during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (280\u2013247 BC), which has been estimated to be at least 100 metres (330 ft) in overall height. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, for many centuries it was one of the tallest man-made structures in the world.\nThe lighthouse was severely damaged by three earthquakes between 956 AD and 1323 and became an abandoned ruin. It was the third longest surviving ancient wonder (after the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and the extant Great Pyramid of Giza), surviving in part until 1480, when the last of its remnant stones were used to build the Citadel of Qaitbay on the site.\nIn 1994, a team of French archaeologists dove into the water of Alexandria's Eastern Harbour and discovered some remains of the lighthouse on the sea floor. In 2016 the Ministry of State of Antiquities in Egypt had plans to turn submerged ruins of ancient Alexandria, including those of the Pharos, into an underwater museum.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nPharos was a small island located on the western edge of the Nile Delta. In 332 BC Alexander the Great founded the city of Alexandria on an isthmus opposite Pharos. Alexandria and Pharos were later connected by a mole spanning more than 1,200 metres (0.75 miles), which was called the Heptastadion (\"seven stadia\"\u2014a stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180 m).\nThe east side of the mole became the Great Harbour, now an open bay; on the west side lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbour. Today's city development lying between the present Grand Square and the modern Ras el-Tin quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras el-Tin promontory, where Ras el-Tin Palace was built in the 19th century, represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the lighthouse at its eastern point having been weathered away by the sea.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe lighthouse was constructed in the 3rd century BC. After Alexander the Great died, the first Ptolemy (Ptolemy I Soter) declared himself king in 305 BC, and commissioned its construction shortly thereafter. The building was finished during the reign of his son, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, and took twelve years to complete at a total cost of 800 talents of silver. The light was produced by a furnace at the top, and the tower was said to have been built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. However, since the lighthouse was over 300 feet tall, the use of limestone as the main material is doubtful due to the possibility of collapsing under its own weight. Rather, pink granite found nearby is more probable, as it is much stronger and can withstand more weight.Strabo reported that Sostratus had a dedication to the \"Saviour Gods\" inscribed in metal letters on the lighthouse. Later Pliny the Elder wrote that Sostratus was the architect, which is disputed. In the second century AD Lucian wrote that Sostratus hid his name under plaster bearing the name of Ptolemy so that when the plaster fell off, Sostratus's name would be visible in the stone. Blocks of sandstone and limestone used in construction are analyzed to be from the Wadi Hammamat quarries in the desert east of the city.\n\n\n== Height and description ==\n\nArab descriptions of the lighthouse are consistent despite it undergoing several repairs after earthquake damage. Given heights vary only fifteen percent from c. 103 to 118 m (338 to 387 ft), on a 30 by 30 m (98 by 98 ft) square base.The fullest description of the lighthouse comes from Arab traveler Abou Haggag Youssef Ibn Mohammed el-Balawi el-Andaloussi, who visited Alexandria in 1166 AD. Balawi provided description and measurement of the interior of the lighthouse's rectangular shaft. The inner ramp was described as roofed with masonry at 7 shibr (189 cm, 6.2 ft) noted as to allow two horsemen to pass at once. In clockwise rotation, the ramp held four stories with eighteen, fourteen, and seventeen rooms on the second, third, and fourth floors, respectively. Balawai accounted the base of the lighthouse to be 45 ba (30 m, 100 ft) long on each side with connecting ramp 600 dhira (300 m, 984 ft) long by 20 dhira (10 m, 32 ft) wide. The octangle section is accounted at 24 ba (16.4 m, 54 ft) in width, and the diameter of the cylindrical section is accounted at 12.73 ba (8.7 m, 28.5 ft). The apex of the lighthouse's oratory was measured with diameter 6.4 ba (4.3 m 20.9 ft).The Arab authors indicate that the lighthouse was constructed from large blocks of light-coloured stone. The tower was made up of three tapering tiers: a lower square section with a central core; a middle octagonal section; and, at the top, a circular section.Ancient accounts from geographer Al-Idrisi accounts admiration from his viewing of the lighthouse in 1154. Al-Idrisi accounts the construction, openings in the walls throughout the rectangular shaft with lead used as a filling agent in between the masonry blocks at the base. Al-Idrisi accounted the total height of the lighthouse to be 300 dhira rashashl (162 m equivalence).At its apex was positioned a mirror which reflected sunlight during the day; a fire was lit at night. Extant Roman coins struck by the Alexandrian mint show that a statue of Triton was positioned on each of the building's four corners, and a  statue of Poseidon or Zeus stood atop.Al-Masudi wrote in the 10th century that the seaward-facing side featured an inscription dedicated to Zeus.Late accounts of the lighthouse after the destruction by the 1303 Crete earthquake include Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan scholar and explorer, who passed through Alexandria in 1326 and 1349. Battuta noted that the wrecked condition of the lighthouse was then only noticeable by the rectangle tower and entrance ramp. Battuta's account measured each side of the tower to be 140 shibr (30.8 m, 101 ft) on either side. Battuta detailed plans of Sultan An-Nasir Muhammad to build a new lighthouse near the site of the collapsed one, but the plans were never fulfilled after the sultan's death in 1341.\n\n\n== Destruction ==\nThe lighthouse was partially cracked and damaged by earthquakes in 796 and 951, followed by structural collapse in the earthquake of 956, and then again in 1303 and 1323. Damaging earthquakes propagate from two well known tectonic boundaries, the African-Arabian and Red-Sea rift zones, respectively 350 and 520 km from the lighthouses location. Documentation shows the 956 earthquake to be the first to cause structural collapse of the top 20+ metres of the construction. Documented repairs after the 956 earthquake include the installment of an Islamic style dome after the collapse of the statue that previously topped the monument. The most destructive earthquake in 1303 was an estimated intensity of VIII+ originating from the Greek island of Crete (280\u2013350 km from Alexandria). Finally, the stubby remnant disappeared in 1480, when the then-Sultan of Egypt, Qaitbay, built a medieval fort on the larger platform of the lighthouse site using some of the fallen stone.\nThe 10th-century writer al-Mas'udi reports a legendary tale on the lighthouse's destruction, according to which at the time of Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (r. 705\u2013715) the Byzantines sent a eunuch agent, who adopted Islam, gained the Caliph's confidence and secured permission to search for hidden treasure at the base of the lighthouse. The search was cunningly made in such a manner that the foundations were undermined, and the Pharos collapsed. The agent managed to escape in a ship waiting for him.\n\n\n== Archaeological research and rediscovery ==\n\nIn 1968, the lighthouse was rediscovered. UNESCO sponsored an expedition to send a team of marine archaeologists, led by Honor Frost, to the site. She confirmed the existence of ruins representing part of the lighthouse. Due to the lack of specialized archaeologists and the area becoming a military zone, exploration was put on hold.\nA team of French archaeologists led by Jean-Yves Empereur re-discovered the physical remains of the lighthouse in late 1994 on the floor of Alexandria's Eastern Harbour. He worked with cinematographer Asma el-Bakri who used a 35 mm camera to capture the first underwater pictures of the scattered remains of collapsed columns and statues. Empereur's most significant findings consisted of blocks of granite 49\u201360 tonnes in mass often broken into multiple pieces, 30 sphinxes, 5 obelisks and columns with carvings dating back to Ramses II (1279\u20131213 BC). The cataloging of over 3,300 pieces was completed by Empereur and his team at the end of 1995 using a combination of photography and mapping. Thirty-six pieces of Empereur's granite blocks and other discoveries have been restored and are currently on display in Alexandria museums. Subsequent satellite imaging has revealed further remains. In the early 1990s, the underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio began exploration at the opposite side of the harbor from where Empereur's team had worked. Subsequent satellite and sonar imaging has revealed the additional remains of wharves, houses and temples which had all fallen into the ocean as a result of earthquakes and other natural disasters. It is possible to go diving and see the ruins. The secretariat of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage is currently working with the Government of Egypt on an initiative to add the Bay of Alexandria (including the remains of the lighthouse) to a World Heritage List of submerged cultural sites.\n\n\n== Significance ==\nLegend has it that the people of the island of Pharos were wreckers; hence, Ptolemy I Soter had the lighthouse built to help guide ships into port at night.Pharos became the etymological origin of the word \"lighthouse\" in Greek (\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), many Romance languages such as French (phare), Italian and Spanish (faro), Catalan, Romanian (far) and Portuguese (farol), and even some Slavic languages like Bulgarian (far). In Turkish, Serbian and Russian, a derived word means \"headlight\" (far; \u0444\u0430\u0440; \u0444\u0430\u0440\u0430).\n\n\n== Proposed reconstruction ==\nSince 1978 a number of proposals have been made to replace the lighthouse with a modern reconstruction. In 2015, the Egyptian government and the Alexandria governorate suggested building a skyscraper on the site of the lighthouse as part of the regeneration of the eastern harbour of Alexandria Port. The plan was opposed by Alexandria-based sociologist Amro Ali.\n\n\n== Pharos in culture ==\n\nThe lighthouse remains a civic symbol of the city of Alexandria and of the Alexandria Governorate with which the city is more or less coterminous. A stylised representation of the lighthouse appears on the flag and seal of the Governorate and on many public services of the city, including the seal of Alexandria University.\n\n\n=== In architecture ===\nA well-preserved ancient tomb in the town of Abusir, 48 kilometres (30 mi) southwest of Alexandria, is thought to be a scaled-down model of the Alexandria Pharos. Known colloquially under various names \u2013 the Pharos of Abusir, the Abusir funerary monument and Burg al-Arab (Arab's Tower) \u2013 it consists of a 3-storey tower, approximately 20 metres (66 ft) in height, with a square base, an octagonal midsection and cylindrical upper section, like the building upon which it was apparently modelled. It dates to the reign of Ptolemy II (285\u2013246 BC), and is therefore likely to have been built at about the same time as the Alexandria Pharos.\nThe design of minarets in many early Egyptian Islamic mosques followed a three-stage design similar to that of the Pharos, attesting to the building's broader architectural influence.\nThe George Washington Masonic National Memorial, located in Alexandria, Virginia, is fashioned after the ancient Lighthouse.\n\n\n=== In literature ===\nJulius Caesar, in his Civil Wars (Part III, 111\u2013112), describes the Pharos and its strategic importance. Gaining control of the lighthouse helped him subdue Ptolemy XIII's armies (48 BC):Now because of the narrowness of the strait there can be no access by ship to the harbour without the consent of those who hold the Pharos. In view of this, Caesar took the precaution of landing his troops while the enemy was preoccupied with fighting, seized the Pharos and posted a garrison there. The result was that safe access was secured for his corn supplies and reinforcements.\nThe Romano-Jewish historian Josephus (37 \u2013 c. 100 AD) describes it in his book The Jewish War (4.10.5) when he gives a geographical overview of Egypt.\nIt was described in the Zhu fan zhi (\"Records of Foreign Peoples\") by Zhao Rugua (1170\u20131228), a Chinese customs inspector for the southern port city of Quanzhou during the Song dynasty.\nIbn Battuta visited the lighthouse in 1326, finding \"one of its faces in ruins,\" yet he could enter and noted a place for the guardian of the lighthouse to sit and many other chambers.  When he returned in 1349, he \"found that it had fallen into so ruinous a condition that it was impossible to enter it or to climb up to the doorway.\"\nIn Robert Silverberg's science fiction novella Sailing to Byzantium (1985), a culture of the far future recreates ancient cities, full with every detail, among them Alexandria; several episodes of Silverberg's story take place on the rebuilt Pharos.\n\n\n=== In video games ===\nThe lighthouse was one of the Wonders of the World that could be built in the 1991 computer game Civilization, giving a bonus to ship movement. It would appear again in all the latter installments of the series.\nIt can be built as a monument in the city building strategy games Pharaoh: Cleopatra (2000) and Children of the Nile (2004).\nThe lighthouse is featured as a wonder in the 2013 strategy game, Total War: Rome II, where it gives a minor boost to the faction occupying Alexandria.\nThe lighthouse was featured in the action-adventure video game Assassins Creed Origins released on October 27, 2017. It is set in Ancient Egypt during the Ptolemaic period (48 BC). Ubisoft Montreal's research on Ancient Egypt was done with the help of French archaeologist and Egyptologist Jean-Claude Golvin.\nThe lighthouse can be built in the SimCity 3000 game as a landmark.\nThe Lighthouse of Alexandria is a \"Great Building\" available in the web-based game Forge of Empires.Flags\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nTower of Hercules, a Roman lighthouse in Spain\nMinar (Firuzabad)\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\nHarris, William V., and Giovanni Ruffini. 2004.

          "Stark reminder of the Roman influence on Egypt. The guide did an excellent job of explaining fully, but unfortunately, it was too hot for me to walk around. He was respectful of my situation.",
          "This is a historic pillar surrounded by carvings and ruins. The stop is uncomplicated and does not take much time. If you want to save the entry fee, you can see more from the parking area than when up close. Plan about 20 minutes.",
          "In addition to the pillar, there are sphinxes in the open yard. Beneath this structure is an ancient library. Hard to believe that we pretty much had this to ourselves. Summer is clearly a good time to visit.",
          "This site actually is more than a random pillar. Underneath there are sanctuaries and a former library (obviously no books now). It\u2019s a really interesting site and understated. Check it out.",
          "It\u2019s a roman site that used to be Serapeum\u2019s Temple. The name was given to celebrate Cleopatra\u2019s brother.",
          "Interesting walk if you are looking to kill an hour. Interesting to see but walkways and area not well kept.",
          "very good place to relax & enjoy the by gone era, the place is in the center of the city..well preserved & maintained.",
          "Two Sphinx and a roman pillar have been uncovered. There are other finds scattered round the immediate area as well. Nice walk ways and you CAN walk right up to the Sphinx and pillar.",
          "I wouldn't put this place high on your list if you have limited time in Alexandria, there isn't much left of the old temple and it's just a big pillar, nothing special.",
          "It isn't really Pompey's pillar (just a mistake by explorers), however impressive, as it dates from much later than Pompey. The early Christian church is only partially excavated, and has a replica of the sacred bull. Probably there are more exciting things to see in",
          "Take the climb up the stairs to see where William Clark chiseled his name in stone. According to the docent working on the day we visited this is the only spot that it can be proven that the Lewis and Clark expedition actually was. Climb all the way to the top of the stairs",
          "It's worth going to these ruins just to see the pillar itself. It's absolutely huge and quite a sight to see. Although we found that the rest of the site isn't all that interesting.",
          "If you have any interest in history, this is a must. You probably need about one hour here to see it all, just ensure you walk around to the far corner so you can go underground and see where the priests lived, etc...",
          "A must see when visiting Alexandria, the sad part is that it has been neglected and needs lots of TLC if they want more tourist to visit the country.",
          "While the pillar itself is huge there isn\u2019t much to see beyond this and unless you have a particular interest in the period then you can see it from the street just as well.",
          "Located in Alexandria, this place was beautiful. Our guide explained how its been wrongly named and was made much before Pompei's time. Anyways, we spent about an hour here. The weather was just perfect. Its like a little trek to get closer to the pillar. There's also 2 sphinx",
          "The 30m column stands over the ruins in the centre of the city. There are some ruins of a temple and 2 Sphinxes which were originally from Heliopolis and a surviving Nileometer which was used to measure and record the Nile flooding in ancient times. It is an interesting place",
          "It's sad that Alexandria, once the capital of Ptolemaic kingdom and the third city of the Roman Empire, has so few and so disappointing ancient monuments remaining. Well, it's just a big pillar. Nothing special. Worth a single photo.",
          "Not a lot to see but it does have a place in Egypts history. In olden times, the Nile river and canals did come to a port area and it was the birth of the Nilometer - a measurement that told Egyptian farmers if there would be flood or famine. The nile flood plains being a",
          "I was disappointed by this well-known attraction. It is in disrepair and has poor signage. This is a place where your guide needs to do a lot of explaining. Just walking around will not bring it to life. Beware of the bridge that takes you to the base of the pillar. It is",
          "Pompey's Pillar is the centerpiece of a small collection of ruins in central Alexandria. The admission fee provides access to the pillar, adjacent sphinxes and numerous fragments of buildings and statues. There is also an underground \"little library\" where scrolls were stored",
          "This is definitely one of the major tourist attractions in Alexandria and worth a visit. So much history!",

          "The Roman triumphal column in Alexandria, Egypt, is the largest of its type constructed outside the imperial capitals of Rome. It stands in the middle of the modern city. The Roman ruler of Egypt erected this memorial column in honor of the Roman Emperor Diocletian. However,",
          "With the excavation still open , our guide archeologist explained the layers of soil representing the historical periods of Egypt. Pre historic Egypt (attacked by Nubians, Assyrians and Persians), Greeks and Romans.",
          "A good place to spend some leisure, but nothing really worthwhile. Place is neat and clean and the entrance fee is EGP 80. The tower itself is quite tall but other than than, you don't feel that awe which you would otherwise feel for other places in Egypt",
          "You can skip buying the ticket to visit this site. Stand outside, listen to the guide\u2019s explanation, take a photo of the pillar, then move on.",
          "The pillar is situated in the middle of a temple excavation. The grounds are kept up nicely and there are several ares to explore underground. ONe of the nice historic sites of the city.",
          "The name does not have any relation to Pompeyin Italy. This is prime sight in Alexandria that everyone should go. It sits on top of Temple of Serapeum, man made god of Alexandria. Beautiful place to take photo to show friends and relatives that you went to Alexandria.",
          "This is another hidden gem. It looks like any old monument, but once the guide explained it's layered history, the site amazed. Needless to say, take a guide.",
          "How they transported this pillar is an engineering feat. Marvellous to see and the underground library. A must if visiting Alexanderia.",
          "This was a good stop in Alexandria with interesting ruins. Note there is no relief from the sun here so if you are sensitive to the sun, wear a hat or bring an umbrella. Do go underneath into the tunnels to see all there is to see. Take your time and follow the walkways around",
          "After the visit to Cairo and Luxor, this place seems very ordinary. However, worth a visit due to historical significance. There are underground caves (entry from back side) with a small temple and a library. Worth a visit if you happen to be in Alexandria. We also spotted",
          "The pillar itself isn\u2019t super exciting but underneath are pathways where books were once hidden to be protected from destruction. They were neat to see and explore. This site requires a fair amount of walking over unstable ground, may not be great for people with balance",
          "Built of a one piece granite, the Pompey\u2019s pillar still stands tall in the heart of Alexandria. There is no written history to confirm whether if it was actually Pompey\u2019s pillar but just a hearsay. There are two statue of sphinx placed on either side of the pillar as if",
          "A single towering pillar between two small Sphinx like statues is surrounded by Roman ruins. Worth a quick look on the way back into town after a visit to the catacombs. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",
          "i have read about this while in school and was good to finally be there in person. In the middle of a bazaar and a bit run down but worth a visit. Be prepared with good climbing shoes and carry a good camera.",
          "Poor town with rich past and an ugly present: the contrasts of civilisations and their reminders is Always there in Alexandria. Why is this town degenerated as it is today? where is the former glory? Things to think about for the local tourist office: the sites are so few and",
          "Our guide was not particularly enthused about these ruins, so we were very pleasantly surprised. As you circle the hill, note that there are two small rooms underground, as well, that should be visited. Take a flashlight. Actually, take a flashlight to many of the sites in",

          "These ruins were discovered by accident. Surrounded by modern high rise buildings, the effect is a bit lacking, but the columns and statues are no less magnificent. I wandered around the area for over an hour on a day with occasional mist, exploring the remains where Romans",

          "Not really an attraction. There\u2019s a pillar or column with the ever present sphinx type statue. It\u2019s worth a 5 min stop though. Get a sense of history.",
          "The pillar is all that remains of the ruins of this temple, and it can be easily viewed from the outside. There isn't much reason to visit this site.",
          "the location of this place was very far in old city the monument was not very well maintained, though the roughness added to its beauty",
          "Interesting place again where the roman blended with egyptians. Interesting story behind it , but a quick stop as it is not quite a lot to see.",
          "Greeks and pharoes met in this place. Nothing much to see but both cultures left a mark. The trip is an interesting experience. Takes time but you see the unique Alexandria and the Karmouz neighborhood. There is a lot of poverty and dirt on the road with old buildings but you",

          "Visited this as part of a tour so had already seen a lot of temples and other tourist hot spots. This was interesting to see but seemed a little plain after seeing so many other sites. Worth visiting. The Roman theatre was much better. Quite a few steps which are uneven and",

          "Amazing size , once again talks a lot in the history or Egypt. As usual these are massive structures of ancient Egypt",
          "This has a couple of very well formed sphinx and lots of ones in various levels of preservation- and of course the massive pillar. The temples and underground passages also interesting Probably at most a 20-30 min visit and if choosing I thought the catacombs more interesting",
          "Pretty cool if you know the history. There is a letter carved on the inside thanking the leader for feeding the starving people. Lots of stairs.",
          "This exhibit is not tourist friendly. While there are steps leading to the bathrooms, there are loose floor boards over paths and rocky areas that you have to climb up and down. What is very impressive is that this pillar was made of granite that was transferred here from Aswan.",
          "I came here with my guide as part of my tour of Alexandria. You definitely need someone with you to run you through the history of the site, otherwise you'll miss a lot and it won't mean much. There is also a holy statue in a tunnel that you have to see. Most of the area is in",
          "Basically it's a single standing pillar which has no relation to Pompey. There is much more other places to visit and cover for. This place is worth skipping ..",
          "Walk among the ruins and picture the history from centuries ago. Picture the beauty upon the completion of this. The beauty of the artifacts that remain can give you the impression of the beauty it once held. A must see.",
          "Listen to your guide speak about the events in the history of the peoples and rulers who once tried to control this part of the Mediterran Sea. Sad to hear how much of it is lost,but not forgotten.",
          "Well preserved. Part of a pretty large excavation site. They also have some catacombs here. But it's just a pillar. If you have knowledge of Roman history or you're interested in looking at related stuff this is the place for you. For the average tourist with no real background",
          "Part of a larger excavation site, this is the most prominent structure still standing erect. Can't miss it.",
          "It's a moderately interesting place that combines the city's Roman history with Egyptian sphinxes. The underground parts are just as interesting as what is aboveground.",
          "Besides the pillar there are tunnel-ways that can be explored underneath the pillar. Great photo-op.",
          "Have a look on the picture, it is all you get from that place after walking and climbing for 15 mins. The place is poorly maintained and you need a tour guide to tell you something about the history.",
          "Pompey's pillar is a jewel of the history of Alex. Well maintained, the pillar, sanctuary and sfinxes stand out in the middle of a crowded neighborhood. Don't miss it.",
          "This is the best place to see in Alexandria. It requires walking and climbing, but is worth it. The picture is what you go to see.",
          "A lot to see within a small site, the visitor\u2019s entry fee is EGP30. Dating back to 297AD, the stone column sits on the highest point overlooking the excavations of an ancient temple. Poorly maintained walkways and underground tunnels guide the visitor around the spot although,",
          "A very interesting place and a genuine walk through history. The area is well preserved but very hard to find. Obviously once you see the huge pilar, it's easy to find but it's trying to get through the markets that's difficult. It has enough information around to understand",
          "Pompey's Pillar is interesting and you can get a good picture from it, on it, etc. So it is worth the small price of admission to get there. But make sure you get into the catacombs behind it! There you will find an annex for the Great Library of Alexandria. You will find many",
          "Due to the increased costs to visit this site should be visited if time permits - I wouldn't make it a priority. Be sure to read up on the history before walking around, again, it would be better to do research before visiting this site. There are some great ruins however it's",
          "The entrance fees have increased, with still no maintenance on the site to guide tourists about the history. I would suggest a google search to read up on it, and a picture from the outside which is free! :) Otherwise, avoidable!",
          "A beautiful piece of History written in the stones ...the Romans knew how to live . The swimming pool, the graveyard, the grandiose pillars, the statues, the remains of old, ancient, great History, ... we go back in time and forget the here and now and are transported to the",
          "A single huge pillar left. Who knows it may fall in next earth as others fallen too! Nice place but surrounding city trying to engulf the place. Nice walk-around. U will meet some cats too! Don't miss.",
          "As far as ruins go this is ruined, only one pillar left. However there is a surprise to be found walking underground. A good guide will bring this tour to life.",
          "This place is located a 5 minute walk from Kom El Shoqafa catacombs. We stopped here in the heat of the day and spent about 25 minutes here walking the grounds. The ticket price (as of July 2016) was 20 LE for foreigners and photography without a tripod is permitted free of",
          "Well I went there to take a look but really not in there to see or to take a look on but if you in there and have free time go if didn't have time it's ok u ll not lose anything if u didn't go",
          "Nice place but not very lovely view. Buildings in backdrop kills it's beauty. Just a pillar if you do not know the history. Walking is not much. Require one person with camera on ground to catch good shot. Avoidable",
          "No large crowds agasin here and very clean. The area is small enough to explore on your own once left by the guide and you can easily make your way back to the gates. The site is not far from the catacombs so it makes and easy jaunt to see both.",
          "It is a special historical site, but apart from the pillar there is not much more to see. Not sure if it is required to pay and enter.",
          "Like all else in Egypt, if you want to see a thing up close, you have to pay. Everywhere you need to entrance fees. We were not impressed by the attitude of the peple selling the tickets and just left after a few minutes.",
          "There is not a lot to see on this site, but it is still very interesting and worth seeing. It is worth having either a guide to explain about it or your own research. Allow an hour at the most.",
          "I really enjoyed walking around this area and seeing some of the old remains. The foundations and walls of historic buildings, Cleopatra's library and off course the pillar itself. If travelling on your own, (Uber was a godsend for us! So much cheaper than taxis and the drivers",
          "Quite a small historic site but, worth a look while in Alex - secure & safe.Try telling Al Jazeera news !!!!!!!",
          "We didn't go to the site but drove past with our guide and got the run down, very interesting! I wouldn't recommend stopping for too long other than admiring how large and what a feat it would of been to erect.",
          "In my first year in egypt \u2013 that was 2012 \u2013 I just had half a day to visit things in Alexandria, as it was the day my friend Ahmed picked me up from there to take me to Disuq and stay some days with his family. Still we used this time with visiting some ancient places like",
          "I wasn't super impressed by this place considering this is in Egypt where everything else is mind blowing. There is only one pillar standing and two spinxs. The route to it it's super crowded and filthy, through slums. If you are in Alexandria and don't have anything else to do",
          "I saw a lot of sites in Egypt, and most of them blew me away. This site, however, wasn't of them. I could have passed of this place - there are many o;aces in Cairo that I would have rather seen.",
          "It is an amazing trip to see an interesting monument from Roman period , and on your way you can enjoy watching all about popular area with very difficult traffic , narrow streets , street markets . So you can know about history and recent slums in Alexandria.",
          "its again amazing to see a roman pillar with a couple of sphinx together. but than thats egypt. except the history related to the place, the only interesting thing was the nilometer.",
          "The Serapeum is in the same place; you can only just about figure out the roman bath from the ruins. The pillar is dedicated to Pompey who reduced taxes. There is a little adventure involved as you walk up or climb up to the base of the pillar.",
          "The middle of old town attraction has a great history. Can be amazing visit for v the kids too. A bit of knowledge about Alexander the great hero before visiting helps",
          "There isnt much that remains of the temple but the pillar and Sphinx. There are a few tunnels being restored which is mainly course rock with no inscriptions or hieroglyphics on them. The sheer size of the pillar made from a single piece of granite is quite impressive. In my",
          "Originally there were hundreds of pillars and stayed. Now only one of the pillars remains along with a few Sphinx's. What happened? It was interesting to see. The underground passages that led to the bull statue, the places for people to leave offerings and the rooms.",
          "We had to go through a horrific traffic through narrow streets and barely avoided getting our car scratched by tram and other crossing vehicles as vendors have covered most of the streets by their product displays. There is also a site of ancient library which seems underground",
          "The historical temple with Roman Greek architectural. Visitor can explore new area below the pillar. A long tunnel from ancient time...",
          "The remains of the Serapeum are close to the tomb complex so see both at the same time. The standing column is the largest in site monolithic column I have ever seen. The pillar has nothing to do with Pompey, however. More tombs in the NW corner of the site",
          "Drove by here, peeked in to see if it's worth buying a ticket to go in. The guard let me take a look and I only took a photo. It is literally nothing more than what you see in this picture. So I took a picture and left. It is interesting to note that it's the biggest pillar of",
          "The approach to the place is crowded, and the outside surroundings are stinking. Inside there is not much to see, after buying the usual costly tickets. Can be avoided.",
          "One monolithic pillar sticking out of the grounds. Nothing interesting to see there. Complete and utter waste of time, Alexander was....",
          "We were only able to drive by, but the majestic history of this ancient treasure will be with us forever!! Imagine yourself in the middle of all the intrigue during the spectacular times of Marc Antony, Cleopatra and Pompey!!! Such drama! WOW!!!! Go to EGYPT if you can -",
          "Relation between Greece & Egypt is historical one, visiting this place is an indication of that history, but the surrounding of the place does not reflect this era of history. Ministries of Antiquities, Tourism & Culture in Egypt should pay great attention to this historical &",
          "We enjoyed our trip to Pompey's Pillar or Amoud El Sawari. Soo much fun to see and explore stuff about the past and old civilisation. Lots of walking you see the pillar then the abis cow God then the library. I wished if they had a gif shop to buy some souvenirs.",
          "i visit Alexandria a lot but it's my first to visit the pillar, good place but it suffer like very place in Egypt from negligence ,",
          "One of the best places to go when visiting Alex is the site of Pompey pillar . a wonderful spot that was once so important on ancient Alex map and still shouts with glamour.",
          "Monumentally this is a good site. But there is nothing else. The fee is quite high. Actually you can glance it from the road as you pass from Cairo to Alexandria.",
          "it is very nice but very crowded place it is in the center of alexandria it is good to be visited especilly at summer",
          "If you are visiting Alexandria, please visit this place; although this is quite far away from the other attractions and requires pushing through the crowded streets of Alexandria. It is located in the site of the ancient Temple of Serapeum in Alexandria. Hence this monument",
          "First of all: this has nothing to do with Pompey, and it's not even really a pillar (it's a column). And it's true that there's not much left to see here. But it's a pretty cool juxtaposition between old and new, to see the pillar set back against modern Alexandria. And standing",
          "I would never return - but this capped off our tour of Alexandria - and understandably why. The history of the pillar helped wrap up the importance of this city.",
          "Like many of this country's sites, the Pillar sits within an impoverished area. The site itself is well kept though.",
          "this is a massive archeological area but unfortunately not much is left to see (but lots to imagine).",
          "The place is nice... there isn't much to see and rarely any tourists so you are expected to tip a lot but people are very friendly so I really didn't mind. In a very run down area in Alexandria though so be careful",
          "A nice manageable size of site. The pillar is grand, the cats are photogenic, and there are a few extra ruins and obelisks to examine. Terrible access through a crowded and choked part of the old city.",
          "The only remains of the old palace, a pillar is situated right in the heart of the city bazaar with the sphinx besides it.",
          "This monument is somewhat tucked away in a very run down part of town . When I went it was crowded with six or sever coach loads of Chinese tourists which gave it rather an attractive , if somewhat anachronistic , feel as they swarmed around the site . It is fairly limited in",
          "I had a great time here although it is a small historic site. The tombs ( caves are intimidating if you are claustrophobic)",
          "Read about this place in History class and now I am here. This site is well not in very good condition but none the less very interesting to visit. To see the enormous Roman Pillar flanked by two enormous Egyptian Sphinxes of red granite with exceptional smiles, true beauty. You",
          "Well worth a visit as well - a local guide will explain the complex very well & it has very clean toilets - go early in the morning when there are no other tourists around.",
          "The sheer scale and elegance of the pillar makes you wish you could have seen the whole complex when it was standing - it must have been amazing. I don't understand why this is only number 22 on the list of things to do in Alexandria; for me it was the number one attraction",
          "excellent pillar arch and nice to see.. Worth watching and 1 hour visit is must to see the sanctuary underground and nice tunnel.",
          "This place will be amazing when they complete the restoration around the pillar....but there is something special about the area anyhow...",
          "You can feel how large were everything in those days. You can feel the power of the Empire and too see how great architects they had that time.",
          "History personified ! 2nd thing we saw in ALexadria after the catacombs. This ancient ruins would be a place of great interest. Theres a gang of great looking shaggy cats , somehow they enhanced the impact :)",
          "Pompey\u2019s pillar stands in the center of the temple hall of the Serapeum, the principal temple of the Greco-Egyptian god Serapis, The Serapeum also housed an underground library, contemporary to the ancient library of Alexandria. from outside public market, restaurants .It was",
          "So much of history and I am sure some great historical facts. However place could do with some guides or alternatively audio tracks for tourist to really obtain a perspective of the place. Overall some majestic structures.",
          "well... not much details to check out , yet its nice to visit and go inside a cave located right behind the pillar.",
          "If you don\u2019t have enough time to see all the sights, you may consider to leave this one out. The big pillar of \u2018Pompey\u2019 and two sphinx-like statues are the main attractions.",
          "I visited the area years ago and was expecting just the column in the middle of a scraggy park as before. However so much excavation cleared since then, including some underground tunnels and chambers which are open to walk in. Great to see how they worked the rock to create a",
          "Liked the history about it, disliked the approach to Piller in rush hour!! AREA SURROUNDING Piller is very crowded, liked the water system of lod time \"how to gauge water in canal\" to charge the tax!!",
          "You will love the culture of the site and if you mix it with other sightseeing in one day you will have a lot of fun and learn a lot about ancient histroy",
          "An excellent example of roman architecture without going to Rome. If that's your kind of thing you'll probably like it a lot, there's also a great site underground.",
          "From the street the pillar just looks like any other in Rome or at Luxor. But don't be fooled. Get up close and get a perspective of how high this is and wonder how they transported it to Alexandria from Aswan. The underground Library and Sanctuary are also great value.",
          "The pillar is such a spectacular sight in the small Alexandria neighborhood. And to learn from my tour guide that the Pillar is just freestanding there makes it even more spectacular. Also make sure you visit the underground tombs at the pillar. And of course you have a Sphinx",
          "Majestic sight in the centre of Alexandria. Sphinx in front adds to the spectacle. Amazing to think how it was assembled in the 3rd century AD. Space for reflection in a bustling city.",
          "It is worth the visit as I really enjoyed walking around the ruins and enjoying the relics on hand. My one major complaint is that the items are all marked with a Sharpie in very visible locations. It truly takes away from the beauty of these historical items. I understand that",
          "Once again, the value of a private guide showed itself. Our guide (Memphis Tours) gave us a detailed background of the site, which helped appreciate the significance of the \"pillar\" and other artifacts. We thought the pillar would be singularly unimpressive...boy were we",
          "Before going I thought I would just go and come back in 10 mins but this took over an hour. Its a very long walk with loads of stairs and somethings underground too. Apart from the pillar there is the Nilometer, the old Roman baths and ruins and underground there are 2 caves one",
          "Plus the hug very high pillar , there is a warshiped cow underground from thousands of year which was v nice to see",
          "The story for its construction is equally fascinating as the structure. Most prominent Greek landmark in Alexandria.",
          "Went in December 2012 and 2013. In 2012 there were a lot more tourists (though compared to pre-2011, it was low). In 2013, we had the site to ourselves! Every guide/taxi/person seems to want to ensure you stop at the Pillar. It is interesting but the only thing to see at the",
          "A pillar worth marveling at, this remnant from the Roman times is actually a Corinthian column commemorating the victory of Roman emperor Diocletian in the old part of the city. Today just a small enclosure, it was once part of a large temple complex. This free standing tower is",
          "I was the only tourist in the complex for the ninety minutes that I spent walking around. It was lovely to stroll around and take in the ruins. Make sure you visit the underground tunnels which lead underneath the pillar. They are tucked away and could be easily missed. It",
          "We visited this place in November 2012 as part of a tour package. Did not find it impressive compare to Pompeii in Italy. It is still worth a visit for a first time.",
          "I thought It was a little bit more, maybe because of my high expectations I was shocked, but for those coming to see it... It's nice but don't have high hopes it's just a Pillar and nothing more...",
          "Not exciting, but the pillar is incredible. The adjacent sphinxs are noteworthy for their condition and aura. One of the mandatory sites to visit in Alexandria.",
          "On a scale of 1-10 of things to see in Egypt I think I would rate this as -1 . It may appeal to people interested in historical figures and stories, but it is very ordinary in terms of anything of artistic merit. I would not bother visting here again if I were in Alexandria.",
          "What was most interesting about Pompey's Pillar is that it was misnamed, and was not erected to honor him. Although an interesting site, I'm not sure I would make a special trip to see it. They are two small sphinx statues next to it, and there is some interesting subterranean",
          "Very surprised to find that we were the only visitors to Pompey's Pillar. We were there at noon, which was serendipitous, we heard the calls to prayer from 4 sides! Moving experience.",
          "It's a little peek into the remains of the Roman occupation of northern Egypt. Basically unregulated - you can roam throughout the site.",
          "The pillar with the sphinxes are a great view but nothing beyond that, repent spending money for entering the complex !! Recommend just stopping by and seeing it from outside as nothing much to offer at the excavation site.",
          "The pillar itself and the sphinxes beside it are impressive. The rest of the complex less so. You can make a quick stop here.",
          "Again they have place objects not from Alex here. The sphinxes need to be placed elsewhere. Part of the fun was getting here. We thought the taxi driver was taking us somewhere to rob us but looking at the city was very good. The column is just that but it is 30m high. They have",
          "The pillar is very tall, and in good shape. The entire area has a good walk way around it, with low steps on a grade. The ground is uneven when you go into the underground \"temple\" remains where the replique of an Apis bull is located at the end of a hallway and many steps!",
          "assume a man can do that. so beautiful and admirable. very nice architecture and mind will blow up. grate marvel of men and no words to explain it.",
          "There isn't much to see. It's a pillar and that's that. The thing is, it's located near the Kom Alshoqafa Catacombs so both should be seen since you're right there anyway.",
          "...basically a cemetary with a stone column. Wouldn't want to go back - if you're short on time, this attraction could easily be skipped.",
          "A wonderful sight to see.The pillar stands proud amongst other actifacts.It is a most interesting and historical find.",
          "Pompey's Pillar is a unique site that used to be a large structure with baths and channels used for washing and also measuring the level of the Nile. The site is in ruins now, but there are some interesting sphinxes and a pillar remains standing. There are also a few",
          "Nothing really exciting about it and definitely NOT worth any admission price to see. You can see everything you need to from outside the wall across the street.",
          "I was so amaze with this 'only one' pillar left standing. Under the pillar is a library and main shrine. I surely will visit again this pillar if i visit Alex again. Try to take picture from down under the large tree and will give you beautiful image.",
          "Pompey's Pillar sits several blocks away from the corniche in Alexandria. When my husband and I first set eyes on it we were amazed at how HUGE it is. Coming from a Roman building and moved to Alexandria in ancient times it now sits lonesome on the top of a hill in the middle of",
          "Pales in comparison to similar pillars which are part of intact temples or other antiquities. It's nice to visit, see the pillar and the surrounding grounds but not necessarily worth the entrance fee. However, if this is your first pillar sighting, then it might impress you.",
          "Viewing Roman and or Greek sites is a little Ho Hum after spending time in Egyptian sites but when in Alexandria its all that is left.",
          "I spent about an hour visiting Pompey's Pillar and took home some wonderful memories of the Romans presence in Egypt. The underground libraries were the highlight of my experience, with all the winding passageways and narrowing walls. Simply amazing! Allow at least an hour to",
          "We really enjoyed our trip to Pompeys Pillar, the area itself was very quiet and there were only a few other tourists visiting at the same time as us. The underground libraries were fantastic and the two tourists police that joined us made our experience more fun, they earned",
          "The pillar is quite tall and is one of the few things left to prove that the Romans were actually in Egypt. As you make your way to the pillar, there is a kind of outdoor museum like in Memphis that you can look at where stuff like headless sphinxes are lined up in a row. I",
          "Good place to reckon the history with some underground rooms. This place will take around 1 to 1.5 hours to explore. The place is surrounded by residential areas and it is hidden among these. One of the largest monolithic column ever erected...!!",
          "It is well worth a visit to this site. The pillar and surrounds are very interesting. Beware the pesky Policeman and tomb attendant though. On the lookout for a tip and taking photographs for you. Otherwise a great site to visit to Alexandria.",
          "On our way to the catacombs our taxi passed here and I though it was just a pillar and some carvings.............wrong....it was amazing underground areas everything spent a magical 2 hours there just wandering and it was a reasonable price and very quiet, but you do need to be",
          "The Roman Amphitheatre was very good but this place was fantastic!! We had only 50 minutes to see the place. You need about 70 to 85 minutes to see everything. The area is much larger than the roman ruins. The statues and stonework were very impressive.",
          "if you are pushed for time give this a miss and go to the catacombs around the corner. Both are equally difficult to get to, heavy traffic, poor roads and a market all conspire to disuade all but the persistent traveller.",
          "Interesting contrast of ruins perched on a hill amid the urban sprawl. The Pillar was larger than we though, but apart from a couple other small Sphinxs there is not much else to see. Not a particularly large area, you can probably finish in ~30 mins.",
          "This red aswan granite pillar looked superb and glowed when the setting sun lit it. The pillar was part of a temple. There are a couple of sphinxes, but most interesting were some underground galleries, which were apparently part of a roman library. Apis bulls were buried there",
          "same as catacombs, the site is great but the roads and traffic are terrible,wish if they have new roads or allow smaller electric cars to reach there instead of the big huge coaches.",
          "quite a let down actually. need a very good guide to lead you through the history of the pillar.",
          "In our view this was the best site we visited in Alexandria. A magnificent archeological find - and don't reject the guard who will offer to take you down the tunnels - for a fee he will take your photo in front of the (admittedly, a copy) of the bull statute and let you",
          "The impressiveness of this archaeological site was not as striking as I had prior expected. It took me roughly 20 minutes to wander around and pick up some interesting facts though. Built venerating the feat of Roman Emperor Diocletian over an Alexandria uprising by 297 AD,",
          "I never thought that there will be an excavation of such huge proportion in the centre of a very busy market. The pillar itself is very prominent and huge in size, there is an open air museum before you reach the pillar. Below the pillar there are two tunnels which takes you to",
          "Tired of reading reviews and books that consider this pillar \"terribly overrated\" I went with low expectations... and is it usually happens, this is the best thing you can do. The pillar itself is really impressive, and the esfiges that surround it are amazing as well. The small",
          "Having read the guide books about this sight, I thought I would only see a pillar of size and nothing more so I was surprised when finding more things to see. Among other things there is an now underground area that used to be a religious library in Alexandria. These catacombs",
          "The site of Pompey's Pillar and the Serapeum at Carmous are currently being upgraded. There is a new boundary wall and also new footpaths around the whole site. There's a selection of statues and small pillars as well as the main attraction of the pillar and the two sphinxes. It",

        "wiki": "The catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa (Arabic: \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u0643\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642\u0627\u0641\u0629\u200e; meaning \"Mound of Shards\") is a historical archaeological site located in Alexandria, Egypt, and is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.The necropolis consists of a series of Alexandrian tombs, statues and archaeological objects of the Pharaonic funeral cult with Hellenistic and early Imperial Roman influences. Due to the time period, many of the features of the catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa merge Roman, Greek and Egyptian cultural points; some statues are Egyptian in style, yet bear Roman clothes and hair style whilst other features share a similar style. A circular staircase, which was often used to transport deceased bodies down the middle of it, leads down into the tombs that were tunneled into the bedrock during the age of the Antonine emperors (2nd century AD). The facility was then used as a burial chamber from the 2nd century to the 4th century, before being rediscovered in 1900 when a donkey accidentally fell into the access shaft. To date, three sarcophagi have been found, along with other human and animal remains which were added later. It is believed that the catacombs were only intended for a single family, but it is unclear why the site was expanded in order to house numerous other individuals. \nAnother feature of the catacombs is the Hall of Caracalla, which contains the bones of horses which were the tombs created for the horses of the emperor Caracalla in 215 AD.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe catacombs were named Kom El Shoqafa, meaning Mound of Shards, because the area used to contain a mound of shards of terra cotta which mostly consisted of jars and objects made of clay. These objects were left by those visiting the tombs, who would bring food and wine for their consumption during the visit. However, they did not wish to carry these containers home from this place of death so they would break them. At the time of the discovery, heaps of these broken plates were found.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe catacombs lie  the western necropolis of Alexandria and consist of three levels cut through solid rock, the third level being now completely underwater. The catacombs have a six-pillared central shaft which opens off the vestibule. On the left is a triclinium, a funeral banquet hall where friends and family gathered on stone couches covered with cushions, both at the time of burial and also on future commemorative visits.Visitors can reach the first level through a breach in the rotunda wall, which was made at an unknown date. This leads to the Hall of Caracalla in which the bones of horses and humans were found.\n\n\n== Principal tomb chamber ==\nAt the front of the tomb chamber there is a temple-like fa\u00e7ade consisting of two columns topped by papyrus, lotus, and acanthus leaves of ancient Egypt and supporting an architrave with a relief of a central winged sun-disk flanked by Horus falcons. A carved Agathodaemon in the form of a snake is flanking both sides of the entrance to the inner tomb. Each snake wears a Roman Caduceus and a Greek Thyrsus as well as the Egyptian Pschent and is topped by a shield showing a Medusa. Figures of a man and a woman are carved into the wall. The man's body has a stiff hieratic pose typical of Ancient Egyptian sculpture, with the head carved in the lifelike manner of the classic Hellenes. The woman's figure is also rigidly posed but bears the Roman hairstyle.\nThere are three huge stone sarcophagi with non-removable covers along the sides of the chamber. It's assumed that bodies were inserted in them from behind, using a passageway which runs around the outside of the funeral chamber. There is a hallway with 91 inch deep walls in the central tomb chamber, with carved recesses, each providing burial space for three mummies. The sarcophagi are decorated with garlands and heads of Greek mythology gods. Each sarcophagus has associated a relief panel. The central panel shows the wolf-headed Anubis wearing Roman soldier garb, who mummifies a body lying on a lion bed. Below the bed are three canopic jars. The lateral panels show the Apis-bull receiving a gift.\n\n\n== Gallery principal tomb chamber ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "This is worth a visit. Found by a donkey falling into a hole back in the 1890s.this has now become a visit for tourists. Quite a sight and cleverly constructed. Regretfully no 9News knows who was buried here. Lot of slippery steps down but worth the hike. Cannot take a camera",

          "Hard to believe the hard work that must have gone into the digging and construction required to build the Catacombs. Lots of steps to go down and back up...take your time!",
          "I think this is the best thing in the city. The catacombs are fairly extensive with carvings and designs. The tombs excite the imagination and are quite well described. I only wonder why cameras are forbidden. There were many potential photo ops but it is best to leave the",
          "Our tour of the Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa was fabulous. We were able to navigate the twists and turns of this wonderfully complicated necropolis. Don't miss this if you're in Alexandria.",

          "What a nice surprise to find in the heart of Alex. Well presented nice and quiet and cool beneath the earth. A good way to spend an hour, nice toilets too.",
          "If anyone has been to the Catacombs in Paris, this is very different. There really aren't thousands & thousands of bones/skulls stacked up here like in Paris. But there ARE plenty of burial chambers one can see throughout.",
          "This was my favourite attraction in Alexandria, definitely worth a visit if you like history and don't mind underground places.",
          "This is another wonder I believe - the way ancient Egyptians made this structure - was simply mind blowing! You need to hire guide for its better understanding. You\u2019ll get wow experience for sure!",
          "This site was quite interesting but we were finished in about 1 hour so don't plan to stay for a long time. Great history to be found there as in most of Egypt.",
          "This is an interesting site, with elements of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman practices. The excavators found an adjacent opening that, we were told, was used during the Roman period to dispose of the bones of chariot racing horses.",
          "By \"Catacombs\", don't be expecting catacombs similar to the catacombs in Paris. There aren't any bones or walls made of skulls, but it was interesting to delve into this Greco-Roman tomb and see some of the artwork that's still adorning the walls and niches. It's worth seeing",

          "The catacombs are vast and expansive here. Note that they do NOT permit cameras to be brought past the entrance, so you will need to leave it with the front desk (they will give you a numbered thing to retrieve it upon your exit). Once inside the temperature is consistent and",

          "Discovered by a donkey, this place is a must visit in Alexandria. Our guide told us a story about how a donkey accidentally fell into the sand and revealed this historic site few decades ago. This site houses d catacombs used 3000 years ago to bury d common people. We also saw",

          "Also nice are some of the Tombs moved from other locations. The paintings in one are really something.",
          "Really enjoyed this different experience. Interesting hearing the stories of those buried below and what I can remember. I so wished that I had some photos, but they don't allow, so that memory will fade very quickly for me. I did get one nice photo of the glass ceiling",
          "Perhaps not the most impressive thing in Egypt, but, if you're in Alexandria, it's a must-see and the best thing to see there after the fort in the port.",
          "Dates back to the 1st century AD and as you walk down the spiral stairs to the different levels, you just wonder how they built such a think! Rooms go off in different directions, all with separate burial slots chiseled out of rock. Up until very recently, the lower level was",
          "If you are American, you can be proud of USAID assistance in preserving this historical and moving sight. We got there late in the afternoon and did not have enough time to do it justice. If you are coming from ancient Egypt-and heading into Greco Roman Egypt, it is the perfect",
          "The sculptures are very impressive when you go down the catacombs. This place is not for claustrophobic people. It is not very long to visit, but it worth the detour for sure.",
          "Touring the catacombs was one of the highlights of my brief visit to Alexandria. You descend a long rock-hewn staircase into a complex with numerous tombs that were carved right into the rock as well. Some are partially complete, but many have elaborate carvings and",
          "Our tour group visited here, an amazing underground Catacomb. Found by accident there is a maze of tombs. Some of the path is poorly lit and the surface is uneven. In one spot there is an unbarricaded drop of around 60 cm - take care and take a light.",
          "Went to the Catacomb on the 25/03/19. The entrance fee was 80EGP for tourist like us. The place was guarded by the Police. Guns can be seen. After you purchase you tickets, they'll have a mini checks on ur bags. The place was in good condition tho and well maintain. So we went",
          "Incredible. What started for one rich family became a large scale burial ground. Pity photographs are not allowed as there are some remarkable scenes displayed. Worth seeing.",

          "So you decide to go, you get up full of vim and vigor, then wait for the driver (he's on Egyptian time)you get in, then you wait, cause the traffic is deplorable, finally you get the eager to get out and experience the delights as described in the brochure, but, the filth and",
          "Beautiful place for the whole family you will love it there my daughters liked it so much choose the right time to ho there though June was too hot for us",
          "Catacombs. Catacombs at Alexandria are locally known as Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa. Which means Mound of shards. The name is due to large mound of shards of clay pottery around the catacomb site. Saw mounds around the catacombs abut could not make out any shards.",
          "We had a good guide named Mr. Saber Elhardy and he really explained in detail at each point of the catacomb.... too detailed that at one point, it felt really scary being at 100ft below ground. But good experience none the less. A must when you visit Alexandria.",
          "A good place to spend some time, else nothing much and interesting to see, just some underground catacomb. The catacombs were supposedly built by the Greek to bury or rather place the bodies in the burial chambers of people after their death",
          "Unfortunate about the no photography rule as these were quite different to other catacombs I've seen. Enter via a spiral staircase, there are various chambers to explore. There is no information available so a guide is a must.",
          "This site is only worth visiting with a guide, as otherwise you wouldn\u2019t understand the empty space. They are unfinished, unused tombs that had to be abandoned before construction ended as the water was rising (the site was under water for thousands of years before being",
          "It was a great underground attraction, the catacombs are an interesting sight, though if you're not into enclosed spaces, you might not want to descend down into the catacombs. The above ground tombs are also nice, just not so expansive. But if you're in the city, it's a nice",
          "Beautiful and historic site to see the rotunda and triculum. You could appreciate the Roman period of burial traditions. If you are weak in knees, you may skip the spiral stairs to reach the bottom. They charge you extra for foreigners and photographing is prohibited.",
          "This was the highlight of my visit to Alexandria. Morbid as it is, the catacombs are great. Just like with the other sites or Alexandria and probably Egypt, a guide is invaluable. There is so much hidden history.",
          "This was part of out tour itinerary and personally I didn\u2019t find it that spectacular. There\u2019s no explanation or anything so you would need a guide to know the history behind it. It was interesting to learn about Roman and Egyptian culture and how they mixed, but the tombs itself",
          "I have visited a couple of Catacombs in Mexico and Balkan countries. This is very unique and it has wowed me. If you have a chance, visit it.",
          "Down about 100 steps and you will experience a bit of wonderful ancient history. I am glad I was with my tour group as our guide made this experience much better. The ancient carvings and history are very interesting. Note that you are not allowed to photograph.",
          "after the fort we came to the catacombs. entrance fee is 80 egp for adult tourist (locals always pay much less for entrance fees anywhere) a few arrows and enough explanations written around the museum you not to\"get lost\" inside the catacombs.more to see outside too. we enjoyed",
          "No flashy colours here, but the carvings downstairs are excellent. I was glad to have a guide who could explain all the details as there is very little signage.",
          "To think that this was discovered by a donkey falling down a hole and then they discovered the Catacombs. It is only a 100. Steps down to see and well worth the history lesson. Very interesting.",
          "A must see in Alexandria, in looking at the site I was not expecting much as I had not done any research, however the underground to this site is something else and tells such a different story, so amazing how well reserved the tombs are below, there is an eerie feeling to the",
          "The catacombs were very interesting and a highlight of our visit to Alexandria. You need to go down a spiral staircase to tour the catacombs. We had a private guide that took us to this site and explained the different rooms and their meanings. Pictures are not allowed inside",
          "An ancient underground burial chamber from the Roman period. A spiral staircase takes down to the burial area, the stairs are sometime uneven. There is a number of different size chambers used for burials. All the chambers are empty. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "It was an interesting experience to roam underground through that maze of catacombs. There are no bones in there or sarcophigi it is basically different rooms and holes a few walls have drawings from the roman era.",
          "This is the first time I write a review for a site mainly because this place is underrated. It was an amazing experience to be there and learn about its story from construction to discovery.",
          "We enjoyed the catacombs. There were about 99 steps down to the viewing level. Watch where you step, but there are so many different areas to explore.",
          "Good place to visit if you happen to be in Alexandria. Keep about an hour for the visit. One need to climb down into the open well/pit to see the old graves and excavations. The steps are steep and narrow alleys, so people with knee pain or claustrophobic should decide before",
          "The catacomb burial of the Man, woman and child is a must visit to see how ornate the burial chamber was and the amount of planning that went in just to bury the dead. Its an interesting story how the catacomb was discovered by accident. The place was used as a garbage dumping",
          "Follow a medieval style stairwell underground to see multiple paths of tombs carved into stone walls. Was really cool to see. Walkways were not very stable, our guide even tripped a couple times, so I don\u2019t recommend for people with poor balance or using a cane etc.",
          "The place is very good, but lack of maintenance. There is the tourist police guarding the gates but the insides are very well maintained. Good experience but no proper regulation in place. Like all the tour operators could be moved in proper sequence, there was one time where we",
          "An easy spiral staircase takes you down to this 4c burial tomb. Whilst the chambers are empty shells there is an interesting chamber depicting Anubis the King of the Dead. Definitely worth a visit if you have time. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",
          "We visited Alexandria in July. One of the places we went to in Alexandria was the Catacombs. We got a taxi to the catacombs but they close at 4.30pm and we arrived just after 4pm.we paid the entrance fee and went in. The first impressions it look like a building site and was not",
          "The catacombs here are interesting but, definitely not like other catacomb sites around the world. There are no human bones to see, just walking in and viewing the areas of burial. There are some steps to go inside and the flooring all dirt and can be some small rocks, so wear",

          "We did this as part of a day trip to Alexandria and it is well worth the time it took to explore the catacombs. It is all part of the Roman influence and needs to be included in your trip.",
          "If you have seen catacombs in Paris, this is very disappointing. It's totally empty and apparently often partially flooded although the day we visited, it had recently been pumped. I would not make an effort to see this site. There's no photography allowed, but really, there's",
          "During our Alexandria sightseeing program we visited the Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa. This is an onetime repository for mummies - an underground vault for mummies. The place has Egyptian-Greco-Roman architecture and stone carvings.",
          "Its a bit far, walking/driving in narrow ally to reach it, But once you are there and go down the tomb to see the ancient grave yard and imaging what these people were doing and where they are, and how life changes, it really gave me goosebumps Dont miss it :)",
          "Not a lot to see actually. When we went down the steps and into the catacombs we did not have any lights. The generator was not working so our tour guide took out his cell phone and used the flashlight. It didn't provide enough light. My sister and I were disappointed both with",
          "This is one of the sights that you see in movies. When you experience it though, you keep expecting Indiana Jones at any moment. It is a very interesting place to visit. Since it is an old underground cemetery that was discovered about 100 years ago when someone's donkey fell",
          "A quick peep into the history of Egypt, where Egyptian culture blends into Roman culture. Bit claustrophobic, but nevertheless a good site to see. Must have a good guide to point out all the things of interest.",
          "Like most of Alexandria I wouldn't bother visiting it. You can't take photos so leave your camera in your car otherwise they'll keep it until you exit.",
          "Seems to be a highlight of Alex, but in reality more like a waste dump. History not taken care of. A pity.",
          "This is definitely the most well preserved catacombs worldwide........the unique thing about it is the mix between the ancient egyptian, greek and roman architecture and symbols. A must see in Alexandria and it is very near to Pompei pillar too.",
          "We were able to get into all three levels of the catacombs. The tombs are carved out of solid rock and are quite intersting",
          "Surprisingly, its location was unknown by several local people that we asked, including taxi drivers. Situated in one of the less affluent areas of town, it is just a EGP3 tuktuk ride from a Roman site - Pompey\u2019s Pillar. With a visitor\u2019s entry fee of EGP40, the second century",
          "It's not big and under maintenance. But there is one good tomb reserve the carving which combined pharaoh and Rome culture! And suggest that you can plan with the Pompey pillar as a package. Great representation of the Alex complexity! But be aware of the sunlight! I got",
          "They are well preserved tombs and very cool to explore. It requires more details for the tourists, so we know what they are about. It is also a very difficult place to find. Not far from Pompey's pillar.",
          "Need a guide for sure, for this excursion otherwise you don't get the full story. I ts a small place to visit and not easy to find unless you are a local.",
          "it was one of the places that surprised me cause i didn't know it was even existent in Alexandria , even though i am a inhabitant of the city .The issue of the place is the absence of any kind of information other than the ones written at the entry so i 'ld recommend going with",
          "Even if you are not a history buff like I am, this is a cool place to visit. It was found when a farmer's donkey fell through a hole in the ground and the farmer investigated. It is a catacomb of tombs but many interesting niches to check out. Also, for those of you who are",
          "Visited Catacombs at the end of summer hence it was quite warm. I would not recommend this site for anyone with mobility issues, the stairway into the Catacomb is steep, spiral and 99 stairs long (feels like double on the way back up). The Catacomb was amazing once inside,",
          "The Catacombs was the highlight of my day visit to Alexandria. I would recommend you do this tour without hesitation! I did travel here alone, and so I recommend a google read on it before entering to enjoy the history. Doing it alone (and then discovering I was entirely alone",
          "The catacombs are fascinating. There is a lot of history. They are different from the catacombs you see in Europe. It is a long climb down and a long climb back up. Much of the tour is walking along 2\"x12\" boards spanning across the water filled floor. As everyone is",
          "The catacombs offer a glimpse of the transitional period between ancient Egypt and Greco-Roman times. The frescoes blend both periods. They are well worth seeing if you have the time.",
          "It is a true amalgamation of the two cultures, egyptian and roman. Unassuming from the top but once you enter you cant help being amazed. must see in Alexandria.",
          "Historical places and its excellent please go there and see more about civilization in alexandria ..",
          "Must see place who admire archeology and tombs. Roman but essence of old Egyptian Kingdom culture. Well preserved. But the tombs are empty though due to water submerged issues. But u will feel the ambience I'm sure.",
          "For something entirely different and very interesting take this tour with a guide to explain what you are looking at in the underground discovery.",
          "This site is definitely a must-see for anyone touring Alexandria. The catacombs are located in a neighbourhood actually called Kom El Shoqafa, so some locals were confused that there was a tourist attraction of the same name. I recommend you take a taxi to Pompey's Pillar and",
          "Worth a visit while in Alexandria. It's not huge, but interesting to see the mixture of Pharonic and Greek/Roman styles in the carvings. Could be difficult to find if you're driving yourself, but drivers should know it. There is a large parking lot on site. Avoid trying to",
          "From the outside .. this place is in the middle of a residential area . surrounded by flats . ! Nothing to write home about from the outside . i thought that I had made a mistake visiting here , BUT ....I was surprised how much I enjoyed this place . I had read a good",
          "Very interesting historic site. I recommend you go with a guide to learn about what you are looking at. Creepy cool!",
          "For this attraction you will have to go underground, about 3 floors to be exact. If your claustrophobic i would not recommend this. Otherwise its something definitely worth checking out.",
          "The short walk down into the catacombs does not prepare you for just what is down there. The catacombs spread out and to learn about the roman rituals with their dead is very interesting. A bit claustrophobic for some but well worth the experience.",
          "The catacombs are literally in the middle of the city. It just looks like a flat piece of land until you walk down the stairs into the spooky place it is. a must visit in Alexandria.",
          "We walked through these underground caves where many bodies were at one time kept. There is also an area for animals. But of course they have all been removed. There are still some drawings on the walls with some color. It is fascinating just to see all the underground work.",
          "You'll need a guide to tell you what's going on and the history. Amazing catacombs carved out of the rock, initially a private tomb but later public burial ground, although presumably only for the rich and famous. Fantastic to see 2000 year old carvings with none of the usual",
          "I absolutely love the ancient history of this country and at times I think the the Ptolemaic period is overlooked, even by me. It was so nice to descend to this tomb and discover how different they were to the tombs of the Valley of the Kings and how the Egyptian Gods were",
          "Went here to on a day trip from Cairo ; historic city Alex - a few things to go to & enjoy around the place.",
          "We visited this place on our drive towards our Alexandria hotel and stopped for a short visit. Outwardly it doesn't look very much and walking down the spiral steps, you come to an area with lots of holes carved out from the walls where apparently the bodies are meant to be.",
          "It doesn't look like much from above ground, the site is a little run down but when you venture below it is really amazing to know the history of the catacombs. I recommend going with a guide to understand the history and the engineering feats below. Highly recommeded!!!!",
          "Mesmerizing history behind this site. We had a very good guide to explain all parts of the catacomb and the history behind it. we ended spending almost 2 hours here. Pompey's pillar is just walking distance from here which is worth a visit.",
          "The catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa in Alexandria, Egypt and is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Legend has it that in 1900, a donkey hauling a cart full of stone, made a misstep and disappeared into a hole in the ground, making one of the most astounding",
          "This is the only place in Alexandria that is compelling enough to visit. You go down spiral stairs to the second level where the burial chamber is located. The third level is under water. You must visit with a guide to understand the details. Behind the main three sarcophagus is",
          "Don't expect much from the signage and be careful where you step (loose boards balanced across stones) ... but even the kids will think this place is cool - especially if it is hot outside .... definitely one of the places not to miss in Alexandria ...",
          "the catacombs of the ancient romans and greek is an amazing place to visit. amazing history behind the place and the catacombs are a bit creepy, especially if u r scared of underground closed spaces. but it you can overcome that, its worth all your time and again a must see",
          "Its a little creepy as well as thrilling, when you go down the dark steps, in a spiral into the main burial chamber. And then most of the tombs are flooded...was Alexander buried here or not?",
          "The catacombs are located in downtown Alexandria. We went with a tour guide, but I can imagine that navigating your way there would be quite difficult independently haggling with a driver and all. The significance of the catacombs is that you find Roman and the Pharonic",
          "Make this a definite part of your plans when visiting Egypt! It was creepy and exciting. Absolutely breathtaking. I would go back if given the chance. Thanks for a great tour Mahmoud!",
          "Ninety-nine steps lead you down into the burial chamber. We do not know who is buried in the main burial room. In the adjoining rooms hundreds of mummies were found. Theses were friends?, family?, acquaintances?, or Strangers to the family. In later years the catacombs were",
          "The royal tomb in this complex is one of the most unique that I have seen in the eastern Mediterranean. That alone was worth the visit. The site is challenging to reach, however. I would recommend going with a guide or friend (which I did). Avoid if you are claustrophobic",
          "I happened to discover this site while in Egypt. The catacombs where relatively undiscovered by the public at that time. I have not been there in years but the preservation is incredible. I was the only person on the tour when I was there. The Airline that I flew home on had",
          "I think that this place is the most fascinating in Alexandria. The story alone of how it was found is incredible! I would visit early in the morning while it is still cool and you have all your energy. It requires you to walk and there is lots of stairs. Love this place!",
          "Alexandria reminded me so often of parts of France. A magical, historical place that has a large promenade, Mediterranean Sea and places like the catacombs which still show the blend of cultures back in the 2nd century. Right in the middle of downtown suburban Alexandria,",
          "For being considered One of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages... I expected more. The site is not well preserved, with flooded dirty water inside and ruined passages that are not clearly marked. It's the most expensive tour in Alexandria, and yet the worst infrastructure for",
          "From outside it looks nothing but when you go inside, this place seems like ghost tomb. there were so many caves and chambers to burry the dead. Engineering at its best considering the time it was built. A must place to visit in Alexandria.",
          "Incredibly beautiful tombs created by a loving couple. SUPERB artwork!! Please go if you can!! We were speechless upon seeing the Egytpian-Greco style of sculpture and images. Truly amazing - a combination of myths and culture. We were so grateful we made the effort to visit!",
          "I visited this place the same day I visited Pompey's Pillar, it was a good walk for me & checked the area in between. I wish that the officials in the Ministry of Antiquities will give great attention to those ancient sites & its surroundings.",
          "I recommend this to every person who loves Historical places. My kids had fun but not the 8 years daughter, she was scared. Catacomb of Kom el Shoqafa was started in the 2nd century A.D. and was used to intern the dead for the next 200 years. This was a period in the history",
          "The classic view of Ancient Egyptian tombs from the Valley of the Kings took place over 1500 years before this site at which you can see the blending of Roman and Egyptian customs. This was the last hurrah for Egyptian religion before the introduction of Christianity to Egypt,",
          "Diving under ground in a journey through mazes of corridors, we discovered the greatest mix of ancient Egyptian- Roman architecture tombs which was discovered in 1901 and still in great shape.",
          "since I am live in Alexandria form long time I just had visit one of the most beautiful monuments and Catacombs , the story is amazing how a small donkey made a huge discovery , no world can draw the beautiful picture of what you will see . also You can buy photos/postcards",
          "This is an interesting place for a visit, especially because it's a bizarre combination of Greco-Roman and ancient Egyptian art. The more modern conquerors tried to copy the Egyptian style of art, and it ends up looking pretty funky.",
          "Sadly anything that requires a taxi will be a lot of effort in Alexandria as the effort of picking a price and tolerating the nagging for more is tedious (at least for me, maybe there's a way I don't know of). The catacombs themselves are ok. The guide who's job it is to wait in",
          "Not sure what the flooding will do to the catacombs - so go now incase something is damaged later by the water! I had a lot of fun navigating the tombs over the planks ontop of the water. Fun experience",
          "One of the key highlights of Alexandria. A fascinating experience. However, the place and its surrounding area is quite run down at present. Needs better maintenance.",
          "The catacombs themselves are amazing as is the story behind them, but getting to this location is a task and the neighborhood is unsightly.",
          "A piece of rather neglected history well worth the effort to discover. Has 'atmosphere' in spades. Not for the infirm, or claustrophobic, as has steps, wobbly duckboard walks and confined spaces.",
          "so much to see here but it felt unsafe. walking on planks on top of dirty subterranean water with a high chance of falling off is not acceptable if you pay a fee. there was minimal lighting so doing it without a torch is not recommended.",
          "These catacombs make for an underground walk full of atmosphere... as long as there are no tour buses out front. The small spaces become crowded quickly and being down there with rowdy disinterested teens from somewhere quickly dissipates the charm. The site's signage is",
          "A fascinating site , I am sure this place is very important historically and it appeared to have remains from several different epochs . It is sadly neglected though and desperately needs investment - to include information boards and professional guides as well as just amenity",

          "This is well worth a visit , for it's place in history and architecture. Make sure you have a local guide to take you around , they make it so much more safer & interesting.",
          "The tombs constructed 250 meters under ground.... so artistically and strategically built in those times with very lessor minimum technologies is stunning... the paintings and carvings are amazing",
          "Can't find interesting things here. Nothing in particular. At first, the ticketing staff told us that cameras are not allowed. When they noticed us of losing interest to enter the site, immediately informing us that we can use of mobile camera instead. Why? Because they are",
          "I went there at the peak of summer in Alexandria. But, the visit of the catacomb was very exciting, though the weather was hot. In the catacomb, you might wonder and observe by yourself the blend of art: Romans and Egyptian style in decorating the walls. Some of the sarcophagi",

          "The catacombs were on our itinerary with Emo Tours from Cairo. It was an amazing historical site and one which should not be missed. The site is very easy to miss as it is not very large and in a back street. What a wonderful relief from the hot sun. It is amazing that all",
          "It was interesting to learn about these catacombs and how they worked to uncover them. The lower levels stunk of stagnant water (very musty), however the carvings showed the mixture of both ancient Roma-Greco and Egyptian art and beliefs which was cool.",
          "I advise every one comes to Alexandria and interesting in history to visit this place it is one of few in this world the catacombs .",
          "Was amazing to see and a really great experience, highly recommend it. I did not go with a tour guide so didn't get much of the history and background, but was still very interesting to see.",
          "We visited the Catacombs in Alexandria as part of a private day tour by EMO tours. I recommend them and strongly recommend you visit these Catacombs. You need good shoes and be fit enough to walk up and down steps so not ideal for young children, the elderly or those with",
          "I like this place, though it is hard to go there on hot summer day. But it is full of history. Specially Caracalla Hall. It is lot of tales about that time of Alexandria's history.",
          "I was amazed with this historical site. so much of history and interesting to walk down to the chambers. would have benefitted from a guide to explain all the different chambers and perhaps the tourism authorities can capitalize on this gem of a place by taking the visitors",
          "A very interesting look into \u2018burying\u2019 corpses in the past. !!! Warning: Do not, under no circumstances visit the WC at this site. It is absolutely disgusting. And they even want money when you visit the toilet!!! It\u2019s a disgrace! You have been warned.",
          "The journey to reach the catacombs is a bit away from the city center and when i arrived i was surprised to see that there were only about 3 catacombs with few drawings left. You won't probably need more than 30 minutes to see the whole thing which compared to the prices and the",
          "The Catacombs are in a very poor area and the journey to it takes you through some extremely narrow, overcrowded streets. We were rushed around by a guide, who was only interested in collecting his fee at the end of the whirl wind tour. All we got out of the tour was: Roman,",
          "Like most of Alexandria, the catacombs are just a little sad and hokey... It's interesting enough, just go without expecting too much.",
          "Had a good time visiting here. Go early, before the crowds, and have a guide to explain stuff. Exploring the catacombs was a lot of fun and it really brought out the little kid in me who wanted to be Indiana Jones.",

          "The construction of the burial site is impressive. The spiral construction going down the earth is really fascinating.",
          "Although I've been living in Alexandria for more than 20 years, it was my first time to go to this place with a friend and her family from Cairo, luckily they have a car otherwise it was a bit difficult to go by myself and there was a guide there who helped a lot. It's worth to",
          "These catacombs dating from second & third century AD are worth a visit. They show how pharaonic, greed and roman mythologies mixed at that time in Alexandria. We visited with a guide and felt that we would have missed a lot if we visited alone.",

          "As soon as you hit the spiral staircase to the moment you come back up the entire experience is unique. Seeing all the tombs with the burial carvings and ancient hieroglyphics really takes you back in time. The floors are very uneven so make sure you wear good walking shoes.",
          "I was disappointed on entry at having to hand over my camera, especially as so many locals appear to ignore the rules. But, no camera meant I could focus on the beautiful carving of the catacombs. The deep well like catacombs are by far the highlight of the visit, if you're",

          "The property and display of items made me feel like I was at a garage sale...it was sad to have such beautiful relics strewn across the lawn. In addition, the catacombs had unstable boards to walk along and there are not signs or guides to provide details on what you are",
          "I have been to the tombs in Rome but these I found more interesting. Maybe it was my Guide and the way he told the story.... Nonetheless I was in awe of how these were built and the carvings told the story. I loved the \" shrine\" of the horse bones that belonged to the animal who",

          "We had a great visit -there was only one other small group in the catacombs at the time. I would imaging that if it got crowded, some people would find it uncomfortable. Very interesting - more so if you have a Guide Book with information or a local guide. This is a huge burial",

          "The Catacombs are a fascinating part of Alexandria's history. Take care descending the spiral stairs and watch out for uneven floors. It is easier on the climb back up. at the bottom you walk on planks which bounce a bit. It is handy to have a guide to interpret the carvings.",

          "You get to walk down (and later back up) about 90 stairs. You walk on uneven poorly lit surfaces and unsteady boards. The whole thing is a little erie like catacombs are supposed to be. The whole experience gives you a feel for the funeral rites in the 2nd to 4th centuries.",

          "Definitely an interesting site to see. The site is situated in the middle of some buildings and I believe it was unearthed on accident. The tombs were not used, but the structure remains. You can only go about 3 floors down because they hit water after that point. It's very",

          "Kom El-Dekka Site (Roman amphitheater) is in Alexandria - founded by Alexander the Great. It was a \u2018well-off\u2019 residential area in Graeco-Roman times, with lovely villas, bathhouses and a theatre. The amphitheater is a marble theater that once seated 800 spectators. This site",
          "Romans ,the people who were great thinker s and meet near theatres and exchange their ideas.This may be the place in the ancient time ,open air theatre,amphitheater ,where on one spot,if you stand and shout,you can hear echo of your sound.So they could address the people sitting",
          "I\u2019m not even sure it was reconstructed correctly. Interesting artifacts above the amphitheater worth seeing.",
          "It is the only roman amphitheatre in Egypt. The marble seats are still visible. There are nice mosaic of birds and some long baths are still visible",
          "This site was rediscovered by happenstance not that long ago. Besides the small amphitheater there are remains of baths and walls of undefined purposes.",
          "Right in the heart of Alexandria. Easy to find and worth the visit. The staff are very friendly and helpful.",
          "This is situated within the city and nice to walk around in the evening, the day time is very hot and humid. This is one of the great theatrical ambiance created by the Romans. Beautiful with historical vales.",
          "It was nice to get out and walk around. They are still excavating and discovering new things. It was neat to walk around and take photos of the place. Not an easy walk for people with mobility issues, lots of stairs. Be sure to visit the building in the back corner to see some",
          "there you can imagine how my ancestors were studding, and you can even listen to the music if you are lucky you can attend one of the concert parties.",
          "I had never seen a Roman amphitheater before so this was all very interesting to me. And of course, it is a fair sized complex with baths and various other facilities. Present day Alexandria covers much that is not excavated so like many ancient sites, we can only guess what",
          "Don't miss the Villa of the Birds. It's hidden away in the far corner of the archeological site in a small building. It has the most wonderful intact floor mosaics of beautiful birds.",
          "Yes, it\u2019s a Roman amphitheater and yes it\u2019s super cool. But, that\u2019s all there is to it. It\u2019s worth visiting and standing in the spot where, if you speak, your voice echoes perfectly due to the precise acoustics of the location. But, you can complete the entire tour in 5-10",
          "It can be a amphitheater or may be a university auditorium in ancient time. Over all a nice place to spend time in the afternoon.",
          "Definitely worth the visit. Like so many places in Alexandria, we had the place to ourselves, except for the ubiquitous cats and some good natured dogs. Lots of nooks and crannies to poke around in. Great photo ops. And a nice palate cleaner if you're a little templed out ;)",

          "When in Alexandria, make sure and stop at this ruin to see a typical Greco-Roman amphitheater and Roman bath house. It was very interesting.",
          "I thought that this site was pretty kept up nicely. Some nice photo shots. Ruins are pretty typical for most amphitheaters. They do tend to look very much alike. This was very urban compared to many others though.",
          "Fine, but not extremly interesting. I expected more of Alexandria, being once such an important city.",

          "Kudos to Alexandria for the condition and cleanliness of this beautiful amphitheater. well worth the visit",

          "You can't wonder around the site but it's part of the attractions if you haven't seen a roman amphitheater before, well kept, clean and easy to access.",
          "The amphitheater is the most intact item in this ruined city\u2019s. There\u2019s some remnants of Roman baths, temple and other buildings. Some nice mosaics. Best part there\u2019s no one to pedal their wares.",
          "This is great. It\u2019s like lots of different Roman ruins. The interesting part is all the items they excavated from the Mediterranean. Definitely worth checking out.",

          "We happened to arrive shortly before closing so we didn't have a lot of time but I felt like it was enough. We had no tour guide and it may have been worth the extra money if they offered one (not sure if they do). You can see the theatre from the outside but it's still worth",

          "Roman Amphitheater located at Alexandria down town. Nice place to capture photos for memories. Also you can do walkthrough to do shopping .",
          "The whole area has ongoing archaeological excavations, so you can see the statified layers- fascinating. The Roman theatre has great accoustics, so do try them out, stand on the stone in the middle. There are also artifacts from the sunken city on display",
          "A wonderful visit to make while in the city. It should take you 45 minute max to go through the place.",
          "Well preserved piece of history. Does involve uneven ground and steps. You are not allowed to climb onto the levels but there is the \u2018echo\u2019 spot on the ground for you to speak and hear your own voice which is cool. There is also a Roman home here to walk inside with lovely",
          "Amidst the hectic traffic of Alexandria: a heaven of peace. Admire the many grades of the amphitheatre, surely not the largest in the world but surely one of the most beautiful. One can immagine how it must have been so many centuries ago. Worth a visit.",
          "Kom El Dikka archaeological excavations and conservation and restoration works is a Polish-Egyptian project. Before archaeologists from the University of Warsaw began to excavate this site in the 1960s, it looked like what the name suggests -- literally a \"hill of rubble.\" Now,",

          "The place needs some TLC. However, if you love history and understand the transition process, you will love it and be mesmerized by how beautiful (gotta close your eyes to see the beauty) it is. If not, you are likely to simply go, walk around, see the trash , read a bit and",
          "I did not expect this high-quality services with this reliable prices. I gonna recommend Travelish tours to my colleges in Uni Bremen and the professional Tours organizer Momo. Big Like",
          "Again, as we were in Alexandria we tried to see as much as we could in our one day. This site is actively being restored, but we found it an interesting way to pass 30 minutes. Our local guide again provided us with information regarding the site and it's history. We were able",

          "This is the ruins of a Roman amphitheatre which was later excavated. Students of history will find this attraction very interesting. The semicircular open air theatre was used for music programmes. There are a few old lecture theatres which shows how the Roman students were",
          "We were on our way to Pompey's Pillar and stopped by here for a minute. Having seen other Roman Amphitheatres, I knew what it was in an instant. Like others have said, take a look from the outside (there are roads running almost all the way around it). You may want to just",

          "Although excavation is ongoing at the Amphitheater it is still worth one's time. It is the oldest Roman theater in Egypt. To me it's another reminder of how expansive the Roman Empire extended. You will also see a magnificent villa of birds and Bacchus mosaic.",
          "Lots of excavation work currently going on as they\u2019ve discovered a Roman villa and bath house adjacent. It\u2019s still definitely worth a visit and a very peaceful place to sit in the afternoon. They\u2019ve also got some ruins there from the Lighthouse of Pharos",

          "In the midst of traffic mayhem that is Alexandria, this excavation is a bit tranquility. The oldest surviving Roman theatre in Egypt and maybe even more important, the Villa of the Birds, with its magnificent mosaics of birds and a Bacchus mosaic (from elsewhere in the city).",
          "According to our guide there is some thought that this site is in fact a university. The amphitheater was used as a lecture hall...try out the echo and sound effects! Other rooms are thought to be classrooms and dormitories. There is also a Roman bath. And the bird tiles are a",
          "If you haven\u2019t visited Rome but want to see some Ruins, this is the stop you need to make. It\u2019s little like a tiny Forum (across from the Colosseum in Rome). It\u2019s fun for a stop, but don\u2019t plan to spend any extensive time here.",

          "What an extraordinary find, once buried in Egypt is now open to explore. A large complex including the baths, amphitheater, academic chambers, mosaic floors, and more. Definitely a treasure of Athens. Happy to highly recommend it to others.",
          "Alexandria was a major hub of learning, arts and culture bustling with scholars, students and patrons. These remains are evidence of that- a flourishing society. What was their life like? What caused its demise? Sadly that the Egyptian Government doesn't think it has a story to",

          "I have been visitingAlexandria regularly for the last 45 years, yet this was my first visit to this site. It was magical, and was enjoyed by all the member of the family. It is amazing how clever and effective the theater was designed to amplify the sound without distortion.",

          "To be asking 40 EGYP for entry to this place is a bit steep to say the least. Sure it is a historical place and maybe it pays for the upkeep but not worth the entry price unless you are die-hard history lover/archaelogist.",

          "very nice place to visit, the roman life in Egypt was very rich and amazing, the roman amphitheatre really good",
          "Was not impressed with this site I must say, felt like just another hole in the ground to attract tourist. Was not worth the visit I think.",
          "Nice interesting place. Ticket`s price 40 EGP for 1 person (the same proce for residents and foregniers- what is really nice from them!! ) I spent really nice time there!",
          "It is not my first vist but i wanted to take my daughters this time I love the Roman theatre it is not that big but it is nice and unfortunately bathrooms are horrible and forgot about the bird palace over there actually there is nothing.",
          "One of the few amphitheaters that have been re-purposed for today's use. Local concerts and theater is staged here. Small but fairly complete.",
          "After having seen Roman amphitheaters in other places like Italy, England, and Jordan, this was very disappointing. Its small...about 1/20th of the size of others but still a little cool if you have already visited other sites like the citadel.",
          "It's just a short walk from the train station. Google maps will get you there. I found it difficult to speak to locals compared to Cairo, but if you have a map, hand gestures should suffice. Free entry. 10 minute excursion you should fit in, if you are there for one day.",
          "Im a history buff so this was a must see for me... I loved it. Wished the Villa of the Birds didnt require another ticket but security is pretty lax",
          "This site was clean and that was surprisingly. This is more a small theatre than an amphitheatre for sporting events. It's a great place to sit and dwell on the activities of the past occupants.",
          "the place is mediocre , it doesn't have much to see , if you have been to the amphitheatre in rome or malaga there is no need to visit this place cause it basically has nothing to see other than the egyptian employers, if not you could pay it a visit but what's in the photo is",
          "Really liked seeing the old Amphitheater. The site is clean and well maintained. One of the things that I like was sitting in the stands and wondering if Alexander himself may have spoke to the people here. There are also some old artifacts here but the Amphitheater is the",
          "I had not expected to visit this place when my guide brought me here. I was surprised at the scale of it. This represents the city's ancient Roman past. There are people who work there who will try to show you special places for photos.",
          "not much to see here, the place can be checked from out through the wall. So unless you have a tour guide to tell you something about the history of the place, I wouldn't recommend you waste your time.",
          "Not much to see here but a cool little stop. You must be sure stand on teh center stone in the amphitheatre and here your voice resonate in the space. guide was great and had a good knowledge explaining how there were greek and roman remnants here. there were also some",
          "There is really not a lot to see other than this famous picture. It's a quick trip. 30 EP is the cost.",
          "Adjacent to the main railway station, the visitor\u2019s entrance fee is EGP30. The 800 seat Roman Amphitheatre forms part of a site that continues to be excavated. Although easily accessed at ground level, steps take visitors down to the subterranean level which is now open to the",
          "Spend the time to stop buy this place. You will love it, the only downfall is that it is a small place and not many things to see, BUT what is there is excellent. MAKE SURE you stand on the mark in the amphitheater and talk. Will will be amazed at what you hear. It was designed",
          "Yes it is a glimpse of Rome; in Egypt. a wonderful feeling and its amazing to see the artifacts that have been recovered from beneath the sea by divers. Place has a wonderful ambiance.",
          "The place is currently under restoration, but the roman theater part is open to visitors, There is a spot there where the singers would stand and the echoes can only be heard in that one spot, was great to experience it.",
          "This smaller attraction certainly is a wonderful place to learn about the roman's. The amphitheatre was made in such a way that to stand in the right spot you can be heard all over the ruins are very intriguing.",
          "A beautiful part of history in the city. As everything else in Egypt you have to pay just to enter and everything is neglected and not clean, but worthwhile to go there.",
          "Not just the ampitheatre, but a Roman villa with ongoing excavations of an original, in-situ mosaic floor. Also other fascinating ruins and items recovered from the port of Alexandria.",
          "I have visited the Roman Amphitheater sight today..it's a wonderful place ..it needs some restoration ..but the ruins of the buildings shows how the Greco-Roman period in Alexandria was great ..and you can see that obviously in Villa of Birds which has mosaics panels depicting",
          "No one lives in Alex without visiting the roman theater, pompey pillar, catacombs, cracalla tomb, Islamic citadel qaiutbay and other monument",
          "By comparison, this is a new discovery only found in the 1960's. It is a run down site but the ancient amphitheatre was amazing to see with the coloumns and marble, the seat numbers and the other buildings with the ancient red brick walls. Highly recommended.",
          "Located a few steps from the main train station of Alexandria. This is the most complete Roman ruin in Egypt. It was a small amphetheatre used for music and the reading of poetry and dates from the 2nd century AD. Other ruins have been excavated on the site. These include a",

          "Very interesting that the roman empires influence extended this far. This is the only one of its kind in Egypt. Well worth a visit if in Alexandria.",
          "This is a must on your list to visit when you are in Alexandria. One can feel amazed that they are around ancient ruins that was once full of life. It is full of history so study up before you go.",
          "A very beautiful place to visit, I visited the coliseums in room back in 2000, and today I felt same feelings. It's just an amazing place to spend couple of hours exploring old civilisation. We walked around my family and I and enjoyed it a lot. I wished if they had a gift shop",
          "very nice historical place to be visited u will visit it several time it gives an idea how great was this civilization",
          "This place really takes you back by several centuries. The architecture is so devised, I believe that without the modern electronic gadgets, one can hear clearly whatever one said from the stage! The ruins are still almost full. The accompanying garden is also nicely planned.",
          "and speak-out to the audience that would have sat in the amphitheater. Just do it - and you'll find out why! So cool, and unreal.",
          "Grab a tour guide! Amazing that you can still touch ruins and explore. We learned about evacuations still occurring. Head to the dive shop, too learn about the underwater explorations.",
          "My child is interested in archaeology and the main reason why I decided to visit Roman Theater was she. And actually I could not imagine that this sight would touch her so deeply. We even did not read the descriptions of the sight which are at the right side from the entrance",

          "The main ruins of Alexandria excavated by a Polish mission in the past 40 years. The area open to the public is limited but one can have an idea of the beauty of the city. One can ask the guards to open the Roman house which has exquisite mosaics. Highly recommended!",
          "Amazing sights of historic artifacts found in the mediteranian. Fascinating area to see. Great for a short stop along the way. 30 - 40 minutes will be enough to take it all in and see it all.",
          "You can see the roman theater...and some granite columns and the birds villa with nise mosaic flooring",
          "This was a really cool area, especially the information on the statues that were uncovered from the Mediterranean. It's disheartening though to think about the amount of technology and advancement that is lost when each great civilization falls",
          "It was a nightmare to find - even the local who went with us struggled. Was nice to see but I don't think it was really worth all the effort",
          "a nice example of the roman monuments still reserved worth the visit while in Alexeandria there's low fees!",
          "Of course one of the beauties of Egypt is seeing all the different ages and cultures in one place. To have access to such a mind-blowing amphitheatre is amazing. The experience itself however is very HOT and a little dangerous. The sun beats down without shade or a visitor",
          "The roman amphitheatre was a big disappointment for us, having seen bigger buildings in Turkey. The condition of the site isn't good and possibly Alexandria should look at improving the site. No tourists, no revenue.",
          "Egypt and Alexandria has so much to offer. The roman amphitheater is not worth spending time on. The theater is extremely small and there are many other places that have more to show. Save the theaters for Italy. Very little has been done to make this interesting. Not many words",
          "I enjoyed being able to walk around and look at the statues etc. that they have on display. I also appreciated the history and the fact that it is still used. I was with a tour group so we were escorted by security our entire trip, but to be honest I don't know how comfortable",
          "Nice place, in the middle of the City, showing people the History of Alexandria Roman times. I wish it would finally completed restoration work, and tourists could access the rest of the complex.",
          "what started as an excavation site with only most of the amphitheatre visible somce 30 years ago, has now evolved into a huge monument site with roads, arches, baths and smaal shops are around. alexandria is visibly on this site a city of layers, one on top of the other",
          "Very well maintained and is highly recommended to anyone travelling to this part of Egypt. It had been built very similar to the Roman Amphitheater. Very nice even though",
          "It was a small amphitheatre used for music, It amazed me that it sat underground for so long right there. It was lovely.",
          "As this was listed on tourist guides , visited this ancient site and was surprised with old buildings and excavation in progress. This needs to be marketed more and recommend that they have a guide who can explain the significance of the buildings or alternatively some audio",
          "An impressive place. Must have been something in its heyday. One can almost imagine sitting there at night watching a play under the night sky.",
          "The mosaic of the birds hidden away in the corner of the site is beautiful and not to be missed. Excavations continue and there is so much more to see than a few years ago, but there are less recovered artefacts on display as they are now in museums and you can no longer sit in",
          "The amphitheatre is an interesting place to visit. Ok, there are more beautiful ones in the world, but this one is nice. Do not forget to take a look at the house of the birds. You do not have to buy a ticket. It was closed, you can get the idea of the mansion from looking",
          "You can walk around the Amphitheatre without being pestered by people purporting to be guides, we were never approached and freely wandered and able to take as many photographs as we wanted. Well worth a visit, in fact would say it is a must see!",
          "This was one of the few historical sites we visited that seemed put together. There's currently a Polish excavation project in the works there which was fun to watch.",
          "its amazing place. everybody can see it. our history. i visited it twice with my friends and family .",
          "This archeological complex is one of the hidden gems of Alexandria. The most famous part of it is the impressive roman amphitheater. But the complex has a lot more to offer. Including study chambers, a roman bath, a residential quarter, a house (named: Bird's house) with amazing",
          "This little villa is a great way to spend an hour or 2. The roman ruins are magnificent without being too much. The Villa with the beautiful tiles shows you a great picture you must see.",
          "Definitely not worth the trip, you have to pay more to see the whole site and it's not that interesting.",
          "This Roman theater and the surrounding ruins was only discovered in the mid 20th century so the theater is in great condition. Make sure you stand in the orators position and test the acoustics. Incredible. Try quoting some Shakespeare.",
          "This is an interesting historic site uncovered only relatively recently . Its well preserved and much excavation is still being done nearby. There are lots of other statues in the area to see.",
          "Well unless your really into this type of thing I would stay away. Its not all that large and a lot of the area is closed of or you then have to pay extra to see more",
          "The Roman amphitheater reminds me of Rome, same design and structure, just in Egypt. They are still excavating the site but to learn that this was just discovered 60 years ago is really mind blowing. They still use the theatre today for small gatherings.",
          "really very beautiful. right in centre of city near train station. I was the only person there..amazing piece's of sculpture dotted around",
          "Loved the history told to me by my tour guide about the place. It's really something when you think about it. Our world is so small but back then it was uncharted territory. I would recommend a tour of this place without hesitation.",
          "This is a gorgeous place to visit. There are two sections to this place and two different tickets as well. I have only done the amphitheatre section both times. If you are a photo guru this is a great place to visit when the sun is shining to get great photos off the ruins. A",
          "If you are in Alexandria, why not stop by and see the amphitheater. It is very small, and only fairly recently excavated...not nearly as impressive as some others (Aspendos, Ephesus). However, it is in good condition and easy to access. One fun thing is the acoustic \"center\"",
          "It is a small place and you can visit the whole in half an hour. Walk down to the spot where you can hear your amplified voice. Its quite interesting and you can sing a song its fun. Apart from that there are some objects on display, some paintings and a bird bath.",
          "This place is comparably small to the other ancient theathres there are. Still, it's worth a stroll to see the remains of Roman influence in Egypt. I watched the film Agora that sets in Alexandria. It probably doesn't screen this place tough. But visiting it could reproduce our",
          "The ruins are evidence of a time when the Romans ruled the world, they have been simply every where. I understand Helen of Troy was hiding here for a time as well.",
          "As amphitheatres go this one is not all that spectacular, but it's interesting nonetheless because of its historic relevance and age. There are numerous statues and treasures uncovered from underwater around the top of the amphitheatre. And don't miss the spot on the ground",
          "It's a very well conserved but not very protected roman amphitheater. It's a sweet and romantic place to wonder around.",
          "The roman amphitheatre is a small place to visit. What i didn't appreciate that there isn't a guide service or any legend that explain what you are seeing.In Alexandria museum the Roman amphitheatre section explain a lot more than the live place. For the price is cheap for",
          "Spent an hour or so wandering here. Interesting to see what's left of old Rome but not as spectacular as some others I've seen.",
          "The morning after we arrived in Alexandria by train from Cairo, we visited this Roman ruin. A wonderful place to walk around. Just a short time is needed. Easy to get to because right in the heart of the city. Well worth it if you are in the area and have a few days to explore",
          "ancient and amazing place to see in alexandria. It remounts to the period of roman occupation in Egypt",
          "I enjoyed walking around the Amphitheatre. Its small so it won't take much time to do and its nice to see the Roman influences in Alexandria.",
          "The Amphitheater was smaller than I expected, but still remained standing after so many years. This relic of roman civilization will take you back in time. However, there is nothing else to see or do. 15 minutes will more than suffice to visit this place.",
          "Brilliant architecture.. Always wonder how people designed such beautiful building. If you are in alexandria, you must visit this place",
          "Egypt is a place of great historical importance and this place offers a glimpse of the Roman Era in Egypt. If you love to explore historical places, this is a must see in Egypt.",
          "A lot of interesting ruins and historical finds, love hearing the history and most importantly this is one of its kind in Egypt so you wont find anything like this anywhere else in the country",
          "Set away from the main road this is a fab place to spend an afternoon. Take time to wander through the ruins, admire the findings from the deep sea dive and visit the villa of the birds on the far side. They're currently renovating the mosaics and they are truly something to be",
          "The amphitheatre speaks well about the Roman influence in Egypt. However, it looked like more ruins than history that had to speak.",
          "The area there is so nice, specially those underground passages however there is no security at all in the area, and there is a clear sign of negligence, this place need intensive care... the transportation from & to is easy, so easy in fact",
          "For better or worse, the Romans left a big foot print in the Mediterranean and this amphitheatre is another one of it's marvels. Yes it's another ruin, but the site is amazing. The acoustics from the sweet spot of the amphitheatre is incredible, where a small voice can be",
          "The Roman Amphitheatre, and surrounding area that they are unearthing, helps you see how many cultures have been part of the city of Alexandria. Although it was not an incredible ruin compared to others in the world, it is nonetheless an interesting one...if you are getting an",
          "very interesting, and strangely quiet down below the hustle and bustle of the Alexandria streets. Was fascinated by the live dig going on.",
          "This place looks like an archaeological dig. The cut-marble seating, columns, and smaller chambers are all intact. It's easy to imagine the place when it was in use. There is a path above the amphitheater that leads to an enclosed chamber with signs indicating that excavation",
          "Just soak into this site. Try voice modulation and see the difference in your own voice when you face the audience side. Impressive how they designed it in a manner to allow winds carry your sound waves.",
          "Its all damaged and is all against the expectations that i had. you can't go inside and have to view it from a distance.",
          "Remember this is the only Amphithatre in the whole of egypt. Which is a bit of a shock i must say. It is not very big and they have placed a few things they have found in the sea (quite nice) You will not need long at the place. They are still digging in the area so i am sure",
          "There is a place to stand in front of the audience, where if you speak, the accoustics are perfect! Worth trying! 30 minutes unless you really know your history!",
          "Not really alot there considering it is quite a treck to get there but better than when we went 11 years ago.",
          "I am very like such a place to spend my time and that is wonderful construction with white and gray marbles. semi circulars and steps great place/ built by great people",
          "Not much is left after all these years, but what remains is very cool. You can actually stand in the middle and hear the acoustics at work. The villa is an additional ticket, you are allowed to wonder alone by the back building but to get inside and really see the mosaics up",
          "The good thing about this site is that actually proves there was an enormous Greek and Roman city here once, because there is barely anything else left to let you know this. There is a very well preserved little theatre, a few columns and some odds and ends statuary to look at ,",
          "You don't need to spend a lot of time here. (less then 20 minutes). But its pretty interesting to see an old Roman Amphitheatre. There are mosaics that are pretty beautiful to see. You can also get some neat pictures here. Good place to get Post cards outside with the street",
          "It is stunning!! Hard to believe the engineering that it took to build it. It a well worth a visit with all the stone sculptures and pieces of other major sites",
          "Really gives you a sense of history, Ancient Rome in Alexandria. The home of Cleopatra and Marc Anthony.",
          "very nice and interesting attraction, really interesting but very dirty... I can express well my disappoint to see a little jewellery like it dirty... prices are different between egyptian and european... of course... this is special Egypt welcome for us!",
          "Amongst all the hussle of the busy city and just 5 minutes from the train station sits the Roman Amphlteatre. Costs 20 Egyptain pounds(EP) to get in. Great place to walk around and be able to imagine what things were like in Roman times. Not too far from the national museum (35",

          "When I am in Egypt I live practically next door to this wonderful excavation. Most public sights cost about 26 LE to enter and I think this is about the same. It is a wonderful example of it's kind and probably the world's finest example to date. The history of this wonderful",
          "it sounds so good as an historical place, i liked it so much because i like such places , so if you like historical places you have to visit it",
          "I have never seen such Amphitheatre like this before my visit to Alexandria. It has beautiful ancient architecture, very nice place.",
          "Beautiful ancient ruin with nice preservation. If you visit the am phi theatre, try to sing or make sound in the middle of the theatre on the cylindric stone and you will ear your voice echoing only when you stand on the stone, if you move a bit from he stone your echoing voice",
          "I had never seen a Roman Amphitheatre before, so this was an interesting experience for me. We visited in the middle of the day, so it was quite hot. Make sure and wear a hat and sunscreen. A real gem surrounded by modernity!",
          "We cal it the roman theatre and they make concerts in it in summer :)",
          "I have had the blessing of attending few musical events at the Roman Amphitheater. Everything about this place is fabulous, it is so alive and it takes you back to the Roman time. A must visit during your stay in Alexandria.",
          "I took couple of my Saudi friends there, its really an old place where you can see the old Villas and the old Theater. Nice place and huge parking, not crowded at all!",
          "This is supposedly the only Roman amphitheatre in all of Egypt. Don't forget to check out some bird mosaics on what used to be the floor of a burnt down Roman villa (just behind the amphitheatre). I paid 20 LE for the Roman Theatre and 15 LE to see the Bird\u2019s Villa of Kom",
          "For those people interested in seeing where the Romans have been, this amphitheatre is well worth a visit. Its quite small, and would possibly have been a private amphitheatre. It was only discovered during the 1960's. There are two sections of original mosaic floor, and",
          "this place is really huge and interesting, easily accessible by many means of transportation, dating back to the grecko-roman era it had seen many historical events so be prepared and read before you go",
          "We loved this site, thanks to our guide Zach, did great job telling us all history of Alexandria as we sit on the stone benches of this lovely old place , thank you Zach ,it was a great lecture.",
          "Different in that Roman, as opposed to Greek or Egyptian. If you have seen other well preserved amphitheaters and forums, not worth visiting unless you are a student of the Roman period. Otherwise worth a short visit, although most of the site can be seen from the outside.",
          "nicely preserved though incongruously set amidst a college grounds. can still see the roman numerals inscribed on the seats of kings long gone... fascinating,",
          "It was nice to see but again as all the places in Egypt this place needs some restoration and maintenance. The place is actually visible from outside but if you really want to be in the Arena you must go down the stairs.",
          "Iit's fascinating to see the Roman antiquities that have either survived the mass building over the centuries or those that are reappearing and are being newly appreciated and conserved. The mosaics in the Villa of Birds are particularly worth seeing. The amphitheatre is in the",

          "that Roman Amphitheatre is a nice visit that is easy to be achived and also easy to reach while you are in Alexandria, it is a walkable distance from El Raml Station area in the heart of Alexandria and opposit side of the main Railway station of Alexandria as well. it is",
          "Very interesting site in very good condition. My friend's wife and children were even finding potsherds in the gravel around the site.",
          "This was our first site on our Alexandria daytrip, but I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. It was much smaller than I anticipated, so perhaps Amphitheatre is the wrong word for it (Odeum is the other name for it). The site offers some good contrast to the modern city",

Stratigakis and other cultural bodies.\nThe apartment was leased by The Cavafy International Committee in 1991, and opened to the public on 16 November 1992.The entrance was free until 2014. Now the tickets are 15 L.E. and 5 L.E. for students.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThere are other museums dedicated to Cavafy in other cities, including a newly opened museum in Plaka, Athens.The poet and his living place were mentioned many times in Lawrence Durell's Alexandria Quartet, and Where the Tigers Were: Travels through Literary Landscapes by Don Meredith.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe small-size museum displays letters, notes and poems written by Cavafy, Many portraits, drawings and photographs of Cavafy and close friends, a room dedicated to writer and close friend Stratis Tsirkas as it was his room when he lived with Cavafy for some time.

It is both a commemoration of the Library of Alexandria that was lost in antiquity, and an attempt to rekindle something of the brilliance that this earlier center of study and erudition represented. The idea of reviving the old library dates back to 1974, when a committee set up by Alexandria University selected a plot of land for its new library. Construction work began in 1995 and, after some US$220 million had been spent, the complex was officially inaugurated on 16 October 2002. In 2010, the library received a donation of 500,000 books from the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France (BnF). The gift makes the Bibliotheca Alexandrina the sixth-largest Francophone library in the world.\nThe library has shelf space for eight million books, with the main reading room covering 20,000 square metres (220,000 sq ft). The complex also houses a conference center; specialized libraries for maps, multimedia, the blind and visually impaired, young people, and for children; four museums; four art galleries for temporary exhibitions; 15 permanent exhibitions; a planetarium; and a manuscript restoration laboratory.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea of reviving the old library dates back to 1974, when a committee set up by Alexandria University selected a plot of land for its new library, between the campus and the seafront, close to where the ancient library once stood. The recreation of the ancient library was not only adopted by other individuals and agencies, it garnered support from Egyptian politicians. One leading supporter of the project was former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak; UNESCO was also quick to embrace the concept of endowing the Mediterranean region with a center of cultural and scientific excellence. This initiative by the Egyptian government, UNESCO, and Alexandria University was undertaken \"with the aim of re-establishing Alexandria as one of the great intellectual and cultural centres of the twenty-first century\". UNESCO's involvement beginning in 1986 created a great opportunity for the project to truly be international in focus. \nAn architectural design competition was organized by UNESCO in 1988 to choose a design worthy of the site and its heritage. The competition was won by Sn\u00f8hetta, a Norwegian architectural office, associated with Austrian architect Christoph Kapeller and Egyptian architect Ihab El Habbak, from among more than 1,400 entries. This architectural team consisted of ten members representing six countries. In addition, Unesco created an International Commission for the Bibliotheca Alexandrina which consisted of high-level representatives from 18 diverse countries and organizations. Given Unesco\u2019s involvement and the investment by the international community, this project achieved its mission to \u201cplay an educational, cultural, and scientific role throughout the region\u201d.The first pledges were made for funding the project at a conference held in 1990 in Aswan: USD $65 million, mostly from the MENA states. Construction work began in 1995 and, after some US$220 million had been spent, the complex was officially inaugurated on 16 October 2002.The Bibliotheca Alexandrina is trilingual, containing books in Classical Arabic, English, and French. In 2010, the library received a donation of 500,000 books from the National Library of France, Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France (BnF). The gift makes the Bibliotheca Alexandrina the sixth-largest Francophone library in the world. The BA also is now the largest depository of French books in the Middle East and North Africa, surpassing those of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, in addition to being the main French library in Africa.\n\n\n== Building and library features ==\nThe dimensions of the project are vast: the library has shelf space for eight million books, with the main reading room covering 20,000 square metres (220,000 sq ft) on eleven cascading levels. The complex also houses a conference center; specialized libraries for maps, multimedia, the blind and visually impaired, young people, and for children; four museums; four art galleries for temporary exhibitions; 15 permanent exhibitions; a planetarium; and a manuscript restoration laboratory. The library's architecture is equally striking. The main reading room stands beneath a 32-meter-high glass-panelled roof, tilted out toward the sea like a sundial, and measuring some 160 m in diameter. The walls are of gray Aswan granite, carved with characters from 120 human scripts.The collections at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina were donated from all over the world. The Spanish donated documents that detailed their period of Moorish rule. The French also donated, giving the library documents dealing with the building of the Suez Canal.\n\n\n== Internet Archive partnership ==\nThe BA/IA partnership is built with the aims to preserve heritage for future generations and to provide universal access to human knowledge. The BA was the site of the first mirror and external backup of the Internet Archive. The Internet Archive donated five million USD to the BA, including:\n\n10 billion web pages spanning the years 1996\u20132001 from over 16 million sites\n2000 hours of Egyptian and U.S. television broadcasts\n1000 archival films\n100 terabytes of data stored on 200 computers\nA books-scanning facility for local books\n\n\n== Library services ==\nThe BA's mission is to be a center of excellence in the production and dissemination of knowledge and to be a place of dialogue, learning and understanding between cultures and peoples. The new Bibliotheca Alexandrina is more than a library. BA hosts book fairs, book launches, ceremonies, cinema, competitions, concerts, conferences, educational courses, exhibitions, festivals, forums, lectures, meetings, performances, presentations, reading activities, round table discussions, seminars, shows, theater, training courses, video-conferences and workshops for adults, children, young people and the academic community.\nHere are some of the areas and exhibits that it comprises:\n\n\n=== The main library ===\nCan hold up to millions of books.\n\n\n=== Six specialized libraries ===\nThe Arts and Multimedia Library\nThe Taha Hussein Library for the visually impaired\nThe Children's Library\nThe Young People's Library\nThe Microforms Library\nThe Rare Books and Special Collections Library \n\n\n=== A copy of the Internet Archive ===\nThe library provides access to print on demand books via the Espresso Book Machine.\n\n\n==== Taha Hussein Library for the Blind and Visually Impaired ====\nThe Taha Hussein Library contains materials for the blind and visually impaired using special software that makes it possible for readers to read books and journals. It is named after Taha Hussein, the Egyptian professor of Arabic and literary critic and one of the leading figures of the Arab Renaissance (Nahda) in literature, who was himself blinded at the age of three.\n\n\n==== Nobel Section ====\nContains book collections of Nobel Prize Laureates in Literature from 1901 to present. The Nobel Section was inaugurated by Queen Silvia of Sweden and Queen Sonja of Norway on 24 April 2002.\n\n\n=== Four museums ===\n\n\n==== Antiquities Museum ====\nEstablished in 2001, the BA Antiquities Museum is the first archeological museum to be situated within a library. The primary aims of the museum are to promote research, creativity, and cultural awareness. Holding approximately 1,316 artifacts, the Antiquities Museum collection provides a glimpse into Egyptian history from the Pharaonic era to the conquest of Alexander the Great to the Roman civilizations before the advent of Islam across Egypt. The collection includes underwater antiquities from the Mediterranean seabed near the Eastern Harbour and the Bay of Abukir.The museum provides descriptions of artifacts in three languages: English, Arabic, and French.\n\n\n==== Manuscript Museum ====\nThe Manuscript Museum provides visitors and researchers with rare manuscripts and books. Established in 2001, the Manuscript Museum contains the world's largest collection of digital manuscripts. It is an academic institution that is affiliated to the Library of Alexandria. The stated aims of the museum are to preserve heritage, foster human cadres in the conservation and restoration of manuscripts, and create a generation of new restorers.\nThe Manuscript Museum operates alongside the Manuscript Center, which provides digital access to more than 6,000 rare books, maps, and documents within the museum's collection. There are three sections housed within the museum:\n\nRare Collections: This section includes the BA's unique items, such as original manuscripts, early printed books, maps, and antique coins.\nMicrofilm: This section includes microfilms of around 30,000 rare manuscripts and 50,000 documents, as well as a collection from The British Library of around 14,000 Arabic, Persian, and Turkish manuscripts, which is considered the largest collection in Europe. Additionally, visitors can find a vast archive of national and Arabic newspapers.\nMuseographic Display: This section is divided into the Exhibition Gallery group and the Traveling Exhibition group. The Exhibition Gallery displays the Manuscript Center's electronic publications and selected digital manuscripts.\n\n\n==== Sadat Museum ====\n\nThis museum contains many personal belongings of the Egyptian president Anwar Al Sadat. The collections include some of his military robes, his Nobel Prize medal, his copy of the Qur'an, a few of his handwritten letters, pictures of him and his family, and the blood stained military robe he wore the day of his assassination. The museum also contains a recording in his voice of part of the Qur'an and assorted newspaper articles written about him.\n\n\n==== History of Science ====\nSee History of science\n\n\n=== Permanent exhibitions ===\n\n\n==== Digital collections ====\nOur Digital World: The \"Our Digital World\" exhibition displays some of the library's digital projects, including digital archives of former presidents, the Science Supercourse, and the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL). Additionally, digital versions of valuable books, such as Description de l'Egypte and L'Art Arabe are available.\n\n\n==== Personal collections ====\nThe World of Shadi Abdel Salam: \"The World of Shadi Abdel Salam\" exhibition contains many of the works and effects of the Egyptian film director, screenwriter, and costume designer Shadi Abdel Salam, donated by his family to the Library to put on permanent display. This includes his personal library, some of his furniture, several awards, and many storyboard paintings and costumes from several of his films.\nImpressions of Alexandria: The \"Impressions of Alexandria\" exhibition is divided into two sections: Alexandria as seen by Artists and Travelers, and Cosmopolitan Alexandria: a Photographic Memory. The former section features travelers' and artists' original lithographs, maps, and engravings about Alexandria for the time period of the 15th century to the 19th century. The latter section features photographs from the 19th century to the mid-20th century, drawing attention to cultural works from writers and artists of the time.\n\n\n=== CULTURAMA ===\n\nThe culturama hall consists of a huge 180-degree panoramic interactive computer screen with a diameter of 10 meters that is made up of nine separate flat screens arranged in a semicircle and nine video projectors controlled by a single computer. Culturama has enabled the display of information that could never have been displayed clearly using a regular computer display system.It was developed by the Egyptian Center for Documentation of Cultural and Natural Heritage (CULTNAT) and holds its patent in 2007.\nIt displayed 3 periods from the history of Egypt:\n\nAncient Egyptian Period\nHighlights of Islamic Civilization\nModern Egypt\n\n\n=== VISTA ===\nVirtual Immersive Science and Technology Applications. It uses CAVE Technology.\nVISTA features several projects including\n\nBA Model: A complete virtual recreation of the BA including the Library's main building, planetarium, study rooms, and even the Library's furniture will be seen clearly and accurately in this demo.\nSphinx\nSocio-Economic Data Visualization: A new visualization technique for multi-dimensional numerical data. The case study uses data provided by the UN, including health care, life duration expectancy and literacy rate over a 25-year period in some countries.\n\n\n=== Digital Assets Repository ===\n\nThe Digital Assets Repository (DAR) is a system developed at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA) by the International School of Information Science (ISIS) to create and maintain digital library collections and preserve them to future generations, as well as providing free public access to the library's digitized collections through a web-based search and browsing facilities via DAR's website.\n\n\n== Management ==\nThe founding director was Ismail Serageldin, who served until May 2017. He also was chair of the Board of Directors for each of the BA's affiliated research institutes and museums. He was succeeded by current manager Dr. Moustafa El Feqy.\n\n\n== Post-revolutionary involvement ==\nThe Bibliotheca Alexandrina held a variety of symposiums in 2011 in support of the Egyptian community and emphasizing the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, the Egyptian Constitution and Democratic Government in Arab nations. The library also displays a photo gallery of the January 25, 2011 revolution and is working to document it in a wide variety of formats.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nCriticism of the library comes chiefly from two angles. Many allege that the library is a white elephant impossible for modern Egypt to sustain, and serves as little more than a vanity project for the Egyptian government. Furthermore, there are fears that censorship, long the bane of Egyptian academia, would affect the library's collection. In addition, the building's elaborate architecture (which imitates a rising Sun) upset some who believed too much money was being spent on construction rather than the library's actual collection. Due to the lack of available funds, the library had only 500,000 books in 2002, low compared to other national libraries. (However, in 2010 the library received an additional 500,000 books from the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France.) It has been estimated that it will take 80 years to fill the library to capacity at the current level of funding. The library relies heavily on donations to buy books for its collections.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nPlanetarium Science Center\nBibliotheca Alexandrina\u2019s 100 Greatest Egyptian Films\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nWatson, Bruce (April 2002). \"Rising Sun\".

          "Ok you can't go to Alex without seeing the library. It is beautiful, it is modern and it is inspiring. The only problem is they do not inform you that you have to purchase tickets for the ancient manuscripts room and the antiquities. Also make sure those are open when you go.",

          "This is a review that somehow never made it to publication and so I must restate what I can remember. I was surprised at the modernity of the library, expecting it to be a replica of the old. In a way, that was a disappointment. But then which is better? Being able to",
          "The Library was designed to converge towards the sea! A section of the library is immersed in a water tank to symbolize the ancient Egyptian sun projected by the sea. The sloping roof of the building allows the indirect use of sunlight in most sections of the library. An airship",

        "wiki": "The Alexandria Museum of Fine Arts is a museum for Egyptian and Middle-Eastern fine art situated in the Moharam Bek neighborhood of Alexandria, Egypt. It houses a collection of works by Egyptian artist and a selection of works from Baroque, Romanticism, Rococo and Orientalism. In addition, noteworthy examples of carving, printing and sculpture from Egyptian and European artists. The museum aims to promote art to the local community and to a greater extent Egyptian society, through a selection of activities: art workshops, exhibitions and museum education for children; exhibitions for noted Egyptian artists and international cultural exchange activities.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was established in 1904 when Alexandria Municipal Authorities received a collection of paintings as a gift from Edward Farid Heim. The collection consisted of 210 pieces by international artists. Heim stipulated the establishment of a dedicated building for presenting these artworks; he would have otherwise taken them back to his homeland Germany. In 1936, French trader, Baron de Menasha, donated a villa in Alexandria's Moharram Bek area to be used as a library and a gallery for the exhibition of artworks. The building was destroyed in the Second World War and the municipality had to store the artworks in another location until another museum had been established.\nIn 1952, Egyptian architect Foad Abd Elmageed was assigned by the general manager of Alexandria's municipality Hussein Sobhy to design the Museum of Fine Arts. It was built in a modernistic style and included several gallery spaces, a library, and a cultural centre for holding concerts, seminars, and film screenings. In 1954, the Revolutionary Command Council opened the museum, choosing a date that coincided with the second celebration of July Revolution. On July 26, 1955, the Egyptian president Gamal Abd El-Nasser opened the initial session of the Mediterranean Countries Biennale.  Founded by the general manager of Alexandria municipality Hussein Sobhy, it is the second oldest Biennale worldwide that has been held in the museum till date.\nIn January 2013, the museum reopened after its renovation, including adding a workshop and artists' hosting building, Calligraphy Museum, posterior garden, as well as a hall for temporary art exhibitions which was named after the Alexandrian artist Hamed Ewes.\n\n\n== The Collection ==\n\nThe museum's collection is divided into three groups: the first belongs to Heim's 210 artworks. The second group is Orientalist paintings that are exhibited in a separated hall on the second floor, donated by the artist Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil.  The third group was donated by the Museum of Modern Art in Cairo as well as other individual collections that were received from Egyptian, international and Armenian artists who lived in Egypt throughout the museum's history. In addition, the province donated money for purchasing works from other notable artists.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Montaza (Egyptian Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062a\u0632\u0647\u200e) is the name of both a district and a park in Alexandria, Egypt. The district includes the park, but the two are legally distinct.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\"Montaza\" does mean \"park\", but like most words in Arabic there is an essence that is missing by literal English translation. It can only be understood with a greater awareness of the root: \"nuzha\"(Arabic: \u0646\u0632\u0647\u0629). This means variably - to be far, untouched, unblemished, and free. Thus \"montaza\" takes meanings such as promenade, walk, stroll; recreation ground; park.\n\n\n== Montaza district ==\nThe Montaza district (Arabic: \u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062a\u0632\u0647\u200e \u1e24ayy al-Muntazah) is a local government district of Alexandria Governorate on the northeastern end of the city along the coast. Besides the neighborhood-sized park of Montaza which gives it its name, Montaza district includes the neighborhoods of Soyof, El Falaky, El Mandara, Sidi Bishr, Maamora, Khurshid, Abu Qir and parts of Asafra. With a population of approximately 1.2 million, the Montaza district is the largest district of the governorate by population.\nThe Montaza district administrative building is in Sidi Bishr, at the intersection of Masgid Sidi Bishr and Malak Hefni Streets, near the Sidi Bishr tram station. The building was damaged by fire during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011; the building had contained a police station, which, like police stations across Egypt, was a particular target for protesters.\n\n\n== Montaza Park ==\n\nThe neighborhood of Montaza is at the far northeast end of Montaza District, along the coast. Built under the monarchy, it is a favored tourist spot on account of its sizable gardens and palaces left by its royal heritage; the Egyptian government charges a nominal fee (25 LE as of 2018). Montaza Palace, which gives the park its name, was constructed during the reign of the Khedive Abbas II, the royal family's habit of summering in the palace eventually drew wealthy Egyptians and foreigners to the same location (although foreigners in general tended to congregate at the opposite end of the city, in Agami). It is considered to be quite exclusive to be in possession of a cabin in the Montaza. It can not be bought and is usually passed down from generation to generation. There are several different \"suburbs\" within the Montaza, the most exclusive being Aida.\nMontaza also plays host to a noted clock tower and two old hotels (the Helnan Palestine and Salamlek Palace). The Sheraton Montazah is actually across the street from the park, in the neighborhood of Mandara.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNeighborhoods in Alexandria\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Thinking about the minds and legends who spent time here, whether in the theatre or the baths, places the amphitheatre in perspective. Would\u2019ve been great to see in its\u2019 hey day. The items salvaged from the ocean are also cool and the bird room is nice to see. Does not take a",
          "This is an attractive site in the middle of town. A short stop allows one to peruse the locale. Other than that, this area is not too memorable. In my experience, if you've seen one Roman amphitheatre, you've seen them all.",
          "Hard to believe that there was nobody here when we toured these ruins. The bird mosaics were expecially impressive. Whatever you do, don't miss this Roman site.",
          "Nice place to walk around for an hour, with the added bonus of some of the ruin artefacts from subsea alexandria that have been saved from the ocean and stored there. Pleasant surroundings and a few shady areas to rest and take in the views.",
          "The area is full of history from the Greek Period to the present. This is a precious portal into that past. Not on the scale of the ammphitheaters in Turkey, Greece or Italy, but for Egypt it is unique. If you are in Alex, take the time to go there!",
          "When in Alexandria, make sure and stop at this ruin to see a typical Greco-Roman amphitheater and Roman bath house. It was very interesting.",
          "I thought that this site was pretty kept up nicely. Some nice photo shots. Ruins are pretty typical for most amphitheaters. They do tend to look very much alike. This was very urban compared to many others though.",
          "Fine, but not extremly interesting. I expected more of Alexandria, being once such an important city.",
          "This is an interesting ancient place and the amphitheatre is well preserved and the speaker spot in front is amazing. But around the gardens are some lovely extras including some mosaic floors - don't miss them!",
          "Whenever we go on Foreign or Domestic tours as tourists, I generally try to know about those places by surfing thorough the Internet and wikipedia. When I reach the tourist attractions ,I already know few things about that place. I have found this habit of great help. Roman Ampy",
          "They charge extra for foreigners and the place is well kept and maintained. The scale is rather small and not impressive. But you can imagine how Romans enjoyed their leisure times for entertainment and learning.",
          "This experience made me feel like I was in Ancient Rome. It\u2019s a nice walk to see the amphitheater; Roman bath ruins and others.",
          "An ancient Greek Roman structure, this is a small area and easy to walk. Located below the level of the Alexandria city it is surrounded by urbanization. The marble in the stairs and the beautiful mosaics give an impression of that ancient time. Nothing much to be so impressed",
          "Amazingly well-preserved Greco-Roman ruins, featuring a large amphitheater and lots of columns and statues over a good-sized area. The only criticism I have is not about the site itself, but rather the facilities: As a foreigner it was a bit hard for me to find where the",
          "In the midst of Alexandria you will find the Roman Ampitheatre with great acoustics if you want to try out your acting skills. The sound travels well as we can attest to from a couple of our colleagues \u2018friends, romans and countryman\u2019 rendition. There are useful descriptions",
          "Enjoyed walking around here and getting insights from our guide Karim. Still being researched, but honestly just enjoyed the walk around, had the place to ourselves.",
          "You would think that a cities premier attractions would warrant some cleanliness,but no,sad to say not here,its just so sad the whole experience,from lining up on the side walk-dodging cars & barking horns,more litter,dog feces,plastic,security guards more interested in their",

          "People spend maximum 40 minutes at this exhibition and it's costs 80 L.E. I was not impressed. It's lovely to look at but the signs and information at each area could do with some improvement. Could have been a better experience, but still something one should do on a trip to",
          "The Roman Amphitheatre dated back to Before Christ was discovered accidentally when the President of Egypt was passing by a place which was open area and asked the governor what is it. The governor requested the President\u2019s permission to build a Municipal Building of Alexandria",
          "It is a perfect place . Having a lot of Roman periog history.and fullof submerged monuments that was chemically treated over there. It is mind blowing if you have a guide to explain it .",

          "Wonderful site of Roman ruins with amphitheater and mosaic display to let your imagination run wild. Small area that is easy to walk around. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",
          "among the few places you cannot miss in the town of Alexandria this terrain is really astonishing. The surrounding urbanisation is in contrast with the rich underground. How can local governments destroy the beauty of ancient times with new, ugly buildings on top of Greek-Roman",
          "I must warn you that these ruins are not well kept and the surrounding area, in the middle of town, is not pleasurable. It was nice, but I do not recommend that you go out of your way. Take a walk on the Corniche, instead.",
          "Kudos to Alexandria for the condition and cleanliness of this beautiful amphitheater. well worth the visit",
          "Great side stop! I wish there was more information at the site to view, but it was a great stop to appreciate the Roman construction! Parking and access was a little tricky.",
          "I had spent 3 days in Alexandria, and was regretting missing having time to visit here. But, as it turned out, I walked right by it on my way to catch my train to Cairo. I had visited other Roman ruins in the city, and was very happy to see this. I had time to walk around the",
          "There isn't a lot to see here but it is interesting enough and very pleasant. The part I enjoyed most was the room with mosaics of the birds.",
          "I enjoyed the visit to the Roman Amphitheatre very much. It was nice to go to the spot where the artists would have performed and try the acoustics by saying something and hearing your voice spreading everywhere.",
          "You can't wonder around the site but it's part of the attractions if you haven't seen a roman amphitheater before, well kept, clean and easy to access.",
          "The amphitheater is the most intact item in this ruined city\u2019s. There\u2019s some remnants of Roman baths, temple and other buildings. Some nice mosaics. Best part there\u2019s no one to pedal their wares.",
          "This is great. It\u2019s like lots of different Roman ruins. The interesting part is all the items they excavated from the Mediterranean. Definitely worth checking out.",
          "Loved visiting this place and learning of the background and history. It is right in the center of town. Alexlandria is such a great city to visit. I recommend at least 3 days",
          "Another nice place to see in Alexandria, interesting to see the blend between the romans and egyptians.",
          "We happened to arrive shortly before closing so we didn't have a lot of time but I felt like it was enough. We had no tour guide and it may have been worth the extra money if they offered one (not sure if they do). You can see the theatre from the outside but it's still worth",

          "Roman Amphitheater located at Alexandria down town. Nice place to capture photos for memories. Also you can do walkthrough to do shopping .",
          "The whole area has ongoing archaeological excavations, so you can see the statified layers- fascinating. The Roman theatre has great accoustics, so do try them out, stand on the stone in the middle. There are also artifacts from the sunken city on display",
          "A wonderful visit to make while in the city. It should take you 45 minute max to go through the place.",
          "Well preserved piece of history. Does involve uneven ground and steps. You are not allowed to climb onto the levels but there is the \u2018echo\u2019 spot on the ground for you to speak and hear your own voice which is cool. There is also a Roman home here to walk inside with lovely",
          "Amidst the hectic traffic of Alexandria: a heaven of peace. Admire the many grades of the amphitheatre, surely not the largest in the world but surely one of the most beautiful. One can immagine how it must have been so many centuries ago. Worth a visit.",
          "Kom El Dikka archaeological excavations and conservation and restoration works is a Polish-Egyptian project. Before archaeologists from the University of Warsaw began to excavate this site in the 1960s, it looked like what the name suggests -- literally a \"hill of rubble.\" Now,",

          "The place needs some TLC. However, if you love history and understand the transition process, you will love it and be mesmerized by how beautiful (gotta close your eyes to see the beauty) it is. If not, you are likely to simply go, walk around, see the trash , read a bit and",
          "I did not expect this high-quality services with this reliable prices. I gonna recommend Travelish tours to my colleges in Uni Bremen and the professional Tours organizer Momo. Big Like",
          "Again, as we were in Alexandria we tried to see as much as we could in our one day. This site is actively being restored, but we found it an interesting way to pass 30 minutes. Our local guide again provided us with information regarding the site and it's history. We were able",
          "Now that is worth visiting. We walked around and explored what it is to be party do the past with the marble, rocks and all those pieces. Great job restoring mosaics.",
          "This is the ruins of a Roman amphitheatre which was later excavated. Students of history will find this attraction very interesting. The semicircular open air theatre was used for music programmes. There are a few old lecture theatres which shows how the Roman students were",
          "We were on our way to Pompey's Pillar and stopped by here for a minute. Having seen other Roman Amphitheatres, I knew what it was in an instant. Like others have said, take a look from the outside (there are roads running almost all the way around it). You may want to just",
          "Nice but small and nothing to see except a small amphitheatre and some ruins. Not Worthing spending the money. U can visit it in 10 min so definitely nop",

          "Wow...it is really cool to see the influence Romans had in Egypt.. It does get hot, so morning trip is the best. Really cool spot to visit",
          "Although excavation is ongoing at the Amphitheater it is still worth one's time. It is the oldest Roman theater in Egypt. To me it's another reminder of how expansive the Roman Empire extended. You will also see a magnificent villa of birds and Bacchus mosaic.",
          "Lots of excavation work currently going on as they\u2019ve discovered a Roman villa and bath house adjacent. It\u2019s still definitely worth a visit and a very peaceful place to sit in the afternoon. They\u2019ve also got some ruins there from the Lighthouse of Pharos",
          "This I could have skipped. The most interesting part was watching the men move huge bags of dirt on their backs for the ongoing construction.",
          "In the midst of traffic mayhem that is Alexandria, this excavation is a bit tranquility. The oldest surviving Roman theatre in Egypt and maybe even more important, the Villa of the Birds, with its magnificent mosaics of birds and a Bacchus mosaic (from elsewhere in the city).",
          "According to our guide there is some thought that this site is in fact a university. The amphitheater was used as a lecture hall...try out the echo and sound effects! Other rooms are thought to be classrooms and dormitories. There is also a Roman bath. And the bird tiles are a",
          "If you haven\u2019t visited Rome but want to see some Ruins, this is the stop you need to make. It\u2019s little like a tiny Forum (across from the Colosseum in Rome). It\u2019s fun for a stop, but don\u2019t plan to spend any extensive time here.",
          "Great seeing ruins from the Roman empire spread so far and wide. We have visited many amphitheatres around the world, some are still in use (not this one).",
          "What an extraordinary find, once buried in Egypt is now open to explore. A large complex including the baths, amphitheater, academic chambers, mosaic floors, and more. Definitely a treasure of Athens. Happy to highly recommend it to others.",
          "Alexandria was a major hub of learning, arts and culture bustling with scholars, students and patrons. These remains are evidence of that- a flourishing society. What was their life like? What caused its demise? Sadly that the Egyptian Government doesn't think it has a story to",
          "Beautiful theatre with amazing acoustics. Part of a larger forum complex which includes homes, a bath complex and more.",
          "Waste of time. There were tiny mosaic in noticeable. Broken stairs. Only my kid enjoyed playing with cats there and running on steps. Nothing else. It's like tick mark thing when you are coming with group. If by your own skip this and spend hours and says at Cafe by beach.",

          "There is very little to see here. It cost us 180Le for two people. Most of the things you can see from behind the fence on the road. There is a lot of garbage and just seems very unkept. Might be interesting if you are super into Alexandria's history.",

          "The Roman Amphitheatre is a relatively new find, being discovered in the 1960s. Egypt is so ancient that one is tempted to say \"Oh, only Roman, so recent,\" but it is almost 2,000 years old, way before our time. Roman amphitheatres are not all that uncommon, but they are",
          "I have been visitingAlexandria regularly for the last 45 years, yet this was my first visit to this site. It was magical, and was enjoyed by all the member of the family. It is amazing how clever and effective the theater was designed to amplify the sound without distortion.",

          "The ruins of an ancient Roman Amphitheatre in Alexandria are worth seeing. Built from marble, this 4th century AD structure was accidentally discovered in 1960, while digging a foundation. It is a complete complex that could seat 600 spectators, had Powder rooms & nearby guest",

          "To be asking 40 EGYP for entry to this place is a bit steep to say the least. Sure it is a historical place and maybe it pays for the upkeep but not worth the entry price unless you are die-hard history lover/archaelogist.",

          "The Roman Amphitheatre is actually quite well maintained. It looks like a small chunk of the Colosseum from inside and looks quite pretty. The only problem is that it does not attract many tourists and we actually saw a couple of young kids peeing on one of the columns which was",

          "It's interesting to see ancient amphitheatre surrounded by modern buildings. When we visited, we noticed that some areas were being renovated. There were also some lights, big speakers, etc, which look like there was a play/concert that took place. I guess they still use it",

          "The place is currently under restoration, but the roman theater part is open to visitors, There is a spot there where the singers would stand and the echoes can only be heard in that one spot, was great to experience it.",
          "This smaller attraction certainly is a wonderful place to learn about the roman's. The amphitheatre was made in such a way that to stand in the right spot you can be heard all over the ruins are very intriguing.",
          "A beautiful part of history in the city. As everything else in Egypt you have to pay just to enter and everything is neglected and not clean, but worthwhile to go there.",
          "Not just the ampitheatre, but a Roman villa with ongoing excavations of an original, in-situ mosaic floor. Also other fascinating ruins and items recovered from the port of Alexandria.",
          "I have visited the Roman Amphitheater sight today..it's a wonderful place ..it needs some restoration ..but the ruins of the buildings shows how the Greco-Roman period in Alexandria was great ..and you can see that obviously in Villa of Birds which has mosaics panels depicting",

          "By comparison, this is a new discovery only found in the 1960's. It is a run down site but the ancient amphitheatre was amazing to see with the coloumns and marble, the seat numbers and the other buildings with the ancient red brick walls. Highly recommended.",
          "Located a few steps from the main train station of Alexandria. This is the most complete Roman ruin in Egypt. It was a small amphetheatre used for music and the reading of poetry and dates from the 2nd century AD. Other ruins have been excavated on the site. These include a",

          "Very interesting that the roman empires influence extended this far. This is the only one of its kind in Egypt. Well worth a visit if in Alexandria.",
          "This is a must on your list to visit when you are in Alexandria. One can feel amazed that they are around ancient ruins that was once full of life. It is full of history so study up before you go.",
          "A very beautiful place to visit, I visited the coliseums in room back in 2000, and today I felt same feelings. It's just an amazing place to spend couple of hours exploring old civilisation. We walked around my family and I and enjoyed it a lot. I wished if they had a gift shop",
          "very nice historical place to be visited u will visit it several time it gives an idea how great was this civilization",
          "This place really takes you back by several centuries. The architecture is so devised, I believe that without the modern electronic gadgets, one can hear clearly whatever one said from the stage! The ruins are still almost full. The accompanying garden is also nicely planned.",
          "and speak-out to the audience that would have sat in the amphitheater. Just do it - and you'll find out why! So cool, and unreal.",
          "Grab a tour guide! Amazing that you can still touch ruins and explore. We learned about evacuations still occurring. Head to the dive shop, too learn about the underwater explorations.",
          "My child is interested in archaeology and the main reason why I decided to visit Roman Theater was she. And actually I could not imagine that this sight would touch her so deeply. We even did not read the descriptions of the sight which are at the right side from the entrance",

          "It has been a very nice experience seeing the roman Colosseum at Alexandria and a part of the ancient city buildings there. I recommend visiting this place for monument lovers",
          "The main ruins of Alexandria excavated by a Polish mission in the past 40 years. The area open to the public is limited but one can have an idea of the beauty of the city. One can ask the guards to open the Roman house which has exquisite mosaics. Highly recommended!",
          "Amazing sights of historic artifacts found in the mediteranian. Fascinating area to see. Great for a short stop along the way. 30 - 40 minutes will be enough to take it all in and see it all.",
          "You can see the roman theater...and some granite columns and the birds villa with nise mosaic flooring",
          "This was a really cool area, especially the information on the statues that were uncovered from the Mediterranean. It's disheartening though to think about the amount of technology and advancement that is lost when each great civilization falls",
          "It was a nightmare to find - even the local who went with us struggled. Was nice to see but I don't think it was really worth all the effort",
          "a nice example of the roman monuments still reserved worth the visit while in Alexeandria there's low fees!",
          "Of course one of the beauties of Egypt is seeing all the different ages and cultures in one place. To have access to such a mind-blowing amphitheatre is amazing. The experience itself however is very HOT and a little dangerous. The sun beats down without shade or a visitor",
          "The roman amphitheatre was a big disappointment for us, having seen bigger buildings in Turkey. The condition of the site isn't good and possibly Alexandria should look at improving the site. No tourists, no revenue.",
          "Egypt and Alexandria has so much to offer. The roman amphitheater is not worth spending time on. The theater is extremely small and there are many other places that have more to show. Save the theaters for Italy. Very little has been done to make this interesting. Not many words",
          "I enjoyed being able to walk around and look at the statues etc. that they have on display. I also appreciated the history and the fact that it is still used. I was with a tour group so we were escorted by security our entire trip, but to be honest I don't know how comfortable",
          "Nice place, in the middle of the City, showing people the History of Alexandria Roman times. I wish it would finally completed restoration work, and tourists could access the rest of the complex.",
          "what started as an excavation site with only most of the amphitheatre visible somce 30 years ago, has now evolved into a huge monument site with roads, arches, baths and smaal shops are around. alexandria is visibly on this site a city of layers, one on top of the other",
          "Very well maintained and is highly recommended to anyone travelling to this part of Egypt. It had been built very similar to the Roman Amphitheater. Very nice even though",
          "It was a small amphitheatre used for music, It amazed me that it sat underground for so long right there. It was lovely.",
          "As this was listed on tourist guides , visited this ancient site and was surprised with old buildings and excavation in progress. This needs to be marketed more and recommend that they have a guide who can explain the significance of the buildings or alternatively some audio",
          "An impressive place. Must have been something in its heyday. One can almost imagine sitting there at night watching a play under the night sky.",
          "The mosaic of the birds hidden away in the corner of the site is beautiful and not to be missed. Excavations continue and there is so much more to see than a few years ago, but there are less recovered artefacts on display as they are now in museums and you can no longer sit in",
          "The amphitheatre is an interesting place to visit. Ok, there are more beautiful ones in the world, but this one is nice. Do not forget to take a look at the house of the birds. You do not have to buy a ticket. It was closed, you can get the idea of the mansion from looking",
          "You can walk around the Amphitheatre without being pestered by people purporting to be guides, we were never approached and freely wandered and able to take as many photographs as we wanted. Well worth a visit, in fact would say it is a must see!",
          "This was one of the few historical sites we visited that seemed put together. There's currently a Polish excavation project in the works there which was fun to watch.",
          "its amazing place. everybody can see it. our history. i visited it twice with my friends and family .",
          "This archeological complex is one of the hidden gems of Alexandria. The most famous part of it is the impressive roman amphitheater. But the complex has a lot more to offer. Including study chambers, a roman bath, a residential quarter, a house (named: Bird's house) with amazing",
          "This little villa is a great way to spend an hour or 2. The roman ruins are magnificent without being too much. The Villa with the beautiful tiles shows you a great picture you must see.",
          "Definitely not worth the trip, you have to pay more to see the whole site and it's not that interesting.",
          "This Roman theater and the surrounding ruins was only discovered in the mid 20th century so the theater is in great condition. Make sure you stand in the orators position and test the acoustics. Incredible. Try quoting some Shakespeare.",
          "This is an interesting historic site uncovered only relatively recently . Its well preserved and much excavation is still being done nearby. There are lots of other statues in the area to see.",
          "Well unless your really into this type of thing I would stay away. Its not all that large and a lot of the area is closed of or you then have to pay extra to see more",
          "The Roman amphitheater reminds me of Rome, same design and structure, just in Egypt. They are still excavating the site but to learn that this was just discovered 60 years ago is really mind blowing. They still use the theatre today for small gatherings.",
          "really very beautiful. right in centre of city near train station. I was the only person there..amazing piece's of sculpture dotted around",
          "Loved the history told to me by my tour guide about the place. It's really something when you think about it. Our world is so small but back then it was uncharted territory. I would recommend a tour of this place without hesitation.",
          "This is a gorgeous place to visit. There are two sections to this place and two different tickets as well. I have only done the amphitheatre section both times. If you are a photo guru this is a great place to visit when the sun is shining to get great photos off the ruins. A",
          "If you are in Alexandria, why not stop by and see the amphitheater. It is very small, and only fairly recently excavated...not nearly as impressive as some others (Aspendos, Ephesus). However, it is in good condition and easy to access. One fun thing is the acoustic \"center\"",
          "It is a small place and you can visit the whole in half an hour. Walk down to the spot where you can hear your amplified voice. Its quite interesting and you can sing a song its fun. Apart from that there are some objects on display, some paintings and a bird bath.",
          "This place is comparably small to the other ancient theathres there are. Still, it's worth a stroll to see the remains of Roman influence in Egypt. I watched the film Agora that sets in Alexandria. It probably doesn't screen this place tough. But visiting it could reproduce our",
          "The ruins are evidence of a time when the Romans ruled the world, they have been simply every where. I understand Helen of Troy was hiding here for a time as well.",
          "As amphitheatres go this one is not all that spectacular, but it's interesting nonetheless because of its historic relevance and age. There are numerous statues and treasures uncovered from underwater around the top of the amphitheatre. And don't miss the spot on the ground",
          "It's a very well conserved but not very protected roman amphitheater. It's a sweet and romantic place to wonder around.",
          "The roman amphitheatre is a small place to visit. What i didn't appreciate that there isn't a guide service or any legend that explain what you are seeing.In Alexandria museum the Roman amphitheatre section explain a lot more than the live place. For the price is cheap for",
          "Spent an hour or so wandering here. Interesting to see what's left of old Rome but not as spectacular as some others I've seen.",
          "The morning after we arrived in Alexandria by train from Cairo, we visited this Roman ruin. A wonderful place to walk around. Just a short time is needed. Easy to get to because right in the heart of the city. Well worth it if you are in the area and have a few days to explore",
          "ancient and amazing place to see in alexandria. It remounts to the period of roman occupation in Egypt",
          "I enjoyed walking around the Amphitheatre. Its small so it won't take much time to do and its nice to see the Roman influences in Alexandria.",
          "The Amphitheater was smaller than I expected, but still remained standing after so many years. This relic of roman civilization will take you back in time. However, there is nothing else to see or do. 15 minutes will more than suffice to visit this place.",
          "Brilliant architecture.. Always wonder how people designed such beautiful building. If you are in alexandria, you must visit this place",
          "Egypt is a place of great historical importance and this place offers a glimpse of the Roman Era in Egypt. If you love to explore historical places, this is a must see in Egypt.",
          "A lot of interesting ruins and historical finds, love hearing the history and most importantly this is one of its kind in Egypt so you wont find anything like this anywhere else in the country",
          "Set away from the main road this is a fab place to spend an afternoon. Take time to wander through the ruins, admire the findings from the deep sea dive and visit the villa of the birds on the far side. They're currently renovating the mosaics and they are truly something to be",
          "The amphitheatre speaks well about the Roman influence in Egypt. However, it looked like more ruins than history that had to speak.",
          "The area there is so nice, specially those underground passages however there is no security at all in the area, and there is a clear sign of negligence, this place need intensive care... the transportation from & to is easy, so easy in fact",
          "For better or worse, the Romans left a big foot print in the Mediterranean and this amphitheatre is another one of it's marvels. Yes it's another ruin, but the site is amazing. The acoustics from the sweet spot of the amphitheatre is incredible, where a small voice can be",
          "The Roman Amphitheatre, and surrounding area that they are unearthing, helps you see how many cultures have been part of the city of Alexandria. Although it was not an incredible ruin compared to others in the world, it is nonetheless an interesting one...if you are getting an",
          "very interesting, and strangely quiet down below the hustle and bustle of the Alexandria streets. Was fascinated by the live dig going on.",
          "This place looks like an archaeological dig. The cut-marble seating, columns, and smaller chambers are all intact. It's easy to imagine the place when it was in use. There is a path above the amphitheater that leads to an enclosed chamber with signs indicating that excavation",
          "Just soak into this site. Try voice modulation and see the difference in your own voice when you face the audience side. Impressive how they designed it in a manner to allow winds carry your sound waves.",
          "Its all damaged and is all against the expectations that i had. you can't go inside and have to view it from a distance.",
          "Remember this is the only Amphithatre in the whole of egypt. Which is a bit of a shock i must say. It is not very big and they have placed a few things they have found in the sea (quite nice) You will not need long at the place. They are still digging in the area so i am sure",
          "There is a place to stand in front of the audience, where if you speak, the accoustics are perfect! Worth trying! 30 minutes unless you really know your history!",
          "Not really alot there considering it is quite a treck to get there but better than when we went 11 years ago.",
          "I am very like such a place to spend my time and that is wonderful construction with white and gray marbles. semi circulars and steps great place/ built by great people",
          "Not much is left after all these years, but what remains is very cool. You can actually stand in the middle and hear the acoustics at work. The villa is an additional ticket, you are allowed to wonder alone by the back building but to get inside and really see the mosaics up",
          "The good thing about this site is that actually proves there was an enormous Greek and Roman city here once, because there is barely anything else left to let you know this. There is a very well preserved little theatre, a few columns and some odds and ends statuary to look at ,",
          "You don't need to spend a lot of time here. (less then 20 minutes). But its pretty interesting to see an old Roman Amphitheatre. There are mosaics that are pretty beautiful to see. You can also get some neat pictures here. Good place to get Post cards outside with the street",
          "It is stunning!! Hard to believe the engineering that it took to build it. It a well worth a visit with all the stone sculptures and pieces of other major sites",
          "Really gives you a sense of history, Ancient Rome in Alexandria. The home of Cleopatra and Marc Anthony.",
          "very nice and interesting attraction, really interesting but very dirty... I can express well my disappoint to see a little jewellery like it dirty... prices are different between egyptian and european... of course... this is special Egypt welcome for us!",
          "Amongst all the hussle of the busy city and just 5 minutes from the train station sits the Roman Amphlteatre. Costs 20 Egyptain pounds(EP) to get in. Great place to walk around and be able to imagine what things were like in Roman times. Not too far from the national museum (35",
          "A great site to visit, the amphitheatre is large and assessible to all.There is also a wonderful colonade to walk along.",
          "When I am in Egypt I live practically next door to this wonderful excavation. Most public sights cost about 26 LE to enter and I think this is about the same. It is a wonderful example of it's kind and probably the world's finest example to date. The history of this wonderful",
          "it sounds so good as an historical place, i liked it so much because i like such places , so if you like historical places you have to visit it",
          "I have never seen such Amphitheatre like this before my visit to Alexandria. It has beautiful ancient architecture, very nice place.",
          "Beautiful ancient ruin with nice preservation. If you visit the am phi theatre, try to sing or make sound in the middle of the theatre on the cylindric stone and you will ear your voice echoing only when you stand on the stone, if you move a bit from he stone your echoing voice",
          "I had never seen a Roman Amphitheatre before, so this was an interesting experience for me. We visited in the middle of the day, so it was quite hot. Make sure and wear a hat and sunscreen. A real gem surrounded by modernity!",
          "We cal it the roman theatre and they make concerts in it in summer :)",
          "I have had the blessing of attending few musical events at the Roman Amphitheater. Everything about this place is fabulous, it is so alive and it takes you back to the Roman time. A must visit during your stay in Alexandria.",
          "I took couple of my Saudi friends there, its really an old place where you can see the old Villas and the old Theater. Nice place and huge parking, not crowded at all!",
          "This is supposedly the only Roman amphitheatre in all of Egypt. Don't forget to check out some bird mosaics on what used to be the floor of a burnt down Roman villa (just behind the amphitheatre). I paid 20 LE for the Roman Theatre and 15 LE to see the Bird\u2019s Villa of Kom",
          "Its been great Amphitheater to experience the ancient Roman era. Worth watching really. The entry fee is very nominal for the foreigners. If you are travelling from Cairo to Alexandria by Train, then you may plan this as your first visit since it is less than half a KM away from",
          "we had an awesome guide who fed us with lots of info on the site we were very impressed with the attraction especially the centre of the amphitheatre and the acoustics definitely worth a visit",
          "The roman Amphitheatre was truly amazing. We been to Rome and Pompeii and I found this just as interesting. The Amphitheatre covers a more compact area so exploring is easier. One hour should be enough time. It is very interesting to see roman ruins in the middle of an",

          "If you have never visited a Roman Amphitheatre perhaps you will like it, however this hardly compared to ruins we have seen in Jordan/Syria and of course Europe.",
          "For those people interested in seeing where the Romans have been, this amphitheatre is well worth a visit. Its quite small, and would possibly have been a private amphitheatre. It was only discovered during the 1960's. There are two sections of original mosaic floor, and",
          "this place is really huge and interesting, easily accessible by many means of transportation, dating back to the grecko-roman era it had seen many historical events so be prepared and read before you go",
          "We loved this site, thanks to our guide Zach, did great job telling us all history of Alexandria as we sit on the stone benches of this lovely old place , thank you Zach ,it was a great lecture.",
          "Different in that Roman, as opposed to Greek or Egyptian. If you have seen other well preserved amphitheaters and forums, not worth visiting unless you are a student of the Roman period. Otherwise worth a short visit, although most of the site can be seen from the outside.",
          "nicely preserved though incongruously set amidst a college grounds. can still see the roman numerals inscribed on the seats of kings long gone... fascinating,",
          "It was nice to see but again as all the places in Egypt this place needs some restoration and maintenance. The place is actually visible from outside but if you really want to be in the Arena you must go down the stairs.",

          "Very interesting site in very good condition. My friend's wife and children were even finding potsherds in the gravel around the site.",
          "This was our first site on our Alexandria daytrip, but I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. It was much smaller than I anticipated, so perhaps Amphitheatre is the wrong word for it (Odeum is the other name for it). The site offers some good contrast to the modern city",
          "This amphitheater is well preserved and it i fun to step up to the acoustic center spot and try it out, but in reality, this amphitheater is nothing special compared to other amphitheaters around the old roman empire. If you haven't seen one before it will be great but if you",
          "This is sometimes referred to as the Roman Ampitheatre (Trip Advisor lists them separately but they are the same thing). The proper name for this is an Odeum, which is a smaller type of Roman theatre and there are very few examples of these in the world. The site at Kom El-Dikka",

        "wiki": "Alexandria is the ninth-largest city in the state of Louisiana and is the parish seat of Rapides Parish, Louisiana, United States. It lies on the south bank of the Red River in almost the exact geographic center of the state. It is the principal city of the Alexandria metropolitan area (population 153,922) which encompasses all of Rapides and Grant parishes. Its neighboring city is Pineville. In 2010, the population was 47,723, an increase of 3 percent from the 2000 census.\n\n\n== History ==\nLocated along the Red River, the city of Alexandria was originally home to a community which supported activities of the adjacent French trader outpost of Post du Rapides. The area developed as an assemblage of traders, Caddo people, and merchants in the agricultural lands bordering the mostly unsettled areas to the north and providing a link from the south to the El Camino Real and then larger settlement of Natchitoches, the oldest permanent settlement in the Louisiana Purchase.\nAlexander Fulton, a businessman from Washington County, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, received a land grant from Spain in 1762, and the first organized settlement was made at some point in the 1780s. In 1805, Fulton and business partner Thomas Harris Maddox laid out the town plan and named the town in Fulton's honor. The earliest deed that survives for an Alexandria resident is from June 24, 1801, when a William Cochren, who identifies himself as \"Slave master of the Southern Americas\", sold a tract of land across the Red River to a William Murrey.That same year, Fulton was appointed coroner in Rapides Parish by territorial Governor William C.C. Claiborne. Alexandria was incorporated as a town in 1818 and received a city charter in 1832.\n\n\n=== Civil War in Alexandria ===\nIn the spring of 1863, Alexandria was occupied by Union forces under the command of Admiral David Dixon Porter and General Nathaniel P. Banks. Porter arrived with his gunboats on May 7. Later in the day Banks reached Alexandria with his cavalry, whose members had marched twenty-five miles that day to reach the city. According to the historian John D. Winters of Louisiana Tech University, Porter disliked Banks but nevertheless turned over Alexandria to him and then departed to rejoin General U.S. Grant at the ongoing siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Banks posted guards and declared martial law. Porter left behind the gunboat USS Lafayette in Alexandria and posted the USS Pittsburg on the Black River to the northeast.In 1864, Admiral Porter returned to the area and quarreled with General Banks over possession of cotton supplies. Porter seized three hundred bales of Confederate cotton from various warehouses in Alexandria and stamped it \"U.S.N. prize\", referring to the United States Navy. Porter sent his sailors into the country to search for unginned cotton. After the crop was located, it was brought to Alexandria to be ginned and baled. The sailors also seized molasses and wool. Winters writes that Porter \"took all cotton wherever he found it, cotton belonging to the Confederate government, cotton belonging to the 'rebels,' and cotton belonging to 'loyal' citizens.\"Winters continues: \"Banks was furious with Porter when he learned that the admiral was scouring the interior for cotton. Since he had no authority to stop Porter's speculative activities, Banks could only try to beat him to the remaining cotton. Army wagons were sent out in large numbers to collect the cotton. Thousands of bales were brought in by the troops and stored for future shipment. Jealous of the abundant transportation facilities of the army, unprincipled navy men stole army wagons and teams at night, repainted the wagons, and branded the mules with navy initials, and dove deep in the country in search of cotton.\"The federal army made itself as comfortable as possible during its long stay in Alexandria. Winters writes that \"lumber and tools were foraged, and the men busied themselves by building wooden tent floors, benches, and furniture. ... Alexandria [was enclosed] with a zigzag line of fortifications.\" While Banks remained in Alexandria in the spring of 1864, Porter was temporarily trapped north of the city because of the low level of the Red River, four feet instead of the needed seven feet to accommodate gunboats.Confederate citizens as a whole were most fearful of the Union. According to Winters, \"most [Confederates] had never before seen a Yankee soldier [and] expected the worse from the invader. ... 'Some cried, some cursed, some whined; and some overcome with fear, hid themselves in the woods, leaving everything to the tender mercies of the army.' Negroes were responsible for much of the plunder and pillage. Negro camp followers and officers' servants roamed the plantations and small farms without hindrance, bringing in their booty to camps each afternoon.\"On May 13, 1864, when the Union decided to abandon Alexandria, the city was set afire despite General Banks' order to the contrary. Winters reports that \"burning and plundering\" by two Union corps, who set fire to a store on Front Street. Then \"a strong wind spread the flames rapidly from one building to the next.\" Banks later claimed that the fire \"broke out in the attic of one of the buildings on the levee inhabited by either soldiers or refugees.\" Winters reports that \"pandemonium reigned; frightened cows bellowed and charged through the flaming streets; squawking chickens with scorched wings tried to fly out of danger. Hundreds of women, children, and old people ran through the streets, trying to carry a few of their belongings to safety. When the heat became unbearable, they dropped their loads and fled to the levee. Thieves ran from house to house and even along the levee taking whatever they wanted from the shocked people. By noon the most congested parts of town were destroyed. An attempt to blow up a church in the path of the fire only succeeded in helping to spread the flames.\"Alexandria faced the overwhelming task of rebuilding with a year of the war remaining. Prices became exorbitant; butter cost $10 a pound, bacon $5 a pound, flour $3 a pound, and a bushel of meal $10. Many of the helpless lived in the forest without food, shelter, or clothing, subsisting on blackberries. All clothing was homespun, and shoes were mostly made of cloth. While Admiral Porter expressed sympathy for the suffering Alexandria residents, he declared the \"burning of Alexandria a fit termination of the unfortunate Red River expedition.\"\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nAlexandria is located at 31\u00b017\u203234\u2033N 92\u00b027\u203233\u2033W and has an elevation of 75 feet (22.9 m).According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 27.0 square miles (69.9 km2), of which 26.4 square miles (68.4 km2) is land and 0.6 square mile (1.5 km2) (2.15%) is water.\n\nAlexandria is on a level plain in the center of the Louisiana Longleaf Pine forests, in which pine is interspersed with various hardwoods. A number of small bayous, such as Bayou Rapides, Bayou Robert, and Hynson Bayou, meander throughout the city. In the immediate vicinity of the city, cotton, sugar, alfalfa, and garden vegetables are cultivated.\nThe climate is humid subtropical with some continental influence in the winter. Summers are consistently hot and humid, whereas winters are mild, with occasional cold snaps. On average, the first freeze occurs in early to mid November and the last freeze occurs in early to mid March. The area receives plentiful rainfall year-round, with thunderstorms possible throughout the year. Some storms can be severe, especially during the spring months. According to 'Cities Ranked and Rated' (Bert Sperling and Peter Sander), Alexandria reports an average of 69 days per year with thunder reported, which is nearly double the national average. Snowfall is rare, with measurable snow having occurred 27 times since 1895. The heaviest snowfall event took place February 12\u201313, 1960 when 9.1\" of snow fell.Tropical storms and hurricanes affect Alexandria from time to time, but rarely cause severe damage, unlike areas closer to the coast. In September 2005 Hurricane Rita moved inland and affected Alexandria and surrounding areas, causing widespread power outages and damaging the roofs of some structures. The most recent hurricane, Gustav in 2008, caused widespread flooding, knocked over trees and power lines leading to power outages, and damaged structures. Some low-lying Alexandria neighborhoods had substantial flooding from Gustav, leaving several feet of water in houses.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 47,723 people, 17,816 households, and 11,722 families residing in the city.

The center hosts the Performing Arts Series of the Arts Council of Central Louisiana, the Red River Chorale (an auditioned community chorus), and presentations of numerous local theater groups. The land for the center was donated by The Alexandria Town Talk newspaper, owned by the Gannett Company of McLean, Virginia.\nBusinesswoman Jacqueline Seagall Caplan (1935\u20132016) was the president of the Arts Council of Central Louisiana and the chairman of the group's executive committee when the Coughlin-Saunders Performing Arts Center opened in 2004. She predicted that Coughlin-Saunders would in time \"provide a place people can point to and say it's theirs. ... [Until now], we've never had a performing arts center where every type of performing art can come.\"The Hearn Stage is a black box theater for smaller productions.  The Arts Council provides day-to-day management of both the Coughlin-Saunders Center and the Hearn Stage.The Riverfront Amphitheater hosts each April a \"Jazz on the River\" music festival, sponsored by the Arna Bontemps African American Museum.

Snyder (1922\u20131993), Malcolm P. Hebert, Sr. (1926\u20132006), and Arnold Jack Rosenthal (1923\u20132010), respectively.\n\n\n==== Today ====\nAlexandria has a mayoral-council system of government.  The Mayor serves as the executive branch of the local government. The current Mayor \u2013 Jacques Roy \u2013 was elected to office in November 2006, succeeding long-time mayor Edward Gordon \"Ned\" Randolph, Jr. Randolph had succeeded John K. Snyder.\nThe City Council serves as the legislative branch. The five districts of the city are represented on the Council; in addition there are two council members elected to serve as at-large representatives of the city.\nThe Alexandria Court has a limited jurisdiction, consisting of the citizens of Wards 1, 2 and 8 in Rapides Parish. Within those boundaries the court has the power to hear and decide both criminal and civil cases, rule in civil cases and hand down judgment for punishment in criminal cases.\n\n\n=== Area politics ===\nOverall, the people of the Alexandria area tend to be conservative. Even though the majority typically elects Republicans in national elections, they vote for Democrats in local elections, many of which are not contested by the GOP.\n\n\n=== United States Congressional district ===\nFrom 1913 to 1993, Alexandria served as the seat of Louisiana's Eighth Congressional district.  A Democratic seat, it was held by the Long family for nearly half of its existence, from 1953 to 1987, broken only by the two terms of Harold B. McSween and three terms of Republican Clyde Holloway of Forest Hill. The seat was removed after the 1990 census indicated Louisiana no longer had the population to support it. The district was split among the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Congressional districts. Alexandria is now in the Fifth district and was represented from 2003 to 2013 by Rodney Alexander, a Democrat-turned-Republican. From November 2013 to January 2015 the representative is Vance McAllister of Ouachita Parish.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nSituated south of the city, Louisiana State University at Alexandria (or LSUA) is a regional campus of the state's flagship university system, Louisiana State University.  From its establishment in 1959, the campus offered only two-year degrees; students seeking baccalaureate degrees had to commute or move to the main campus in Baton Rouge in order to gain a four-year degree.  After 1976, students could either commute or telecommute in order to attend upper-level courses, including graduate classes.  In 2002, following approval by the Louisiana State University Board of Supervisors and the Louisiana Board of Regents the Louisiana Legislature passed legislation allowing LSUA to offer baccalaureate degrees.\nA four-year degree is also attainable through Southern Baptist-affiliated Louisiana College in Pineville, founded in 1906.\nAlexandria also has one of the Region 6 Louisiana Technical College campuses.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\nRapides Parish School Board operates public schools.\nAlexandria has three public high schools: Bolton High School, Alexandria Senior High School, and Peabody Magnet High School. In addition, there are two private high schools: the Roman Catholic Holy Savior Menard Central High School, and Grace Christian.\nThe Renaissance Home for Youth west of Alexandria is a haven for youthful offenders who live in a group-home setting as an alternative to reform school or adult jail. Since the facility opened in 1973, nearly 12 thousand young people have lived at the home in search of rehabilitation.Alfred Booker Junior Academy proudly follows faith- centered education for all students Pre-Kindergarten through eighth grade.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAlexandria serves as the crossroads of Louisiana. To reach either Shreveport or Monroe from the southern portion of the state, the easiest method of travel takes the driver through Alexandria.  Likewise, if a visitor is to head from the northern portion of the state to the Cajun portions of the state (Lake Charles and Lafayette), or the greater metropolitan areas of either Baton Rouge or New Orleans, the easiest method of travel involves driving down Interstate 49 through Alexandria.\nIn addition to I-49, travelers can follow Louisiana 1 up to Alexandria from Baton Rouge and points south.  Also, Highway 167 could be taken from Opelousas north to Ruston, crossing through Alexandria at one of the few bridges over the Red River in central Louisiana.  Highways 165 and 71 also link Alexandria and points south with the northern and southern portions of the state via the Curtis-Coleman bridge.\nThere are possible plans for a 50-mile, 4 lane beltway to encircle Alexandria and Pineville. As of now, it is only in the planning stages of development.\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\nThree road bridges cross the Red River in the Alexandria area.  They are:\n\nThe Purple Heart Memorial Bridge. Part of the Alexandria-Pineville Expressway (also referred to as the Cottingham Expressway), it connects Interstate 49 to Highway 167 by crossing the Red River from downtown Alexandria to Pineville. It replaced the Fulton Street Bridge and has six lanes of traffic.  Designed by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LADOTD), the bridge cost $15.9 million in federal and state funds. The northbound portion was completed in 1995, the southbound in 1998.\nThe U.S. 165 Business Bridge (alternatively, the Gillis Long Bridge, the Red River Bridge or the Jackson Street Bridge) connecting downtown Pineville with the business district in Alexandria. It is a two-lane vertical-lift bridge with a sidewalk/bikepath on either side. The bridge is named after U.S. Representative Gillis Long, who represented Louisiana's Eighth Congressional District. It was built in 1985 to replace the Murray Street Bridge.\nThe Oscar K. Allen Bridge connecting Highway 165/71 on both sides of the Red River. It is a two-lane K-truss type bridge, named after Governor Oscar K. Allen. It was built in 1936 to connect Alexandria to the (former) Fort Buhlow. A new four-lane (two lanes in each direction) bridge is being built beside the aging OK Allen Bridge (appropriately named the Fort Buhlow Bridge) and should be open in mid-2013.  At that time US 165 will be completely four-laned for most of its traverse of Louisiana.Former bridges include:\n\nThe Murray Street Bridge.  One of the first bridges in Alexandria.  A two-lane steel truss swing bridge, it decayed over time, finally being demolished in 1983.  The approach on the Alexandria side was turned into a river overlook as part of the Alexandria Levee Park.\nThe Fulton Street Bridge.  Named after Fulton Street which it connected with Highway 167. Technically part of the Alexandria-Pineville Expressway, it was a four-lane steel vertical-lift bridge.  It was demolished in 1994 to make way for the Purple Heart Memorial Bridge.There are two railroad bridges over the Red River in Alexandria. One is located near the Buhlow area north of the OK Allen bridge. The other is south of the Purple Heart Memorial Bridge.\n\n\n=== Mass transit ===\nRegional mass transit is handled by ATRANS (Alexandria Transportation Authority).\nFor those leaving or arriving at the city by bus, Greyhound Lines has a terminal downtown.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nAlexandria is served by the Alexandria International Airport and the Esler Regional Airport in Pineville.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nAlexandria does not have Amtrak service, nor a commuter rail system. The Kansas City Southern (Southern Belle) and the Missouri Pacific (since absorbed by Union Pacific) (Louisiana Eagle and Louisiana Daylight) operated train stations in the area in the early part of the 20th century but passenger services ended in the 1960s and the stations have closed.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCity of Alexandria : Government and community services.\nThe Town Talk : Alexandria's Local Daily Newspaper.\nKALB-TV : Alexandria's local NBC and CBS station.\nKLAX-TV : Alexandria's local ABC station.\nVisit Alexandria : Business Directory.",

The former church was built in 370 AD and is dedicated to St. Athanasius of Alexandria. When Islam came to Egypt, the church was converted to a small mosque. \n\n\n== Roman rule ==\nIn 370 AD, The Church of St. Athanasius was built.\n\n\n== Islamic conquest ==\n\nOn November 8, 641 AD, Alexandria fell into Muslim control by the caliph, Umar after a 14-month siege under the leadership of Amr ibn al-As when the Byzantine Empire surrendered the city and a treaty was signed. Since then, the church was turned into a mosque by the Muslims.\n\n\n== Napoleonic expedition ==\n\nIn 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte led the French campaign in Egypt and Syria. The Attarine Mosque was once thought by the French to house the Tomb of Alexander the Great. Vivant Denon's drawing of the mosque courtyard depicted a small octagonal building housing a sarcophagus closely resembling the \"House of Alexander the Great\" which leads to speculations whether this was the tomb of the city's founder. It was later known that the sarcophagus belongs to Nectanebo II.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLists of mosques \nList of mosques in Africa\nList of mosques in Egypt\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Again, if you want to feel your more in an old town atmosphere, head 2 1/2 hours south to Colonial Williamsburg. This is a nice place to stroll through if you're in the area, but as with nearly all else in Old Town, just not work going out of your way to see/experience",
          "This is a church--built in 1767--that the founding families worshiped in. At the front there are two stones on either side of the alter. One is engraved Washington for George Washington and the other is Lee for Robert E Lee's family. It makes you think about how hard it must",

With a population of 5,200,000, Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean, the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa. The city extends about 40 km (25 mi)  at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea. Alexandria is a popular tourist destination, and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.\nAlexandria was founded in c.\u2009331 BC by Alexander the Great, king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth, during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire. An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria. Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years, until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at Fustat (later absorbed into Cairo). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library (the largest in the ancient world); and the Necropolis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity. It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome.\nThe city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria, which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire. In the modern world, the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.\nFollowing the Arab conquest of Egypt in AD 641, the city was plundered and lost its significance before re-emerging in the modern era. From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major center of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centers in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nRecent radiocarbon dating of seashell fragments and lead contamination show human activity at the location during the period of the Old Kingdom (27th-21st centuries BC) and again in the period 1000-800 BC, followed by the absence of activity thereafter. From ancient sources it is known there existed a trading post at this location during the time of Rameses the Great for trade with Crete, but it had long been lost by the time of Alexander's arrival. A small Egyptian fishing village named Rhakotis (Egyptian:*Ra\u02c1-\u1e32\u0101\u1e6dit, written r\u02c1-\u1e33\u1e6dy.t, 'That which is built up') existed since the 13th century BC in the vicinity and eventually grew into the Egyptian quarter of the city. Just east of Alexandria (where Abu Qir Bay is now), there was in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of Canopus and Heracleion. The latter was recently rediscovered under water.\nAlexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in April 331 BC as \u1f08\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 (Alexandreia). Passing through Egypt, Alexander wanted to build a large Greek city on Egypt's coast that would bear his name. He chose the site of Alexandria, envisioning the building of a causeway to the nearby island of Pharos that would generate two great natural harbors. Alexandria was intended to supersede the older Greek colony of Naucratis as a Hellenistic center in Egypt, and to be the link between Greece and the rich Nile valley.  A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to the city during his life.\nAfter Alexander's departure, his viceroy Cleomenes continued the expansion. The architect Dinocrates of Rhodes designed the city, using a Hippodamian grid plan. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, his general Ptolemy Lagides took possession of Egypt and brought Alexander's body to Egypt with him. Ptolemy at first ruled from the old Egyptian capital of Memphis. In 322/321 BC he had Cleomenes executed. Finally, in 305 BC, Ptolemy declared himself Pharaoh as Ptolemy I Soter (\"Savior\") and moved his capital to Alexandria.\nAlthough Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's early development, the Heptastadion and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined Tyre and becoming the center of the new commerce between Europe and the Arabian and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than Carthage. In a century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with Greek people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nAlexandria was not only a center of Hellenism, but was also home to the largest urban Jewish community in the world. The Septuagint, a Greek version of the Tanakh, was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic center of learning (Library of Alexandria), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Jewish, and Egyptian. By the time of Augustus, the city walls encompassed an area of 5.34 km2, and the total population in Roman times was around 500\u2013600,000.According to Philo of Alexandria, in the year 38 of the Common era, disturbances erupted between Jews and Greek citizens of Alexandria during a visit paid by the Jewish king Agrippa I to Alexandria, principally over the respect paid by the Jewish nation to the Roman emperor, and which quickly escalated to open affronts and violence between the two ethnic groups and the desecration of Alexandrian synagogues. The violence was quelled after Caligula intervened and had the Roman governor, Flaccus, removed from the city.In AD 115, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the Kitos War, which gave Hadrian and his architect, Decriannus, an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215, the emperor Caracalla visited the city and, because of some insulting satires that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365, Alexandria was devastated by a tsunami (365 Crete earthquake), an event annually commemorated years later as a \"day of horror\".\n\n\n=== Islamic era ===\n\nIn 619, Alexandria fell to the Sassanid Persians. Although the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general 'Amr ibn al-'As invaded it during the Muslim conquest of Egypt, after a siege that lasted 14 months. The first Arab governor of Egypt recorded to have visited Alexandria was Utba ibn Abi Sufyan, who strengthened the Arab presence and built a governor's palace in the city in 664\u2013665.After the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517, the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under Ottoman rule until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of Rosetta during the 9th to 18th centuries, and only regained its former prominence with the construction of the Mahmoudiyah Canal in 1807.\nAlexandria figured prominently in the military operations of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernize the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.In July 1882, the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied.In July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the Lavon Affair. On 26 October 1954, Alexandria's Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on Gamal Abdel Nasser.Europeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 Suez Crisis that led to an outburst of Arab nationalism. The nationalization of property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly all the rest.\n\n\n=== Ibn Battuta in Alexandria ===\n\nIn reference to Alexandria, Egypt, Ibn Battuta speaks of great saints that resided here. One of them being Imam Borhan Oddin El Aaraj. He was said to have the power of working miracles. He told Ibn Battuta that he should go find his three brothers, Farid Oddin, who lived in India, Rokn Oddin Ibn Zakarya, who lived in Sindia, and Borhan Oddin, who lived in China. Battuta then made it his purpose to find these people and give them his compliments. Sheikh Yakut was another great man. He was the disciple of Sheikh Abu Abbas El Mursi, who was the disciple of Abu El Hasan El Shadali, who is known to be a servant of God. Abu Abbas was the author of the Hizb El Bahr and was famous for piety and miracles. Abu Abd Allah El Murshidi was a great interpreting saint that lived secluded in the Minyat of Ibn Murshed. He lived alone but was visited daily by emirs, viziers, and crowds that wished to eat with him. The Sultan of Egypt (El Malik El Nasir) visited him, as well. Ibn Battuta left Alexandria with the intent of visiting him.Ibn Battuta also visited the Pharos lighthouse on 2 occasions; in 1326 he found it to be partly in ruins and in 1349 it had deteriorated further, making entrance to the edifice impossible.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\nThe most important battles and sieges of Alexandria include:\n\nSiege of Alexandria (47 BC), Julius Caesar's civil war\nBattle of Alexandria (30 BC), final war of the Roman Republic\nSiege of Alexandria (619), Byzantine-Persian Wars\nSiege of Alexandria (641), Rashidun conquest of Byzantine Egypt\nAlexandrian Crusade (1365), a crusade led by Peter de Lusignan of Cyprus which resulted in the defeat of the Mamluks and the sack of the city.\nBattle of Alexandria (1801), Napoleonic Wars\nSiege of Alexandria (1801), Napoleonic Wars\nAlexandria expedition (1807), Napoleonic Wars\n\n\n== Ancient layout ==\nGreek Alexandria was divided into three regions:\nBrucheum\nBrucheum is the Royal or Greek quarter and forms the most magnificent portion of the city. In Roman times Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal;\nThe Jewish quarter\nThis quarter is the northeast portion of the city;\nRhakotis\nRhakotis is the old city that was absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians. (from Coptic Rakot\u0259 \"Alexandria\").Two main streets, lined with colonnades and said to have been each about 60 meters (200 ft) wide, intersected in the center of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his Mausoleum) rose. This point is very near the present mosque of Nebi Daniel; and the line of the great East\u2013West \"Canopic\" street, only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharia Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.\nAlexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a 1,260-metre-long (4,130 ft) mole and called the Heptastadion (\"seven stadia\"\u2014a stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180 metres or 590 feet). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the \"Moon Gate\" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern \"Ras al-Tin\" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.\nIn Strabo's time, (latter half of the 1st century BC) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbor.\n\nThe Royal Palaces, filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbor on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the \"Private Port,\" and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land subsidence here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.\nThe Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Julius Caesar as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the battle of Pharsalus\nThe Poseidon, or Temple of the Sea God, close to the theater\nThe Timonium built by Marc Antony\nThe Emporium (Exchange)\nThe Apostases (Magazines)\nThe Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole\nBehind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great obelisks, which become known as \"Cleopatra's Needles,\" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.\nThe Gymnasium and the Palaestra are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.\nThe Temple of Saturn; alexandria west.\nThe Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.\nThe Musaeum with its famous Library and theater in the same region; site unknown.\nThe Serapeum of Alexandria, the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells us that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near \"Pompey's Pillar,\" which was an independent monument erected to commemorate Diocletian's siege of the city.The names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, The Great Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, reputed to be 138 metres (453 feet) high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy (Ptolemy II Philadelphus) completed it, at a total cost of 800 talents. It took 12 years to complete and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the Great Pyramid of Giza. A temple of Hephaestus also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.\nIn the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens, according to a census dated from 32 CE, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 216,000 to 500,000 making it one of the largest cities ever built before the Industrial Revolution and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAlexandria is located in the country of Egypt, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlexandria has a borderline hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BWh), approaching a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). As the rest of Egypt's northern coast, the prevailing north wind, blowing across the Mediterranean, gives the city a less severe climate from the desert hinterland. Rafah and Alexandria are the wettest places in Egypt; the other wettest places are Rosetta, Baltim, Kafr el-Dawwar, and Mersa Matruh. The city's climate is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, moderating its temperatures, causing variable rainy winters and moderately hot and slightly prolonged summers that, at times, can be very humid; January and February are the coolest months, with daily maximum temperatures typically ranging from 12 to 18 \u00b0C (54 to 64 \u00b0F) and minimum temperatures that could reach 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F). temperature sometimes gets lower than 5 and it sometimes rains snow.\nAlexandria experiences violent storms, rain and sometimes sleet and hail during the cooler months; these events, combined with a poor drainage system, have been responsible for occasional flooding in the city in the past though they rarely occur anymore. July and August are the hottest and driest months of the year, with an average daily maximum temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual rainfall is around 200 mm (7.9 in) but has been as high as 417 mm (16.4 in)Port Said, Kosseir, Baltim, Damietta and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in Egypt.\nThe highest recorded temperature was 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) on 30 May 1961, and the coldest recorded temperature was 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1994.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDue to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour and the rest has been built over in modern times.\n\n\"Pompey's Pillar\", a Roman triumphal column, is one of the best-known ancient monuments still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient acropolis\u2014a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab cemetery\u2014and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its pedestal, it is 30 m (99 ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in diameter at the base, tapering to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) at the top. The shaft is 88 feet (27 m) high, and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is 132 cubic meters (4,662 cubic feet) and weight approximately 396 tons. Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient obelisks. The Romans had cranes but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several obelisk erecting experiments including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk. The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. \"Pompey's Pillar\" is a misnomer, as it has nothing to do with Pompey, having been erected in 293 for Diocletian, possibly in memory of the rebellion of Domitius Domitianus. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god Serapis were enacted, and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.\nAlexandria's catacombs, known as Kom El Shoqafa, are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large spiral staircase, and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other syncretic Romano-Egyptian religious symbols, burial niches, and sarcophagi, as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in 1900.The most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as Kom El Deka. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its Roman-era baths.\nPersistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local Archaeological Society, and by many individuals, notably Greeks proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.\nThe past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; D. G. Hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898\u20131899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.\n\nSince the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. Cleopatra VII's royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual subsidence in the 4th century AD. This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team. It raised a noted head of Caesarion. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy. The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman strata.\nThe most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.\nThe objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in Kom El Shoqafa (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).\nThe German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of Kom El Deka, which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.\nThe making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtlessly immense; but despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\".\n\n\n=== Temple of Taposiris Magna ===\nThe temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine Pharos Lighthouse.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, there are Muslim mosques. Coptic Christian churches are most common churches .There are also other Christian churches as:  Greek , Latin and Armenian . Orthodox Christian churches are most common but Catholic , Anglican and Evangelical churches are present. Also there is a Jewish synagogue\n\n\n=== Islam ===\n\nThe most famous mosque in Alexandria is Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque in Bahary. Other notable mosques in the city include Ali ibn Abi Talib mosque in Somouha, Bilal mosque, al-Gamaa al-Bahari in Mandara, Hatem mosque in Somouha, Hoda el-Islam mosque in Sidi Bishr, al-Mowasah mosque in Hadara, Sharq al-Madina mosque in Miami, al-Shohadaa mosque in Mostafa Kamel, Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque, Yehia mosque in Zizinia, Sidi Gaber mosque in Sidi Gaber, Sidi B esher mosque, Rokay el-Islam mosque in Elessway, Elsadaka Mosque in Sidibesher Qebly, Elshatbi mosque and Sultan mosque.\nAlexandria is the base of the Salafi movements in Egypt. Al-Nour Party, which is based in the city and overwhelmingly won most of the Salafi votes in the 2011\u201312 parliamentary election, supports the president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nAfter Rome and Constantinople, Alexandria was considered the third-most important seat of Christianity in the world. The Pope of Alexandria was second only to the bishop of Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire until 430. The Church of Alexandria had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, the Church of Alexandria was split between the Miaphysites and the Melkites. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. In the 19th century, Catholic and Protestant missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.\nToday, the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is Saint Mark Cathedral . The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include Pope Cyril I Church in Cleopatra, Saint Georges Church in Sporting, Saint Mark & Pope Peter I Church in Sidi Bishr, Saint Mary Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, Saint Mina Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and Saint Takla Haymanot's Church in Ibrahimeya.\nThe most important Eastern Orthodox churches in Alexandria are Agioi An\u00e1rgyroi Church, Church of the Annunciation, Saint Anthony Church, Archangels Gabriel & Michael Church, Taxiarchon Church, Saint Catherine Church, Cathedral of the Dormition in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, Prophet Elijah Church, Saint George Church, Saint Joseph Church in Fleming, Saint Joseph of Arimathea Church, Saint Mark & Saint Nektarios Chapel in Ramleh, Saint Nicholas Church, Saint Paraskevi Church, Saint Sava Cathedral in Ramleh, Saint Theodore Chapel and the Russian church of Saint Alexander Nevsky in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.\nThe Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said has jurisdiction over all Latin Church Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the Jesuits in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan, which uses the Byzantine Rite, and the nominal see of the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia, using the Armenian Rite.\nThe Saint Mark Church in Shatby, founded as part of Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, Coptic Catholic and Coptic Orthodox rites.\nIn antiquity, Alexandria was a major center of the cosmopolitan religious movement called Gnosticism (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\n\nAlexandria's once-flourishing Jewish community declined rapidly following the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, after which negative reactions towards Zionism among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt fled to the newly established Israel, France, Brazil and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50. The most important synagogue in Alexandria is the Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nAlexandria has a number of higher education institutions. Alexandria University is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its Faculty of Medicine & Faculty of Engineering. In addition, the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology in New Borg El Arab city is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010.  The Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC American University in Cairo because of its worldwide recognition from board of engineers at UK & ABET in US. Universit\u00e9 Senghor is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly recruits students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT) and Pharos University in Alexandria.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\nAlexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by Catholic missionaries include Coll\u00e8ge de la M\u00e8re de Dieu, Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Sion, Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Ecoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), \u00c9cole Girard, \u00c9cole Saint Gabriel, \u00c9cole Saint-Vincent de Paul, \u00c9cole Saint Joseph, \u00c9cole Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lyc\u00e9e el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently a public school run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais d'Alexandrie (\u00c9cole Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the Istituto \"Don Bosco\".\nEnglish schools in Alexandria are becoming the most popular. English-language schools in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, British School of Alexandria, Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Egyptian English Language School,  Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, Schutz American School, Victoria College, El Manar Language School for Girls (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and El Nasr Girls' College.\nThere are only two German schools in Alexandria which are Deutsche Schule der Borrom\u00e4rinnen (DSB of Saint Charles Borrom\u00e9) and Neue Deutsche Schule Alexandria, which is run by Frau Sally Hammam.\nThe Montessori educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at Alexandria Montessori.\nThe most notable public schools in Alexandria include El Abbassia High School and Gamal Abdel Nasser High School.\n\n\n=== Women ===\nCirca the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to the same percentage in Cairo. As a result, specialist women's publications like al-Fat\u0101h by Hind Nawal, the country's first women's' journal, appeared.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city's principal airport is currently Borg El Arab Airport, which is located about 25 km (16 mi) away from the city center.\nFrom late 2011, El Nouzha Airport (Alexandria International Airport) was to be closed to commercial operations for two years as it underwent expansion, with all airlines operating out of Borg El Arab Airport from then onwards, where a brand new terminal was completed there in February 2010. In 2017, the government announced that Alexandria International Airport will shut down permanently for operational reasons.\n\n\n=== Port ===\n\nAlexandria has four ports; namely the Western Port also known as(Alexandria Port), which is the main port of the country that handles about 60% of the country's exports and imports, Dekhela Port west of the Western Port, the Eastern Port which is a yachting harbor, and Abu Qir Port at the northern east of the governorate. It is a commercial port for general cargo and phosphates.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nInternational Coastal Road (Mersa Matruh \u2013 Alexandria \u2013 Port Said)\nCairo\u2013Alexandria Desert Road (Alexandria \u2013 Cairo \u2013 220 km (137 mi), 6\u20138 lanes)\nCairo-Alexandria Agriculture Road (Alexandria \u2013 Cairo)\nMehwar El Ta'meer \u2013 (Alexandria \u2013 Borg El Arab)\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAlexandria's intracity commuter rail system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity railway station) to Abu Qir, parallel to the tram line. The commuter line's locomotives operate on diesel, as opposed to the overhead-electric tram.\nAlexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned Misr Station (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and Sidi Gaber railway station (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the center of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by Egyptian National Railways.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nAn extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the El Raml district in the west and ends in the Victoria district in the east. Most of the vehicles are blue in color. Some smaller yellow-colored vehicles have further routes beyond the two main endpoints. The tram routes have one of four numbers: 1, 2, 5, and 6. All four start at El Raml, but only two (1 and 2) reach Victoria. There are two converging and diverging points. The first starts at Bolkly (Isis) and ends at San Stefano. The other begins at Sporting and ends at Mostafa Kamel. Route 5 starts at San Stefano and takes the inner route to Bolkly. Route 6 starts at Sidi Gaber El Sheikh in the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 1 takes the inner route between San Stefano and Bolkly and the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 2 takes the route opposite to Route 1 in both these areas. The tram fares are 50 piastres (0.50 pounds), and 100 piastres (1.00 pounds) for the middle car. Some trams (that date back the 30s) charge a pound. The tram is considered the cheapest method of public transport. A caf\u00e9 operates in the second floor of the first car of tram 1 (a women-only car) which costs 5 L.E per person, also offering a WiFi service. A luxury light blue tram car operates from San Stefano to Ras El Tin, with free WiFi and movies and songs played inside for 5 L.E per ticket.\nStations:\n\nRoute 2 serves:\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nConstruction of the Alexandria Metro is due to begin in 2020 at a cost of $1.05 billion.\n\n\n=== Taxis and minibuses ===\n\nTaxis in Alexandria sport a yellow-and-black livery and are widely available. While Egyptian law requires all cabs to carry meters, these generally do not work and fares must be negotiated with the driver on either departure or arrival.\n\nThe minibus share taxi system, or mashr\u016b' operates along well-known traffic arteries. The routes can be identified by both their endpoints and the route between them:\n\nCorniche routes:\nEl Mandara \u2013 Bahari\nEl Mandara \u2013 El Mansheya\nAsafra \u2013 Bahari\nAsafra \u2013 El Mansheya\nEl Sa'aa \u2013 El Mansheya\nAbu Qir routes:\nEl Mandara \u2013 El Mahata (lit. \"the Station\", i.e. Misr Railway Station)\nAbu Qir \u2013 El Mahata\nVictoria \u2013 El Mahata\nEl Mandara \u2013 Victoria\nInterior routes:\nCabo \u2013 Bahari\nEl Mansheya \u2013 El Awayid\nEl Mansheya \u2013 El Maw'af El Gedid (the New Bus Station)\nHadara \u2013 El MahataThe route is generally written in Arabic on the side of the vehicle, although some drivers change their route without changing the paint. Some drivers also drive only a segment of a route rather than the whole path; such drivers generally stop at a point known as a major hub of the transportation system (for example, Victoria) to allow riders to transfer to another car or to another mode of transport.\nFare is generally L.E. 3.00 to travel the whole route. Shorter trips may have a lower fare, depending on the driver and the length of the trip.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe Royal Library of Alexandria, in Alexandria, Egypt, was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of Ptolemy II of Egypt. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the Muses\u2014the Museion, Greek \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03bd (from which the Modern English word museum is derived).\nIt has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.The Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002, near the site of the old Library.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Alexandria National Museum was inaugurated 31 December 2003. It is located in a restored Italian style palace in Tariq El Horreya Street (formerly Rue Fouad), near the center of the city. It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and Egypt. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria. Construction on the site was first undertaken in 1926.\nCavafy Museum\nThe Graeco-Roman Museum\nThe Museum of Fine Arts\nThe Royal Jewelry Museum\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nAlexandria Opera House, where classical music, Arabic music, ballet, and opera are performed and bearm basha theatre in elshatby.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThroughout Alexandria, there is art that resembles some of the oldest architectural styles of the Hellenic city, and its ancient decorations, especially in the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, is based on reviving the ancient Library of Alexandria. The Kom el shoqafa Catacombs are considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages and date back to the 2nd century. The remnants of Pompey's Pillar still remain today. This single pillar represents the elaborate temple which once stood in Alexandria. It remains at the site of the Serapeum, Alexandria's acropolis. The Serapeum, which stood for ancient tradition, conflicted with the rise of Christianity. It is a large tourist destination, today. the Roman Amphitheatre of Alexandria is another popular destination. Here, there remains a stage with around seven hundred to eight hundred seats. They also have numerous galleries of statues and details leftover form this time. Alexandria's tourism office announced plans to reserve some beaches for tourists in July 2018.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe main sport that interests Alexandrians is football, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. Alexandria Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Alexandria, Egypt. It is currently used mostly for football matches, and was used for the 2006 African Cup of Nations. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the African Cup of Nations in January 2006, which Egypt won. Sea sports such as surfing, jet-skiing and water polo are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the Alexandria Sporting Club, which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the country's national team with key players. The city hosted the AfroBasket, the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).\nAlexandria has four stadiums:\n\nOther less popular sports like tennis and squash are usually played in private social and sports clubs, like:\n\nStarted in 2011, Cross Egypt Challenge is an international cross-country motorcycle and scooter rally conducted throughout the most difficult tracks and roads of Egypt. Alexandria is known as the yearly starting point of Cross Egypt Challenge and a huge celebration is conducted the night before the rally starts after all the international participants arrive to the city.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nAlexandria is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nA.

        "wiki": "The Graeco-Roman Museum is an archaeological museum located in Alexandria, Egypt. Erected in 1892, it was first built in a five-room apartment, inside one small building on Rosetta Street (later Avenue Canope and now Horriya). In 1895, it was transferred to another, larger building near Gamal Abdul Nasser Street. The museum contains several pieces dating from the Greco-Roman (Ptolemaic) era in the 3rd century BC, such as a sculpture of Apis in black granite, the sacred bull of the Egyptians, mummies, sarcophagus, tapestries, and other objects offering a view of Greco-Roman civilization in contact with ancient Egypt.\nThe museum's collection is the product of donations from wealthy Alexandrians as well as of excavations led by successive directors of the institution, both within the town and in its environs. Certain other objects have come from the Organization of Antiquities at Cairo (particularly those of the Pharaonic period) and from various digs undertaken at the beginning of the century in Fayoum and at Benhasa. Housed within a historic building whose beautiful neoclassical facade of six columns and pediment bears the large Greek inscription \u2018MOY\u03a3EION\u2019 (MOUSEION). The museum consists of 27 halls and an attractive garden, which offer an excellent introduction to Egypt's Greco-Roman period.\nThe museum has been closed for renovations since 2005. As of June 2017, the building was still surrounded by scaffolding.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMuseums in Alexandria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSupreme Council of Antiquities Museums: The Graeco-Roman Museum",

With a population of 5,200,000, Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean, the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa. The city extends about 40 km (25 mi)  at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea. Alexandria is a popular tourist destination, and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.\nAlexandria was founded in c.\u2009331 BC by Alexander the Great, king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth, during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire. An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria. Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years, until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at Fustat (later absorbed into Cairo). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library (the largest in the ancient world); and the Necropolis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity. It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome.\nThe city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria, which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire. In the modern world, the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.\nFollowing the Arab conquest of Egypt in AD 641, the city was plundered and lost its significance before re-emerging in the modern era. From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major center of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centers in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nRecent radiocarbon dating of seashell fragments and lead contamination show human activity at the location during the period of the Old Kingdom (27th-21st centuries BC) and again in the period 1000-800 BC, followed by the absence of activity thereafter. From ancient sources it is known there existed a trading post at this location during the time of Rameses the Great for trade with Crete, but it had long been lost by the time of Alexander's arrival. A small Egyptian fishing village named Rhakotis (Egyptian:*Ra\u02c1-\u1e32\u0101\u1e6dit, written r\u02c1-\u1e33\u1e6dy.t, 'That which is built up') existed since the 13th century BC in the vicinity and eventually grew into the Egyptian quarter of the city. Just east of Alexandria (where Abu Qir Bay is now), there was in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of Canopus and Heracleion. The latter was recently rediscovered under water.\nAlexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in April 331 BC as \u1f08\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 (Alexandreia). Passing through Egypt, Alexander wanted to build a large Greek city on Egypt's coast that would bear his name. He chose the site of Alexandria, envisioning the building of a causeway to the nearby island of Pharos that would generate two great natural harbors. Alexandria was intended to supersede the older Greek colony of Naucratis as a Hellenistic center in Egypt, and to be the link between Greece and the rich Nile valley.  A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to the city during his life.\nAfter Alexander's departure, his viceroy Cleomenes continued the expansion. The architect Dinocrates of Rhodes designed the city, using a Hippodamian grid plan. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, his general Ptolemy Lagides took possession of Egypt and brought Alexander's body to Egypt with him. Ptolemy at first ruled from the old Egyptian capital of Memphis. In 322/321 BC he had Cleomenes executed. Finally, in 305 BC, Ptolemy declared himself Pharaoh as Ptolemy I Soter (\"Savior\") and moved his capital to Alexandria.\nAlthough Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's early development, the Heptastadion and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined Tyre and becoming the center of the new commerce between Europe and the Arabian and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than Carthage. In a century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with Greek people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nAlexandria was not only a center of Hellenism, but was also home to the largest urban Jewish community in the world. The Septuagint, a Greek version of the Tanakh, was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic center of learning (Library of Alexandria), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Jewish, and Egyptian. By the time of Augustus, the city walls encompassed an area of 5.34 km2, and the total population in Roman times was around 500\u2013600,000.According to Philo of Alexandria, in the year 38 of the Common era, disturbances erupted between Jews and Greek citizens of Alexandria during a visit paid by the Jewish king Agrippa I to Alexandria, principally over the respect paid by the Jewish nation to the Roman emperor, and which quickly escalated to open affronts and violence between the two ethnic groups and the desecration of Alexandrian synagogues. The violence was quelled after Caligula intervened and had the Roman governor, Flaccus, removed from the city.In AD 115, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the Kitos War, which gave Hadrian and his architect, Decriannus, an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215, the emperor Caracalla visited the city and, because of some insulting satires that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365, Alexandria was devastated by a tsunami (365 Crete earthquake), an event annually commemorated years later as a \"day of horror\".\n\n\n=== Islamic era ===\n\nIn 619, Alexandria fell to the Sassanid Persians. Although the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general 'Amr ibn al-'As invaded it during the Muslim conquest of Egypt, after a siege that lasted 14 months. The first Arab governor of Egypt recorded to have visited Alexandria was Utba ibn Abi Sufyan, who strengthened the Arab presence and built a governor's palace in the city in 664\u2013665.After the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517, the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under Ottoman rule until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of Rosetta during the 9th to 18th centuries, and only regained its former prominence with the construction of the Mahmoudiyah Canal in 1807.\nAlexandria figured prominently in the military operations of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernize the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.In July 1882, the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied.In July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the Lavon Affair. On 26 October 1954, Alexandria's Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on Gamal Abdel Nasser.Europeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 Suez Crisis that led to an outburst of Arab nationalism. The nationalization of property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly all the rest.\n\n\n=== Ibn Battuta in Alexandria ===\n\nIn reference to Alexandria, Egypt, Ibn Battuta speaks of great saints that resided here. One of them being Imam Borhan Oddin El Aaraj. He was said to have the power of working miracles. He told Ibn Battuta that he should go find his three brothers, Farid Oddin, who lived in India, Rokn Oddin Ibn Zakarya, who lived in Sindia, and Borhan Oddin, who lived in China. Battuta then made it his purpose to find these people and give them his compliments. Sheikh Yakut was another great man. He was the disciple of Sheikh Abu Abbas El Mursi, who was the disciple of Abu El Hasan El Shadali, who is known to be a servant of God. Abu Abbas was the author of the Hizb El Bahr and was famous for piety and miracles. Abu Abd Allah El Murshidi was a great interpreting saint that lived secluded in the Minyat of Ibn Murshed. He lived alone but was visited daily by emirs, viziers, and crowds that wished to eat with him. The Sultan of Egypt (El Malik El Nasir) visited him, as well. Ibn Battuta left Alexandria with the intent of visiting him.Ibn Battuta also visited the Pharos lighthouse on 2 occasions; in 1326 he found it to be partly in ruins and in 1349 it had deteriorated further, making entrance to the edifice impossible.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\nThe most important battles and sieges of Alexandria include:\n\nSiege of Alexandria (47 BC), Julius Caesar's civil war\nBattle of Alexandria (30 BC), final war of the Roman Republic\nSiege of Alexandria (619), Byzantine-Persian Wars\nSiege of Alexandria (641), Rashidun conquest of Byzantine Egypt\nAlexandrian Crusade (1365), a crusade led by Peter de Lusignan of Cyprus which resulted in the defeat of the Mamluks and the sack of the city.\nBattle of Alexandria (1801), Napoleonic Wars\nSiege of Alexandria (1801), Napoleonic Wars\nAlexandria expedition (1807), Napoleonic Wars\n\n\n== Ancient layout ==\nGreek Alexandria was divided into three regions:\nBrucheum\nBrucheum is the Royal or Greek quarter and forms the most magnificent portion of the city. In Roman times Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal;\nThe Jewish quarter\nThis quarter is the northeast portion of the city;\nRhakotis\nRhakotis is the old city that was absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians. (from Coptic Rakot\u0259 \"Alexandria\").Two main streets, lined with colonnades and said to have been each about 60 meters (200 ft) wide, intersected in the center of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his Mausoleum) rose. This point is very near the present mosque of Nebi Daniel; and the line of the great East\u2013West \"Canopic\" street, only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharia Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.\nAlexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a 1,260-metre-long (4,130 ft) mole and called the Heptastadion (\"seven stadia\"\u2014a stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180 metres or 590 feet). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the \"Moon Gate\" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern \"Ras al-Tin\" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.\nIn Strabo's time, (latter half of the 1st century BC) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbor.\n\nThe Royal Palaces, filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbor on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the \"Private Port,\" and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land subsidence here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.\nThe Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Julius Caesar as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the battle of Pharsalus\nThe Poseidon, or Temple of the Sea God, close to the theater\nThe Timonium built by Marc Antony\nThe Emporium (Exchange)\nThe Apostases (Magazines)\nThe Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole\nBehind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great obelisks, which become known as \"Cleopatra's Needles,\" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.\nThe Gymnasium and the Palaestra are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.\nThe Temple of Saturn; alexandria west.\nThe Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.\nThe Musaeum with its famous Library and theater in the same region; site unknown.\nThe Serapeum of Alexandria, the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells us that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near \"Pompey's Pillar,\" which was an independent monument erected to commemorate Diocletian's siege of the city.The names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, The Great Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, reputed to be 138 metres (453 feet) high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy (Ptolemy II Philadelphus) completed it, at a total cost of 800 talents. It took 12 years to complete and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the Great Pyramid of Giza. A temple of Hephaestus also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.\nIn the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens, according to a census dated from 32 CE, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 216,000 to 500,000 making it one of the largest cities ever built before the Industrial Revolution and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAlexandria is located in the country of Egypt, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlexandria has a borderline hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BWh), approaching a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). As the rest of Egypt's northern coast, the prevailing north wind, blowing across the Mediterranean, gives the city a less severe climate from the desert hinterland. Rafah and Alexandria are the wettest places in Egypt; the other wettest places are Rosetta, Baltim, Kafr el-Dawwar, and Mersa Matruh. The city's climate is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, moderating its temperatures, causing variable rainy winters and moderately hot and slightly prolonged summers that, at times, can be very humid; January and February are the coolest months, with daily maximum temperatures typically ranging from 12 to 18 \u00b0C (54 to 64 \u00b0F) and minimum temperatures that could reach 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F). temperature sometimes gets lower than 5 and it sometimes rains snow.\nAlexandria experiences violent storms, rain and sometimes sleet and hail during the cooler months; these events, combined with a poor drainage system, have been responsible for occasional flooding in the city in the past though they rarely occur anymore. July and August are the hottest and driest months of the year, with an average daily maximum temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual rainfall is around 200 mm (7.9 in) but has been as high as 417 mm (16.4 in)Port Said, Kosseir, Baltim, Damietta and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in Egypt.\nThe highest recorded temperature was 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) on 30 May 1961, and the coldest recorded temperature was 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1994.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDue to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour and the rest has been built over in modern times.\n\n\"Pompey's Pillar\", a Roman triumphal column, is one of the best-known ancient monuments still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient acropolis\u2014a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab cemetery\u2014and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its pedestal, it is 30 m (99 ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in diameter at the base, tapering to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) at the top. The shaft is 88 feet (27 m) high, and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is 132 cubic meters (4,662 cubic feet) and weight approximately 396 tons. Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient obelisks. The Romans had cranes but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several obelisk erecting experiments including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk. The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. \"Pompey's Pillar\" is a misnomer, as it has nothing to do with Pompey, having been erected in 293 for Diocletian, possibly in memory of the rebellion of Domitius Domitianus. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god Serapis were enacted, and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.\nAlexandria's catacombs, known as Kom El Shoqafa, are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large spiral staircase, and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other syncretic Romano-Egyptian religious symbols, burial niches, and sarcophagi, as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in 1900.The most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as Kom El Deka. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its Roman-era baths.\nPersistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local Archaeological Society, and by many individuals, notably Greeks proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.\nThe past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; D. G. Hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898\u20131899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.\n\nSince the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. Cleopatra VII's royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual subsidence in the 4th century AD. This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team. It raised a noted head of Caesarion. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy. The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman strata.\nThe most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.\nThe objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in Kom El Shoqafa (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).\nThe German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of Kom El Deka, which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.\nThe making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtlessly immense; but despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\".\n\n\n=== Temple of Taposiris Magna ===\nThe temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine Pharos Lighthouse.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, there are Muslim mosques. Coptic Christian churches are most common churches .There are also other Christian churches as:  Greek , Latin and Armenian . Orthodox Christian churches are most common but Catholic , Anglican and Evangelical churches are present. Also there is a Jewish synagogue\n\n\n=== Islam ===\n\nThe most famous mosque in Alexandria is Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque in Bahary. Other notable mosques in the city include Ali ibn Abi Talib mosque in Somouha, Bilal mosque, al-Gamaa al-Bahari in Mandara, Hatem mosque in Somouha, Hoda el-Islam mosque in Sidi Bishr, al-Mowasah mosque in Hadara, Sharq al-Madina mosque in Miami, al-Shohadaa mosque in Mostafa Kamel, Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque, Yehia mosque in Zizinia, Sidi Gaber mosque in Sidi Gaber, Sidi B esher mosque, Rokay el-Islam mosque in Elessway, Elsadaka Mosque in Sidibesher Qebly, Elshatbi mosque and Sultan mosque.\nAlexandria is the base of the Salafi movements in Egypt. Al-Nour Party, which is based in the city and overwhelmingly won most of the Salafi votes in the 2011\u201312 parliamentary election, supports the president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nAfter Rome and Constantinople, Alexandria was considered the third-most important seat of Christianity in the world. The Pope of Alexandria was second only to the bishop of Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire until 430. The Church of Alexandria had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, the Church of Alexandria was split between the Miaphysites and the Melkites. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. In the 19th century, Catholic and Protestant missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.\nToday, the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is Saint Mark Cathedral . The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include Pope Cyril I Church in Cleopatra, Saint Georges Church in Sporting, Saint Mark & Pope Peter I Church in Sidi Bishr, Saint Mary Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, Saint Mina Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and Saint Takla Haymanot's Church in Ibrahimeya.\nThe most important Eastern Orthodox churches in Alexandria are Agioi An\u00e1rgyroi Church, Church of the Annunciation, Saint Anthony Church, Archangels Gabriel & Michael Church, Taxiarchon Church, Saint Catherine Church, Cathedral of the Dormition in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, Prophet Elijah Church, Saint George Church, Saint Joseph Church in Fleming, Saint Joseph of Arimathea Church, Saint Mark & Saint Nektarios Chapel in Ramleh, Saint Nicholas Church, Saint Paraskevi Church, Saint Sava Cathedral in Ramleh, Saint Theodore Chapel and the Russian church of Saint Alexander Nevsky in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.\nThe Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said has jurisdiction over all Latin Church Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the Jesuits in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan, which uses the Byzantine Rite, and the nominal see of the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia, using the Armenian Rite.\nThe Saint Mark Church in Shatby, founded as part of Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, Coptic Catholic and Coptic Orthodox rites.\nIn antiquity, Alexandria was a major center of the cosmopolitan religious movement called Gnosticism (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\n\nAlexandria's once-flourishing Jewish community declined rapidly following the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, after which negative reactions towards Zionism among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt fled to the newly established Israel, France, Brazil and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50. The most important synagogue in Alexandria is the Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nAlexandria has a number of higher education institutions. Alexandria University is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its Faculty of Medicine & Faculty of Engineering. In addition, the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology in New Borg El Arab city is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010.  The Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC American University in Cairo because of its worldwide recognition from board of engineers at UK & ABET in US. Universit\u00e9 Senghor is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly recruits students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT) and Pharos University in Alexandria.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\nAlexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by Catholic missionaries include Coll\u00e8ge de la M\u00e8re de Dieu, Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Sion, Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Ecoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), \u00c9cole Girard, \u00c9cole Saint Gabriel, \u00c9cole Saint-Vincent de Paul, \u00c9cole Saint Joseph, \u00c9cole Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lyc\u00e9e el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently a public school run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais d'Alexandrie (\u00c9cole Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the Istituto \"Don Bosco\".\nEnglish schools in Alexandria are becoming the most popular. English-language schools in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, British School of Alexandria, Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Egyptian English Language School,  Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, Schutz American School, Victoria College, El Manar Language School for Girls (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and El Nasr Girls' College.\nThere are only two German schools in Alexandria which are Deutsche Schule der Borrom\u00e4rinnen (DSB of Saint Charles Borrom\u00e9) and Neue Deutsche Schule Alexandria, which is run by Frau Sally Hammam.\nThe Montessori educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at Alexandria Montessori.\nThe most notable public schools in Alexandria include El Abbassia High School and Gamal Abdel Nasser High School.\n\n\n=== Women ===\nCirca the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to the same percentage in Cairo. As a result, specialist women's publications like al-Fat\u0101h by Hind Nawal, the country's first women's' journal, appeared.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city's principal airport is currently Borg El Arab Airport, which is located about 25 km (16 mi) away from the city center.\nFrom late 2011, El Nouzha Airport (Alexandria International Airport) was to be closed to commercial operations for two years as it underwent expansion, with all airlines operating out of Borg El Arab Airport from then onwards, where a brand new terminal was completed there in February 2010. In 2017, the government announced that Alexandria International Airport will shut down permanently for operational reasons.\n\n\n=== Port ===\n\nAlexandria has four ports; namely the Western Port also known as(Alexandria Port), which is the main port of the country that handles about 60% of the country's exports and imports, Dekhela Port west of the Western Port, the Eastern Port which is a yachting harbor, and Abu Qir Port at the northern east of the governorate. It is a commercial port for general cargo and phosphates.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nInternational Coastal Road (Mersa Matruh \u2013 Alexandria \u2013 Port Said)\nCairo\u2013Alexandria Desert Road (Alexandria \u2013 Cairo \u2013 220 km (137 mi), 6\u20138 lanes)\nCairo-Alexandria Agriculture Road (Alexandria \u2013 Cairo)\nMehwar El Ta'meer \u2013 (Alexandria \u2013 Borg El Arab)\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAlexandria's intracity commuter rail system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity railway station) to Abu Qir, parallel to the tram line. The commuter line's locomotives operate on diesel, as opposed to the overhead-electric tram.\nAlexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned Misr Station (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and Sidi Gaber railway station (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the center of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by Egyptian National Railways.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nAn extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the El Raml district in the west and ends in the Victoria district in the east. Most of the vehicles are blue in color. Some smaller yellow-colored vehicles have further routes beyond the two main endpoints. The tram routes have one of four numbers: 1, 2, 5, and 6. All four start at El Raml, but only two (1 and 2) reach Victoria. There are two converging and diverging points. The first starts at Bolkly (Isis) and ends at San Stefano. The other begins at Sporting and ends at Mostafa Kamel. Route 5 starts at San Stefano and takes the inner route to Bolkly. Route 6 starts at Sidi Gaber El Sheikh in the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 1 takes the inner route between San Stefano and Bolkly and the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 2 takes the route opposite to Route 1 in both these areas. The tram fares are 50 piastres (0.50 pounds), and 100 piastres (1.00 pounds) for the middle car. Some trams (that date back the 30s) charge a pound. The tram is considered the cheapest method of public transport. A caf\u00e9 operates in the second floor of the first car of tram 1 (a women-only car) which costs 5 L.E per person, also offering a WiFi service. A luxury light blue tram car operates from San Stefano to Ras El Tin, with free WiFi and movies and songs played inside for 5 L.E per ticket.\nStations:\n\nRoute 2 serves:\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nConstruction of the Alexandria Metro is due to begin in 2020 at a cost of $1.05 billion.\n\n\n=== Taxis and minibuses ===\n\nTaxis in Alexandria sport a yellow-and-black livery and are widely available. While Egyptian law requires all cabs to carry meters, these generally do not work and fares must be negotiated with the driver on either departure or arrival.\n\nThe minibus share taxi system, or mashr\u016b' operates along well-known traffic arteries. The routes can be identified by both their endpoints and the route between them:\n\nCorniche routes:\nEl Mandara \u2013 Bahari\nEl Mandara \u2013 El Mansheya\nAsafra \u2013 Bahari\nAsafra \u2013 El Mansheya\nEl Sa'aa \u2013 El Mansheya\nAbu Qir routes:\nEl Mandara \u2013 El Mahata (lit. \"the Station\", i.e. Misr Railway Station)\nAbu Qir \u2013 El Mahata\nVictoria \u2013 El Mahata\nEl Mandara \u2013 Victoria\nInterior routes:\nCabo \u2013 Bahari\nEl Mansheya \u2013 El Awayid\nEl Mansheya \u2013 El Maw'af El Gedid (the New Bus Station)\nHadara \u2013 El MahataThe route is generally written in Arabic on the side of the vehicle, although some drivers change their route without changing the paint. Some drivers also drive only a segment of a route rather than the whole path; such drivers generally stop at a point known as a major hub of the transportation system (for example, Victoria) to allow riders to transfer to another car or to another mode of transport.\nFare is generally L.E. 3.00 to travel the whole route. Shorter trips may have a lower fare, depending on the driver and the length of the trip.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe Royal Library of Alexandria, in Alexandria, Egypt, was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of Ptolemy II of Egypt. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the Muses\u2014the Museion, Greek \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03bd (from which the Modern English word museum is derived).\nIt has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.The Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002, near the site of the old Library.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Alexandria National Museum was inaugurated 31 December 2003. It is located in a restored Italian style palace in Tariq El Horreya Street (formerly Rue Fouad), near the center of the city. It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and Egypt. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria. Construction on the site was first undertaken in 1926.\nCavafy Museum\nThe Graeco-Roman Museum\nThe Museum of Fine Arts\nThe Royal Jewelry Museum\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nAlexandria Opera House, where classical music, Arabic music, ballet, and opera are performed and bearm basha theatre in elshatby.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThroughout Alexandria, there is art that resembles some of the oldest architectural styles of the Hellenic city, and its ancient decorations, especially in the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, is based on reviving the ancient Library of Alexandria. The Kom el shoqafa Catacombs are considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages and date back to the 2nd century. The remnants of Pompey's Pillar still remain today. This single pillar represents the elaborate temple which once stood in Alexandria. It remains at the site of the Serapeum, Alexandria's acropolis. The Serapeum, which stood for ancient tradition, conflicted with the rise of Christianity. It is a large tourist destination, today. the Roman Amphitheatre of Alexandria is another popular destination. Here, there remains a stage with around seven hundred to eight hundred seats. They also have numerous galleries of statues and details leftover form this time. Alexandria's tourism office announced plans to reserve some beaches for tourists in July 2018.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe main sport that interests Alexandrians is football, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. Alexandria Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Alexandria, Egypt. It is currently used mostly for football matches, and was used for the 2006 African Cup of Nations. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the African Cup of Nations in January 2006, which Egypt won. Sea sports such as surfing, jet-skiing and water polo are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the Alexandria Sporting Club, which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the country's national team with key players. The city hosted the AfroBasket, the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).\nAlexandria has four stadiums:\n\nOther less popular sports like tennis and squash are usually played in private social and sports clubs, like:\n\nStarted in 2011, Cross Egypt Challenge is an international cross-country motorcycle and scooter rally conducted throughout the most difficult tracks and roads of Egypt. Alexandria is known as the yearly starting point of Cross Egypt Challenge and a huge celebration is conducted the night before the rally starts after all the international participants arrive to the city.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nAlexandria is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nA.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Heracleion (Ancient Greek: \u1f29\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), also known by its Egyptian name Thonis (Ancient Egyptian: T\u021d-\u1e25n.t, Coptic: \u2ca7\u03e9\u2cb1\u2c9b\u2c93, Ancient Greek: \u0398\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2) and sometimes called Thonis-Heracleion, was an ancient Egyptian city located near the Canopic Mouth of the Nile, about 32 km (20 miles) northeast of Alexandria. Its remains are located in Abu Qir Bay, currently 2.5 km off the coast, under 10 m (30 ft) of water. A stele found on the site indicates that it was one single city known by both its Egyptian and Greek names. Its legendary beginnings go back to as early as the 12th century BC, and it is mentioned by ancient Greek historians. Its importance grew particularly during the waning days of the Pharaohs.\n\n\n== Legendary beginnings ==\nHeracleion is mentioned by many chroniclers in antiquity, including Herodotus, Strabo and Diodorus. The city was said by Herodotus to have been visited by Paris and Helen of Troy before the Trojan war began. They sought refuge there on their flight from the jealous Menelaus, but were rebuffed by Thonis, the watchman at the entrance to the Nile. Alternatively it was believed that Menelaus and Helen had stayed there, accommodated by the noble Egyptian Thon and his wife Polydamna. The 2nd century BC Greek poet Nicander wrote that Menelaus\u2019s helmsman, Canopus, was bitten by a viper on the sands of Thonis. According to Herodotus, a great temple was built at the spot where Heracles first arrived in Egypt. The story of Heracles' visit resulted in the Greeks calling the city by the Greek name Heracleion rather than its original Egyptian name Thonis.\n\n\n== History ==\nHeracleion was originally built on some adjoining islands in the Nile Delta. It was intersected by canals with a number of harbors and anchorages. Its wharves, temples and tower-houses were linked by ferries, bridges, and pontoons. The city was an emporion (trading port) and in the Late Period of ancient Egypt it was the country's main port for international trade and collection of taxes. It had a sister city, Naucratis, which was another trading port lying 72 km (45 mi) further up the Nile. Goods were transferred inland via Naucratis, or they were transported via the Western Lake and through a water channel to the nearby town of Canopus for onward distribution.Heracleion had a large temple of Khonsou, son of Amun, who was known to the Greeks as Herakles. Later, the worship of Amun became more prominent. During the time when the city especially flourished between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, a large temple of Amun-Gereb, the supreme god of the Egyptians at the time, was located in the middle of the city. Pharaoh Nectanebo I made many additions to the temple in the 4th century B.C. Sanctuaries in Heracleion dedicated to Osiris and other gods were famous for miraculous healing and attracted pilgrims from a wide area. The city was the site of the celebration of the \"Mysteries of Osiris\" each year during the month of Khoiak. The god in his ceremonial boat was brought in procession from the temple of Amun in that city to his shrine in Canopus.During the 2nd century BC Alexandria superseded Heracleion as Egypt\u2019s primary port. Over time the city was weakened by a combination of earthquakes, tsunamis and  rising sea levels. At the end of the 2nd century BC, probably after a severe flood, the ground on which central island of Heracleion was built succumbed to soil liquefaction. The hard clay turned rapidly into a liquid and the buildings collapsed into the water. A few residents stayed on during the Roman era and the beginning of Arab rule, but by the end of the eighth century AD what was left of the city had sunk beneath the sea.\n\n\n== Ancient references ==\n\nUntil very recently the site had been known only from a few literary and epigraphic sources, one of which interestingly mentions the site as an emporion, just like Naukratis.\nThe city was mentioned by the ancient historians Diodorus (1.19.4) and Strabo (17.1.16). Herodotus was told that Thonis was the warden of the Canopic mouth of the Nile: Thonis arrested Alexander (Paris), the son of Priam, because Alexander had abducted Helen of Troy and taken much wealth.Heracleion is also mentioned in the twin steles of the Decree of Nectanebo I (the first of which is known as the 'Stele of Naukratis'), which specify that one tenth of the taxes on imports passing through the town of Thonis/Herakleion were to be given to the sanctuary of Neith of Sais. The city is also mentioned in the Decree of Canopus honoring Pharaoh Ptolemy III, which describes donations, sacrifices and a procession on water.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\n\nIn 1933, an RAF commander flying over Abu Qir Bay saw ruins under the water. At that time, most historians believed that Thonis and Heracleion were two separate cities, both located on what is now the Egyptian mainland. The ruins submerged in the sea were located and explored by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio in 1999, after a five-year search. Numerous finds from the site have indicated that the city's period of major activity ran from the 6th to the 4th century BC, with finds of pottery and coins appearing to stop at the end of the 2nd century BC. Goddio's finds have also included incomplete statues of the god Serapis and the queen Arsinoe II. No more than 5% of the city's area was explored by the archaeologist.Around 2010 a baris, a type of ancient Nile river boat, was excavated from the waters around Heracleion. Its design was found to be consistent with a description written by Herodotus in 450 BC. In July 2019, a small Greek temple, ancient granite columns, treasure-carrying ships, and bronze coins from the reign of Ptolemy II, dating back to the third and fourth centuries BC, were found at Heracleion. The investigations were conducted by Egyptian and European divers led by Goddio. They also uncovered a devastated historic temple (the city\u2019s main temple) underwater off Egypt's north coast.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMenouthis\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFranck Goddio official website\n\"Spectacular finds of lost city revealed\".

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is a Coptic church in Alexandria, Egypt. It is the historical seat of the Pope of Alexandria, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church.\nOn Palm Sunday, 9 April 2017, an Islamic State operative detonated his suicide belt in the cathedral, killing 17 people and wounding 48.\n\n\n== Beginning ==\nThe cathedral is said to stand on the site of the church founded by St. Mark the Evangelist in AD 42.St. Mark the Evangelist (author of the second Gospel) has been connected with the city of Alexandria since earliest Christian tradition. Coptic Christians believe he arrived in Alexandria around AD 42 and stayed for about seven years.During this time, Mark converted many to Christianity and performed many miracles. He is considered the founder of the church in Alexandria and the first Bishop of Alexandria. According to tradition, St. Mark was arrested during a festival of Serapis in AD 68 and martyred by being dragged through the streets. He was buried under the church he had founded.\n\n\n== Relics of Saint Mark ==\nIn 828, relics believed to be the body of St. Mark were stolen from Alexandria by Venetian merchants and taken to Venice. Copts believe that the head of St. Mark remains in a church named after him in Alexandria, and parts of his relics are in St. Mark's Cairo's Cathedral. The rest of what are believed to be his relics are in the St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Italy. Every year, on the 30th day of the month of Paopi, the Coptic Orthodox Church celebrates the commemoration of the consecration of the church of St. Mark, and the appearance of the head of the saint in the city of Alexandria. This takes place inside St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria, where the saint's head is preserved.\nThe head of St. Mark was moved around a great deal over the centuries, and has been lost for over 250 years. Some of the relics from the body of St. Mark, however, were returned to Alexandria from Rome in 1968 during the papacy of Coptic Pope Cyril VI.\nThe present St. Mark's Coptic Cathedral is of recent date, but is said to stand on the site of church founded by St. Mark himself.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn AD 311, before the martyrdom of Pope Peter the Last of Martyrs, he prayed a last prayer on the grave of Saint Mark, the church was then a little chapel on the eastern coast, and it contained bodies said to be of Saint Mark and some of his holy successors.  The church was later enlarged in the days of Pope Achillas, the 18th Pope.\nThe church was greatly ruined in 641 when the Arabs invaded Egypt.  In 680 Pope John III rebuilt the church.  In 828, the body of Saint Mark was stolen by Italian sailors and was taken from Alexandria to Venice in Italy. However, Saint Mark's head remained in Alexandria.\nThe church was destroyed again in 1219, during the time of the crusades, then it was rebuilt once more. Sixteenth-century French explorer Pierre Belon mentions the founding of the church in 1547.The church was pulled down during the French invasion of Alexandria in July 1798.  The church was rebuilt and opened in 1819 by Pope Peter El Gawly in the time of Mohammed Ali Pasha. The church was renewed in the time of Pope Demetrius II and by the supervision of Bishop Marcos of El Behira in 1870. Between the years 1950\u20131952, in the time of Pope Yusab II, the church building was pulled down and another, larger  building was built with reinforced concrete after the basilique style. The six marble pillars were transferred into the outer entrance of the church. The icon carrier was accurately cut into parts, each part given a number, and then it was cautiously returned to where it was originally. The two bell tower  were not pulled down as they were reinforced with concrete and were decorated with beautiful Coptic engravings. Two new bells \u2013 brought from Italy \u2013 were provided, one for each bell tower.\nBetween 1985 and 1990, the church was widened from the western side after the former style with great accuracy, keeping the two bell tower in their places, so the entire area of the church was doubled. The six pillars were transferred to the new western entrance of the church supervised by Pope Shenouda III.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCoptic Orthodox Church\nCoptic architecture\nList of Coptic Orthodox Churches in the United States\nSeat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria\nCoptic Cairo\nSeat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria\nSaint Barbara Church in Coptic Cairo\nSaint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Cairo\nSaint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Azbakeya)\nSaint Mark Coptic Orthodox Church (Heliopolis)\nSaint Mary and Saint Abasikhiron Coptic Orthodox Church\nSaint Mary Church (Haret Elroum)\nSt Mary and St Mercurius Coptic Orthodox Church\nSaint Mercurius Church in Coptic Cairo\nSaints Sergius and Bacchus Church (Abu Serga)\nThe Hanging Church\nChurch of the Holy Virgin (Babylon El-Darag)\nChurch of the Virgin Mary (Haret Zuweila)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSaint Mark's Coptic orthodox Cathedral (Alexandria)",

        "wiki": "The Monastery of Saint Mina is a monastery of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria located in the Western Desert near Alexandria. It is dedicated to Saint Menas. The modern monastery is built close to the ruins of Abu Mena, the original pilgrimage site, which was destroyed by the Arabs during the Muslim conquest of Egypt of the mid-7th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing the execution of Saint Mina, his sister brought his body to a church in Alexandria. When the time of persecution ended, during the papacy of Pope Athanasius of Alexandria, an angel appeared to the Pope and ordered him to load the saint's body on a camel and head towards the Western Desert. At a certain spot near a water well at the end of Lake Mariout, not far from Alexandria, the camel stopped and wouldn't move. The Christians took this a sign from God and there buried Saint Mina's body after placing it in a silver coffin. The coffin was later placed inside decay-resistant wood and buried at the same location.\nMost versions of the story state that the location of the tomb was then forgotten until its miraculous rediscovery by a local shepherd. A shepherd was feeding his sheep in that location, and a sick lamb fell on the ground. As it struggled to get on its feet again, its scab was cured. The story spread quickly and the sick who came to this spot recovered from whatever illnesses they had just by lying on the ground. The Ethiopian Synaxarium describes Constantine I sending his sick daughter to the shepherd to be cured, and credits her with finding Mina's body, after which Constantine ordered the construction of a church at the site. Some versions of the story replace Constantine with the late-5th century emperor Zeno, but archaeologists have dated the original foundation to the late 4th century. According to the Zeno version, his daughter was leprous and his advisors suggested that she should try that place, and she did. At night Saint Mina appeared to the girl and informed her that his body was buried in that place. The following morning, Zeno's daughter was cured and she related her vision about the saint to her servants. Zeno immediately ordered Mina's body to be dug out and a cathedral to be built there.\nA large city was also built there and named after the saint. Sick people from all over the world used to visit that city and were healed through the intercessions of Saint Mina, who became known as the Wonders' Maker. Today, numerous little clay bottles on which the saint's name and picture are engraved are found by archeologists in diverse countries around the Mediterranean world, such as Heidelberg in Germany, Milan in Italy, Dalmatia in Croatia, Marseille in France, Dongola in Sudan, and the holy city of Jerusalem. Visitors would buy these bottles, usually containing oil or water for blessing, and take them back to their relatives.\n\n\n== Destruction of the city of Saint Mina ==\nThe city of Saint Mina was destroyed during the Arab invasion of Egypt in the seventh century. The cathedral was also damaged. The remains of the city was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Recent agricultural efforts in the area have led to a significant rise in the water table, which has caused a number of the site's buildings to collapse or become unstable. The site was added to the list of threatened World Heritage Sites in 2001.\n\n\n== The New Monastery and Cathedral of Saint Mina ==\nAs soon as Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria became Pope and Patriarch on Saint Mark's Throne in 1959, he began to put the foundations for a great monastery close to the remains of the old city. Pope Cyril VI had a peculiar relationship to Saint Mina and venerated him as his personal patron saint. The first abbot of the modern monastery was the late Mina Ava-Mina, a well-respected figure within the Coptic community. Today, the Monastery of Saint Mina is one of the most famous monasteries in Egypt. The relics of Saint Mina, as well as that of Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria lie in this monastery.\n\n\n== Abbot ==\nAs of 2003 Kyrillos (Cyril) was the bishop and abbot of the Monastery of Saint Mina.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChurch of Saint Menas (Cairo)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt. Mina Monastery in Mariut on the Web\nSaint of the Day, November 11: Mennas of Egypt at SaintPatrickDC.org\nSt. Mina Monastery in Mariut on the Web (Arabic site)\nStmina-monastery.org\nStmina-monastery.org",

        "wiki": "The Great Library of Alexandria in Alexandria, Egypt, was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world. The Library was part of a larger research institution called the Mouseion, which was dedicated to the Muses, the nine goddesses of the arts. The idea of a universal library in Alexandria may have been proposed by Demetrius of Phalerum, an exiled Athenian statesman living in Alexandria, to Ptolemy I Soter, who may have established plans for the Library, but the Library itself was probably not built until the reign of his son Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The Library quickly acquired many papyrus scrolls, due largely to the Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.\nAlexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library. Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among many others: Zenodotus of Ephesus, who worked towards standardizing the texts of the Homeric poems; Callimachus, who wrote the Pinakes, sometimes considered to be the world's first library catalogue; Apollonius of Rhodes, who composed the epic poem the Argonautica; Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who calculated the circumference of the earth within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; Aristophanes of Byzantium, who invented the system of Greek diacritics and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and Aristarchus of Samothrace, who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. During the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes, a daughter library was established in the Serapeum, a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god Serapis.\nDespite the widespread modern belief that the Library of Alexandria was burned once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries. This decline began with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of Ptolemy VIII Physcon, which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to Cyprus. Many other scholars, including Dionysius Thrax and Apollodorus of Athens, fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, was accidentally burned by Julius Caesar during his civil war in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer Strabo mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of Didymus Chalcenterus in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources.\nThe Library dwindled during the Roman Period, due to lack of funding and support. Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. Between 270 and 275 AD, the city of Alexandria saw a rebellion and an imperial counterattack that probably destroyed whatever remained of the Library, if it still existed at that time. The daughter library of the Serapeum may have survived after the main Library's destruction. The Serapeum was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD under a decree issued by Coptic Christian Pope Theophilus of Alexandria, but it does not seem to have housed books at the time and was mainly used as a gathering place for Neoplatonist philosophers following the teachings of Iamblichus.\n\n\n== Historical background ==\n\nThe Library of Alexandria was not the first library of its kind. A long tradition of libraries existed in both Greece and in the ancient Near East. The earliest recorded archive of written materials comes from the ancient Sumerian city-state of Uruk in around 3400 BC, when writing had only just begun to develop. Scholarly curation of literary texts began in around 2500 BC. The later kingdoms and empires of the ancient Near East had long traditions of book collecting. The ancient Hittites and Assyrians had massive archives containing records written in many different languages. The most famous library of the ancient Near East was the Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh, founded in the seventh century BC by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (ruled 668\u2013c. 627 BC). A large library also existed in Babylon during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II (c. 605\u2013c. 562 BC). In Greece, the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos was said to have founded the first major public library in the sixth century BC. It was out of this mixed heritage of both Greek and Near Eastern book collections that the idea for the Library of Alexandria was born.The Macedonian kings who succeeded Alexander the Great as rulers of the Near East wanted to promote Hellenistic culture and learning throughout the known world. Historian Roy MacLeod calls this \"a programme of cultural imperialism\". These rulers, therefore, had a vested interest to collect and compile information from both the Greeks and from the far more ancient kingdoms of the Near East. Libraries enhanced a city's prestige, attracted scholars, and provided practical assistance in matters of ruling and governing the kingdom. Eventually, for these reasons, every major Hellenistic urban center would have a royal library. The Library of Alexandria, however, was unprecedented due to the scope and scale of the Ptolemies' ambitions; unlike their predecessors and contemporaries, the Ptolemies wanted to produce a repository of all knowledge.\n\n\n== Under Ptolemaic patronage ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\n\nThe Library was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world, but details about it are a mixture of history and legend. The earliest known surviving source of information on the founding of the Library of Alexandria is the pseudepigraphic Letter of Aristeas, which was composed between c. 180 and c. 145 BC. The Letter of Aristeas claims that the Library was founded during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter (c. 323\u2013c. 283 BC) and that it was initially organized by Demetrius of Phalerum, a student of Aristotle who had been exiled from Athens and taken refuge in Alexandria within the Ptolemaic court. Nonetheless, the Letter of Aristeas is very late and it contains information that is now known to be inaccurate. Other sources claim that the Library was instead created under the reign of Ptolemy I's son Ptolemy II Philadelphus (283\u2013246 BC).Modern scholars agree that, while it is possible that Ptolemy I may have laid the groundwork for the Library, it probably did not come into being as a physical institution until the reign of Ptolemy II. By that time, Demetrius of Phalerum had fallen out of favor with the Ptolemaic court and could not, therefore, have had any role in establishing the Library as an institution. Stephen V. Tracy, however, argues that it is highly probable that Demetrius played an important role in collecting at least some of the earliest texts that would later become part of the Library's collection. In around 295 BC or thereabouts, Demetrius may have acquired early texts of the writings of Aristotle and Theophrastus, which he would have been uniquely positioned to do, since he was a distinguished member of the Peripatetic school.The Library was built in the Brucheion (Royal Quarter) as part of the Mouseion. Its main purpose was to show off the wealth of Egypt, with research as a lesser goal, but its contents were used to aid the ruler of Egypt. The exact layout of the library is not known, but ancient sources describe the Library of Alexandria as comprising a collection of scrolls, Greek columns, a peripatos walk, a room for shared dining, a reading room, meeting rooms, gardens, and lecture halls, creating a model for the modern university campus. A hall contained shelves for the collections of papyrus scrolls known as bibliothekai (\u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b8\u1fc6\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9). According to popular description, an inscription above the shelves read: \"The place of the cure of the soul.\"\n\n\n=== Early expansion and organization ===\n\nThe Ptolemaic rulers intended the Library to be a collection of all knowledge and they worked to expand the Library's collections through an aggressive and well-funded policy of book purchasing. They dispatched royal agents with large amounts of money and ordered them to purchase and collect as many texts as they possibly could, about any subject and by any author. Older copies of texts were favored over newer ones, since it was assumed that older copies had undergone less copying and that they were therefore more likely to more closely resemble what the original author had written. This program involved trips to the book fairs of Rhodes and Athens. According to the Greek medical writer Galen, under the decree of Ptolemy II, any books found on ships that came into port were taken to the library, where they were copied by official scribes. The original texts were kept in the library, and the copies delivered to the owners. The Library particularly focused on acquiring manuscripts of the Homeric poems, which were the foundation of Greek education and revered above all other poems. The Library therefore acquired many different manuscripts of these poems, tagging each copy with a label to indicate where it had come from.In addition to collecting works from the past, the Mouseion which housed the Library also served as home to a host of international scholars, poets, philosophers, and researchers, who, according to the first-century BC Greek geographer Strabo, were provided with a large salary, free food and lodging, and exemption from taxes. They had a large, circular dining hall with a high domed ceiling in which they ate meals communally. There were also numerous classrooms, where the scholars were expected to at least occasionally teach students. Ptolemy II Philadelphus is said to have had a keen interest in zoology, so it has been speculated that the Mouseion may have even had a zoo for exotic animals. According to classical scholar Lionel Casson, the idea was that if the scholars were completely freed from all the burdens of everyday life they would be able to devote more time to research and intellectual pursuits. Strabo called the group of scholars who lived at the Mouseion a \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 (synodos, \"community\"). As early as 283 BC, they may have numbered between thirty and fifty learned men.\n\n\n=== Early scholarship ===\nThe Library of Alexandria was not affiliated with any particular philosophical school and, consequently, scholars who studied there had considerable academic freedom. They were, however, subject to the authority of the king. One likely apocryphal story is told of a poet named Sotades who wrote an obscene epigram making fun of Ptolemy II for marrying his sister Arsinoe II. Ptolemy II is said to have jailed him and, after he escaped, sealed him in a lead jar and dropped him into the sea. As a religious center, the Mouseion was directed by a priest of the Muses known as an epistates, who was appointed by the king in the same manner as the priests who managed the various Egyptian temples. The Library itself was directed by a scholar who served as head librarian, as well as tutor to the king's son.The first recorded head librarian was Zenodotus of Ephesus (lived c. 325\u2013c. 270 BC). Zenodotus's main work was devoted to the establishment of canonical texts for the Homeric poems and the early Greek lyric poets. Most of what is known about him comes from later commentaries that mention his preferred readings of particular passages. Zenodotus is known to have written a glossary of rare and unusual words, which was organized in alphabetical order, making him the first person known to have employed alphabetical order as a method of organization. Since the collection at the Library of Alexandria seems to have been organized in alphabetical order by the first letter of the author's name from very early, Casson concludes that it is highly probable that Zenodotus was the one who organized it in this way. Zenodotus's system of alphabetization, however, only used the first letter of the word and it was not until the second century AD that anyone is known to have applied the same method of alphabetization to the remaining letters of the word.Meanwhile, the scholar and poet Callimachus compiled the Pinakes, a 120-book catalogue of various authors and all their known works. The Pinakes has not survived, but enough references to it and fragments of it have survived to allow scholars to reconstruct its basic structure. The Pinakes was divided into multiple sections, each containing entries for writers of a particular genre of literature. The most basic division was between writers of poetry and prose, with each section divided into smaller subsections. Each section listed authors in alphabetical order. Each entry included the author's name, father's name, place of birth, and other brief biographical information, sometimes including nicknames by which that author was known, followed by a complete list of all that author's known works. The entries for prolific authors such as Aeschylus, Euripides, Sophocles, and Theophrastus must have been extremely long, spanning multiple columns of text. Although Callimachus did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he never held the position of head librarian there. Callimachus's pupil Hermippus of Smyrna wrote biographies, Philostephanus of Cyrene studied geography, and Istros (who may have also been from Cyrene) studied Attic antiquities. In addition to the Great Library, many other smaller libraries also began to spring up all around the city of Alexandria.\n\nAfter Zenodotus either died or retired, Ptolemy II Philadelphus appointed Apollonius of Rhodes (lived c. 295\u2013c. 215 BC), a native of Alexandria and a student of Callimachus, as the second head librarian of the Library of Alexandria. Philadelphus also appointed Apollonius of Rhodes as the tutor to his son, the future Ptolemy III Euergetes. Apollonius of Rhodes is best known as the author of the Argonautica, an epic poem about the voyages of Jason and the Argonauts, which has survived to the present in its complete form. The Argonautica displays Apollonius's vast knowledge of history and literature and makes allusions to a vast array of events and texts, while simultaneously imitating the style of the Homeric poems. Some fragments of his scholarly writings have also survived, but he is generally more famous today as a poet than as a scholar.According to legend, during the librarianship of Apollonius, the mathematician and inventor Archimedes (lived c.\u2009287 \u2013c.\u2009212 BC) came to visit the Library of Alexandria. During his time in Egypt, Archimedes is said to have observed the rise and fall of the Nile, leading him to invent the Archimedes' screw, which can be used to transport water from low-lying bodies into irrigation ditches. Archimedes later returned to Syracuse, where he continued making new inventions.According to two late and largely unreliable biographies, Apollonius was forced to resign from his position as head librarian and moved to the island of Rhodes (after which he takes his name) on account of the hostile reception he received in Alexandria to the first draft of his Argonautica. It is more likely that Apollonius's resignation was on account of Ptolemy III Euergetes's ascension to the throne in 246 BC.\n\n\n=== Later scholarship and expansion ===\nThe third head librarian, Eratosthenes of Cyrene (lived c. 280\u2013c. 194 BC), is best known today for his scientific works, but he was also a literary scholar. Eratosthenes's most important work was his treatise Geographika, which was originally in three volumes. The work itself has not survived, but many fragments of it are preserved through quotation in the writings of the later geographer Strabo. Eratosthenes was the first scholar to apply mathematics to geography and map-making and, in his treatise Concerning the Measurement of the Earth, he calculated the circumference of the earth and was only off by less than a few hundred kilometers. Eratosthenes also produced a map of the entire known world, which incorporated information taken from sources held in the Library, including accounts of Alexander the Great's campaigns in India and reports written by members of Ptolemaic elephant-hunting expeditions along the coast of East Africa.Eratosthenes was the first person to advance geography towards becoming a scientific discipline. Eratosthenes believed that the setting of the Homeric poems was purely imaginary and argued that the purpose of poetry was \"to capture the soul\", rather than to give a historically accurate account of actual events. Strabo quotes him as having sarcastically commented, \"a man might find the places of Odysseus's wanderings if the day were to come when he would find the leatherworker who stitched the goatskin of the winds.\" Meanwhile, other scholars at the Library of Alexandria also displayed interest in scientific subjects. Bacchius of Tanagra, a contemporary of Eratosthenes, edited and commented on the medical writings of the Hippocratic Corpus. The doctors Herophilus (lived c. 335\u2013c. 280 BC) and Erasistratus (c. 304\u2013c. 250 BC) studied human anatomy, but their studies were hindered by protests against the dissection of human corpses, which was seen as immoral.According to Galen, around this time, Ptolemy III requested permission from the Athenians to borrow the original manuscripts of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, for which the Athenians demanded the enormous amount of fifteen talents (1,000 lb, 450 kg) of a precious metal as guarantee that he would return them. Ptolemy III had expensive copies of the plays made on the highest quality papyrus and sent the Athenians the copies, keeping the original manuscripts for the library and telling the Athenians they could keep the talents. This story may also be construed erroneously to show the power of Alexandria over Athens during the Ptolemaic dynasty. This detail arises from the fact that Alexandria was a man-made bidirectional port between the mainland and the Pharos island, welcoming trade from the East and West, and soon found itself to be an international hub for trade, the leading producer of papyrus and, soon enough, books. As the Library expanded, it ran out of space to house the scrolls in its collection, so, during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes, it opened a satellite collection in the Serapeum of Alexandria, a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god Serapis located near the royal palace.\n\n\n=== Peak of literary criticism ===\n\nAristophanes of Byzantium (lived c. 257\u2013c. 180 BC) became the fourth head librarian sometime around 200 BC. According to a legend recorded by the Roman writer Vitruvius, Aristophanes was one of seven judges appointed for a poetry competition hosted by Ptolemy III Euergetes. All six of the other judges favored one competitor, but Aristophanes favored the one whom the audience had liked the least. Aristophanes declared that all of the poets except for the one he had chosen had committed plagiarism and were therefore disqualified. The king demanded that he prove this, so he retrieved the texts that the authors had plagiarized from the Library, locating them by memory. On account of his impressive memory and diligence, Ptolemy III appointed him as head librarian.The librarianship of Aristophanes of Byzantium is widely considered to have opened a more mature phase of the Library of Alexandria's history. During this phase of the Library's history, literary criticism reached its peak and came to dominate the Library's scholarly output. Aristophanes of Byzantium edited poetic texts and introduced the division of poems into separate lines on the page, since they had previously been written out just like prose. He also invented the system of Greek diacritics, wrote important works on lexicography, and introduced a series of signs for textual criticism. He wrote introductions to many plays, some of which have survived in partially rewritten forms. The fifth head librarian was an obscure individual named Apollonius, who is known by the epithet Greek: \u1f41 \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 (\"the classifier of forms\"). One late lexicographical source explains this epithet as referring to the classification of poetry on the basis of musical forms.During the early second century BC, several scholars at the Library of Alexandria studied works on medicine. Zeuxis the Empiricist is credited with having written commentaries on the Hippocratic Corpus and he actively worked to procure medical writings for the Library's collection. A scholar named Ptolemy Epithetes wrote a treatise on wounds in the Homeric poems, a subject straddling the line between traditional philology and medicine. However, it was also during the early second century BC that the political power of Ptolemaic Egypt began to decline. After the Battle of Raphia in 217 BC, Ptolemaic power became increasingly unstable. There were uprisings among segments of the Egyptian population and, in the first half of the second century BC, connection with Upper Egypt became largely disrupted. Ptolemaic rulers also began to emphasize the Egyptian aspect of their nation over the Greek aspect. Consequently, many Greek scholars began to leave Alexandria for safer countries with more generous patronages.Aristarchus of Samothrace (lived c. 216\u2013c. 145 BC) was the sixth head librarian. He earned a reputation as the greatest of all ancient scholars and produced not only texts of classic poems and works of prose, but full hypomnemata, or long, free-standing commentaries, on them. These commentaries would typically cite a passage of a classical text, explain its meaning, define any unusual words used in it, and comment on whether the words in the passage were really those used by the original author or if they were later interpolations added by scribes. He made many contributions to a variety of studies, but particularly the study of the Homeric poems, and his editorial opinions are widely quoted by ancient authors as authoritative. A portion of one of Aristarchus's commentaries on the Histories of Herodotus has survived in a papyrus fragment. In 145 BC, however, Aristarchus became caught up in a dynastic struggle in which he supported Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator as the ruler of Egypt. Ptolemy VII was murdered and succeeded by Ptolemy VIII Physcon, who immediately set about punishing all those who had supported his predecessor, forcing Aristarchus to flee Egypt and take refuge on the island of Cyprus, where he died shortly thereafter. Ptolemy VIII expelled all foreign scholars from Alexandria, forcing them to disperse across the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Decline ==\n\n\n=== After Ptolemy VIII's expulsions ===\nPtolemy VIII Physcon's expulsion of the scholars from Alexandria brought about a shift in the history of Hellenistic scholarship. The scholars who had studied at the Library of Alexandria and their students continued to conduct research and write treatises, but most of them no longer did so in association with the Library. A diaspora of Alexandrian scholarship occurred, in which scholars dispersed first throughout the eastern Mediterranean and later throughout the western Mediterranean as well. Aristarchus's student Dionysius Thrax (c. 170\u2013c. 90 BC) established a school on the Greek island of Rhodes. Dionysius Thrax wrote the first book on Greek grammar, a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively. This book remained the primary grammar textbook for Greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century AD. The Romans based their grammatical writings on it, and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today. Another one of Aristarchus's pupils, Apollodorus of Athens (c. 180\u2013c. 110 BC), went to Alexandria's greatest rival, Pergamum, where he taught and conducted research. This diaspora prompted the historian Menecles of Barce to sarcastically comment that Alexandria had become the teacher of all Greeks and barbarians alike.Meanwhile, in Alexandria, from the middle of the second century BC onwards, Ptolemaic rule in Egypt grew less stable than it had been previously. Confronted with growing social unrest and other major political and economic problems, the later Ptolemies did not devote as much attention towards the Library and the Mouseion as their predecessors had. The status of both the Library and the head librarian diminished. Several of the later Ptolemies used the position of head librarian as a mere political plum to reward their most devoted supporters. Ptolemy VIII appointed a man named Cydas, one of his palace guards, as head librarian and Ptolemy IX Soter II (ruled 88\u201381 BC) is said to have given the position to a political supporter. Eventually, the position of head librarian lost so much of its former prestige that even contemporary authors ceased to take interest in recording the terms of office for individual head librarians.A shift in Greek scholarship at large occurred around the beginning of the first century BC. By this time, all major classical poetic texts had finally been standardized and extensive commentaries had already been produced on the writings of all the major literary authors of the Greek Classical Era. Consequently, there was little original work left for scholars to do with these texts. Many scholars began producing syntheses and reworkings of the commentaries of the Alexandrian scholars of previous centuries, at the expense of their own originalities. Other scholars branched out and began writing commentaries on the poetic works of postclassical authors, including Alexandrian poets such as Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes. Meanwhile, Alexandrian scholarship was probably introduced to Rome in the first century BC by Tyrannion of Amisus (c. 100\u2013c. 25 BC), a student of Dionysius Thrax.\n\n\n=== Burning by Julius Caesar ===\n\nIn 48 BC, during Caesar's Civil War, Julius Caesar was besieged at Alexandria. His soldiers set fire to some of the Egyptian ships docked in the Alexandrian port while trying to clear the wharves to block the fleet belonging to Cleopatra's brother Ptolemy XIV. This fire purportedly spread to the parts of the city nearest to the docks, causing considerable devastation. The first-century AD Roman playwright and Stoic philosopher Seneca the Younger quotes Livy's Ab Urbe Condita Libri, which was written between 63 and 14 BC, as saying that the fire started by Caesar destroyed 40,000 scrolls from the Library of Alexandria. The Greek Middle Platonist Plutarch (c. 46\u2013120 AD) writes in his Life of Caesar that, \"[W]hen the enemy endeavored to cut off his communication by sea, he was forced to divert that danger by setting fire to his own ships, which, after burning the docks, thence spread on and destroyed the great library.\" The Roman historian Cassius Dio (c. 155 \u2013c. 235 AD), however, writes: \"Many places were set on fire, with the result that, along with other buildings, the dockyards and storehouses of grain and books, said to be great in number and of the finest, were burned.\" However, Florus and Lucan only mention that the flames burned the fleet itself and some \"houses near the sea\".Scholars have interpreted Cassius Dio's wording to indicate that the fire did not actually destroy the entire Library itself, but rather only a warehouse located near the docks being used by the Library to house scrolls. Whatever devastation Caesar's fire may have caused, the Library was evidently not completely destroyed. The geographer Strabo (c. 63 BC\u2013c. 24 AD) mentions visiting the Mouseion, the larger research institution to which the Library was attached, in around 20 BC, several decades after Caesar's fire, indicating that it either survived the fire or was rebuilt soon afterwards. Nonetheless, Strabo's manner of talking about the Mouseion shows that it was nowhere near as prestigious as it had been a few centuries prior. Despite mentioning the Mouseion, Strabo does not mention the Library separately, perhaps indicating that it had been so drastically reduced in stature and significance that Strabo felt it did not warrant separate mention. It is unclear what happened to the Mouseion after Strabo's mention of it.Furthermore, Plutarch records in his Life of Marc Antony that, in the years leading up to the Battle of Actium in 33 BC, Mark Antony was rumored to have given Cleopatra all 200,000 scrolls in the Library of Pergamum. Plutarch himself notes that his source for this anecdote was sometimes unreliable and it is possible that the story may be nothing more than propaganda intended to show that Mark Antony was loyal to Cleopatra and Egypt rather than to Rome. Casson, however, argues that, even if the story was made up, it would not have been believable unless the Library still existed. Edward J. Watts argues that Mark Antony's gift may have been intended to replenish the Library's collection after the damage to it caused by Caesar's fire roughly a decade and a half prior.Further evidence for the Library's survival after 48 BC comes from the fact that the most notable producer of composite commentaries during the late first century BC and early first century AD was a scholar who worked in Alexandria named Didymus Chalcenterus, whose epithet \u03a7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (Chalk\u00e9nteros) means \"bronze guts\". Didymus is said to have produced somewhere between 3,500 and 4,000 books, making him the most prolific known writer in all of antiquity. He was also given the nickname \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03c2 (Bibliol\u00e1th\u0113s), meaning \"book-forgetter\" because it was said that even he could not remember all the books he had written. Parts of some of Didymus's commentaries have been preserved in the forms of later extracts and these remains are modern scholars' most important sources of information about the critical works of the earlier scholars at the Library of Alexandria. Lionel Casson states that Didymus's prodigious output \"would have been impossible without at least a good part of the resources of the library at his disposal.\"\n\n\n=== Roman Period and destruction ===\n\nVery little is known about the Library of Alexandria during the time of the Roman Principate (27 BC\u2013284 AD). The emperor Claudius (ruled 41\u201354 AD) is recorded to have built an addition onto the Library, but it seems that the Library of Alexandria's general fortunes followed those of the city of Alexandria itself. After Alexandria came under Roman rule, the city's status and, consequently that of its famous Library, gradually diminished. While the Mouseion still existed, membership was granted not on the basis of scholarly achievement, but rather on the basis of distinction in government, the military, or even in athletics.The same was evidently the case even for the position of head librarian; the only known head librarian from the Roman Period was a man named Tiberius Claudius Balbilus, who lived in the middle of the first century AD and was a politician, administrator, and military officer with no record of substantial scholarly achievements. Members of the Mouseion were no longer required to teach, conduct research, or even live in Alexandria. The Greek writer Philostratus records that the emperor Hadrian (ruled 117\u2013138 AD) appointed the ethnographer Dionysius of Miletus and the sophist Polemon of Laodicea as members of the Mouseion, even though neither of these men is known to have ever spent any significant amount of time in Alexandria.Meanwhile, as the reputation of Alexandrian scholarship declined, the reputations of other libraries across the Mediterranean world improved, diminishing the Library of Alexandria's former status as the most prominent. Other libraries also sprang up within the city of Alexandria itself and the scrolls from the Great Library may have been used to stock some of these smaller libraries. The Caesareum and the Claudianum in Alexandria are both known to have had major libraries by the end of the first century AD. The Serapeum, originally the \"daughter library\" of the Great Library, probably expanded during this period as well, according to classical historian Edward J. Watts.By the second century AD, the Roman Empire grew less dependent on grain from Alexandria and the city's prominence declined further. The Romans during this period also had less interest in Alexandrian scholarship, causing the Library's reputation to continue to decline as well. The scholars who worked and studied at the Library of Alexandria during the time of the Roman Empire were less well known than the ones who had studied there during the Ptolemaic Period. Eventually, the word \"Alexandrian\" itself came to be synonymous with the editing of texts, correction of textual errors, and writing of commentaries synthesized from those of earlier scholars\u2014in other words, taking on connotations of pedantry, monotony, and lack of originality. Mention of both the Great Library of Alexandria and the Mouseion that housed it disappear after the middle of the third century AD. The last known references to scholars being members of the Mouseion date to the 260s.In 272 AD, the emperor Aurelian fought to recapture the city of Alexandria from the forces of the Palmyrene queen Zenobia. During the course of the fighting, Aurelian's forces destroyed the Broucheion quarter of the city in which the main library was located. If the Mouseion and Library still existed at this time, they were almost certainly destroyed during the attack as well. If they did survive the attack, then whatever was left of them would have been destroyed during the emperor Diocletian's siege of Alexandria in 297.\n\n\n=== Arabic sources on Muslim invasion ===\nIn 642 AD, Alexandria was captured by the Muslim army of 'Amr ibn al-'As. Several later Arabic sources describe the library's destruction by the order of Caliph Omar. Bar-Hebraeus, writing in the thirteenth century, quotes Omar as saying to Ya\u1e25y\u0101 al-Na\u1e25w\u012b: \"If those books are in agreement with the Quran, we have no need of them; and if these are opposed to the Quran, destroy them.\" Later scholars\u2014beginning with Father Eus\u00e8be Renaudot's remark in 1713 in his translation of the History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria that the tale \"had something untrustworthy about it\"\u2014are skeptical of these stories, given the range of time that had passed before they were written down and the political motivations of the various writers. According to Diana Delia, \"Omar's rejection of pagan and Christian wisdom may have been devised and exploited by conservative authorities as a moral exemplum for Muslims to follow in later, uncertain times, when the devotion of the faithful was once again tested by proximity to nonbelievers\".\n\n\n== Successors to the Mouseion ==\n\n\n=== Serapeum ===\nScattered references indicate that, sometime in the fourth century, an institution known as the \"Mouseion\" may have been reestablished at a different location somewhere in Alexandria. Nothing, however, is known about the characteristics of this organization. It may have possessed some bibliographic resources, but whatever they may have been, they were clearly not comparable to those of its predecessor. For much of the late fourth century AD, the library of the Serapeum was probably the largest collection of books in the city of Alexandria. In the 370s and 380s, the Serapeum was still a major pilgrimage site for many pagans.In addition to possessing the largest library in Alexandria, the Serapeum remained a fully functioning temple and it even had classrooms for philosophers to teach in. It naturally tended to attract followers of Iamblichean Neoplatonism. Most of these philosophers were primarily interested in theurgy, the study of cultic rituals and esoteric religious practices. The Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius (lived c. 458\u2013after 538) records that a man named Olympus came from Cilicia to teach at the Serapeum, where he enthusiastically taught his students the rules of traditional divine worship and ancient religious practices. He enjoined his students to worship the old gods in traditional ways, and he may have even taught them theurgy.In 391 AD, a group of Christian workmen in Alexandria uncovered the remains of an old Mithraeum. They gave some of the cult objects to the Christian bishop of Alexandria, Theophilus. Theophilus had the cult objects paraded through the streets so they could be mocked and ridiculed. The pagans of Alexandria were incensed by this act of desecration, especially the teachers of Neoplatonic philosophy and theurgy at the Serapeum. The teachers at the Serapeum took up arms and led their students and other followers in a guerrilla attack on the Christian population of Alexandria, killing many of them before being forced to retreat. In retaliation, the Christians vandalized and demolished the Serapeum, although some parts of the colonnade were still standing as late as the twelfth century. However, none of the accounts of the Serapeum's destruction mention anything about it having a library and sources written before its destruction speak of its collection of books in the past tense, indicating that it probably did not have any significant collection of scrolls in it at the time of its destruction.\n\n\n=== School of Theon and Hypatia ===\n\nThe Suda, a tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia, calls the mathematician Theon of Alexandria (c.\u2009AD 335\u2013c. 405) a \"man of the Mouseion\". According to classical historian Edward J. Watts, however, Theon was probably the head of a school called the \"Mouseion\", which was named in emulation of the Hellenistic Mouseion that had once included the Library of Alexandria, but which had little other connection to it. Theon's school was exclusive, highly prestigious, and doctrinally conservative. Neither Theon nor Hypatia seem to have had any connections to the militant Iamblichean Neoplatonists who taught in the Serapeum. Instead, Theon seems to have rejected the teachings of Iamblichus and may have taken pride in teaching a pure, Plotinian Neoplatonism. In around 400 AD, Theon's daughter Hypatia (born c. 350\u2013370; died 415 AD) succeeded him as the head of his school. Like her father, she rejected the teachings of Iamblichus and instead embraced the original Neoplatonism formulated by Plotinus.Theophilus, the bishop involved in the destruction of the Serapeum, tolerated Hypatia's school and even encouraged two of her students to become bishops in territory under his authority. Hypatia was extremely popular with the people of Alexandria and exerted profound political influence. Theophilus respected Alexandria's political structures and raised no objection to the close ties Hypatia established with Roman prefects. Hypatia was later implicated in a political feud between Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, and Cyril of Alexandria, Theophilus's successor as bishop. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March of 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians, led by a lector named Peter. She had no successor and her school collapsed after her death.\n\n\n=== Later schools and libraries in Alexandria ===\nNonetheless, Hypatia was not the last pagan in Alexandria, nor was she the last Neoplatonist philosopher. Neoplatonism and paganism both survived in Alexandria and throughout the eastern Mediterranean for centuries after her death. British Egyptologist Charlotte Booth notes that many new academic lecture halls were built in Alexandria at Kom el-Dikka shortly after Hypatia's death, indicating that philosophy was clearly still taught in Alexandrian schools. The late fifth-century writers Zacharias Scholasticus and Aeneas of Gaza both speak of the \"Mouseion\" as occupying some kind of a physical space. Archaeologists have identified lecture halls dating to around this time period, located near, but not on, the site of the Ptolemaic Mouseion, which may be the \"Mouseion\" to which these writers refer.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nIt is not possible to determine the collection's size in any era with certainty. Papyrus scrolls constituted the collection, and although codices were used after 300 BC, the Alexandrian Library is never documented as having switched to parchment, perhaps because of its strong links to the papyrus trade. The Library of Alexandria in fact was indirectly causal in the creation of writing on parchment, as the Egyptians refused to export papyrus to their competitor in the Library of Pergamum. Consequently, the Library of Pergamum developed parchment as its own writing material.A single piece of writing might occupy several scrolls, and this division into self-contained \"books\" was a major aspect of editorial work. King Ptolemy II Philadelphus (309\u2013246 BC) is said to have set 500,000 scrolls as an objective for the library. The library's index, Callimachus's Pinakes, has only survived in the form of a few fragments, and it is not possible to know with certainty how large and how diverse the collection may have been. At its height, the library was said to possess nearly half a million scrolls, and, although historians debate the precise number, the highest estimates claim 400,000 scrolls while the most conservative estimates are as low as 40,000, which is still an enormous collection that required vast storage space.As a research institution, the library filled its stacks with new works in mathematics, astronomy, physics, natural sciences and other subjects. Its empirical standards were applied in one of the first and certainly strongest homes for serious textual criticism. As the same text often existed in several different versions, comparative textual criticism was crucial for ensuring their veracity. Once ascertained, canonical copies would then be made for scholars, royalty, and wealthy bibliophiles the world over, this commerce bringing income to the library.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== In antiquity ===\nThe Library of Alexandria was one of the largest and most prestigious libraries of the ancient world, but it was far from the only one. By the end of the Hellenistic Period, almost every city in the Eastern Mediterranean had a public library and so did many medium-sized towns. During the Roman Period, the number of libraries only proliferated. By the fourth century AD, there were at least two dozen public libraries in the city of Rome itself alone.In late antiquity, as the Roman Empire became Christianized, Christian libraries modeled directly on the Library of Alexandria and other great libraries of earlier pagan times began to be founded all across the Greek-speaking eastern part of the empire. Among the largest and most prominent of these libraries were the Theological Library of Caesarea Maritima, the Library of Jerusalem, and a Christian library in Alexandria. These libraries held both pagan and Christian writings side-by-side and Christian scholars applied to the Judeo-Christian scriptures the same philological techniques that the scholars of the Library of Alexandria had used for analyzing the Greek classics. Nonetheless, the study of pagan authors remained secondary to the study of the Christian scriptures until the Renaissance.Ironically, the survival of ancient texts owes nothing to the great libraries of antiquity and instead owes everything to the fact that they were exhaustingly copied and recopied, at first by professional scribes during the Roman Period onto papyrus and later by monks during the Middle Ages onto parchment.\n\n\n=== Modern library: Bibliotheca Alexandrina ===\n\nThe idea of reviving the ancient Library of Alexandria in the modern era was first proposed in 1974, when Lotfy Dowidar was president of the University of Alexandria. In May 1986, Egypt requested the Executive Board of UNESCO to allow the international organization to conduct a feasibility study for the project. This marked the beginning of UNESCO and the international community's involvement in trying to bring the project to fruition. Starting in 1988, UNESCO and the UNDP worked to support the international architectural competition to design the Library. Egypt devoted four hectares of land for the building of the Library and established the National High Commission for the Library of Alexandria. Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak took a personal interest in the project, which greatly contributed to its advancement. Completed in 2002, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina now functions as a modern library and cultural center, commemorating the original Library of Alexandria. In line with the mission of the Great Library of Alexandria, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina also houses the International School of Information Science (ISIS), a school for students preparing for highly specialized post-graduate degrees, whose goal is to train professional staff for libraries in Egypt and across the Middle East.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nImperial Library of Constantinople\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJames Hannam: The Mysterious Fate of the Great Library of Alexandria.\nKrasner-Khait, Barbara (October\u2013November 2001). \"Survivor: The History of the Library\".

        "wiki": "Alexandria ( or ; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0643\u0646\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0629\u200e al-\u02beIskandariyya; Egyptian Arabic: \u0627\u0633\u0643\u0646\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0629\u200e Eskendereyya; Coptic: \u2ca3\u2c81\u2c95\u2c9f\u03ef    Rakod\u012b; Greek: \u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 Alexandria) is the second-largest city in Egypt and a major economic center. With a population of 5,200,000, Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean, the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa. The city extends about 40 km (25 mi)  at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea. Alexandria is a popular tourist destination, and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.\nAlexandria was founded in c.\u2009331 BC by Alexander the Great, king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth, during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire. An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria. Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years, until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at Fustat (later absorbed into Cairo). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library (the largest in the ancient world); and the Necropolis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity. It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome.\nThe city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria, which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire. In the modern world, the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.\nFollowing the Arab conquest of Egypt in AD 641, the city was plundered and lost its significance before re-emerging in the modern era. From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major center of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centers in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nRecent radiocarbon dating of seashell fragments and lead contamination show human activity at the location during the period of the Old Kingdom (27th-21st centuries BC) and again in the period 1000-800 BC, followed by the absence of activity thereafter. From ancient sources it is known there existed a trading post at this location during the time of Rameses the Great for trade with Crete, but it had long been lost by the time of Alexander's arrival. A small Egyptian fishing village named Rhakotis (Egyptian:*Ra\u02c1-\u1e32\u0101\u1e6dit, written r\u02c1-\u1e33\u1e6dy.t, 'That which is built up') existed since the 13th century BC in the vicinity and eventually grew into the Egyptian quarter of the city. Just east of Alexandria (where Abu Qir Bay is now), there was in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of Canopus and Heracleion. The latter was recently rediscovered under water.\nAlexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in April 331 BC as \u1f08\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 (Alexandreia). Passing through Egypt, Alexander wanted to build a large Greek city on Egypt's coast that would bear his name. He chose the site of Alexandria, envisioning the building of a causeway to the nearby island of Pharos that would generate two great natural harbors. Alexandria was intended to supersede the older Greek colony of Naucratis as a Hellenistic center in Egypt, and to be the link between Greece and the rich Nile valley.  A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to the city during his life.\nAfter Alexander's departure, his viceroy Cleomenes continued the expansion. The architect Dinocrates of Rhodes designed the city, using a Hippodamian grid plan. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, his general Ptolemy Lagides took possession of Egypt and brought Alexander's body to Egypt with him. Ptolemy at first ruled from the old Egyptian capital of Memphis. In 322/321 BC he had Cleomenes executed. Finally, in 305 BC, Ptolemy declared himself Pharaoh as Ptolemy I Soter (\"Savior\") and moved his capital to Alexandria.\nAlthough Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's early development, the Heptastadion and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined Tyre and becoming the center of the new commerce between Europe and the Arabian and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than Carthage. In a century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with Greek people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nAlexandria was not only a center of Hellenism, but was also home to the largest urban Jewish community in the world. The Septuagint, a Greek version of the Tanakh, was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic center of learning (Library of Alexandria), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Jewish, and Egyptian. By the time of Augustus, the city walls encompassed an area of 5.34 km2, and the total population in Roman times was around 500\u2013600,000.According to Philo of Alexandria, in the year 38 of the Common era, disturbances erupted between Jews and Greek citizens of Alexandria during a visit paid by the Jewish king Agrippa I to Alexandria, principally over the respect paid by the Jewish nation to the Roman emperor, and which quickly escalated to open affronts and violence between the two ethnic groups and the desecration of Alexandrian synagogues. The violence was quelled after Caligula intervened and had the Roman governor, Flaccus, removed from the city.In AD 115, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the Kitos War, which gave Hadrian and his architect, Decriannus, an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215, the emperor Caracalla visited the city and, because of some insulting satires that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365, Alexandria was devastated by a tsunami (365 Crete earthquake), an event annually commemorated years later as a \"day of horror\".\n\n\n=== Islamic era ===\n\nIn 619, Alexandria fell to the Sassanid Persians. Although the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general 'Amr ibn al-'As invaded it during the Muslim conquest of Egypt, after a siege that lasted 14 months. The first Arab governor of Egypt recorded to have visited Alexandria was Utba ibn Abi Sufyan, who strengthened the Arab presence and built a governor's palace in the city in 664\u2013665.After the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517, the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under Ottoman rule until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of Rosetta during the 9th to 18th centuries, and only regained its former prominence with the construction of the Mahmoudiyah Canal in 1807.\nAlexandria figured prominently in the military operations of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernize the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.In July 1882, the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied.In July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the Lavon Affair. On 26 October 1954, Alexandria's Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on Gamal Abdel Nasser.Europeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 Suez Crisis that led to an outburst of Arab nationalism. The nationalization of property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly all the rest.\n\n\n=== Ibn Battuta in Alexandria ===\n\nIn reference to Alexandria, Egypt, Ibn Battuta speaks of great saints that resided here. One of them being Imam Borhan Oddin El Aaraj. He was said to have the power of working miracles. He told Ibn Battuta that he should go find his three brothers, Farid Oddin, who lived in India, Rokn Oddin Ibn Zakarya, who lived in Sindia, and Borhan Oddin, who lived in China. Battuta then made it his purpose to find these people and give them his compliments. Sheikh Yakut was another great man. He was the disciple of Sheikh Abu Abbas El Mursi, who was the disciple of Abu El Hasan El Shadali, who is known to be a servant of God. Abu Abbas was the author of the Hizb El Bahr and was famous for piety and miracles. Abu Abd Allah El Murshidi was a great interpreting saint that lived secluded in the Minyat of Ibn Murshed. He lived alone but was visited daily by emirs, viziers, and crowds that wished to eat with him. The Sultan of Egypt (El Malik El Nasir) visited him, as well. Ibn Battuta left Alexandria with the intent of visiting him.Ibn Battuta also visited the Pharos lighthouse on 2 occasions; in 1326 he found it to be partly in ruins and in 1349 it had deteriorated further, making entrance to the edifice impossible.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\nThe most important battles and sieges of Alexandria include:\n\nSiege of Alexandria (47 BC), Julius Caesar's civil war\nBattle of Alexandria (30 BC), final war of the Roman Republic\nSiege of Alexandria (619), Byzantine-Persian Wars\nSiege of Alexandria (641), Rashidun conquest of Byzantine Egypt\nAlexandrian Crusade (1365), a crusade led by Peter de Lusignan of Cyprus which resulted in the defeat of the Mamluks and the sack of the city.\nBattle of Alexandria (1801), Napoleonic Wars\nSiege of Alexandria (1801), Napoleonic Wars\nAlexandria expedition (1807), Napoleonic Wars\n\n\n== Ancient layout ==\nGreek Alexandria was divided into three regions:\nBrucheum\nBrucheum is the Royal or Greek quarter and forms the most magnificent portion of the city. In Roman times Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal;\nThe Jewish quarter\nThis quarter is the northeast portion of the city;\nRhakotis\nRhakotis is the old city that was absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians. (from Coptic Rakot\u0259 \"Alexandria\").Two main streets, lined with colonnades and said to have been each about 60 meters (200 ft) wide, intersected in the center of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his Mausoleum) rose. This point is very near the present mosque of Nebi Daniel; and the line of the great East\u2013West \"Canopic\" street, only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharia Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.\nAlexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a 1,260-metre-long (4,130 ft) mole and called the Heptastadion (\"seven stadia\"\u2014a stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180 metres or 590 feet). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the \"Moon Gate\" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern \"Ras al-Tin\" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.\nIn Strabo's time, (latter half of the 1st century BC) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbor.\n\nThe Royal Palaces, filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbor on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the \"Private Port,\" and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land subsidence here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.\nThe Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Julius Caesar as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the battle of Pharsalus\nThe Poseidon, or Temple of the Sea God, close to the theater\nThe Timonium built by Marc Antony\nThe Emporium (Exchange)\nThe Apostases (Magazines)\nThe Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole\nBehind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great obelisks, which become known as \"Cleopatra's Needles,\" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.\nThe Gymnasium and the Palaestra are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.\nThe Temple of Saturn; alexandria west.\nThe Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.\nThe Musaeum with its famous Library and theater in the same region; site unknown.\nThe Serapeum of Alexandria, the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells us that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near \"Pompey's Pillar,\" which was an independent monument erected to commemorate Diocletian's siege of the city.The names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, The Great Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, reputed to be 138 metres (453 feet) high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy (Ptolemy II Philadelphus) completed it, at a total cost of 800 talents. It took 12 years to complete and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the Great Pyramid of Giza. A temple of Hephaestus also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.\nIn the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens, according to a census dated from 32 CE, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 216,000 to 500,000 making it one of the largest cities ever built before the Industrial Revolution and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAlexandria is located in the country of Egypt, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlexandria has a borderline hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BWh), approaching a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). As the rest of Egypt's northern coast, the prevailing north wind, blowing across the Mediterranean, gives the city a less severe climate from the desert hinterland. Rafah and Alexandria are the wettest places in Egypt; the other wettest places are Rosetta, Baltim, Kafr el-Dawwar, and Mersa Matruh. The city's climate is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, moderating its temperatures, causing variable rainy winters and moderately hot and slightly prolonged summers that, at times, can be very humid; January and February are the coolest months, with daily maximum temperatures typically ranging from 12 to 18 \u00b0C (54 to 64 \u00b0F) and minimum temperatures that could reach 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F). temperature sometimes gets lower than 5 and it sometimes rains snow.\nAlexandria experiences violent storms, rain and sometimes sleet and hail during the cooler months; these events, combined with a poor drainage system, have been responsible for occasional flooding in the city in the past though they rarely occur anymore. July and August are the hottest and driest months of the year, with an average daily maximum temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual rainfall is around 200 mm (7.9 in) but has been as high as 417 mm (16.4 in)Port Said, Kosseir, Baltim, Damietta and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in Egypt.\nThe highest recorded temperature was 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) on 30 May 1961, and the coldest recorded temperature was 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1994.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDue to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour and the rest has been built over in modern times.\n\n\"Pompey's Pillar\", a Roman triumphal column, is one of the best-known ancient monuments still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient acropolis\u2014a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab cemetery\u2014and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its pedestal, it is 30 m (99 ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in diameter at the base, tapering to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) at the top. The shaft is 88 feet (27 m) high, and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is 132 cubic meters (4,662 cubic feet) and weight approximately 396 tons. Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient obelisks. The Romans had cranes but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several obelisk erecting experiments including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk. The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. \"Pompey's Pillar\" is a misnomer, as it has nothing to do with Pompey, having been erected in 293 for Diocletian, possibly in memory of the rebellion of Domitius Domitianus. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god Serapis were enacted, and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.\nAlexandria's catacombs, known as Kom El Shoqafa, are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large spiral staircase, and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other syncretic Romano-Egyptian religious symbols, burial niches, and sarcophagi, as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in 1900.The most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as Kom El Deka. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its Roman-era baths.\nPersistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local Archaeological Society, and by many individuals, notably Greeks proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.\nThe past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; D. G. Hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898\u20131899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.\n\nSince the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. Cleopatra VII's royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual subsidence in the 4th century AD. This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team. It raised a noted head of Caesarion. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy. The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman strata.\nThe most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.\nThe objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in Kom El Shoqafa (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).\nThe German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of Kom El Deka, which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.\nThe making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtlessly immense; but despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\".\n\n\n=== Temple of Taposiris Magna ===\nThe temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine Pharos Lighthouse.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, there are Muslim mosques. Coptic Christian churches are most common churches .There are also other Christian churches as:  Greek , Latin and Armenian . Orthodox Christian churches are most common but Catholic , Anglican and Evangelical churches are present. Also there is a Jewish synagogue\n\n\n=== Islam ===\n\nThe most famous mosque in Alexandria is Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque in Bahary. Other notable mosques in the city include Ali ibn Abi Talib mosque in Somouha, Bilal mosque, al-Gamaa al-Bahari in Mandara, Hatem mosque in Somouha, Hoda el-Islam mosque in Sidi Bishr, al-Mowasah mosque in Hadara, Sharq al-Madina mosque in Miami, al-Shohadaa mosque in Mostafa Kamel, Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque, Yehia mosque in Zizinia, Sidi Gaber mosque in Sidi Gaber, Sidi B esher mosque, Rokay el-Islam mosque in Elessway, Elsadaka Mosque in Sidibesher Qebly, Elshatbi mosque and Sultan mosque.\nAlexandria is the base of the Salafi movements in Egypt. Al-Nour Party, which is based in the city and overwhelmingly won most of the Salafi votes in the 2011\u201312 parliamentary election, supports the president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nAfter Rome and Constantinople, Alexandria was considered the third-most important seat of Christianity in the world. The Pope of Alexandria was second only to the bishop of Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire until 430. The Church of Alexandria had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, the Church of Alexandria was split between the Miaphysites and the Melkites. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. In the 19th century, Catholic and Protestant missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.\nToday, the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is Saint Mark Cathedral . The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include Pope Cyril I Church in Cleopatra, Saint Georges Church in Sporting, Saint Mark & Pope Peter I Church in Sidi Bishr, Saint Mary Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, Saint Mina Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and Saint Takla Haymanot's Church in Ibrahimeya.\nThe most important Eastern Orthodox churches in Alexandria are Agioi An\u00e1rgyroi Church, Church of the Annunciation, Saint Anthony Church, Archangels Gabriel & Michael Church, Taxiarchon Church, Saint Catherine Church, Cathedral of the Dormition in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, Prophet Elijah Church, Saint George Church, Saint Joseph Church in Fleming, Saint Joseph of Arimathea Church, Saint Mark & Saint Nektarios Chapel in Ramleh, Saint Nicholas Church, Saint Paraskevi Church, Saint Sava Cathedral in Ramleh, Saint Theodore Chapel and the Russian church of Saint Alexander Nevsky in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.\nThe Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said has jurisdiction over all Latin Church Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the Jesuits in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan, which uses the Byzantine Rite, and the nominal see of the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia, using the Armenian Rite.\nThe Saint Mark Church in Shatby, founded as part of Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, Coptic Catholic and Coptic Orthodox rites.\nIn antiquity, Alexandria was a major center of the cosmopolitan religious movement called Gnosticism (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\n\nAlexandria's once-flourishing Jewish community declined rapidly following the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, after which negative reactions towards Zionism among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt fled to the newly established Israel, France, Brazil and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50. The most important synagogue in Alexandria is the Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nAlexandria has a number of higher education institutions. Alexandria University is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its Faculty of Medicine & Faculty of Engineering. In addition, the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology in New Borg El Arab city is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010.  The Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC American University in Cairo because of its worldwide recognition from board of engineers at UK & ABET in US. Universit\u00e9 Senghor is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly recruits students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT) and Pharos University in Alexandria.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\nAlexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by Catholic missionaries include Coll\u00e8ge de la M\u00e8re de Dieu, Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Sion, Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Ecoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), \u00c9cole Girard, \u00c9cole Saint Gabriel, \u00c9cole Saint-Vincent de Paul, \u00c9cole Saint Joseph, \u00c9cole Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lyc\u00e9e el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently a public school run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais d'Alexandrie (\u00c9cole Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the Istituto \"Don Bosco\".\nEnglish schools in Alexandria are becoming the most popular. English-language schools in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, British School of Alexandria, Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Egyptian English Language School,  Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, Schutz American School, Victoria College, El Manar Language School for Girls (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and El Nasr Girls' College.\nThere are only two German schools in Alexandria which are Deutsche Schule der Borrom\u00e4rinnen (DSB of Saint Charles Borrom\u00e9) and Neue Deutsche Schule Alexandria, which is run by Frau Sally Hammam.\nThe Montessori educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at Alexandria Montessori.\nThe most notable public schools in Alexandria include El Abbassia High School and Gamal Abdel Nasser High School.\n\n\n=== Women ===\nCirca the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to the same percentage in Cairo. As a result, specialist women's publications like al-Fat\u0101h by Hind Nawal, the country's first women's' journal, appeared.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city's principal airport is currently Borg El Arab Airport, which is located about 25 km (16 mi) away from the city center.\nFrom late 2011, El Nouzha Airport (Alexandria International Airport) was to be closed to commercial operations for two years as it underwent expansion, with all airlines operating out of Borg El Arab Airport from then onwards, where a brand new terminal was completed there in February 2010. In 2017, the government announced that Alexandria International Airport will shut down permanently for operational reasons.\n\n\n=== Port ===\n\nAlexandria has four ports; namely the Western Port also known as(Alexandria Port), which is the main port of the country that handles about 60% of the country's exports and imports, Dekhela Port west of the Western Port, the Eastern Port which is a yachting harbor, and Abu Qir Port at the northern east of the governorate. It is a commercial port for general cargo and phosphates.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nInternational Coastal Road (Mersa Matruh \u2013 Alexandria \u2013 Port Said)\nCairo\u2013Alexandria Desert Road (Alexandria \u2013 Cairo \u2013 220 km (137 mi), 6\u20138 lanes)\nCairo-Alexandria Agriculture Road (Alexandria \u2013 Cairo)\nMehwar El Ta'meer \u2013 (Alexandria \u2013 Borg El Arab)\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAlexandria's intracity commuter rail system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity railway station) to Abu Qir, parallel to the tram line. The commuter line's locomotives operate on diesel, as opposed to the overhead-electric tram.\nAlexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned Misr Station (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and Sidi Gaber railway station (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the center of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by Egyptian National Railways.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nAn extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the El Raml district in the west and ends in the Victoria district in the east. Most of the vehicles are blue in color. Some smaller yellow-colored vehicles have further routes beyond the two main endpoints. The tram routes have one of four numbers: 1, 2, 5, and 6. All four start at El Raml, but only two (1 and 2) reach Victoria. There are two converging and diverging points. The first starts at Bolkly (Isis) and ends at San Stefano. The other begins at Sporting and ends at Mostafa Kamel. Route 5 starts at San Stefano and takes the inner route to Bolkly. Route 6 starts at Sidi Gaber El Sheikh in the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 1 takes the inner route between San Stefano and Bolkly and the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 2 takes the route opposite to Route 1 in both these areas. The tram fares are 50 piastres (0.50 pounds), and 100 piastres (1.00 pounds) for the middle car. Some trams (that date back the 30s) charge a pound. The tram is considered the cheapest method of public transport. A caf\u00e9 operates in the second floor of the first car of tram 1 (a women-only car) which costs 5 L.E per person, also offering a WiFi service. A luxury light blue tram car operates from San Stefano to Ras El Tin, with free WiFi and movies and songs played inside for 5 L.E per ticket.\nStations:\n\nRoute 2 serves:\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nConstruction of the Alexandria Metro is due to begin in 2020 at a cost of $1.05 billion.\n\n\n=== Taxis and minibuses ===\n\nTaxis in Alexandria sport a yellow-and-black livery and are widely available. While Egyptian law requires all cabs to carry meters, these generally do not work and fares must be negotiated with the driver on either departure or arrival.\n\nThe minibus share taxi system, or mashr\u016b' operates along well-known traffic arteries. The routes can be identified by both their endpoints and the route between them:\n\nCorniche routes:\nEl Mandara \u2013 Bahari\nEl Mandara \u2013 El Mansheya\nAsafra \u2013 Bahari\nAsafra \u2013 El Mansheya\nEl Sa'aa \u2013 El Mansheya\nAbu Qir routes:\nEl Mandara \u2013 El Mahata (lit. \"the Station\", i.e. Misr Railway Station)\nAbu Qir \u2013 El Mahata\nVictoria \u2013 El Mahata\nEl Mandara \u2013 Victoria\nInterior routes:\nCabo \u2013 Bahari\nEl Mansheya \u2013 El Awayid\nEl Mansheya \u2013 El Maw'af El Gedid (the New Bus Station)\nHadara \u2013 El MahataThe route is generally written in Arabic on the side of the vehicle, although some drivers change their route without changing the paint. Some drivers also drive only a segment of a route rather than the whole path; such drivers generally stop at a point known as a major hub of the transportation system (for example, Victoria) to allow riders to transfer to another car or to another mode of transport.\nFare is generally L.E. 3.00 to travel the whole route. Shorter trips may have a lower fare, depending on the driver and the length of the trip.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe Royal Library of Alexandria, in Alexandria, Egypt, was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of Ptolemy II of Egypt. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the Muses\u2014the Museion, Greek \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03bd (from which the Modern English word museum is derived).\nIt has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.The Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002, near the site of the old Library.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Alexandria National Museum was inaugurated 31 December 2003. It is located in a restored Italian style palace in Tariq El Horreya Street (formerly Rue Fouad), near the center of the city. It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and Egypt. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria. Construction on the site was first undertaken in 1926.\nCavafy Museum\nThe Graeco-Roman Museum\nThe Museum of Fine Arts\nThe Royal Jewelry Museum\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nAlexandria Opera House, where classical music, Arabic music, ballet, and opera are performed and bearm basha theatre in elshatby.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThroughout Alexandria, there is art that resembles some of the oldest architectural styles of the Hellenic city, and its ancient decorations, especially in the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, is based on reviving the ancient Library of Alexandria. The Kom el shoqafa Catacombs are considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages and date back to the 2nd century. The remnants of Pompey's Pillar still remain today. This single pillar represents the elaborate temple which once stood in Alexandria. It remains at the site of the Serapeum, Alexandria's acropolis. The Serapeum, which stood for ancient tradition, conflicted with the rise of Christianity. It is a large tourist destination, today. the Roman Amphitheatre of Alexandria is another popular destination. Here, there remains a stage with around seven hundred to eight hundred seats. They also have numerous galleries of statues and details leftover form this time. Alexandria's tourism office announced plans to reserve some beaches for tourists in July 2018.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe main sport that interests Alexandrians is football, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. Alexandria Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Alexandria, Egypt. It is currently used mostly for football matches, and was used for the 2006 African Cup of Nations. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the African Cup of Nations in January 2006, which Egypt won. Sea sports such as surfing, jet-skiing and water polo are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the Alexandria Sporting Club, which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the country's national team with key players. The city hosted the AfroBasket, the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).\nAlexandria has four stadiums:\n\nOther less popular sports like tennis and squash are usually played in private social and sports clubs, like:\n\nStarted in 2011, Cross Egypt Challenge is an international cross-country motorcycle and scooter rally conducted throughout the most difficult tracks and roads of Egypt. Alexandria is known as the yearly starting point of Cross Egypt Challenge and a huge celebration is conducted the night before the rally starts after all the international participants arrive to the city.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nAlexandria is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nA.

With a population of 5,200,000, Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean, the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa. The city extends about 40 km (25 mi)  at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea. Alexandria is a popular tourist destination, and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.\nAlexandria was founded in c.\u2009331 BC by Alexander the Great, king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth, during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire. An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria. Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years, until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at Fustat (later absorbed into Cairo). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library (the largest in the ancient world); and the Necropolis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity. It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome.\nThe city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria, which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire. In the modern world, the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.\nFollowing the Arab conquest of Egypt in AD 641, the city was plundered and lost its significance before re-emerging in the modern era. From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major center of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centers in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nRecent radiocarbon dating of seashell fragments and lead contamination show human activity at the location during the period of the Old Kingdom (27th-21st centuries BC) and again in the period 1000-800 BC, followed by the absence of activity thereafter. From ancient sources it is known there existed a trading post at this location during the time of Rameses the Great for trade with Crete, but it had long been lost by the time of Alexander's arrival. A small Egyptian fishing village named Rhakotis (Egyptian:*Ra\u02c1-\u1e32\u0101\u1e6dit, written r\u02c1-\u1e33\u1e6dy.t, 'That which is built up') existed since the 13th century BC in the vicinity and eventually grew into the Egyptian quarter of the city. Just east of Alexandria (where Abu Qir Bay is now), there was in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of Canopus and Heracleion. The latter was recently rediscovered under water.\nAlexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in April 331 BC as \u1f08\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 (Alexandreia). Passing through Egypt, Alexander wanted to build a large Greek city on Egypt's coast that would bear his name. He chose the site of Alexandria, envisioning the building of a causeway to the nearby island of Pharos that would generate two great natural harbors. Alexandria was intended to supersede the older Greek colony of Naucratis as a Hellenistic center in Egypt, and to be the link between Greece and the rich Nile valley.  A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to the city during his life.\nAfter Alexander's departure, his viceroy Cleomenes continued the expansion. The architect Dinocrates of Rhodes designed the city, using a Hippodamian grid plan. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, his general Ptolemy Lagides took possession of Egypt and brought Alexander's body to Egypt with him. Ptolemy at first ruled from the old Egyptian capital of Memphis. In 322/321 BC he had Cleomenes executed. Finally, in 305 BC, Ptolemy declared himself Pharaoh as Ptolemy I Soter (\"Savior\") and moved his capital to Alexandria.\nAlthough Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's early development, the Heptastadion and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined Tyre and becoming the center of the new commerce between Europe and the Arabian and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than Carthage. In a century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with Greek people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nAlexandria was not only a center of Hellenism, but was also home to the largest urban Jewish community in the world. The Septuagint, a Greek version of the Tanakh, was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic center of learning (Library of Alexandria), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Jewish, and Egyptian. By the time of Augustus, the city walls encompassed an area of 5.34 km2, and the total population in Roman times was around 500\u2013600,000.According to Philo of Alexandria, in the year 38 of the Common era, disturbances erupted between Jews and Greek citizens of Alexandria during a visit paid by the Jewish king Agrippa I to Alexandria, principally over the respect paid by the Jewish nation to the Roman emperor, and which quickly escalated to open affronts and violence between the two ethnic groups and the desecration of Alexandrian synagogues. The violence was quelled after Caligula intervened and had the Roman governor, Flaccus, removed from the city.In AD 115, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the Kitos War, which gave Hadrian and his architect, Decriannus, an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215, the emperor Caracalla visited the city and, because of some insulting satires that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365, Alexandria was devastated by a tsunami (365 Crete earthquake), an event annually commemorated years later as a \"day of horror\".\n\n\n=== Islamic era ===\n\nIn 619, Alexandria fell to the Sassanid Persians. Although the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general 'Amr ibn al-'As invaded it during the Muslim conquest of Egypt, after a siege that lasted 14 months. The first Arab governor of Egypt recorded to have visited Alexandria was Utba ibn Abi Sufyan, who strengthened the Arab presence and built a governor's palace in the city in 664\u2013665.After the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517, the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under Ottoman rule until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of Rosetta during the 9th to 18th centuries, and only regained its former prominence with the construction of the Mahmoudiyah Canal in 1807.\nAlexandria figured prominently in the military operations of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernize the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.In July 1882, the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied.In July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the Lavon Affair. On 26 October 1954, Alexandria's Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on Gamal Abdel Nasser.Europeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 Suez Crisis that led to an outburst of Arab nationalism. The nationalization of property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly all the rest.\n\n\n=== Ibn Battuta in Alexandria ===\n\nIn reference to Alexandria, Egypt, Ibn Battuta speaks of great saints that resided here. One of them being Imam Borhan Oddin El Aaraj. He was said to have the power of working miracles. He told Ibn Battuta that he should go find his three brothers, Farid Oddin, who lived in India, Rokn Oddin Ibn Zakarya, who lived in Sindia, and Borhan Oddin, who lived in China. Battuta then made it his purpose to find these people and give them his compliments. Sheikh Yakut was another great man. He was the disciple of Sheikh Abu Abbas El Mursi, who was the disciple of Abu El Hasan El Shadali, who is known to be a servant of God. Abu Abbas was the author of the Hizb El Bahr and was famous for piety and miracles. Abu Abd Allah El Murshidi was a great interpreting saint that lived secluded in the Minyat of Ibn Murshed. He lived alone but was visited daily by emirs, viziers, and crowds that wished to eat with him. The Sultan of Egypt (El Malik El Nasir) visited him, as well. Ibn Battuta left Alexandria with the intent of visiting him.Ibn Battuta also visited the Pharos lighthouse on 2 occasions; in 1326 he found it to be partly in ruins and in 1349 it had deteriorated further, making entrance to the edifice impossible.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\nThe most important battles and sieges of Alexandria include:\n\nSiege of Alexandria (47 BC), Julius Caesar's civil war\nBattle of Alexandria (30 BC), final war of the Roman Republic\nSiege of Alexandria (619), Byzantine-Persian Wars\nSiege of Alexandria (641), Rashidun conquest of Byzantine Egypt\nAlexandrian Crusade (1365), a crusade led by Peter de Lusignan of Cyprus which resulted in the defeat of the Mamluks and the sack of the city.\nBattle of Alexandria (1801), Napoleonic Wars\nSiege of Alexandria (1801), Napoleonic Wars\nAlexandria expedition (1807), Napoleonic Wars\n\n\n== Ancient layout ==\nGreek Alexandria was divided into three regions:\nBrucheum\nBrucheum is the Royal or Greek quarter and forms the most magnificent portion of the city. In Roman times Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal;\nThe Jewish quarter\nThis quarter is the northeast portion of the city;\nRhakotis\nRhakotis is the old city that was absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians. (from Coptic Rakot\u0259 \"Alexandria\").Two main streets, lined with colonnades and said to have been each about 60 meters (200 ft) wide, intersected in the center of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his Mausoleum) rose. This point is very near the present mosque of Nebi Daniel; and the line of the great East\u2013West \"Canopic\" street, only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharia Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.\nAlexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a 1,260-metre-long (4,130 ft) mole and called the Heptastadion (\"seven stadia\"\u2014a stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180 metres or 590 feet). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the \"Moon Gate\" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern \"Ras al-Tin\" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.\nIn Strabo's time, (latter half of the 1st century BC) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbor.\n\nThe Royal Palaces, filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbor on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the \"Private Port,\" and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land subsidence here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.\nThe Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Julius Caesar as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the battle of Pharsalus\nThe Poseidon, or Temple of the Sea God, close to the theater\nThe Timonium built by Marc Antony\nThe Emporium (Exchange)\nThe Apostases (Magazines)\nThe Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole\nBehind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great obelisks, which become known as \"Cleopatra's Needles,\" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.\nThe Gymnasium and the Palaestra are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.\nThe Temple of Saturn; alexandria west.\nThe Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.\nThe Musaeum with its famous Library and theater in the same region; site unknown.\nThe Serapeum of Alexandria, the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells us that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near \"Pompey's Pillar,\" which was an independent monument erected to commemorate Diocletian's siege of the city.The names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, The Great Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, reputed to be 138 metres (453 feet) high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy (Ptolemy II Philadelphus) completed it, at a total cost of 800 talents. It took 12 years to complete and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the Great Pyramid of Giza. A temple of Hephaestus also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.\nIn the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens, according to a census dated from 32 CE, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 216,000 to 500,000 making it one of the largest cities ever built before the Industrial Revolution and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAlexandria is located in the country of Egypt, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlexandria has a borderline hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BWh), approaching a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). As the rest of Egypt's northern coast, the prevailing north wind, blowing across the Mediterranean, gives the city a less severe climate from the desert hinterland. Rafah and Alexandria are the wettest places in Egypt; the other wettest places are Rosetta, Baltim, Kafr el-Dawwar, and Mersa Matruh. The city's climate is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, moderating its temperatures, causing variable rainy winters and moderately hot and slightly prolonged summers that, at times, can be very humid; January and February are the coolest months, with daily maximum temperatures typically ranging from 12 to 18 \u00b0C (54 to 64 \u00b0F) and minimum temperatures that could reach 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F). temperature sometimes gets lower than 5 and it sometimes rains snow.\nAlexandria experiences violent storms, rain and sometimes sleet and hail during the cooler months; these events, combined with a poor drainage system, have been responsible for occasional flooding in the city in the past though they rarely occur anymore. July and August are the hottest and driest months of the year, with an average daily maximum temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual rainfall is around 200 mm (7.9 in) but has been as high as 417 mm (16.4 in)Port Said, Kosseir, Baltim, Damietta and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in Egypt.\nThe highest recorded temperature was 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) on 30 May 1961, and the coldest recorded temperature was 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1994.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDue to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour and the rest has been built over in modern times.\n\n\"Pompey's Pillar\", a Roman triumphal column, is one of the best-known ancient monuments still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient acropolis\u2014a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab cemetery\u2014and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its pedestal, it is 30 m (99 ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in diameter at the base, tapering to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) at the top. The shaft is 88 feet (27 m) high, and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is 132 cubic meters (4,662 cubic feet) and weight approximately 396 tons. Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient obelisks. The Romans had cranes but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several obelisk erecting experiments including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk. The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. \"Pompey's Pillar\" is a misnomer, as it has nothing to do with Pompey, having been erected in 293 for Diocletian, possibly in memory of the rebellion of Domitius Domitianus. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god Serapis were enacted, and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.\nAlexandria's catacombs, known as Kom El Shoqafa, are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large spiral staircase, and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other syncretic Romano-Egyptian religious symbols, burial niches, and sarcophagi, as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in 1900.The most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as Kom El Deka. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its Roman-era baths.\nPersistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local Archaeological Society, and by many individuals, notably Greeks proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.\nThe past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; D. G. Hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898\u20131899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.\n\nSince the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. Cleopatra VII's royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual subsidence in the 4th century AD. This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team. It raised a noted head of Caesarion. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy. The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman strata.\nThe most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.\nThe objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in Kom El Shoqafa (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).\nThe German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of Kom El Deka, which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.\nThe making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtlessly immense; but despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\".\n\n\n=== Temple of Taposiris Magna ===\nThe temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine Pharos Lighthouse.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, there are Muslim mosques. Coptic Christian churches are most common churches .There are also other Christian churches as:  Greek , Latin and Armenian . Orthodox Christian churches are most common but Catholic , Anglican and Evangelical churches are present. Also there is a Jewish synagogue\n\n\n=== Islam ===\n\nThe most famous mosque in Alexandria is Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque in Bahary. Other notable mosques in the city include Ali ibn Abi Talib mosque in Somouha, Bilal mosque, al-Gamaa al-Bahari in Mandara, Hatem mosque in Somouha, Hoda el-Islam mosque in Sidi Bishr, al-Mowasah mosque in Hadara, Sharq al-Madina mosque in Miami, al-Shohadaa mosque in Mostafa Kamel, Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque, Yehia mosque in Zizinia, Sidi Gaber mosque in Sidi Gaber, Sidi B esher mosque, Rokay el-Islam mosque in Elessway, Elsadaka Mosque in Sidibesher Qebly, Elshatbi mosque and Sultan mosque.\nAlexandria is the base of the Salafi movements in Egypt. Al-Nour Party, which is based in the city and overwhelmingly won most of the Salafi votes in the 2011\u201312 parliamentary election, supports the president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nAfter Rome and Constantinople, Alexandria was considered the third-most important seat of Christianity in the world. The Pope of Alexandria was second only to the bishop of Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire until 430. The Church of Alexandria had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, the Church of Alexandria was split between the Miaphysites and the Melkites. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. In the 19th century, Catholic and Protestant missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.\nToday, the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is Saint Mark Cathedral . The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include Pope Cyril I Church in Cleopatra, Saint Georges Church in Sporting, Saint Mark & Pope Peter I Church in Sidi Bishr, Saint Mary Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, Saint Mina Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and Saint Takla Haymanot's Church in Ibrahimeya.\nThe most important Eastern Orthodox churches in Alexandria are Agioi An\u00e1rgyroi Church, Church of the Annunciation, Saint Anthony Church, Archangels Gabriel & Michael Church, Taxiarchon Church, Saint Catherine Church, Cathedral of the Dormition in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, Prophet Elijah Church, Saint George Church, Saint Joseph Church in Fleming, Saint Joseph of Arimathea Church, Saint Mark & Saint Nektarios Chapel in Ramleh, Saint Nicholas Church, Saint Paraskevi Church, Saint Sava Cathedral in Ramleh, Saint Theodore Chapel and the Russian church of Saint Alexander Nevsky in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.\nThe Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said has jurisdiction over all Latin Church Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the Jesuits in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan, which uses the Byzantine Rite, and the nominal see of the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia, using the Armenian Rite.\nThe Saint Mark Church in Shatby, founded as part of Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, Coptic Catholic and Coptic Orthodox rites.\nIn antiquity, Alexandria was a major center of the cosmopolitan religious movement called Gnosticism (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\n\nAlexandria's once-flourishing Jewish community declined rapidly following the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, after which negative reactions towards Zionism among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt fled to the newly established Israel, France, Brazil and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50. The most important synagogue in Alexandria is the Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nAlexandria has a number of higher education institutions. Alexandria University is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its Faculty of Medicine & Faculty of Engineering. In addition, the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology in New Borg El Arab city is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010.  The Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC American University in Cairo because of its worldwide recognition from board of engineers at UK & ABET in US. Universit\u00e9 Senghor is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly recruits students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT) and Pharos University in Alexandria.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\nAlexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by Catholic missionaries include Coll\u00e8ge de la M\u00e8re de Dieu, Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Sion, Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Ecoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), \u00c9cole Girard, \u00c9cole Saint Gabriel, \u00c9cole Saint-Vincent de Paul, \u00c9cole Saint Joseph, \u00c9cole Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lyc\u00e9e el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently a public school run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais d'Alexandrie (\u00c9cole Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the Istituto \"Don Bosco\".\nEnglish schools in Alexandria are becoming the most popular. English-language schools in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, British School of Alexandria, Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Egyptian English Language School,  Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, Schutz American School, Victoria College, El Manar Language School for Girls (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and El Nasr Girls' College.\nThere are only two German schools in Alexandria which are Deutsche Schule der Borrom\u00e4rinnen (DSB of Saint Charles Borrom\u00e9) and Neue Deutsche Schule Alexandria, which is run by Frau Sally Hammam.\nThe Montessori educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at Alexandria Montessori.\nThe most notable public schools in Alexandria include El Abbassia High School and Gamal Abdel Nasser High School.\n\n\n=== Women ===\nCirca the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to the same percentage in Cairo. As a result, specialist women's publications like al-Fat\u0101h by Hind Nawal, the country's first women's' journal, appeared.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city's principal airport is currently Borg El Arab Airport, which is located about 25 km (16 mi) away from the city center.\nFrom late 2011, El Nouzha Airport (Alexandria International Airport) was to be closed to commercial operations for two years as it underwent expansion, with all airlines operating out of Borg El Arab Airport from then onwards, where a brand new terminal was completed there in February 2010. In 2017, the government announced that Alexandria International Airport will shut down permanently for operational reasons.\n\n\n=== Port ===\n\nAlexandria has four ports; namely the Western Port also known as(Alexandria Port), which is the main port of the country that handles about 60% of the country's exports and imports, Dekhela Port west of the Western Port, the Eastern Port which is a yachting harbor, and Abu Qir Port at the northern east of the governorate. It is a commercial port for general cargo and phosphates.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nInternational Coastal Road (Mersa Matruh \u2013 Alexandria \u2013 Port Said)\nCairo\u2013Alexandria Desert Road (Alexandria \u2013 Cairo \u2013 220 km (137 mi), 6\u20138 lanes)\nCairo-Alexandria Agriculture Road (Alexandria \u2013 Cairo)\nMehwar El Ta'meer \u2013 (Alexandria \u2013 Borg El Arab)\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAlexandria's intracity commuter rail system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity railway station) to Abu Qir, parallel to the tram line. The commuter line's locomotives operate on diesel, as opposed to the overhead-electric tram.\nAlexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned Misr Station (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and Sidi Gaber railway station (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the center of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by Egyptian National Railways.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nAn extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the El Raml district in the west and ends in the Victoria district in the east. Most of the vehicles are blue in color. Some smaller yellow-colored vehicles have further routes beyond the two main endpoints. The tram routes have one of four numbers: 1, 2, 5, and 6. All four start at El Raml, but only two (1 and 2) reach Victoria. There are two converging and diverging points. The first starts at Bolkly (Isis) and ends at San Stefano. The other begins at Sporting and ends at Mostafa Kamel. Route 5 starts at San Stefano and takes the inner route to Bolkly. Route 6 starts at Sidi Gaber El Sheikh in the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 1 takes the inner route between San Stefano and Bolkly and the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 2 takes the route opposite to Route 1 in both these areas. The tram fares are 50 piastres (0.50 pounds), and 100 piastres (1.00 pounds) for the middle car. Some trams (that date back the 30s) charge a pound. The tram is considered the cheapest method of public transport. A caf\u00e9 operates in the second floor of the first car of tram 1 (a women-only car) which costs 5 L.E per person, also offering a WiFi service. A luxury light blue tram car operates from San Stefano to Ras El Tin, with free WiFi and movies and songs played inside for 5 L.E per ticket.\nStations:\n\nRoute 2 serves:\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nConstruction of the Alexandria Metro is due to begin in 2020 at a cost of $1.05 billion.\n\n\n=== Taxis and minibuses ===\n\nTaxis in Alexandria sport a yellow-and-black livery and are widely available. While Egyptian law requires all cabs to carry meters, these generally do not work and fares must be negotiated with the driver on either departure or arrival.\n\nThe minibus share taxi system, or mashr\u016b' operates along well-known traffic arteries. The routes can be identified by both their endpoints and the route between them:\n\nCorniche routes:\nEl Mandara \u2013 Bahari\nEl Mandara \u2013 El Mansheya\nAsafra \u2013 Bahari\nAsafra \u2013 El Mansheya\nEl Sa'aa \u2013 El Mansheya\nAbu Qir routes:\nEl Mandara \u2013 El Mahata (lit. \"the Station\", i.e. Misr Railway Station)\nAbu Qir \u2013 El Mahata\nVictoria \u2013 El Mahata\nEl Mandara \u2013 Victoria\nInterior routes:\nCabo \u2013 Bahari\nEl Mansheya \u2013 El Awayid\nEl Mansheya \u2013 El Maw'af El Gedid (the New Bus Station)\nHadara \u2013 El MahataThe route is generally written in Arabic on the side of the vehicle, although some drivers change their route without changing the paint. Some drivers also drive only a segment of a route rather than the whole path; such drivers generally stop at a point known as a major hub of the transportation system (for example, Victoria) to allow riders to transfer to another car or to another mode of transport.\nFare is generally L.E. 3.00 to travel the whole route. Shorter trips may have a lower fare, depending on the driver and the length of the trip.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe Royal Library of Alexandria, in Alexandria, Egypt, was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of Ptolemy II of Egypt. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the Muses\u2014the Museion, Greek \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03bd (from which the Modern English word museum is derived).\nIt has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.The Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002, near the site of the old Library.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Alexandria National Museum was inaugurated 31 December 2003. It is located in a restored Italian style palace in Tariq El Horreya Street (formerly Rue Fouad), near the center of the city. It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and Egypt. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria. Construction on the site was first undertaken in 1926.\nCavafy Museum\nThe Graeco-Roman Museum\nThe Museum of Fine Arts\nThe Royal Jewelry Museum\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nAlexandria Opera House, where classical music, Arabic music, ballet, and opera are performed and bearm basha theatre in elshatby.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThroughout Alexandria, there is art that resembles some of the oldest architectural styles of the Hellenic city, and its ancient decorations, especially in the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, is based on reviving the ancient Library of Alexandria. The Kom el shoqafa Catacombs are considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages and date back to the 2nd century. The remnants of Pompey's Pillar still remain today. This single pillar represents the elaborate temple which once stood in Alexandria. It remains at the site of the Serapeum, Alexandria's acropolis. The Serapeum, which stood for ancient tradition, conflicted with the rise of Christianity. It is a large tourist destination, today. the Roman Amphitheatre of Alexandria is another popular destination. Here, there remains a stage with around seven hundred to eight hundred seats. They also have numerous galleries of statues and details leftover form this time. Alexandria's tourism office announced plans to reserve some beaches for tourists in July 2018.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe main sport that interests Alexandrians is football, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. Alexandria Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Alexandria, Egypt. It is currently used mostly for football matches, and was used for the 2006 African Cup of Nations. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the African Cup of Nations in January 2006, which Egypt won. Sea sports such as surfing, jet-skiing and water polo are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the Alexandria Sporting Club, which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the country's national team with key players. The city hosted the AfroBasket, the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).\nAlexandria has four stadiums:\n\nOther less popular sports like tennis and squash are usually played in private social and sports clubs, like:\n\nStarted in 2011, Cross Egypt Challenge is an international cross-country motorcycle and scooter rally conducted throughout the most difficult tracks and roads of Egypt. Alexandria is known as the yearly starting point of Cross Egypt Challenge and a huge celebration is conducted the night before the rally starts after all the international participants arrive to the city.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nAlexandria is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nA.

        "wiki": "Christian Dior SE (French: [k\u0281istj\u0251\u0303 dj\u0254\u0281]), commonly known as Dior, is a French luxury goods company controlled and chaired by French businessman Bernard Arnault, who also heads LVMH, the world's largest luxury group. Dior itself holds 42.36% shares of and 59.01% voting rights within LVMH. Pietro Beccari has been the CEO since 2017.The company was founded in 1946 by designer Christian Dior. It currently designs and retails leather goods, fashion accessories, footwear, jewelry, timepieces, fragrance, makeup, and skin care products, while also maintaining its tradition as a creator of haute-couture under the Christian Dior Couture division. The Christian Dior label remains largely for women's offerings, although the company also operates the Dior Homme division for men and the baby Dior label for children's wear. Products are sold throughout its portfolio of retail stores worldwide, as well as through its online store.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nThe House of Dior was established on 16 December 1946 in \"a private house\" at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris. However, the current Dior corporation celebrates \"1947\" as the opening year. Dior was financially backed by wealthy businessman Marcel Boussac. Boussac had originally invited Dior to design for Philippe et Gaston, but Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand. The new couture house became a part of \"a vertically integrated textile business\" already operated by Boussac. Its capital was at FFr 6 million and workforce at 80 employees. The company was really a vanity project for Boussac and was a \"majorly owned affiliate of Boussac Saint-Freres S.A. Nevertheless, Dior was allowed a then-unusual great part in his namesake label (legal leadership, a non-controlling stake in the firm, and one-third of pretax profits) despite Boussac's reputation as a \"control freak\". Dior's creativity also negotiated him a good salary.\n\n\n=== \"New Look\" ===\n\nOn 12 February 1947, Christian Dior launched his first fashion collection for Spring\u2013Summer 1947. The show of \"90 models of his first collection on six mannequins\" was presented in the salons of the company's headquarters at 30 Avenue Montaigne. Originally, the two lines were named \"Corolle\" and \"Huit\". However, the new collection went down in fashion history as the \"New Look\" after the editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar Carmel Snow exclaimed, \"It's such a new look!\" The New Look was a revolutionary era for women at the end of the 1940s. When the collection was presented, the editor in chief also showed appreciation by saying; \"It\u2019s quite a revolution, dear Christian!\"  The debut collection of Christian Dior is credited with having revived the fashion industry of France. Along with that, the New Look brought back the spirit of haute couture in France as it was considered glamorous and young-looking. \"We were witness to a revolution in fashion and to a revolution in showing fashion as well.\"\nThe silhouette was characterised by a small, nipped-in waist and a full skirt falling below mid-calf length, which emphasised the bust and hips, as epitomized by the 'Bar' suit from the first collection. The collection overall showcased more stereotypically feminine designs in contrast to the popular fashions of wartime, with full skirts, tight waists, and soft shoulders. Dior retained some of the masculine aspects as they continued to hold popularity through the early 1940s, but he also wanted to include more feminine style.The New Look became extremely popular, its full-skirted silhouette influencing other fashion designers well into the 1950s, and Dior gained a number of prominent clients from Hollywood, the United States, and the European aristocracy. As a result, Paris, which had fallen from its position as the capital of the fashion world after WWII, regained its preeminence. The New Look was welcomed in western Europe as a refreshing antidote to the austerity of wartime and de-feminizing uniforms, and was embraced by stylish women such as Princess Margaret in the UK. According to Harold Koda, Dior credited Charles James with inspiring The New Look. Dior's designs from the \"New Look\" did not only affect the designers in the 1950s, but also more recent designers in the 2000s, including Thom Browne, Miuccia Prada, and Vivienne Westwood. Dior's evening dresses from that time are still referred to by many designers, and they have been seen in different wedding themed catwalks with multiple layers of fabric building up below the small waist (Jojo, 2011). Examples include Vivienne Westwood's Ready-to-Wear Fall/Winter 2011 and Alexander McQueen's Ready to Wear Fall/Winter 2011 (Jojo, 2011).Not everyone was pleased with the New Look, however. Some considered the amount of material to be wasteful, especially after years of cloth rationing. Feminists in particular were outraged, feeling that these corseted designs were restrictive and regressive, and that they took away a woman's independence. There were several protest groups against the designs including, the League of Broke Husbands, made up of 30,000 men who were against the costs associated with the amount of fabric needed for such designs. Fellow designer Coco Chanel remarked, \"Only a man who never was intimate with a woman could design something that uncomfortable.\" Despite such protests, the New Look was highly influential, continuing to inform the work of other designers and fashion well into the 21st century. For the 60th anniversary of the New Look in 2007, John Galliano revisited it for his Spring-Summer collection for Dior. Galliano used the wasp waist and rounded shoulders, modernised and updated with references to origami and other Japanese influences. In 2012 Raf Simons revisited the New Look for his debut haute couture collection for Dior, wishing to update its ideas for the 21st century in a minimalist but also sensual and sexy manner. Simons's work for Dior retained the luxurious fabrics and silhouette, but encouraged self-respect for the woman's body and liberation of expression. The design process for this collection, which was produced in only eight weeks, is documented in Dior and I, presenting Simons's use of technology and modernist re-interpretations.\n\n\n=== Dior ===\n\nAvailable references contradict themselves whether Christian Dior Parfums was established in 1947 or 1948. The Dior corporation itself lists the founding of Christian Dior Parfums as 1947, with the launch of its first perfume, Miss Dior. Dior revolutionized the perfumery industry with the launch of the highly popular Miss Dior parfum, which was named after Catherine Dior (Christian Dior's sister). Christian Dior Ltd owned 25%, manager of Coty perfumes held 35%, and Boussac owned 40% of the perfume business, headed by Serge Heftler Louiche. Pierre Cardin was made head of the Dior workshop from 1947 until 1950. In 1948, a New York City Christian Dior Parfums branch was established\u2014this could be the cause of establishment-date issue. The modern Dior corporation also notes that \"a luxury ready-to-wear house is established in New York at the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th Street, the first of its kind,\" in 1948. In 1949, the \"Diorama\" perfume is released and by 1949, the New Look line alone made a profit FFr 12.7 million.\n\n\n=== Expansion, and death of Dior ===\n\nExpansion from France began by the end of 1949 with the opening of a Christian Dior boutique in New York City. By the end of the year, Dior fashions made up 75% of Paris's fashion exports and 5% of France's total export revenue.In 1949, Douglas Cox from Melbourne, Australia, travelled to Paris to meet with Christian Dior to discuss the possibility of having Dior pieces made for the Australian market. Christian Dior and Douglas Cox signed a contract for Dior to produce original designs and for Douglas Cox to create them in his Flinders Lane workshop. A young Jill Walker, still in her mid teens, was one of the many workers for Douglas Cox, a couture label now in the headlines in Australian newspapers almost daily. Jill would go onto forming a couture legacy in Melbourne with popular labels such as Jinoel and Marti with husband Noel Kemelfield. The agreement between Dior and Douglas Cox really put Australian dressmaking on the global stage, yet ultimately the 60 Dior models proved to be too avant-garde for the conservative Australian taste. Douglas Cox was unable to continue the contract beyond the single 1949 season making these Dior-Cox couture pieces some of the most rare collectors items in Australian couture.In 1950, Jacques Rou\u00ebt, the general manager of Dior Ltd, devised a licensing program to place the now-renowned name of \"Christian Dior\" visibly on a variety of luxury goods. It was placed first on neckties and soon was applied to hosiery, furs, hats, gloves, handbags, jewelry, lingerie, and scarves. Members of the French Chamber of Couture denounced it as a degrading action for the haute-couture image. Nevertheless, licensing became a profitable move and began a trend to continue \"for decades to come\", which all couture houses followed.Also in 1950, Christian Dior was the exclusive designer of Marlene Dietrich's dresses in the Alfred Hitchcock film Stage Fright. In 1951, Dior released his first book, Je Suis Couturier (I am a Couturier) through publishers Editions du Conquistador. Despite the company's strong European following, more than half of its revenue was generated in the United States by this time. Christian Dior Models Limited was created in London in 1952. An agreement was made between the Sydney label House of Youth for Christian Dior New York models. Los Gobelinos in Santiago, Chile, made an agreement with Dior for Christian Dior Paris Haute Couture. The first Dior shoe line was launched in 1953 with the aid of Roger Vivier. The company operated firmly established locations in Mexico, Cuba, Canada, and Italy by the end of 1953. As popularity of Dior goods grew, so did counterfeiting. This illegal business was supported by women who could not afford the luxury goods.\nBy the mid-1950s, the House of Dior operated a well-respected fashion empire. The first Dior boutique was established in 1954 at 9 Counduit Street. In honour of Princess Margaret and the Duchess of Marlborough, a Dior fashion show was held at the Blemhein Palace in 1954 as well. Christian Dior launched more highly successful fashion lines between the years of 1954 and 1957. However, none came as close to the profound effect of the New Look. Dior opened the Grande Boutique on the corner between Avenue Montaigne and Rue Fran\u00e7ois Ier in 1955. The first Dior lipstick was also released in 1955. 100,000 garments had been sold by the time of the company's 10th anniversary in 1956. Actress Ava Gardner had 14 dresses created for her in 1956 by Christian Dior for the Mark Robson film The Little Hut.\nChristian Dior appeared on the cover of TIME dated 4 March 1957. The designer soon afterwards died from a third heart attack on 24 October 1957. The captivating impact of Dior's creative fashion genius earned him recognition as one of history's greatest fashion figures. Kevin Almond for Contemporary Fashion wrote that \"by the time Dior died his name had become synonymous with taste and luxury.\"\n\n\n=== Dior without Christian Dior: 1957 through the 1970s ===\nThe death of the head designer left the House of Dior in chaos, and general manager Jacques Rou\u00ebt considered shutting down operation worldwide. This possibility was not received graciously by Dior licensees and the French fashion industry; the Maison Dior was too important to the financial stability of the industry to allow such an action. To bring the label back on its feet, Rou\u00ebt promoted the 21-year-old Yves Saint-Laurent to Artistic Director the same year. Laurent had joined the House's family in 1955 after being picked out by the original designer himself for the position of the first ever and only Head Assistant. Laurent initially proved to have been the most appropriate choice after the debut of his first collection for Dior (the mention of Dior from this moment on refers to the company) in 1958. The clothes were as meticulously made and perfectly proportioned as Dior's in the same exquisite fabrics, but their young designer made them softer, lighter and easier to wear. Saint Laurent was hailed as a national hero. Emboldened by his success, his designs became more daring, culminating in the 1960 Beat Look inspired by the existentialists in the Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e8s caf\u00e9s and jazz clubs. His 1960 bohemian look was harshly criticized, and even more in Women's Wear Daily. Marcel Boussac was furious, and in the spring, when Saint Laurent was called up to join the French army\u2014which forced him to leave the House of Dior\u2014the Dior management raised no objection. Saint-Laurent left after the completion of six Dior collections.\n\nLaurent was replaced at Dior by designer Marc Bohan in late 1960. Bohan instilled his conservative style on the collections. He was credited by Rebecca Arnold as the man who kept the Dior label \"at the forefront of fashion while still producing wearable, elegant clothes,\" and Women's Wear Daily, not surprisingly, claimed that he \"rescued the firm.\" Bohan's designs were very well esteemed by prominent social figures. Actress Elizabeth Taylor ordered twelve Dior dresses from Bohan's Spring-Summer 1961 collection featuring the \"Slim Look\". The Dior perfume \"Diorling\" was released in 1963 and the men's fragrance \"Eau Sauvage\" was released in 1966. Bohan's assistant Philippe Guibourg\u00e9 launches the first French ready-to-wear collection \"Miss Dior\" in 1967. This is not to be confused with the already existing New York Ready-to-Wear store established in 1948. Designed by Bohan, \"Baby Dior\" opens its first boutique in 1967 at 28 Avenue Montaigne. The Christian Dior Coordinated Knit line is released in 1968 and management of the Fashion Furs Department of Christian Dior is taken by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Castet. This year as well, Dior Parfums was sold to Mo\u00ebt-Hennessy (which would itself become LVMH) due to Boussac's ailing textile company (the still-owner of Dior). This, however, had no effect on the House of Dior operations, and so the Christian Dior Cosmetics business was born in 1969 with the creation of an exclusive line.\nFollowing this, Bohan launched the first Christian Dior Homme clothing line in 1970. A new Dior boutique at Parly II was decorated by Gae Aulenti and the \"Diorella\" perfume was released in 1972. Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fur Collection was created in France in 1973, and then manufactured under license in the United States, Canada, and Japan. The first Dior watch \"Black Moon\" was released in 1975 in collaboration with licensee Benedom. Dior haute-couture graced the bodies of Princess Grace of Monaco, Nicaraguan First Lady Hope Portocarrero, Princess Alexandria of Yugoslavia, and Lady Pamela Hicks (Lord Mountbatten of Burma's younger daughter) for the wedding of The Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer. In 1978, the Boussac Group filed for bankruptcy and so its assets (including those of Christian Dior) were purchased by the Willot Group under the permission of the Paris Trade Court. The perfume \"Dioressence\" was released in 1979.\n\n\n=== Arrival of businessman Arnault ===\n\nIn 1980, Dior released the men's fragrance \"Jules\". After the Willot Group went into bankruptcy in 1981, Bernard Arnault and his investment group purchased it for \"one symbolic franc\" in December 1984. The Dior perfume \"Poison\" was launched in 1985. That same year, Arnault became chairman, chief executive officer, and managing director of the company. On assuming leadership, Arnault did away with the company's mediocre textile operations, to focus on the Bon March\u00e9 department store and Christian Dior Couture. Operations for Christian Dior drastically changed for the better under Arnault. He repositioned it as the holding company Christian Dior S.A. of the Dior Couture fashion business. On the 40th anniversary of Dior's first collection, the Paris Fashion Museum dedicated an exhibition to Christian Dior. In 1988, Arnault's Christian Dior S.A.'s took a 32% equity stake into the share capital of Mo\u00ebt-Hennessy \u2022 Louis Vuitton through its subsidiary Jacques Rober, creating what would become one of the leading and most influential luxury goods companies in the world. Under this milestone merger, the operations of Christian Dior Couture and Christian Dior Parfums were once again united. Italian-born Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9 replaced Bohan as head designer in 1989. The first such non-Frenchman, Ferr\u00e9 left behind traditional Dior associations of flirtation and romance, and introduced concepts and a style described as \"refined, sober and strict.\" Ferr\u00e9 headed design for Haute Couture, Haute Fourrure, Women's Ready-to-Wear, Ready-to-Wear Furs and Women's Accessories collections. His first collection was awarded the D\u00e9 d'Or in 1989. That year, a boutique was opened in Hawaii and the LVMH stake by Jacques Rober rose to 44%.Further Dior boutiques were opened in 1990 in upscale New York City, Los Angeles, and Tokyo shopping districts. The stake in LVMH rose again, to 46%. Another collection of watches named \"Bagheera\" \u2013 inspired by the round design of the \"Black Moon\" watches \u2013 was also released in 1990. Having fired the company's managing executive Beatrice Bongbault in December 1990, Arnault took up that position until September 1991, when he placed former Bon March\u00e9 president Phillipe Vindry at the post. In 1991, Christian Dior was listed on the spot market and then on the Paris Stock Exchange's monthly settlement market, and the perfume \"Dune\" was launched. Vindry dropped ready-to-wear prices by 10%. Still, a wool suit from Dior would come with a price label of USD 1,500. 1990 revenue for Dior was USD 129.3 million, with a net income of $22 million. Dior was now reorganized into three categories: 1) women's ready-to-wear, lingerie, and children's wear 2) accessories and jewelry 3) menswear. Licensees and franchised boutiques were starting to be reduced, to increase the company's control over brand product. Licensing was in fact reduced by nearly half because Arnault and Vindry opted \"for quality and exclusivity over quantity and accessibility.\" Wholly company-owned boutiques now opened in Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Cannes, and Waikiki, adding to its core stores located in New York City, Hawaii, Paris and Geneva. This held a potential to increase direct sales and profit margins while maintaining high-profile locations.\" In 1992, Dior Homme was placed under the artistic direction of Patrick Lavoix, and the \"Miss Dior\" perfume was relaunched. Francois Baufume succeeded Vindry in 1993 and continued to reduce licenses of the Dior name.\n\nThe production of Dior Haute Couture was spun off into a subsidiary named Christian Dior Couture in 1995. Also, the \"La Parisienne\" watch model was released \u2013 embodied in the watch \"Parisian Chic\". By that year, revenue for the label rose to USD 177 million, with a net income of USD 26.9 million. Under the influence of Anna Wintour, editor and chief of Vogue, CEO Arnault appointed British designer John Galliano to replace Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9 in 1997 (Galliano on CBS News: \"without Anna Wintour I would certainly not be at the house of Dior\"). This choice of a British designer, once again instead of a French one, is said to have \"ruffled some French feathers\". Arnault himself stated that he \"would have preferred a Frenchman\", but that \"talent has no nationality\". He even compared Galliano to Christian Dior himself, noting that \"Galliano has a creative talent very close to that of Christian Dior. He has the same extraordinary mixture of romanticism, feminism, and modernity that symbolised Monsieur Dior. In all of his creations \u2013 his suits, his dresses \u2013 one finds similarities to the Dior style.\" Galliano sparked further interest in Dior with somewhat controversial fashion shows, such as \"Homeless Show\" (models dressed in newspapers and paper bags) or \"S&M Show\". Meanwhile, Dior licenses were being reduced further by new president and CEO Sidney Toledano. On 15 October 1997, the Dior headquarters store on Avenue Montaigne was reopened \u2013it had been closed and remodeled by Peter Marino \u2013 in a celebrity-studded event including Nicole Kidman, Demi Moore and Jacques Chirac. That year, Christian Dior Couture also took over all thirteen boutique franchises from Japan's Kanebo.In May 1998, another Dior boutique was opened in Paris. This time the store opened its doors on the Left Bank, Place Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. Also this year, Victoire de Castellane became lead designer of Dior Fine Jewellery and the first Dior Fine Jewellery boutique opened in New York City. Paris itself would witness the opening of the first Parisian Dior Fine Jewellery boutique the following year, at 28 Avenue Montaigne. The perfume \"J'adore\" was released in 1999, and on 5 October 1999, Galliano released the Dior Spring-Summer 2000 ready-to-wear fashion show, debuting the new Saddle bag. In the same year, Dior's long watch partner Benedom joined the LVMH group. In 2000, Galliano's leadership was extended to Ready to wear, accessories, advertising and communications. The first campaign under his leadership was photographed by Nick Knight and featured two women simulating intercourse.\nWhile other brands in the late 1990s, notably Gucci, had resorted to porn chic as a mean to draw attention, Dior ads had such an impact that porn chic became a trend in most fashion ads. Galliano ignited the escalation of porno chic advertisements, which culminated with Ungaro's zoophilic ads, shot by Mario Sorrenti, and Gucci's ads, which featured a model with pubic hair shaped like the signature Gucci logo. As a matter of fact, it is considered that Galliano had revolutionized Dior more through his advertising campaigns than through his designs.On 17 July 2000, Dior Homme lead designer Patrick Lavoix was replaced by Hedi Slimane. Notable Dior releases that year were watches such as the distinctive \"Malice\", which features bracelets made of \"CD\" links, as well as the \"Riva\". Hedi left Dior Homme in 2007 and replaced by Kris Van Assche.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001, the Dior Homme boutique on 30 Avenue Montaigne reopened with a new \"contemporary masculine concept\" instilled by its designer Hedi Slimane. Slimane used this concept in the creation of his first Dior Homme collection. Soon, Dior Homme gained prominent male clientele including Brad Pitt and Mick Jagger.John Galliano then began to release his own Dior watches in 2001, beginning with the \"Chris 47 Aluminum\" line, marking a new era in Dior watch design. Next, the \"Malice\" and \"Riva\" watches were redesigned with precious stones to create the \"Malice Sparkling\" and \"Riva Sparkling\" spin-off collections. Inspired by the Spring-Summer 2002 Ready-to-Wear collection, Dior released the \"Dior 66\" watch, breaking many feminine traditional expectations in design.\n\nThe men's fragrance \"Higher\" was released in 2001, followed by the perfume \"Addict\" in 2002. The company then opened Milan's first Dior Homme boutique on 20 February 2002. By 2002, 130 locations were in full operation. On 3 June 2002, Slimane was presented with the \"International Designer of the Year\" award by the CFDA. Until 2002, Kanebo was the Christian Dior ready-to-wear license holder in Japan and, when the license expired, Christian Dior was able to profitable directly sell its ready-to-wear and accessories in its own boutiques. The \"Chris 47 Steel\" watch was released in 2003 as a cousin of the original \"Chris 47 Aluminum\". Bernard Arnault, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mercier-Arnault, and Sidney Toledano witnessed the opening of the Dior flagship boutique in the Omotesand\u014d district of Tokyo on 7 December 2003. The second Dior flagship store was opened in the upscale Ginza shopping district of Tokyo in 2004. An exclusive Dior Homme boutique was opened also that year in Paris on Rue Royale, and it presented the entire Dior Homme collection. A second Dior Fine Jewelry boutique in Paris was opened at 8 Place Vend\u00f4me. A Christian Dior boutique was opened in Moscow after the company took control of licensed operations of its Moscow agent.The designer of Dior Fine Jewelry Victoire de Castellane launched her own watch named \"Le D de Dior\" (French: \"The D of Dior\"). signifying the entrance of Dior watches into its collection of fine Jewelry. This watch was designed for women but made use of many design features which are typically thought of as masculine. Slimane next released a watch for the Dior Homme collection called \"Chiffre Rouge.\" This special watch included the signature look of Dior Homme: \"Watch design and technology match each other inseparably, to create the perfect expression of Dior Homme\u2019s artistic excellence and to increase the watchmaking legitimacy of Dior timepieces.\" De Castellane then launched her second line of watches called \"La Baby de Dior\". The design for this line was meant to be more feminine with more of a \"jewelry look.\"\n\nThe \"Miss Dior Ch\u00e9rie\" perfume and the \"Dior Homme\" fragrance were released in 2005. Galliano released his \"Dior Christal\" watches in which he combined steel and blue sapphires to create a \"creative and innovative collection.\" Christian Dior S.A. then celebrated the 13th anniversary of Dior Watches in 2005, and, in April of that year, its \"Chiffre Rouge\" collection was recognized by the World Watches and Jewelry Show in Basel, Switzerland. Also in the year, the fashion house also celebrated the 100th anniversary of the birthday of designer Christian Dior. An exhibition, \"Christian Dior: Man of the Century,\" was held in the Dior Museum in Granville, Normandy.\nIn 2006, the Dior watch booth was dedicated to the Dior Canework. This pattern was made by designer Christian Dior and based on the Napoleon III chairs used in his fashion shows.\nIn 2007, Kris Van Assche was appointed as the new artistic director of Dior Homme. Van Assche presented his first collection later that year. The 60th Anniversary of the founding of the Maison Dior was officially celebrated in 2007 as well.By February 2011, the House of Dior was in scandal after accusations of John Galliano making anti-Semitic remarks made international headlines: the company found itself in a \"public relations nightmare.\" Galliano was fired in March and the scheduled presentation of his Fall-Winter 2011/2012 ready-to-wear collection went ahead without him, amid the controversy, on 4 March. Before the start of the show, chief executive Sydney Toledano gave a sentimental speech on the values of Christian Dior and alluded to the family's ties to the Holocaust. The show closed with the staff of the atelier coming out to accept applause in the absence of their artistic director. (The previous January 2011 presentation of Spring-Summer 2011 haute-couture was the last appearance of Galliano on the Dior runway.) The company went on ahead and appointed Bill Gaytten as head designer interim in absence of artistic director. Gaytten had worked under Galliano for Dior and for the John Galliano label. The first haute-couture collection (for the Fall-Winter 2011 season) under Gaytten's management was presented in July and was received with mainly negative reviews. Meanwhile, speculation remained for months as it was unknown who would be selected to replace Galliano. During its 13-month period of having no artistic director, Dior began undergoing subtle changes in its designs as the influence of the theatrical and flamboyant Galliano faded. The all-new resigned dior.com was launched in late 2011.\n\nOn 23 January 2012, Gaytten presented his second haute-couture collection (for the Spring-Summer 2012 season) for Dior and it was much better received than his first collection.Belgian designer Raf Simons was announced, on 11 April 2012, as the new artistic director of Christian Dior. Simons was known for his minimalist designs, and this contrasted against the dramatic previous designs of Dior under Galliano. Furthermore, Simons was seen to have emerged as a \"dark horse\" amid the names of other designers who were considered high contenders. To emphasize the appropriate choice of Simons as the right designer, the company ostentatiously made comparisons between Simons and the original designer Christian Dior. Reportedly, Bernard Arnault and fellow executives at Dior and LVMH were keen to move Dior from the Galliano years. Simons spent much time in the Dior archives and familiarizing himself with haute-couture (as he had no previous background in that niche of fashion). Simons was then scheduled to debut his designs in July. Meanwhile, Gaytten's Spring-Summer 2012 haute-couture collection was presented as the first Dior haute-couture show ever to be held in China on 14 April in Shanghai; and it was a mark of the company's devotion to its presence in the Chinese market.\n\nThe show was the last presentation by Gaytten for Dior, and he remained as head designer for the John Galliano label.On 3 May, the Dior: Secret Garden \u2013 Versailles promotional film was launched. \nIt was highly buzzed about throughout various industry and social media sources as it was a display of Dior through its transition. Simons presented his first ever collection for the company \u2013 the Fall-Winter 2012 haute-couture collection \u2013 on 2 July. A major highlight of the fall-winter 2012 haute-couture shows, the collection was called by the company as \"the new couture\" and made reference to the start of a new Dior through the work of Simons \"wiping the [haute couture] slate clean and starting again from scratch.\" The designer's collection \"made more references to Mr Dior than to the house of Dior\" with pieces harkening back to themes Dior's post-WWII designs introduced to fashion. Simons, who rarely makes himself available for interviews, gave an interview published by the company through its Dior Mag online feature. While previous runway presentations under Galliano were held at the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Simons' show was held at a private residence, near the Arc de Triomphe, with the address only disclosed to select top-clients, celebrities, journalists, and other personnel exclusively invited in a discreet affair. High-profile figures in attendance included designers Azzedine Ala\u00efa, Pierre Cardin, Alber Elbaz (Lanvin designer), Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg, Marc Jacobs, Christopher Kane, Olivier Theyskens, Riccardo Tisci, Donatella Versace; and Princess Charlene of Monaco, actresses Marion Cotillard, M\u00e9lanie Laurent, Jennifer Lawrence, Sharon Stone; film producer Harvey Weinstein; and Dior chairman Arnault with his daughter. Live satellite feed of the show was provided on DiorMag online and Twitter was also implemented for real time communication. By then, it was also known that the company had purchased the Parisian embroidery firm Maison Vermont sometime earlier in 2012.In March 2015 it was announced that Rihanna was chosen as the official spokeswoman for Dior; this makes her the first black woman to take the spokeswoman position at Dior. In 2015, Israeli model Sofia Mechetner was chosen to be the new face of Dior.In 2016, Maria Grazia Chiuri was named the women's artistic director for Dior.In April 2016 a new Dior flagship boutique opened in San Francisco, with a party hosted by Jaime King.In 2017, Dior renovated and expanded its Madrid store. The brand celebrated the opening of the new boutique in a masked ball attended by a number of Spanish celebrities like Alejandro G\u00f3mez Palomo.In March 2018, Kim Jones was named the men's artistic director for the house. Under his management Dior has made several high profile streetwear collaborations. Jones first show for Dior featured American artist and designer Brian Donnelly aka KAWS. Thereafter followed collaborations with Raymond Pettibon, 1017 ALYX 9SM, Yoon Ahn, Hajime Sorayama, Daniel Arsham and most recently Shawn Stussy, creator of the legendary streetwear brand St\u00fcssy.In October 2019, Dior apologized to China for using a map of China that excluded Taiwan.\n\n\n=== Celebrity Ambassadors ===\nDior has created strong partnerships with Hollywood celebrities and social media influencers, working closely with these individuals to reach more demographics and re-establish its identity as a new, modern brand, despite the fact that it has been around for a while. This has allowed the brand to portray a more populist image and attract a wider audience. The brand has worked with and dressed contemporary style icons like Jennifer Lawrence and Lupita Nyong'o, who may resonate with millennials. Dior has effectively implemented social media into their marketing communication strategy, in which images and videos from campaigns are shared on both the official Dior profile, and on the celebrity ambassadors' social media pages.\nAn example of this success is seen in the Secret Garden campaign featuring Rihanna. In this campaign, Rihanna is seen dancing to a song from her album (Only If For a Night) through a hall of mirrors. By being associated with Rihanna's song, the company created a sense of association with her brand, which was beneficial to the company as she was ranked as the most marketable celebrity in 2016. Despite the reach not being completely suitable to the Dior target audience, collaborating with the likes of Rihanna allows the company to engage with more of the market, as Rihanna's social media following is four times larger than that of the fashion house.Below are some of the celebrity ambassadors who have fronted Dior campaigns:\n\nIsabelle Adjani: Poison perfume (1985\u20131990s)\nCarla Bruni: Lady Dior handbag (1996)\nMilla Jovovich: Hypnotic Poison perfume (1999\u20132000)\nCharlize Theron: J'Adore Dior perfume (2004\u2013present)\nSharon Stone: Capture skincare (2005\u2013present)\nMonica Bellucci: Dior cosmetics (2006\u20132010), Lady Dior handbag (2006\u20132007), Hypnotic Poison perfume (2009\u20132010)\nEva Green: Midnight Poison perfume (2007\u20132008)\nMarion Cotillard: Lady Dior handbag (2008\u20132017), Miss Dior handbag (2011)\nJude Law: Dior Homme fragrance (2008\u20132012)\nNatalie Portman: Miss Dior fragrance, Dior cosmetics (2010\u2013present)\nM\u00e9lanie Laurent: Hypnotic Poison perfume (2011\u2013present)\nMila Kunis: Miss Dior handbag (2012)\nJennifer Lawrence: Miss Dior handbag (2012\u2013present), Joy by Dior fragrance (2018\u2013present)\nRobert Pattinson: Dior Homme fragrance (2013\u2013present)\nRihanna: Diorama bag, J'adore Dior perfume, Dior sunglasses (2015\u2013present)\nJohnny Depp: Dior Sauvage fragrance (2015\u2013present)\nAngelababy: DiorAmour collection (2017\u2013present)\nCara Delevingne: DIOR Addict Stellar Shine Lipstick.

Footage was released of the designer under the influence of alcohol saying \"I love Hitler\" and \"People like you would be dead today. Your mothers, your forefathers would be fucking gassed and dead\" to a Jewish woman. In France, it is against the law to make anti-semitic remarks of this nature, and it can be punished by up to six months in prison. On 1 March 2011, Christian Dior officially announced that it had fired Galliano amidst the controversy.\n\n\n== Ownership and shareholdings ==\nAt the end of 2010, the only declared major shareholder in Christian Dior S.A. was Groupe Arnault SAS, the family holding company of Bernard Arnault. The group's control amounted to 69.96% of Dior's stock and 82.86% of its voting rights. The remaining shares are considered free float.Christian Dior S.A. held 42.36% of the shares of LVMH and 59.01% of its voting rights at the end of 2010. Arnault held an additional 5.28% of shares and 4.65% of votes directly.\n\n\n== Creative directors ==\nChristian Dior \u2013 1946\u20131957\nYves Saint Laurent \u2013 1957\u20131960\nMarc Bohan \u2013 1960\u20131989\nGianfranco Ferr\u00e9 \u2013 1989\u20131997\nJohn Galliano \u2013 1997\u20132011\nBill Gaytten \u2013 2011\u20132012\nRaf Simons \u2013 2012\u20132015\nSerge Ruffieux & Lucie Meier 2015\u20132016\nMaria Grazia Chiuri (women's) \u2013 2016\u2013present\nHedi Slimane (men's) \u2013 2000\u20132007\nKris Van Assche (men's) \u2013 2007\u20132018\nKim Jones (men's) \u2013 2018\u2013present\n\n\n== Retail locations ==\n\nThe company operates a total of 210 locations as of September 2010:\n\nAsia: 109\nAfrica: 1 (Casablanca, Morocco)\nCaribbean: 1 (San Juan, Puerto Rico)\nEurope: 45\nCentral America (Panama): 1\nMiddle East: 8\nNorth America (Canada, Mexico, and the United States): 48\nOceania: 6\nSouth America (Brazil, Argentina): 4\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJackson, Lesley.

          "Again, if you want to feel your more in an old town atmosphere, head 2 1/2 hours south to Colonial Williamsburg. This is a nice place to stroll through if you're in the area, but as with nearly all else in Old Town, just not work going out of your way to see/experience",
          "This is a church--built in 1767--that the founding families worshiped in. At the front there are two stones on either side of the alter. One is engraved Washington for George Washington and the other is Lee for Robert E Lee's family. It makes you think about how hard it must",

        "wiki": "Alexandria ( or ; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0643\u0646\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0629\u200e al-\u02beIskandariyya; Egyptian Arabic: \u0627\u0633\u0643\u0646\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0629\u200e Eskendereyya; Coptic: \u2ca3\u2c81\u2c95\u2c9f\u03ef    Rakod\u012b; Greek: \u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 Alexandria) is the second-largest city in Egypt and a major economic center. With a population of 5,200,000, Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean, the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa. The city extends about 40 km (25 mi)  at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea. Alexandria is a popular tourist destination, and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.\nAlexandria was founded in c.\u2009331 BC by Alexander the Great, king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth, during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire. An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria. Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years, until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at Fustat (later absorbed into Cairo). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library (the largest in the ancient world); and the Necropolis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity. It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome.\nThe city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria, which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire. In the modern world, the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.\nFollowing the Arab conquest of Egypt in AD 641, the city was plundered and lost its significance before re-emerging in the modern era. From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major center of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centers in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nRecent radiocarbon dating of seashell fragments and lead contamination show human activity at the location during the period of the Old Kingdom (27th-21st centuries BC) and again in the period 1000-800 BC, followed by the absence of activity thereafter. From ancient sources it is known there existed a trading post at this location during the time of Rameses the Great for trade with Crete, but it had long been lost by the time of Alexander's arrival. A small Egyptian fishing village named Rhakotis (Egyptian:*Ra\u02c1-\u1e32\u0101\u1e6dit, written r\u02c1-\u1e33\u1e6dy.t, 'That which is built up') existed since the 13th century BC in the vicinity and eventually grew into the Egyptian quarter of the city. Just east of Alexandria (where Abu Qir Bay is now), there was in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of Canopus and Heracleion. The latter was recently rediscovered under water.\nAlexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in April 331 BC as \u1f08\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 (Alexandreia). Passing through Egypt, Alexander wanted to build a large Greek city on Egypt's coast that would bear his name. He chose the site of Alexandria, envisioning the building of a causeway to the nearby island of Pharos that would generate two great natural harbors. Alexandria was intended to supersede the older Greek colony of Naucratis as a Hellenistic center in Egypt, and to be the link between Greece and the rich Nile valley.  A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to the city during his life.\nAfter Alexander's departure, his viceroy Cleomenes continued the expansion. The architect Dinocrates of Rhodes designed the city, using a Hippodamian grid plan. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, his general Ptolemy Lagides took possession of Egypt and brought Alexander's body to Egypt with him. Ptolemy at first ruled from the old Egyptian capital of Memphis. In 322/321 BC he had Cleomenes executed. Finally, in 305 BC, Ptolemy declared himself Pharaoh as Ptolemy I Soter (\"Savior\") and moved his capital to Alexandria.\nAlthough Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's early development, the Heptastadion and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined Tyre and becoming the center of the new commerce between Europe and the Arabian and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than Carthage. In a century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with Greek people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nAlexandria was not only a center of Hellenism, but was also home to the largest urban Jewish community in the world. The Septuagint, a Greek version of the Tanakh, was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic center of learning (Library of Alexandria), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Jewish, and Egyptian. By the time of Augustus, the city walls encompassed an area of 5.34 km2, and the total population in Roman times was around 500\u2013600,000.According to Philo of Alexandria, in the year 38 of the Common era, disturbances erupted between Jews and Greek citizens of Alexandria during a visit paid by the Jewish king Agrippa I to Alexandria, principally over the respect paid by the Jewish nation to the Roman emperor, and which quickly escalated to open affronts and violence between the two ethnic groups and the desecration of Alexandrian synagogues. The violence was quelled after Caligula intervened and had the Roman governor, Flaccus, removed from the city.In AD 115, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the Kitos War, which gave Hadrian and his architect, Decriannus, an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215, the emperor Caracalla visited the city and, because of some insulting satires that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365, Alexandria was devastated by a tsunami (365 Crete earthquake), an event annually commemorated years later as a \"day of horror\".\n\n\n=== Islamic era ===\n\nIn 619, Alexandria fell to the Sassanid Persians. Although the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general 'Amr ibn al-'As invaded it during the Muslim conquest of Egypt, after a siege that lasted 14 months. The first Arab governor of Egypt recorded to have visited Alexandria was Utba ibn Abi Sufyan, who strengthened the Arab presence and built a governor's palace in the city in 664\u2013665.After the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517, the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under Ottoman rule until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of Rosetta during the 9th to 18th centuries, and only regained its former prominence with the construction of the Mahmoudiyah Canal in 1807.\nAlexandria figured prominently in the military operations of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernize the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.In July 1882, the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied.In July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the Lavon Affair. On 26 October 1954, Alexandria's Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on Gamal Abdel Nasser.Europeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 Suez Crisis that led to an outburst of Arab nationalism. The nationalization of property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly all the rest.\n\n\n=== Ibn Battuta in Alexandria ===\n\nIn reference to Alexandria, Egypt, Ibn Battuta speaks of great saints that resided here. One of them being Imam Borhan Oddin El Aaraj. He was said to have the power of working miracles. He told Ibn Battuta that he should go find his three brothers, Farid Oddin, who lived in India, Rokn Oddin Ibn Zakarya, who lived in Sindia, and Borhan Oddin, who lived in China. Battuta then made it his purpose to find these people and give them his compliments. Sheikh Yakut was another great man. He was the disciple of Sheikh Abu Abbas El Mursi, who was the disciple of Abu El Hasan El Shadali, who is known to be a servant of God. Abu Abbas was the author of the Hizb El Bahr and was famous for piety and miracles. Abu Abd Allah El Murshidi was a great interpreting saint that lived secluded in the Minyat of Ibn Murshed. He lived alone but was visited daily by emirs, viziers, and crowds that wished to eat with him. The Sultan of Egypt (El Malik El Nasir) visited him, as well. Ibn Battuta left Alexandria with the intent of visiting him.Ibn Battuta also visited the Pharos lighthouse on 2 occasions; in 1326 he found it to be partly in ruins and in 1349 it had deteriorated further, making entrance to the edifice impossible.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\nThe most important battles and sieges of Alexandria include:\n\nSiege of Alexandria (47 BC), Julius Caesar's civil war\nBattle of Alexandria (30 BC), final war of the Roman Republic\nSiege of Alexandria (619), Byzantine-Persian Wars\nSiege of Alexandria (641), Rashidun conquest of Byzantine Egypt\nAlexandrian Crusade (1365), a crusade led by Peter de Lusignan of Cyprus which resulted in the defeat of the Mamluks and the sack of the city.\nBattle of Alexandria (1801), Napoleonic Wars\nSiege of Alexandria (1801), Napoleonic Wars\nAlexandria expedition (1807), Napoleonic Wars\n\n\n== Ancient layout ==\nGreek Alexandria was divided into three regions:\nBrucheum\nBrucheum is the Royal or Greek quarter and forms the most magnificent portion of the city. In Roman times Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal;\nThe Jewish quarter\nThis quarter is the northeast portion of the city;\nRhakotis\nRhakotis is the old city that was absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians. (from Coptic Rakot\u0259 \"Alexandria\").Two main streets, lined with colonnades and said to have been each about 60 meters (200 ft) wide, intersected in the center of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his Mausoleum) rose. This point is very near the present mosque of Nebi Daniel; and the line of the great East\u2013West \"Canopic\" street, only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharia Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.\nAlexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a 1,260-metre-long (4,130 ft) mole and called the Heptastadion (\"seven stadia\"\u2014a stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180 metres or 590 feet). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the \"Moon Gate\" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern \"Ras al-Tin\" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.\nIn Strabo's time, (latter half of the 1st century BC) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbor.\n\nThe Royal Palaces, filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbor on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the \"Private Port,\" and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land subsidence here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.\nThe Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Julius Caesar as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the battle of Pharsalus\nThe Poseidon, or Temple of the Sea God, close to the theater\nThe Timonium built by Marc Antony\nThe Emporium (Exchange)\nThe Apostases (Magazines)\nThe Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole\nBehind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great obelisks, which become known as \"Cleopatra's Needles,\" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.\nThe Gymnasium and the Palaestra are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.\nThe Temple of Saturn; alexandria west.\nThe Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.\nThe Musaeum with its famous Library and theater in the same region; site unknown.\nThe Serapeum of Alexandria, the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells us that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near \"Pompey's Pillar,\" which was an independent monument erected to commemorate Diocletian's siege of the city.The names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, The Great Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, reputed to be 138 metres (453 feet) high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy (Ptolemy II Philadelphus) completed it, at a total cost of 800 talents. It took 12 years to complete and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the Great Pyramid of Giza. A temple of Hephaestus also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.\nIn the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens, according to a census dated from 32 CE, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 216,000 to 500,000 making it one of the largest cities ever built before the Industrial Revolution and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAlexandria is located in the country of Egypt, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlexandria has a borderline hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BWh), approaching a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). As the rest of Egypt's northern coast, the prevailing north wind, blowing across the Mediterranean, gives the city a less severe climate from the desert hinterland. Rafah and Alexandria are the wettest places in Egypt; the other wettest places are Rosetta, Baltim, Kafr el-Dawwar, and Mersa Matruh. The city's climate is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, moderating its temperatures, causing variable rainy winters and moderately hot and slightly prolonged summers that, at times, can be very humid; January and February are the coolest months, with daily maximum temperatures typically ranging from 12 to 18 \u00b0C (54 to 64 \u00b0F) and minimum temperatures that could reach 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F). temperature sometimes gets lower than 5 and it sometimes rains snow.\nAlexandria experiences violent storms, rain and sometimes sleet and hail during the cooler months; these events, combined with a poor drainage system, have been responsible for occasional flooding in the city in the past though they rarely occur anymore. July and August are the hottest and driest months of the year, with an average daily maximum temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual rainfall is around 200 mm (7.9 in) but has been as high as 417 mm (16.4 in)Port Said, Kosseir, Baltim, Damietta and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in Egypt.\nThe highest recorded temperature was 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) on 30 May 1961, and the coldest recorded temperature was 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1994.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDue to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour and the rest has been built over in modern times.\n\n\"Pompey's Pillar\", a Roman triumphal column, is one of the best-known ancient monuments still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient acropolis\u2014a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab cemetery\u2014and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its pedestal, it is 30 m (99 ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in diameter at the base, tapering to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) at the top. The shaft is 88 feet (27 m) high, and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is 132 cubic meters (4,662 cubic feet) and weight approximately 396 tons. Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient obelisks. The Romans had cranes but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several obelisk erecting experiments including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk. The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. \"Pompey's Pillar\" is a misnomer, as it has nothing to do with Pompey, having been erected in 293 for Diocletian, possibly in memory of the rebellion of Domitius Domitianus. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god Serapis were enacted, and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.\nAlexandria's catacombs, known as Kom El Shoqafa, are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large spiral staircase, and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other syncretic Romano-Egyptian religious symbols, burial niches, and sarcophagi, as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in 1900.The most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as Kom El Deka. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its Roman-era baths.\nPersistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local Archaeological Society, and by many individuals, notably Greeks proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.\nThe past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; D. G. Hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898\u20131899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.\n\nSince the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. Cleopatra VII's royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual subsidence in the 4th century AD. This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team. It raised a noted head of Caesarion. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy. The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman strata.\nThe most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.\nThe objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in Kom El Shoqafa (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).\nThe German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of Kom El Deka, which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.\nThe making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtlessly immense; but despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\".\n\n\n=== Temple of Taposiris Magna ===\nThe temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine Pharos Lighthouse.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, there are Muslim mosques. Coptic Christian churches are most common churches .There are also other Christian churches as:  Greek , Latin and Armenian . Orthodox Christian churches are most common but Catholic , Anglican and Evangelical churches are present. Also there is a Jewish synagogue\n\n\n=== Islam ===\n\nThe most famous mosque in Alexandria is Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque in Bahary. Other notable mosques in the city include Ali ibn Abi Talib mosque in Somouha, Bilal mosque, al-Gamaa al-Bahari in Mandara, Hatem mosque in Somouha, Hoda el-Islam mosque in Sidi Bishr, al-Mowasah mosque in Hadara, Sharq al-Madina mosque in Miami, al-Shohadaa mosque in Mostafa Kamel, Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque, Yehia mosque in Zizinia, Sidi Gaber mosque in Sidi Gaber, Sidi B esher mosque, Rokay el-Islam mosque in Elessway, Elsadaka Mosque in Sidibesher Qebly, Elshatbi mosque and Sultan mosque.\nAlexandria is the base of the Salafi movements in Egypt. Al-Nour Party, which is based in the city and overwhelmingly won most of the Salafi votes in the 2011\u201312 parliamentary election, supports the president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nAfter Rome and Constantinople, Alexandria was considered the third-most important seat of Christianity in the world. The Pope of Alexandria was second only to the bishop of Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire until 430. The Church of Alexandria had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, the Church of Alexandria was split between the Miaphysites and the Melkites. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. In the 19th century, Catholic and Protestant missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.\nToday, the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is Saint Mark Cathedral . The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include Pope Cyril I Church in Cleopatra, Saint Georges Church in Sporting, Saint Mark & Pope Peter I Church in Sidi Bishr, Saint Mary Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, Saint Mina Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and Saint Takla Haymanot's Church in Ibrahimeya.\nThe most important Eastern Orthodox churches in Alexandria are Agioi An\u00e1rgyroi Church, Church of the Annunciation, Saint Anthony Church, Archangels Gabriel & Michael Church, Taxiarchon Church, Saint Catherine Church, Cathedral of the Dormition in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, Prophet Elijah Church, Saint George Church, Saint Joseph Church in Fleming, Saint Joseph of Arimathea Church, Saint Mark & Saint Nektarios Chapel in Ramleh, Saint Nicholas Church, Saint Paraskevi Church, Saint Sava Cathedral in Ramleh, Saint Theodore Chapel and the Russian church of Saint Alexander Nevsky in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.\nThe Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said has jurisdiction over all Latin Church Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the Jesuits in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan, which uses the Byzantine Rite, and the nominal see of the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia, using the Armenian Rite.\nThe Saint Mark Church in Shatby, founded as part of Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, Coptic Catholic and Coptic Orthodox rites.\nIn antiquity, Alexandria was a major center of the cosmopolitan religious movement called Gnosticism (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\n\nAlexandria's once-flourishing Jewish community declined rapidly following the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, after which negative reactions towards Zionism among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt fled to the newly established Israel, France, Brazil and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50. The most important synagogue in Alexandria is the Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nAlexandria has a number of higher education institutions. Alexandria University is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its Faculty of Medicine & Faculty of Engineering. In addition, the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology in New Borg El Arab city is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010.  The Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC American University in Cairo because of its worldwide recognition from board of engineers at UK & ABET in US. Universit\u00e9 Senghor is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly recruits students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT) and Pharos University in Alexandria.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\nAlexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by Catholic missionaries include Coll\u00e8ge de la M\u00e8re de Dieu, Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Sion, Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Ecoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), \u00c9cole Girard, \u00c9cole Saint Gabriel, \u00c9cole Saint-Vincent de Paul, \u00c9cole Saint Joseph, \u00c9cole Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lyc\u00e9e el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently a public school run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais d'Alexandrie (\u00c9cole Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the Istituto \"Don Bosco\".\nEnglish schools in Alexandria are becoming the most popular. English-language schools in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, British School of Alexandria, Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Egyptian English Language School,  Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, Schutz American School, Victoria College, El Manar Language School for Girls (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and El Nasr Girls' College.\nThere are only two German schools in Alexandria which are Deutsche Schule der Borrom\u00e4rinnen (DSB of Saint Charles Borrom\u00e9) and Neue Deutsche Schule Alexandria, which is run by Frau Sally Hammam.\nThe Montessori educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at Alexandria Montessori.\nThe most notable public schools in Alexandria include El Abbassia High School and Gamal Abdel Nasser High School.\n\n\n=== Women ===\nCirca the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to the same percentage in Cairo. As a result, specialist women's publications like al-Fat\u0101h by Hind Nawal, the country's first women's' journal, appeared.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city's principal airport is currently Borg El Arab Airport, which is located about 25 km (16 mi) away from the city center.\nFrom late 2011, El Nouzha Airport (Alexandria International Airport) was to be closed to commercial operations for two years as it underwent expansion, with all airlines operating out of Borg El Arab Airport from then onwards, where a brand new terminal was completed there in February 2010. In 2017, the government announced that Alexandria International Airport will shut down permanently for operational reasons.\n\n\n=== Port ===\n\nAlexandria has four ports; namely the Western Port also known as(Alexandria Port), which is the main port of the country that handles about 60% of the country's exports and imports, Dekhela Port west of the Western Port, the Eastern Port which is a yachting harbor, and Abu Qir Port at the northern east of the governorate. It is a commercial port for general cargo and phosphates.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nInternational Coastal Road (Mersa Matruh \u2013 Alexandria \u2013 Port Said)\nCairo\u2013Alexandria Desert Road (Alexandria \u2013 Cairo \u2013 220 km (137 mi), 6\u20138 lanes)\nCairo-Alexandria Agriculture Road (Alexandria \u2013 Cairo)\nMehwar El Ta'meer \u2013 (Alexandria \u2013 Borg El Arab)\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAlexandria's intracity commuter rail system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity railway station) to Abu Qir, parallel to the tram line. The commuter line's locomotives operate on diesel, as opposed to the overhead-electric tram.\nAlexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned Misr Station (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and Sidi Gaber railway station (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the center of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by Egyptian National Railways.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nAn extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the El Raml district in the west and ends in the Victoria district in the east. Most of the vehicles are blue in color. Some smaller yellow-colored vehicles have further routes beyond the two main endpoints. The tram routes have one of four numbers: 1, 2, 5, and 6. All four start at El Raml, but only two (1 and 2) reach Victoria. There are two converging and diverging points. The first starts at Bolkly (Isis) and ends at San Stefano. The other begins at Sporting and ends at Mostafa Kamel. Route 5 starts at San Stefano and takes the inner route to Bolkly. Route 6 starts at Sidi Gaber El Sheikh in the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 1 takes the inner route between San Stefano and Bolkly and the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 2 takes the route opposite to Route 1 in both these areas. The tram fares are 50 piastres (0.50 pounds), and 100 piastres (1.00 pounds) for the middle car. Some trams (that date back the 30s) charge a pound. The tram is considered the cheapest method of public transport. A caf\u00e9 operates in the second floor of the first car of tram 1 (a women-only car) which costs 5 L.E per person, also offering a WiFi service. A luxury light blue tram car operates from San Stefano to Ras El Tin, with free WiFi and movies and songs played inside for 5 L.E per ticket.\nStations:\n\nRoute 2 serves:\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nConstruction of the Alexandria Metro is due to begin in 2020 at a cost of $1.05 billion.\n\n\n=== Taxis and minibuses ===\n\nTaxis in Alexandria sport a yellow-and-black livery and are widely available. While Egyptian law requires all cabs to carry meters, these generally do not work and fares must be negotiated with the driver on either departure or arrival.\n\nThe minibus share taxi system, or mashr\u016b' operates along well-known traffic arteries. The routes can be identified by both their endpoints and the route between them:\n\nCorniche routes:\nEl Mandara \u2013 Bahari\nEl Mandara \u2013 El Mansheya\nAsafra \u2013 Bahari\nAsafra \u2013 El Mansheya\nEl Sa'aa \u2013 El Mansheya\nAbu Qir routes:\nEl Mandara \u2013 El Mahata (lit. \"the Station\", i.e. Misr Railway Station)\nAbu Qir \u2013 El Mahata\nVictoria \u2013 El Mahata\nEl Mandara \u2013 Victoria\nInterior routes:\nCabo \u2013 Bahari\nEl Mansheya \u2013 El Awayid\nEl Mansheya \u2013 El Maw'af El Gedid (the New Bus Station)\nHadara \u2013 El MahataThe route is generally written in Arabic on the side of the vehicle, although some drivers change their route without changing the paint. Some drivers also drive only a segment of a route rather than the whole path; such drivers generally stop at a point known as a major hub of the transportation system (for example, Victoria) to allow riders to transfer to another car or to another mode of transport.\nFare is generally L.E. 3.00 to travel the whole route. Shorter trips may have a lower fare, depending on the driver and the length of the trip.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe Royal Library of Alexandria, in Alexandria, Egypt, was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of Ptolemy II of Egypt. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the Muses\u2014the Museion, Greek \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03bd (from which the Modern English word museum is derived).\nIt has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.The Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002, near the site of the old Library.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Alexandria National Museum was inaugurated 31 December 2003. It is located in a restored Italian style palace in Tariq El Horreya Street (formerly Rue Fouad), near the center of the city. It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and Egypt. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria. Construction on the site was first undertaken in 1926.\nCavafy Museum\nThe Graeco-Roman Museum\nThe Museum of Fine Arts\nThe Royal Jewelry Museum\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nAlexandria Opera House, where classical music, Arabic music, ballet, and opera are performed and bearm basha theatre in elshatby.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThroughout Alexandria, there is art that resembles some of the oldest architectural styles of the Hellenic city, and its ancient decorations, especially in the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, is based on reviving the ancient Library of Alexandria. The Kom el shoqafa Catacombs are considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages and date back to the 2nd century. The remnants of Pompey's Pillar still remain today. This single pillar represents the elaborate temple which once stood in Alexandria. It remains at the site of the Serapeum, Alexandria's acropolis. The Serapeum, which stood for ancient tradition, conflicted with the rise of Christianity. It is a large tourist destination, today. the Roman Amphitheatre of Alexandria is another popular destination. Here, there remains a stage with around seven hundred to eight hundred seats. They also have numerous galleries of statues and details leftover form this time. Alexandria's tourism office announced plans to reserve some beaches for tourists in July 2018.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe main sport that interests Alexandrians is football, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. Alexandria Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Alexandria, Egypt. It is currently used mostly for football matches, and was used for the 2006 African Cup of Nations. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the African Cup of Nations in January 2006, which Egypt won. Sea sports such as surfing, jet-skiing and water polo are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city.

It is located on the west bank of the Nile, 4.9 km (3 mi) southwest of central Cairo, and is a core city of the Greater Cairo metropolis.\nGiza lies less than 20 km (12.43 mi) north of Memphis (Men-nefer), which was the capital city of the first unified Egyptian state from the days of the first pharaoh, Narmer.\nGiza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau: the site of some of the most impressive ancient monuments in the world, including a complex of ancient Egyptian royal mortuary and sacred structures, including the Great Sphinx, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and a number of other large pyramids and temples. Giza has always been a focal point in Egypt's history due to its location close to Memphis, the ancient pharaonic capital of the Old Kingdom. Its St. George Cathedral is the episcopal see of the Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Giza.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe \"city\" of Giza is the capital of the Giza Governorate, and is located near the northeast border of this governorate. The city's population was reported as 2,681,863 in the 2006 national census, while the governorate had 6,272,571 at the same census, without specifying what the city is.  The former figure corresponds to the sum of 9 kisms.\nTechnically, Giza may not be an incorporated municipal unit (and therefore not a city) at all. In a typical Egyptian fashion, there are two districts within the Governorate with the same name: a kism/qasm and associated markiz.  Some 9 urban kisms of Giza Governorate form collectively a contiguous area of 98.4km2 directly opposite side of the Nile from Cairo, and recorded a preliminary count of 4,146,340 in 2017 census count, not including the Al-\u1e24aw\u0101midiyah kism separated by Giza markiz.  It is unclear if the 9 urban kisms represent a single entity; the structure may be similar to that of 23 wards of Tokyo in that all local units are simply subordinate to the Prefecture of Tokyo without any intermediate municipal structure.\n\nNotes:2018 CAPMAS projection based on 2017 revised census figures, may differ significantly from 2017 census preliminary tabulations.  The 9 kisms were reported simply as Giza city by CAPMAS in 2006 but given explosive growth definitions, likely informal, may have change or may be set to change.Giza's most famous landform and archaeological site, the Giza Plateau, holds some major monuments of Egyptian history, and is home to the Great Sphinx. Once thriving with the Nile that flowed right into the Giza Plateau, the pyramids of Giza were built overlooking the ancient Egyptian capital city of Memphis, across the river from modern day Cairo. The Giza Plateau is also home to Egyptian monuments such as the tomb of Pharaoh Djet of the First Dynasty, as well as that of Pharaoh Ninetjer of the Second Dynasty. The Great Pyramid of Giza at one time was advocated (1884) as the location for the Prime Meridian, a reference point used for determining a base longitude.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nGiza experiences a hot desert climate like arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BWh). Its climate is similar to Cairo, owing to its proximity. Wind storms can be frequent across Egypt in spring, bringing Saharan dust into the city during the months of March and April. High temperatures in winter range from 16 to 20 \u00b0C (61 to 68 \u00b0F), while nighttime lows drop to below 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F). In summer, the highs are 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F), and the lows can drop to about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F). Rain is infrequent in Giza; snow and freezing temperatures are extremely rare.\nUp to August 2013, the highest recorded temperature was 46 \u00b0C (115 \u00b0F) on 13 June 1965, while the lowest recorded temperature was 2 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F) on 8 January 1966.\n\n\n=== Districts and neighbourhoods ===\nDokki District: 93,660 93,025\nAgouza District: 174,460 162,851\nGiza District: 180,568 246,325, Kism Al Jizah 238,567 248,897\nBulaq ad Dakrur: 453,884 564,791\nImbabah: 287,357 389,049, Kism Imbabah 523,265 597,160\nHaram District: 200,076 295,704\nOmrania\nMonib\nKafr TuhurmusThe centre of the city is Giza Square.\n\nFaisal districtNile islands:\n\nQorsaya Island\nDahab Island\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\nThe area in what is now Giza served as the necropolis of several pharaohs who ruled ancient Egypt, during the 2nd millennium BC. Three of these tombs, in the form of giant pyramids, are what is now the famed Pyramids of Giza.\n\n\n=== Classical to medieval era ===\nAs ancient Egypt passed under several conquests under the Persians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines, so did the area in what is now Giza. A Byzantine village named Phylake (Greek: \u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae) or Terso (Coptic: \u03ef\u2ca3\u2ca5\u2cb1, meaning \"the fortress\", now Tersa) was located south of Giza and should not be confused with it.Egyptians called the area Tipersis (Coptic: \u03ef\u2ca1\u2c89\u2ca3\u2ca5\u2c93\u2ca5) (also Tipersis enbabylon (which most likely refers to Babylon Fortress but may as well refer to Babylon in Mesopotamia) Tipersoi, Perso), which may correspond to Persians (as the name may be literally translated as \"Persians of/from Babylon\"). Eutychius gives a legend about city's name and its foundation by Artaxerxes Ochus, while Abu Salih says it was found by a Persian king H\u016b\u0161 at the same time as Qasr ash-Sham.As Muslims of the fledgling Islamic caliphate went on with their conquest of Egypt from the Byzantine Empire beginning in 639 AD, three years after their victory at the battle of Yarmouk in 636 AD, they conquered all of the land by the time they have captured the city of Alexandria in 641 AD. A year later in 642 AD (year 21 in Islamic calendar), they founded the city of Giza. Its name, al-Jizzah in Arabic, means \"the valley\" or \"the plateau\", pertaining to the area's topography. Peust also suggests a Persian etymology of the word from Middle Persian diz (fortress, castle), which Persians could give to the pyramids or a fortress they've found in the area.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nGiza has seen many changes over time. Changes in infrastructure during the different occupations of Egypt by various rulers, including the British in the 18th and early 20th century, focused on the construction of roads, streets, and buildings in the area. Giza is a thriving centre of Egyptian culture and is quite heavily populated, with many facilities and buildings in the current area. Giza saw much attention in particular to its vast amount of ancient Egyptian monuments found on the Giza Plateau, and has astonished thousands of visitors and tourists over the years. Giza's infrastructure saw much attention from both the British government prior to the 1952 coup d'\u00e9tat, as well as the current Egyptian government due to the city's importance in tourism.\nThe city hosts the first zoo on the entire African continent and one of the oldest in the Mediterranean region, the Giza Zoo. In addition, there are several parks, the most famous among them is Orman Park, which means \"Forest Park\" in the Turkish language.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nTransportation in Giza comprises an extensive road network, rail system, subway system, and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and microbuses.\nGiza shares with Cairo a subway system, officially called the \"Metro (\u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648)\", a fast and efficient way of getting around. An extensive road network connects Giza with 6th of October City, Cairo and other cities. There are flyovers and bridges such as the 15th. Giza traffic is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded.\n\nCairo Taxi\nUber (Available in Cairo and Giza since 2015)\nCareem (Available in Cairo and Giza since 2015)\nSwvl (Available in Cairo and Giza since 2017) (A new concept of shared rides within Egypt). \nWater Taxis (Motorized Feluccas) available for transport to nearby places along the Nile River\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustries here include movies, chemicals, Giza cotton, machinery and cigarettes. In addition, Giza has many luxury apartment buildings along the Nile, making it a popular place to live.\n\n\n=== International access ===\nAccess to the city of Giza, which has its own governorate adjacent to the Governorate of Cairo, is dependent on the Cairo International Airport. Another local airport is found in Giza, called the Imbaba Airport, but recently the Egyptian government has decided to shut down the area and turn it into a cultural or an athletic area.\nSphinx International Airport is scheduled to open in 2018.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nGiza's learning institutions include Cairo University, which was moved to Giza in 1924. The city is a hub of education and educational services not only for Egypt but also for the entire Mediterranean Region. Giza has numerous schools, kindergartens, and institutes of higher learning.\nThe Cairo Japanese School, a Japanese international school, is in Giza. The Deutsche Evangelische Oberschule, a German international school, is located in Dokki in Giza. Previously the Pakistan International School of Cairo had its campus in Giza.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe city hosts the second most successful club in Egypt and Africa, El Zamalek, which is located in the Meet Okba neighbourhood near the Mohandesin neighbourhood. Beside El Zamalek there are other clubs like El Tersana and Seid Shooting Club which is one of the elite clubs in Egypt.\n\n\n== Twin towns and sister cities ==\n\nGiza is twinned with:\n\n Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam\n Bergen, Norway\n Los Angeles, United States\n Rinkeby, Stockholm, Sweden\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\nGreater Cairo\nGiza Governorate\nGiza pyramid complex\nGreat Sphinx of Giza\nList of Egyptian pyramids\nList of megalithic sites\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDer Manuelian, Peter. 2017.

          "Our group had an opportunity to see the Sphinx and Pyramids illuminated while we were eating dinner at Abou Shakra Restaurant. We didn\u2019t actually attend the Sound and Light show so I can\u2019t speak to it\u2019s overall value. But I can tell you that seeing these world-famous monuments",
          "It tells some of the history of the pyramids and lights them up using 70s technology. It was a good show and interesting to watch.",
          "I tried to change the date of my vip tickets. Nobody answered to my emails - no service at all, once you bought a ticket.",
          "There are three shows, each one in a different language. The show lasts about an hour, and as other people have said, it is a bit dated, but I must say I did enjoy it and was a good introduction to the pyramids.",
          "This show has not been updated in a very long time. It was boring and the story was confused. With today's lighting technology it could be a fabulous show. The majority of our tour group were disappointed. This show must have made a lot of money in the years it has been",
          "If you have the times, this is a nice way to spend an evening and get another historical perspective about the Pyramids. We enjoyed our evening.",
          "Our hotel is across the street, so we got to watch the sound and light show free from the comfort of our hotel roof top. As we waited for it to start, we watched vans & buses congregating in the street and parking lot below the hotel to let the tourists out for the hour long",
          "To arrive in Egypt and see the pyramids lit up at night with sound and music was daunting. We took the VIP seats so we could have unobstructed views and take great photos. They were hardly any more money and we sat first row. February was cold at night so dress warmly. You can",
          "Not worth the money - terrible show. Skip it. The light system is very old, the laser lights don\u2019t work.",
          "The sound and light show is OK. The dialogue is very informative, but the light show is showing its age. It's is worth doing because you will have an evening in Cairo, or you should.",
          "Perhaps the most boring waste of time in Egypt. There was nothing spectacular about this light and sound show. The show seemed like a high school AV project. The narration was boring and uneventful. The lighting was atrocious. It almost seemed as if the sphinx was holding a",
          "Really cool light and sound show, well worth the stop! Really amazing to see the pyramid lit up at night, wonderful experience.",
          "This was a terrible disappointment. A tourist trap to avoid. The light show itself was underwhelming, and the story telling also left much to be desired. An horrible scrum to get in got things off to a bad start and was typical of the badly organized show. Perhaps it would have",
          "This was an optional extra on our Bunnik Tour but I'm so glad we did it. We were VIPs from our Bunnik Tour and this gave us fantastic front row seats. At night time the pyramids take on a magical quality and the colourful lights, and story telling were simply mesmerising. The",
          "Very well done and worth experiencing ! It was really enjoyable . Not to be missed ! Reserve a seat in advance .",
          "Our guide took us the the Sound & Light show almost one hour early. Although we were not able to sit in the audience for the Arab language show at 6 pm, we were able to see enough of the show from the distant seating area to understand how much or how little lighting was used at",
          "I was staying across the street at the Great Pyramid Inn and had decided before arriving to go and see the show on my first day however, a 22 hour flight put paid to that idea. The next day after visiting Dahshur, Saqaarra, Memphis and Giza plateau, I decided to attend the show.",
          "A truly spectacular show, so well done and presented. The lights on the Pyramids were beautiful and artistic and gave a great sense of history, explained very well. Highly recommended",
          "Impressive laser & light effect - makes the pyramids get close - learnt lots too Cold in Jan - blankets on loan! Cheaper to sit in a rooftop restaurant, enjoy snacks & drinks - same view (almost) for free - sound loud enough to be heard! A thought - either way - don\u2019t miss",
          "Take your warm clothes, at least in winter, but then enjoy to the max of a nice audiovisual spectacle. Several languages available. As a foreign tourist it might be a bit easier to get a good seat in front and centrally, Overall: (nearly) a must!",
          "we were told not to go to this show, but i actually really enjoyed it! it\u2019s kind of out-dated but the atmosphere really makes it a good time. maybe not a must-see but definitely a bit of camp fun!",
          "The Pyramids Light Show is expensive, and known to be dated and kinda corny- But, it is part of the experience. We couldn't bring ourselves to spend the money on the show, but there are several rooftop restaurants serving dinner and drinks where you can enjoy \"the show\". Not",
          "Just dreadful. Out dated technology, abysmal laser projections, more lasers circa 1980 than 21st century. The same with projections. Dated technology. Audio quality to cringe over. Unpleasantly loud and very distorted. Dreadfully poor quality. Lighting REALLY disappointing. In",

          "We were a tad late so show had already started, but it wasn't busy at all. It started to rain part way through but only lasted a minute and then was fine. The show itself was a lot of history and seemed a bit \"old school\" nothing new or exciting. This was our first day so",
          "You may not find the show very informative but I suggest that you go for the lighting. The pyramids and the Sphinx look beautiful when they are lit. Also, go and buy the tickets at the venue. DO NOT take a tour. They will charge you a lot. Uber is easily available and the ticket",
          "I was watching the light show from the rooftop of Sphinx Golden Gate Inn. Lights was ok, I thought there some kind of good lightning but it was not. Really disappointed Maybe they need to change and improve so they can attract more guests",
          "The show was great for the first 30 minutes but then dragged on a little too much for my liking. It did get cool so I recommend a jumper for jacket. The pyramids under the night sky and under lights was the highlight for me.",
          "Loved watching this. We were lucky enough to see from balcony and rooftop of great pyramid inn. Just do it!",
          "Our tour had a scheduled time but it was late because the prior tour arrived late and their show started late. As a result our show started late too. The show itself is interesting with the colored lights and the commentary but it is straight out of the 60s. This show is all",
          "An evening of sound and light is a completely different way of experiencing the pyramids from daylight direct visits. A good into to the history of their creation if you have never read up on them.",
          "Must visit if you are in Egypt and in Cairo. Gives a brief detail of the Egyptian history. Arrangements at the location is also done very neatly.",
          "I booked through Delux Private Tours, the Egypt Sound & Light Show at the Pyramids. Can recommend this evening show with Delux Private tours to pick you up from your hotel, get you there in air conditioned comfort and return back to your hotel. All costs included when you book.",
          "It was clean, but way overpriced for what you see. I find that the show is very very very outdated. It seems the show contents and audio is from the 1950s and needs a serious update. I seriously wanted to go to sleep and was not even paying attention to it after half way",
          "There\u2019s some who will find this Sound & Light show cheesy and a little bit anachronistic giving that the voices, lights & accompanying music are pretty much unchanged since its inception at the start of the 1960s. But therein lies its charm, the music reminiscent of the",
          "We\u2019re very fortunate to have full view of the show every night from our hotel. But seeing what people pay to watch this show is ridiculous. It\u2019s boring, content is old, it\u2019s not exciting. Show needs to change if they want an engaging audience and the lights need to be more \u201cwow\u201d",
          "I really enjoyed this and wanted to enjoy it even more. While maybe not a fair comparison, but I have seen other light shows in the last decade and this needs some significant modernizing. After visiting the Pyramids in daylight and the Egyptian museum, much of the history is",
          "All 6 of us in our group that went thought it was on the boring side. A couple even fell asleep. It is very slow paced. The lights are pretty but it was not what we were expecting. If just want to see the pyramids lit up, you can see that for free and that you should do. Luckily",
          "Very old style show - probably hasn't changed in 30 years.... Nice to see the pyramids lit up but you could probably get away with seeing the show without paying. Very expensive for what it is.",
          "This was high on my bucket list and it did not disappoint. Take a jacket as it can get cool, but the show is amazing! The history is phenomenal and the holograms are fantastic. The pyramids and the Sphinx are so different during the day, but this is a show that is",
          "Stay in a bnb or hotel accross the road from the ticket office and have a drink on the roof top during the sound and light show. Worth it!",

          "Don't bother with this, it's a waste of time and money. Go in the day time and really experience the wonders of the pyramids!",
          "Went on our first night. It was nice orientation to the beginning of our trip of so much history. Enjoyed very much!",
          "This light and sound show was our introduction to the Great Pyramids and The Sphinx and we LOVED IT! With the voice of Omar Sharif narrating an over the top cheezzzzy script I enjoyed learning the history of Egypt with moving and changing lights glowing upon these ultimately",
          "The view is amazing and the pyramids are amazing all light up at night. The sound is very cool and gives history of pyramids.",
          "the light show is very nice, the pyramids look amazing with all the lights changing color as the narrator explains the history, but this is only good for 30 min and if you really a fan of history",
          "The show combines some history of Egypt, some dramatization of ancient Egyptian pomp, the story of the Rosetta Stone and a lot of Hollywood glitz. Is it worth it. Absolutely, seeing what the face of the Sphinx looked projected onto the damaged face of Sphinx alone is worth it.",
          "It was a good show, we enjoyed it. Even if Egypt is a warm country but would recommend a sweater or a jacket when going to the show in winter nights.",
          "As others note this could be better if redone; it was obviously put together decades ago. Wish that the pyramids were kept lit longer after the show and into the evening to take in their majesty at dark; instead the lights went on with the show and turned off at its conclusion.",
          "It\u2019s fine if you are really interested in the history. The lights and the setup is enthralling. The storytelling was fine to start with but got a bit unrelatable after the first 15 mins or so. It should be revised and delivered for the common man that usually is the bulk of the",
          "This was just ok. I probably wouldn't recommend it. It's very cheesy, many of the lights or lasers didn't seem to work. If you need something to do for an hour it's fine, but not amazing.",
          "Excellent show which started off with prompt pick up from hotel We were accompanied by our guide Hazem (we also had used him for 2 other tours ) from EMO Tours who was professional courteous and he even bought us a Egyptian coffee to try as we were a bit early for the show A",
          "Nice show at Pyramids by night... It could be much more spectacular Needs a good update Anyway worths visiting it",
          "It\u2019s like a whole production history lesson thing. It would be cool if it were updated but it seems like 50+ years old.",
          "Was recommended to go and see this show and wasn't dissapointed. Found it very enjoyable and especially seeing the sunset over the pyramids at the start.Well narrated and the lights over and around the sphinx were fantastic",
          "I was excited about this as we had gone to a sound and light show that was very well done in Jerusalem so expected something similar. The show started out promising but was lengthy and honestly, boring. We were underwhelmed. Was it worth going, yes. It was spectacular to see",
          "Never observed anything like this. They play music along with the lights and narration. The first and second time was very interesting but after that it got to be a little annoying. Our hotel was right in front of the Pyramids so we heardit every night. We watched it from our",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the show - not normally a fan of sound and light shows, but this one with the dramatic music, makes you feel like you're back sailing down the Nile with the pyramids in sight....",
          "The show was nice, But Thats about it. Nice lights etc. But I was expecting more of a fact-based information (National geographich style facts) than some stories and legends about someone. Went there to know about the pyramids, left without any special knowledge. Still",
          "I was fortunate enough to be taken here after work by the people I was visiting. It was my second time in Cairo, and they said you must see the pyramids! We arrived a little early (as it starts at 7:30), but it was amazing to see the sun set behind these incredible structures.",
          "The show was great. The sunset and the pyramids were more than enough. The show is old but still works. Around half an hour.",
          "My 25 year old daughter insisted we see the light show upon arriving the first day in Egypt. NOT a great idea. Considering that Americans are walking threats in Egypt and that we had an escorted policeman with the tour group and following the bus, it\u2019s not a good idea to go",
          "I did not take the transport, but I did go and see the show, since my hotel was one block from the Great Sphinx. It was a marvelous laser show that you cannot miss.",
          "Well organised and well projected images onto the pyramids. The commentary is informative. Traffic getting in and out a nightmare!",
          "Whilst it can be a little corny and a little old, the show is definitely worth seeing. Pay the bit extra to get the front 3 rows, it's worth it.",
          "The sphinx is the site of the sound and light show. Seats are first come first served but fortunately are well spaced so view is good. We expected more holograms to be used but the lighting and narration were good",
          "We were lured by our tour guide to do this event. It is one of those shows that if you go, it's ok and not go then you feel FOMO. However, we found the show very interesting. Loved the lighting but the showrunners need to upgrade their equipment and the show story. It is a bit",
          "Well if you can do more with light and made it spectacular it will be good and well if you like story,hear story etc then this is for you. But i think can watch once as the pyramid and sphnix look good with light",
          "Had seen it in 2003. Saw it again yesterday. It becomes stunning due to the large canvas of three pyramids in the background. Commentary is educative. Show has not changed over the years as I recollect. Worth visiting. Online tickets is one option or visitors can purchase it at",
          "We saw 3 light & sound shows at various temples and pyramids in Egypt. This was easily the best of them.",
          "No, this isn't the greatest light show in the world and yes the narration is a little dated but personally I liked that. The best part about the show is seeing the pyramids at night time underneath the moon, that was really something special. The lights illuminate them in",
          "REally cool experience to be there at night so if thats what you want SCORE! however its dated and gets old quick. Its also chilly soplan accordingly",
          "It\u2019s nice to see the pyramids at sunset and light show was good but apparently the information presented are not all facts and the sound used could be improved.",
          "We were able to watch this from our balcony. It wasn\u2019t very good. The sound was often inaudible and the lighting effects are basic. If I had been one of the many people who had paid for an excursion here, I would have been really annoyed. As it was, it was mildly entertaining.",
          "You need to witness this at least once, gazing at the Pyramids against the back drop of moon and stars is an altogether different experience. Once the Sun starts to set and you see the crescent of the the moon emerging behind the pyramid with millions of stars above on a clear",
          "Got there early and had front row seats behind vip area. Pretty cold last night so 20 pounds blankets were popular. Nice to watch sunset over sphinx and pyramids. Show covered history of egypt for 50 mins. Lights desperately need updating as there are much more spectacular",
          "Was amazing to see the light show and to hear the sound telling the story around the pyramids and the Sphinx. It was great, will absolutely come back to see it again.",
          "This was a decent show. A bit cheesy in places with plummy English voice overs but a good conclusion to the day if you have done the pyramids of Giza already.",
          "I saw this exact same show 30 years ago when I visited. They have not updated one thing, including the seating. The text is right out of a 60's -B movie and the lasers did not work. When describing pharaohs, they say, \"He was as Handsome as a Barbarian\" silly text and not",
          "This is a much hyped up show which is okay. It is definitely bad but can be excluded from the itinerary as all you will see will be shared by the guide on a daytrip to the pyramids and the sphinx.",
          "Chairs are set up in front of the great Sphinx. The sound is old and lights are basic. It was really cold, so come prepared. It was a bit corny and commercialized. We were there so it seemed like a must-do item. However, I would tell my friends to skip it.",
          "Excellent show which started off with prompt pick up from hotel We were accompanied by Mohammed who was professional courteous and he gave us a full insight to what was planned for the trip A young man who is a credit to the company The show was excellent and it gave you an",
          "This was a bit underwhelming. The \u201csound\u201d is very old recording about Egyptian legends. The \u201clight\u201d is basically spotlights, green lasers, and pictures. Don\u2019t expect a Disneyland projection show. It\u2019s a good place to take pics of the pyramids at night. Our transportation",
          "I felt like it was a bit corny...kind of takes away the majestic-ness. Very commercial. Also it gets very cold, so go.prepared with warm clothing.",
          "This is a fantastic show! Although it has been made propably in the 60s is still fantastic show. You feel like you are in a holiwood movie!",
          "- Aggressive feeling between the visitors - Stinky area around - totally full - Cold - Boring story - Laser on pyramid broken - Sound like in the 80s - Far away + Popcorn tasty + You can go earlier",
          "The sound and light show at the Giza pyramids are performed in English every night at 7 pm from October to April and at 7:30 pm May to September. Depending on demand, there is a second or even third showing in another language\u2014either Italian, Spanish, French, or German. We were",
          "The temperature gets quite low so make sure you carry warm clothes. The story telling is pretty engaging",
          "Do not pay extra for the show.If you have an opportunity ,watch it from the near by hotel terrace as we did.Show is long and frankly quite boring.Light effects are not very exciting. Pyramids are lighted up nicely only for few minutes.Best to see them at the day",
          "Hilariously bad. Was probably state of the art 30 years ago. Certainly not now. I laughed in places where laughter was not intended (of that I'm sure). The very crisp English accents cracked me up - felt like I was watching a 1930's newsreel. I enjoyed it - the others in my tour",
          "I did this with my family on our first night together in Cairo. It was nice for our first night as it was a way for us to get to see the pyramids right away. And the idea behind this show is great. It's a great idea to have the pyramids lit up, but the lighting was really dated.",
          "The show at Karnak is much better, but to see the pyramids lit up at night time this is the only way to see it. We used transport from our hotel and bought regular tickets there. It does get a bit cold at night too. Lights are better than the sound experience, could be",
          "It was worth seeing for the lighting. The commentary was over powering and a brief history would have been good. And it would have been great with some atmospheric music to just soak it up. It was freezing a blanket is advisable.",
          "We thought there was going to lazer lights and music. This was not. It was a history lesson with Father Time. It reminded me of a history show from 1936 with poor graphics. If the narration was done with Morgan Freeman, at least it may have sounded more interesting. If you",
          "The lights make the pyramids and the Sphinx look indeed majestic. The commentaries by Omar Sharif are interesting, but they are about 45 minutes (out of about 60) too long, and some of it is spiritual or even intellectual rubbish.",
          "Most tours charge from $45-60 dollars per person, some include dinner and some don't but if you are staying in close proximity to the pyramids it is much cheaper to do it on your own. Your hotel can arrange for round trip taxi transfer $590 Egyptian pounds and entrance fee is",
          "The show is informative and interesting. Make sure you get there from the beginning! There are plenty of seats so you\u2019ll definitely find a spot to sit and watch.",
          "You know sometimes you know you are doing the wrong thing, but you do it anyway? The Sound and Light show at Giza involves sitting with 1,000+ plus others and listen to the very dead now Omar Sharif talk about the Pyramids and the Sphinx. The 50 minute presentation is a bit of",
          "It is a good show with good commentary but pricey. Just book a night at Great Pyramids Inn & watch the whole show from their rooftop Restaurant. Alibaba will reserve you a nice table with great views. The food in the Restaurant is great too. Check it out you will love it.",
          "This has so much potential but the show is really quite dated. They should start from scratch and create a new quality show. Also, it does get cold so make certain you go there well rugged up.",
          "The night Light Show gives a completely different feel to the whole area of Giza. Shivers down the spine but not because it was cold but because the vibes of the Pharoahs emerge towards the spectators.",
          "Excellent show. Hosam was my driver for pretty much the whole day. Good company, was exactly were he said he would be at all points during the day. And he got me to the hotel and back safely in the Cairo traffic.",
          "The sound and light show gives an excellent exposition of the stories behind the Pyramids and their builders. The lights pick out all the Pyramids in turn clearly explaining their relationships to each other. The show lasts 1hr and in the winter it does get cold in the desert.",
          "The light and sound show of pyramid was expensive and the weather was freezing. We were shivering and we had to hire blankets at Egyptian pounds sixty. They did not accept American dollars. The show is priced at 100 us dollars which was exhorbitant. This is an avoidable trip.",
          "A big thanks to Husayn (sp) and Emo Tours. The Sound and Light show was a great history lesson, and fun to see the Pyramids lite up at night.",
          "Seeing the 3 Pyramids & the Sphinx at night in multicolored lights is Not to be missed - but do it the right way. First, arrive 30 minutes early & make sure the time presentation is in your preferred language. Then Sit at the upper Bar section ( non alcoholic drinks, but that\u2019s",
          "It was cold on the night we went so make sure you rug up and wear warm clothes. We had the VIP seating , front row, but there were plenty of other seats available. At least in this row you get cushions on your metal chairs. You can for an extra charge hire a blanket. I must say",
          "We had a sense that the light and sound show was going to be something special and worthy of the admission price. We were very wrong. The audio by Omar Sharif should have provided a sign, that it hasn\u2019t been updated for ~30 years. They need to update the show or lower the",
          "we witnessed the 'show' from our hotel (pyramids valley boutique hotel giza) and must say: even if we missed most of it, we didn't miss much. Yes, they illuminate the pyramids - which is nice - but they also talk a lot or better a recording tells some kind of story which takes",
          "The superlatives offered by others were confirmed by our experience. BTW: On the night we visited there were plenty of seats. Save yourself EP 50 and don't bother with the VIP seating. Plenty of room to roam the viewing area.",
          "stayed across from the pyramids and great sphinx, so I saw the light show every night from my balcony. it starts at 8:00 pm, many tourist buses arrive, along with the light show there is a commentary on the history of the area, not expensive ticket, good seating, very safe, a",
          "This should have been spectacular, but on a cool new year's eve night. it just did not wow me. It goes on for like 45 minutes and the pyramids are lit up and they tell a story. After seeing them from the desert earlier in the day I just thought there would be more to this. So I",
          "Why you should watch this and important tips: 1. Gives a good idea of Egyptian history and the pyramids 2. Preferably watch this in the beginning of your trip 3. If you are going in winter, wear the best of winter clothing. Its extremely cold and windy 4. Reach atleast 30mins",
          "The show starts in the evening. It's an open place and very cold during winter. The lighting is average and repetitive. The music and narrative is not that impressive as it could be. Overall an average show. The most important question is whether this show is causing any harm to",
          "It is not a show by any stretch of imagination. A few projected pictures of poor quality, and a voice of a narrator. Nothing else.",
          "the sound and light show starts after dusk. The lighting of the pyramids and the Sphinx is spectacular. Seeing the pyramids lighted, and the Sphinx with detail lazered on to it, was moving and help us imagine what it looked like when first built. The accompanying music and",
          "The show is in English. The show is both informative & entertaining. It is worth the time & money. Very well executed.",
          "A big NO. I do not recommend this one. It is ridiculously priced with less than an hour of confusing script of history and there are cars coming down from the right side of the hill with their lights on & that adds on to ruining the whole impression of historical moment.",
          "I guess this is one of the tourist things to do so we did it. But we had just spent the whole day seeing all the pyramids and so the story was old. Loved seeing the Sphinx lit up gave it character.",
          "This is a must do for all going to Egypt and visiting the pyramids at Giza. Here the history is set in front of your eyes in a beautiful sitting arrangement in front of the 3 great pyramids and the Sphinx. The scene is set with the Sphinx narrating the story from the beginning",
          "I highly recommend the extra for VIP. It's not much more but much better seats with padding and front row. You don't need to book ahead of time for VIP. There were plenty of seats.",
          "This light show could be much better than it actually is. I find that there is too much unnecessary narrative. There are good moments but not a true crescendo. They could have done much... Save your money.",
          "I liked it. Nothing to do with an American style show but engaging and finally something is available to better live the experience. Worthwhile doing it for sure.",
          "I first saw the light show 20yrs ago. It hasn\u2019t changed one bit. It is kind of hokey and the pharaohs would not be pleased with it, but it is neat to learn a bit more of the history of pyramids. The chairs are metal, not very comfortable, and it gets a bit chilly during the",
          "The setting is so amazing that it makes the whole landscape look like a natural stage. Short 45 minutes lightshow in English. Please take a tripod along for those epic long exposure shots. Also. Carry a jacket in the winter months.",
          "We paid 36usd for this show and it is not worth it. What a pity as there is so much potential to narrate a very interesting part of history with more modern lights and sound effects. It seems that this show is outdated and has not seen any improvement for a long time. These are",
          "This recreates history in a very unique way. The face of the sphinx in hologram is the icing on the cake.",
          "On a winter's night in Giza we were treated to a spectacle of the history of the pyramids. The show is narrated by the famous late Omar Sharif. The story of each of the pyramids is enhanced by the lighting. The river nile and the sphinx get their credit too. Easy to watch, done",
          "Just back from the sound and light show of Giza pyramids. Lots of history but no modernization in the light show. Looks they have not made any changes in the show since ages. As it was in our bucket list, we went. Nothing great but can't miss it if you are near the pyramids.",
          "I've wanted to see this show since it was featured in a James Bond movie and luckily we were staying close by in Giza so we didn't have to deal with a lengthy drive as traffic is a nightmare. The show itself is very outdated - I don't think it's been updated in the 40+ years",
          "In this modern day and age, this might not amuse the younger generation, but I really liked the history that was presented, and seeing the pyramids and the Sphinx lit at night was awesome. I think some new technology was added to make the Sphinx talk. We attended in October",
          "We went to the sound and light show with great expectations, but it turned out to be a boring fare. There was a monotonous story telling with lighting just going on and off on the pyramids and the sphinx. Overall boring.",
          "It was on my ''to see\" list of Cairo, but now i'm not so sure it worth. It was too expensive for what it offers. The price is 250 LE not in the front rows/ 300 LE first 5 rows . The show itself it's average. A voice telling the stories of the pharaohs and sphinx, lights changing",
          "Some devices to listen the show doesn\u2019t works properly, but the show is wonderful and I recommend the special place behind the chairs where offered you a drink for one d\u00f3lar is even better than the first row.",
          "We witnessed The Sound and Light show from our Hotel Balcony which was bang opposite to the Great Pyramids. Initially, We were contemplating if we should visit this sound and light show. But later thought that we can see it from our balcony. This show is pretty ordinary and",
          "We had to do this and it was excellent. Night time at the Pyramids, you are so very close. History and myths spoken, changing lights and front row seats. Yes, lots of people and lots of lighted cell phones but I thought it quite exciting to be there at night and yes, eat",
          "We really didn't find the show that interesting, and it's not cheap. You listen to an hour of historical commentary while lights turn on and off on the pyramids. I wouldn't really call it a show. Again, just not interesting. I'd say pass on this one. Plenty else to do.",
          "The Light & Sound Show at the Pyramids / Sphinx complex at Giza, Egypt was a memorable experience. Especially to us as we had studied Egyptian archaeology as students. The show, which lasts about 45 minutes, is in English (translations are available, I guess, for the VIP seats)",
          "Many will pronounce this attraction as cheesy or corny. I saw a number of people sleeping through it. The Sound portion, a rambling narration with a regal music, sounds much like the soundtrack from a 1950s Biblical epic movie: grand dialogue, of course with a British accent",
          "Remember James Bond, \"The Spy Who Loved Me\"? Yes, this is the show that's in that movie. There are few things different, but one cool thing is Sir Anthony Hopkins' voice. He's a great narrator, so it added more magic to the whole experience. Seeing the Pyramids & Sphinx at night",
          "It is a very good show and highly recommended. Mid November was very cold in the evening so go well prepared",
          "We stayed at a hotel bang opposite the entrance to the sound and light show and heard as well as saw the show. Quite good - the light, the commentary and the overall presentation. Worth a see.",
          "It's okay! We had a fantastic view from our hotel rooftop so we didn't need to pay entrance and could see everything for free. The sound track reminds me of a 1960's Star Trek episode but it's full of information and stories and when all the Pyramids get lit up it makes for good",
          "This just isn\u2019t worth the money... the story is super cheesy and doesn\u2019t even really make sense. People try to take photos the whole time and stand in the isles or smoke. They don\u2019t event light up the pyramids so you can see them all at once (aside from about 2mins). If I had it",
          "Do not expect something extraordinary. The pyramids just change colours and there is narration about the kings and queens. Kinda gets boring after a while.",
          "Although the show itself is not the best in technology, it's somewhat interesting, as a story is told while the lights illuminate the pyramids and the Sphynx. The pyramids are in a fact a show per se when you enter the site is absolutely impressive to see their shades at night.",
          "This was a lights and lasers production illuminating the Sphinx and pyramids to a cheesy voiceover script. I did not feel it was worth the time or the money, although some members of our tour seemed to like it. It totally pales in comparison to everything else there is to see in",
          "I mean if you really don\u2019t have anything else to do, then sure. But it wasn\u2019t anything like I thought it would be. And if I\u2019ve seen some lovely light and sound shows. The lights are average and the narration is quite boring. I thought I would see some lovely visuals on the",
          "Hmmm, I think my expectations were going a different direction versus what this show actually does. If you are into listening to history for 45 mins in the cold, then go ahead. If you expect a Vegas Bellagio type of light show... save your money and do something else like",
          "We weren\u2019t sure what to expect with this show but it was our first night in Giza & we hadn\u2019t planned anything else. While we were ultimately glad we did it, the commentary could certainly use a refresh - it sounds like it was recorded in the 50s & never updated.",
          "Nice to see this light show It takes you back to the Egyptian period I was time and again taken back",
          "The Light and Sound show is a great program you can go to in Cairo in the evening. We had a wonderful experience at the show. The show goes on for about an hour in the evening around 7 pm. It talks about the history of the pyramids and it is a great sight of the lit pyramids in",
          "Decided we should see this touristic event at the pyramids. It was crowded and not terribly clean. However it did offer an introduction to Egyptian history with fantastic lit images of the pyramids. Went with a private guide. Would not try to get there by yourself.",
          "In the evening you must go to visit this spectacular show. The lighting is superb. The narration is also very good. You will have an Idea of the history of these pyramids by listening to this.",
          "We reached Cairo in the late afternoon and wanted some light activity to spend time. Our hotel (Le meridian) was right opposite the pyramids and decided for light and sound show and get overall perspective. What we realized later that the entry is from the other end (one can",
          "a great spectacle where you get to apprecciate the pyramids in a different perspective. For the whole family",
          "They sell very expensive tours. We recommend to go but use uber and buy the ticket yourself otherwise it will be like 40 euros per person. If you do it your self it will be like 250 LE. They sell another ticket in the first row for 300 LE but it is both worth it is almost the",
          "We were lucky enough to see and hear this Show from the rooftop of our hotel - Marvel Stone Hotel. Unsure what the cost is as it was free from this hotel location. It's a great show which last approx 45mins. The light show was spectacular from up above - don't think it would",
          "Very poor. Nothing especial. You will pay for seeing pyramid lit only. a story told but not documenhtary. without data or historical facts and little gratifying. It does not contribute anything and it is quite boring. the light show is very poor. It consists simply in",
          "Nothing great really. Thankfully we didn't have to pay for it and if you get a view from your room, thats all you will need.",
          "Great and most wonderful experience, Light and sound show is must watch show. Very well historic background explained with lights and sound effects.",
          "Incredible show ... the history, the lights and the sound... all together makes a beautiful thing to remember. A must see!!!!",
          "It is amazing show takes you to great history of the pharous never miss when you visit Cairo The only thing I didn't like is the area around",
          "In our group some liked the show others didn't. Personally I loved it & was glad I saw it. The projection of a pharoah's head on the sphinx as a narrator was done very well. Even though the pyramids are a kilometre or two away, when lit up they seemed close enough to touch.",
          "Honestly it\u2019s not worth a money and especially your time. Its like a fairy tail for the kids projected on the stone in front of the Sphinx and pyramids are lighted by different colors.",
          "if you want to listen to the ancient history so you have to start with that show which is start everyday at 7.40 pm",
          "1950\u2019s English voice over is worth a listen. Show takes a long time but could be condensed easily. Lots of tourists using flash cameras spoil the show.",
          "The Pyramids are truly mesmerising, the light and sound show is just a touch dated. This doesnt detract from this being something worth doing when in the city. The lighting is good but the dialogue is in serious need of being updated. Also keep an eye on the pricing for the",
          "We saw the show from our hotel terrace, without paying, so I can't compare what you get to what you pay :P, but the show was nice with infos about the pyramids. We liked it! The first one starts at 19:30, in english and another one at 20:30 in other languages (we hear french and",
          "If you visit Cairo, you need to visit the Sound and Light show, I enjoyed and my family, the family tickets can cost you 30 euro. We would like to have more shows about the ancient Egyptian.",
          "To be honest I was expecting a bit more. Don't get me wrong, the show was good and the narrative very interesting but with such spectacular props (Pyramids and Sphinx) I think they could do so much better with their light show.",
          "Spectacular show. Magic colours and a really nice voice telling us about the history. It is very powerful. Enjoy it inside or outside the area or from a hotel roof.",
          "We saw the show tonight Sept. 4th, 2018. We arrived today in Egypt, had a half day tour and wanted to close the night with something nice. The show is very nice, the Pyramids and Sphinx look impressive when lit up and it's a great picture opportunity. But best of all was Tamer",
          "Could be better show. It was nice but in terms of show weak. Have some information about the faraos , but for someone who seen light show at Disneyworld it's very weak. They Should prepared a better light show. It has a place for purchase some light food at this place. But be",
          "We had been to the Pyramids several times before, but this was our first time to the Sound & Light show. After grabbing a bite at the Marriott near the Pyramids and enjoying the spectacular view we headed to the Pyramids in time for the show. The show lasted 45 minutes but it",
          "This was a stunning, spectacular show which fully lived up to its billing. Just one thing - next time I'll go when the commentary is in English language",
          "seeing pyramids lit up in different colors was pretty but not worth the price and length of show. Better to watch from roof top coffee bar.",
          "Granted that the pyramids and Sphinx are absolutely incredible when you get to see them during the day, it\u2019s unbelievable how even more mystical they get at sunset...Right before the show begins, you find yourself gazing at such a wonder surrounded by the silence of the desert",
          "This show is a innovative and interesting as a 1920\u2019s film. To call it a light show in 2018 is a huge exaggeration. I couldn\u2019t bare to watch it for free from the my hotel rooftop. Don\u2019t waste your money!",
          "The sound and light show in Giza is absolutely spectacular! The Pyramids and the Sphinx are illuminated with different colored lights. The Sphinx is the storyteller and you learn about the history of the pyramids, the Pharaos and much more - accompanied with beautiful,dramatic",
          "You\u2019re in Cairo. You\u2019ve traveled hundreds, even thousands, of miles to see the pyramids. Why would you skip the light show? It\u2019s less than $20US per person. Here\u2019s how to do it. You go to the Hayat Pyramid View Hotel or any other nearby. You go to the rooftop terrace, sit down",
          "We Loved the sound and light show at the pyramids. It was impressive display of history... It was a chilly evening and blankets were available for a price. We really enjoyed the show. Must see this to grasp the pyramids history.",
          "So, my husband saw the exact same show, and I mean the exact same - 30+ years ago! But I enjoyed it! The lights on the pyramids were beautiful, the sound was good, and it would be great for a family with kids. We went the night we arrived and I was just awestruck by the fact",
          "I hoped to see a modern laser-show. Instead I saw and heard an old-fashioned story. I saw all sound and light shows available along the Nile, this was in my opinion the most corny. Despite sitting in the frontrow and enjoying a nice view over the pyramids and sphinx the show",
          "We paid a bit extra to be seated right up front, which was a Great Idea! Got some really Awesome Pics. Bring a light jacket or coat as it could get a bit nippy out there at night. The Show was Fantastic!, we felt as if we were in the Movies watching the performance Live",
          "Saw all or part of 8 shows from hotel balcony or restaurant (Pyramids View Inn). Would have been disappointed if I paid for it. Silly story and area is so vast, the lighting is somewhat subdued.",
          "The excitement and anticipation was more than the actual show. I was expecting a musical laser show, but it was more of a history lesson that is narrated by the Sphinx. There were dogs that kept barking during the show. There was a man there that said we could not take",
          "The first visit in cairo before visiting any historical places is the sound and light show. The Sphinx explains the major dynasties of ancient Egypt. why the pyramids were built and how the pyramids were built. the Geography of ancient Egypt and how the Nile was flowing near",
          "Well done and very interesting. Choose to pay a bit extra and get a front row seat even though am sure the is view fine from further back. There are sessions in different languages so need to check when yours is 'playing'. We didn't go on a 'tour' but just took a taxi and",
          "My husband and I took a tour of Egypt in April 2018. Our first glimpse of the pyramids would be this light show, which we had very much looked forward to. However, although we were duly impressed by seeing the pyramids for the first time, the light show was a huge",
          "Shirene was not able to accompany us to the light show but Shirenes driver took us and he was always quite polite.",
          "This is a very dated production. The music, narration, and light harkens to the good old 1970s. The idea of it is alluring. My 12 year old saw a preview and couldn't live another hour without going to it. But it's not what it's cracked up to be.",
          "Pyramids in the day is massive, breathtaking and extravaganza. Pyramids in twilight are just lovely with sunset sky and moon in the background. The sound and light show is a good way of story telling. A must see event for families with kids. very educative.",
          "The light show was underwhelming, we did it the last night in town. It was recommended by our guide, his only miss. issues, music and updating in desperate needs.",
          "I stayed right in front at my hotel and watched the show in English French and Arabic each night for free from our balcolony.",
          "I was so lucky enough to be staying at best view pyramids so got to see the light show from the rooftop of the hotel every evening. A good show",
          "just start by saying that I didn't pay for this as were staying at Pyramid Inn Hotel that has excellent views of the Giza plateau, This show is not essential viewing if you only have short time in Cairo, and the Luxor one at Karnak is better as you actually walk around and feel",
          "This show in the backdrop of the Sphinx and Khafre pyramid is a grand colourful spectacle. The sombre voice explains the history of Egypt , the pyramids and the Sphinx. It is worth a visit. Generally everyone rushes in to occupy the centre seats. But you must try to take the",
          "This show is good. Just be sure the language it is presented in is what you need before purchasing tickets as they are different on some days. Most of the time it is English. Get there early for a good seat.",
          "Excellent sound & light show when in Cairo well worth seeing lasted about 1 hour cost approx \u00a35 to go in",
          "The place is crap, management keeps smoking, no one gives a Damm about not clicking pictures with flas on and the show itself is so poorly executed that we felt sleepy in the first 15 mins. Not worth going don't waste time or money.",
          "This outdoor Sound & Light Show in Giza is a very nice introduction to that spesific part of the history of Egypt. It tells the ancient story of the Pyrymands and Sphinx and the different colour lights makes for a very entertaining evening. (Weather permitting).",
          "I think many of the reviews have covered this well. Seeing the Pyramids lit up is something to be seen but the rest of the show was not great. At times it was hard to follow and the laser lighting seemed pretty basic and the show very dated. There were other basic things",
          "A very enjoyable show. Try and get a seat near the front on the right side to get the best view. Gives you a summary of what you are going to see in Egypt.",
          "If you are suitably overwhelmed by the pyramids then this show is well worth a visit, it tells the story of the 3 pyramids with an amazing holographic show and naration. Well worth it.",
          "Was it cool to see the pyramids lit up at night? Yes. Would I do it again? No. Everyone who says this show needs to be revamped/updated is correct. I have only seen the show once but you can tell it has never been updated. And with the technology today, the lights can be far",
          "The show it tacky, the laser effects are not impressive and the story not coherent. HOWEVER, seeing the pyramids lit under the night sky whilst the stars were shining, it worth every single euro. I recommend paying the 50 extra Egyptian pounds to stay in the first row just to",
          "I first visited Egypt in 1984 and I remember being enthralled by this sound and light show. This time round, we stayed in a hotel overlooking the sound and light site and so had free views of this. I've got to say, that I was really disappointed this time as the whole show",
          "We got it from the roof of an hotel and I must admit I would never pay for this. Really poor and not great as the sorrounding would need. I didn\u2019t not suggest it.",
          "I read on someone's blog before our Egypt vacation that this sound and light show isn't worth the money, but you can see all the lights from the Pizza Hut across the street. So we didn't pay to see the show but we went to Pizza Hut for dinner and drinks to watch it. You could",
          "Amazing show, along with well developed story. We watched it on the last day of our trip and it says all. Enjoyed each frame of it.",
          "The Sound and Light Show at the Pyramids of Giza was a major letdown for me. I expected an exciting light show but it was a long, drawn out, recorded oration by a man with a boring, monotone voice. There were a few lights that turned on and lit up the pyramids in the distance",
          "Not worth your time unless you've got a long trip like we had (8 days) with extra nights to spare. I fell asleep during it because the voices of the narrators couldn't keep my attention. Needs some work and it could be really awesome. Maybe they could get some tips from Sydney?",
          "We enjoyed the whole sound and light show - they have done a good job of telling the stories of the pyramids and the sphinx whilst using the artefacts to help tell the story. Get close to the front if you can as you get the best view there. Even in summer it can get very cold",
          "Nightlife, especially with children in tow, is a bit complicated in Cairo so we took the advice of our tour company to check out this show. It was not particularly well-done, and while the pyramids are amazing to look at, you might enjoy sitting on your hotel balcony in the",
          "A bit dull, the lights on the Sphinx were the best. The voices were rather odd - sounded a bit like the guy from the carry on films. The history was sort of interesting if you're into that. By the end it did seem to go off on a tangent telling a few old weird myths. Take a",
          "Save your money and watch this from the pyramids valley hotel you get a better view undercover and you can have a drink at the same time",
          "Really cool sound and light show. We were at the roof of marvil stone hotel and looked at it. It starts every night at 7pm and is in english, then later at night the show is in arabic. Tells the history of the three pyramids",
          "The lights and effects are great. The audio was ok .. some voices were loud and clear and some not so much. The commentary didn't work so much for me. The cool breeze made it more difficult to focus. A good experience since I didn't do any other sound and light show anywhere in",
          "The Sound and Light show is charming. The seats are close to the Sphinx and Pyramids. Omar Sharif reads the narration. The location makes for a great experience as the Pyramids and Sphinx are lit up.There is a cafe and toilets nearby.",
          "This is a very over rated show. Our expectations had been built up by tour guides and others but it was a sub-par experience. The story line is weak and apart from the three pyramids and the sphinx being lit up in turns there's really nothing else. Don't waste your money or time",
          "It was cold the night we were there, but we still enjoyed seeing this very much. Very well done. Lights and sounds...",
          "The show was narrated by Omar Sharif (one of my favourite actors!); the delivery was good, but the content was not very illuminating",
          "It is must visit, although if you have done the Day Visit to the Pyramid. The Light Shows are good in short form historicity of Egypt. As during our visit the weather is clod, so it is very important to wear something thick or you may rent the blanket from the counter.",
          "This was the best Light n Sound Show I saw in my life..Narrated by Omar Sheriff I was spellbound as how the Pyramids were explained their structure and how the Mummification took place ..their rooms and ante chamber shown..a must visit",
          "I don\u2019t remember ever having seen a light show before, so I didn\u2019t know exactly what to expect. Overall, I thought it was rather enjoyable, although, after a while the lighting effects became repetitive and the music and narration monotonous. Still, it is certainly worth seeing.",
          "Beautiful Pyramids lit up at night but waste of money and time. The show is outdated with monotone recorded history with occasional lights showing the Pyramids and Sphinx.",
          "Save money and take in the show from a restaurant that is close buy and you can watch the show and get a meal for about the same price.",
          "The time of the yar is important while attending to this show. \u0131n winter it might be quite cold so try to wear thick clothes.so many seating places inside so need to worry.try to film it rather than taking pictures. the wiev is fascinating.",
          "An ancient site, a warm and starry night, pyramids lighting up from the darkness ... it should all result in a magical night. Not quite. It's not a terrible experience ... I mean, just imagine where you are. But it could be sooo much better! The script is in desperate need of",
          "This is so so. Old recording done in the style of the old 10 commandments movie. It\u2019s cool how it\u2019s lit up at night.",
          "There are sound and light shows all over the world, but this must be just about the most historically magical venue in the world. Because of that I suppose I would recommend it, but I do have several provisos. The laser lights are projected onto the pyramids and sphinx. This",
          "Nice show for the night photographers out there. The shows give a brief history of each monument/pyramid. I wouldn't make a trip just for the show unless your just trying to get some good night shots.",
          "Booked through a Travel Tour site and discovered tickets at the door were selling for much less than what we had paid online. Anyway it was a total waste of time. Don't bother going.",
          "We were concerned about seeing the pyramids and sphinx at night before we visited in the day light, but we actually enjoyed the day visit more because we learned so much from the night time light show. It is a little bit lame and could use some updating, audio sounds like a",
          "We were advised against this one and opted for Karnak instead. We looked at seating during the day, it looked ok but would be crowded and seating is on one level. I\u2019m told the light shows are better on Luxor and Karnak. We met other tourists in our hotel who had and were",
          "It was a nice show with the pyramids and the sphinx being lit up as history was being told in the background. Please wear something warm when you visit this place. Being open air and in the evening it is windy. Even my mobile was shaking whilst I took pictures",
          "Not worth to see the show, it feels like watching Sindbad movie from 60\u2019s. If you have nothing to do in the evening then you can visit. It\u2019s better to take local taxi and make a deal with him to wait for 50 mins so he can take you back to your hotel, you can buy tickets for the",
          "You know those older films that begin with a narration over an animation before the live acting started? Well this seemed exactly like one. The lighting and stories are interesting. The setting is obviously impressive. I\u2019m not sure the price as it was included in our tour, but",
          "It's a good show! Takes you through history! The surround sound is marvelous! And love the lights too! At a point, it gets tiring and begins to feel like staring into the abyss :)",
          "It is a very good experience to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx at night - in colors! It is a 45 minutes show. The speaker system is not great, so we missed quite a few details in the audio part of the show. But the view was great and we were happy about it. It is overpriced,",
          "This was part of our package, so I don't know how much we paid for it. I tell you, I won't recommend it even if it's free. There is this monotonous narrative with pink light here, and blue light there - and if you are very new to Egyptian history, nothing will make sense,",
          "it will be so interesting if you like the Egyptian history and want to know more about the Egyptian history and and it will be veryyy boring if you do not like the history.",
          "The light n sound show should not be missed at any cost.It gives us an account of the historical background of the Pyramids n Sphinx and is indeed well narrated.Have a leisurely dinner at one of the many typical Egyptian restaurants in the vicinity n then enjoy the show.Under",
          "Unfortunately this light show wasn\u2019t what we thought it would be. It\u2019s was 45 minutes of monotone recorded history with occasional lights shown in the pyramids and Sphinx. It may be my fault since I thought it would be dazzling laser lights with upbeat rhythmic music blasting",
          "We visited the Sound & Light Show as part of our Luxury Escapes experience to Egypt. We paid $60 US for a VIP ticket which included entrance, transportation and tour escort from our hotel. Along the way we were treated to a freshly squeezed sugar cane drink which was delicious",
          "In case you have the time then you must see this show else plan in a way that you get to spend some time here.It is a must see attraction.",
          "The thought of seeing the pyramids at night all grand and lighted sounded really awesome but it turned out to be a little of a disappointment and especially when we paid usd50 per pax to sit and watch some old fashion story telling and lights movement. It somehow did not bring",
          "We watched the show from the hotel rooftop and truly enjoyed it. The presentation is a little dated but very good overall. My wife referred to it as being from the original Star Trek series from the 60's.",
          "Theatrical take on the history of the Giza pyramids and the area, as told by the Sphinx, who sounds a lot like Omar Sharif. It's a sound and light show, so it's meant to be kitsch. Good overview of the history and a bit of local colour to the stories. Lasts just under an hour -",
          "Would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't exhausted from a full day of touring the Pyramids. Great history of the Pyramids and the creators.",
          "Pyramids looked fabulous when they were lit, the light show lasts 1 hour, some teenagers may find this boring or dragging a bit",
          "Expected more. Boring, most of the time you spend in darkness, listening to boring voice telling the legend of Pyramids with theatrical voice. The ligts are nothing special. In my country the castles and churches are lighted much better, for free, and during all night. Pyramids",
          "We were excited to see the Sound & Light Show at the Pyramids but were disappointed! Tickets were priced at EGP200 and the VIP tickets which entitles you to be seated in the front 3 rows were priced at EGP225. We found the show to be extremely commercialised, slow, and most of",
          "If you like the Egyptian culture and its history this is surely worth a visit. There's nice original voices speaking and music playing which gets you back in the days instantly. Also a great light show!",
          "We did this on our first evening in Giza. Guess couldn't wait till the morning to see the majestic pyramids! I found the whole thing a bit too dramatic and outdated.. it was more interesting to hear the same history from our guide the next morning. You still want to do this",
          "Visited sphinx Square for sound and light show being conducted at 7.00 pm. It's open space with chairs for hundreds of guests to sit. Entry is smooth one can occupy seat for a flow of information for about 40 minutes explaining every minute thing associated with egyptolgy. All",
          "Have you ever wondered how life has been for thousands of years? These ideas inspired the artists to take you there, briefly, by creating a sound and light show. , And imagine the power of the rule of the ancient Egyptians. The artists created brilliantly a wonderful show that",
          "Seeing this show was a lifetime dream. It did not dissappoint. I had chills and by the end tears (happy). So thrilling. Must do when in Cairo",
          "Attend this show without fail,before visiting Giza pyramids.Orchestrated with complete information of the history pharaohs and their life.",
          "There are sound and light shows at the Egyptian sites all over the country. This is one of them. It is, however, very cool to see the pyramids and sphinx lit up. The show is only an hour, so its a good way to spend some time before dinner. To be honest, the voice over is",
          "In a chilly winter evening this was a great event which we enjoyed on our day of arrival. Depiction of History thru laser light n sound were fantastic. Can't manage to miss it. Knowledge sharing was unique and narration with lights were awesome.",
          "Good opportunity to know everything about history by photos with sound explanation with music affection . its translated to many languages . cheap ticket and worth to try it",
          "Not worth the money we paid for the entrance, and what was sold as amazing light and sound show. The sound was amazing (read loud) and the lights were dim and dull around the pyramids. I felt bored halfway through hearing a mono voice talking about history of Egypt.",
          "The sound and light show was quite stunning visually, as you sit directly in front of the Sphinx and the three main pyramids of Giza. I learned some history and laughed at the melodramatic audio presentation! In January, it was quite chilly at night. We were a tad under-dressed",
          "3 shows in different languages every evening, the first is in English. This is fun, the voices and characters are old fashioned but interesting, the music very dramatic and any extra time you can spend looking at the pyramids is time well spent",
          "We went here in the night and saw this. Very beautiful and informative. Its really a must to go for this",
          "We all are see the Sound and Light Show. We are like it but some difficulty to take photograph, arrangement of chairs. it is not in sloping mode. Lighting arrangements not proper to see the structure. Story is good.",
          "The light and sound show is an excellent narration of ancient history of Egypt , the Pharoahs , the high priest and the 5000 year old civilisation . The brief script alog with laser lightings and audio visual aids makes it quite interesting and appealing. A pleasent experience.",
          "Well worth the visit. On a beautiful evening there is no better way to spend it. The narration is in English and the lighting is spectacular. Lasts 45 minutes and gives you a great location to see a panorama of the pyramids and Sphinx. Suggest arriving 45 minutes early to get a",
          "Don't use this agency because there was no sense of schedule planning or professionalism. My husband and I were on our honeymoon and lets say this agency really affected our time in Egypt. We lost a night because the agency did not plan accordingly to the traffic in Egypt. The",
          "After visiting the Giza Pyramids during the day, it is interesting to here the history retold and explained while lights and music highlight the various structures in the areas. It's a very tourist attraction, but, hey, you're in Egypt with such amazing and unique pyramids",
          "We expected this to be cheesy, and yes, it was a little. But it was also a colorful, entertaining history of Egypt. I've heard people complain how impossible it is to photograph, but I got great shots with my cell phone (Samsung, which does well in low-light). It was pretty",
          "I am not sure what I was expecting but this was not it. If you love story telling history then you will love it as it goes through the history of the area but personally I found it hard to follow and the lights were not spectacular. It\u2019s basically watching a slide show projected",
          "I can not believe that one of the wonders of the world has such as stupid and old fashioned light show. Don't expect to get nice pictures as the advertising shows. It was the most expensive ticket in 4 cities in Egypt and the most disappointing. Go to the mall of Egypt or mall",
          "We went to this and chose only one Sound and Light show of the many we would come across throughout Egypt because everyone raves about these shows. Our guide recommended the Pyramids over Luxor, so that\u2019s what we did. First, it\u2019s incredibly long. We fortunately had great",
          "What promises to be an interesting experience in the first 2min, ends up being a huge disappointment for the next 58min. The show is vey dated, feels cheesy and unless you have a DSLR on a tripod with an extremely fast shutter speed, none of your pictures will come out crisp. I",
          "The setting was incredible. And it was really cool, being the background for a James Bond movie of the 1970s. But really, when was this recorded? THREE assertions that the construction is so excellent that the Jewish slaves who built the pyramids must have been happy and",
          "Nice Light Show but not spectacular at all. They should be able to make something better because it is a unique area but not at the level. The lights shows at Luxor, Philae and Abu Simbel are really splendid",
          "Whatr a lovely show. You are transported to the Pharonic times.A very well designed show. The seating arrangement is good. However, in the open air it was very very cold. We had to hire warm Blankets to keep ourselves comfortable.A definite Must See to have a complete feel of",
          "The sound and light show at the Giza plateau is not to be missed. The voicing of the opening has been featured in movies and stories and the show provides a magnificent perspective on the antiquity and grandeur of the treasures of Giza. Seeing the Sphinx with a full face is a",
          "If you are going, go on your own, take a taxi or Uber. Ticket is just 150 EGP (8 USD) but our tour company charged us 30 USD per person. While some sights of lighted pyramids are nice, the commentary is not so great, they could have used more professional English speaker and",
          "In summer it is great to stay in the opened area infront of Sphinx and watch the show, it seems that you hear a voice coming from the Sphinx, in winter it is not so warm at night so please take your jaket or rent a blanket 10 Egyptian pounds from the sound and light place, it is",
          "The Show is nice but it takes a long time to arrive to Pyramids at night, especially on Thursday. If it is autumn, make sure that you take a light coat with you.Don\u2019t expect much, then you will like it more.",
          "Nice to see the show but it is very cold. Blanket for rent. It's a little bit long, but you can have different language.",
          "This is a good show to attend. Sometimes hard to hear but overall it is worth the ticket to see it. Give really good picture taking opportunities.",
          "Quick tips: - The show is best watched after you have done visiting all pyramids, Egyptian museum and the Cairo day tour. This will ensure you have enough background knowledge to understanding the content of this show; else it will be just few laser lights and colourful",
          "The Sphinx and the pyramid background is so awesome and impressive that they can make a mediocre production look great. The lights part of the show is excellent, but the narrative and sounds are copy pasted from a 1940s movie and sometimes comedic, which some might find",
          "Took children 7 and 8 years. Was probably 10 mins too long. It was very informative and I think I needed more info to enjoy the story more. We went on first night we arrived in Cairo. The sphinx and front ruin were lit really well. We could see from our seats. Lots of people",
          "We went there to complete our trip of Giza Pyramids and we loved it. Awesome experience, open air theatre with lights and sound explaining the rich egyptian history and pyramids and sphinx in the background what else do you need. Entry tkts costs approx 135/150 LE pp. Three",
          "The show was great ! Not as Disney land magic show but it worth the experience. We where lucky to meet Mr Hani Abdulrahman ,public relation manager , who was extremely helpful in directing us where to go If you come during this time of the year then prepare yourself for a",
          "We joined this tour on our second night in Cairo. The show was not very engaging and the techniques were dated. It included good history of ancient Egypt but lacked the wow factor to keep the audience engaged. The lighting was interesting for about 5 minutes but became",
          "Well set up with comfortable seating. Excellent pictures and sound explaining much I didn't know. DVD available",
          "A truly nostalgic experience - very old-fashioned lighting, exceedingly melodramatic music, and totally non-PC commentary such as that we shouldn't feel sorry for the slaves who built the Pyramids, because they were lucky to have lived at such a momentous time. And every few",
          "It can be cool at night during the show. Bring a coat or blanket, blankets are available for use. The show takes place at the base of the pyramids, at a rock wall. The pyramids are displayed in colour and the story of the ancients is very much an event to see and hear.",
          "The show is old fashion, with a funny British 80's accent, However, it is nice way to hear some of Egypt histoty, and to see the pyramids lit at night, Bring something warm, and just relax and enjoy.",
          "It is certainly good and worth watching . But the narration , lighting and presentation can be improved especially in view of the fact that the pyramids at Giza are the oldest wonder of the world . It would be good to keep the lights on for some time after the completion of the",
          "This show is 1 hr long. The show requires a revamp as old English is used for the show. Not able to sustain interest for a long narration. The lights showing is not so spectacular but if you are curious and want to see how it lights up you can sit at the back for 10-15min and",
          "Firstly, the Pyramids are in themselves so very awesome that lighting them up in lurid colours seems almost sacrilegious. It's completely unnecessary, and I'm sure the ancient kings must be squirming at the effrontery. There was no need for this. Four massive stone structures do",
          "While the show is a bit dated, it was an interesting way to spend an evening in Cairo close to the hotel and without much hassle. If you\u2019re expecting an Orlando Disney World style light extravaganza, you\u2019ll be disappointed. If you\u2019re expecting an interesting evening seeing the",
          "it was amazing experience for me...during light show they are telling about there history which is good for us because most of us don't know anything about that...atleast you will get little idea",
          "We heard about the light show and had high expectations. The sound was rather hard to hear. When the pyramids were lighted it was powerful but thats it. I am glad we didn't pay to see this. We saw everything from our hotel just in front of the sfinx and pyramids.",
          "Th sound and light show is well worth experiencing. I find the atmosphere of the Giza plateau by night very pleasing. You may or not like the show, but do go and experience these monumental sites under the stars.",
          "We attended the show the evening before we went to see the pyramids and the Sphinx and we found the experience to be absolutely amazing.... The changing, colorful lights projected on the Sphinx and the pyramids just in front of us, the sounds accompanying the images and the",
          "Saw the light show today. It\u2019s too simplistic for this day and era. There is technology to improve the light show and display to make it more spectacular. They should invest more in this to make the show worthwhile.",
          "We stayed at the Pyramids View Inn and were fortunate enough to enjoy the Sound and Light show while eating dinner on the rooftop balcony. The show is very interesting and is given in several different languages. It gives the history of the pyramids and Egypt through the",
          "When the sun sets and the tourists leave the Pyramids, enjoy the history of Egypt projected onto the Pyramids and Sphinx in bright colors and laser as you listen in English or by audio aid in other languages. This was a wonderful way to \"extend\" our day's adventure at Giza, plus",
          "You should try to go for this 1 hour show. Very nice surround sound and light effect. This is a good chance to see pyramid in the dark",
          "The sound and light show at Sphinx is good. Though the quality of presentation is high the content leaves much to be desired.",
          "This show was one of the experiences that tough to explain in words. But after experiencing Karnak light and sound I can say, This is worth but one must not miss the Karnak one as well. November evening was chilling cold with desert wind. The layered and warm cloths are highly",
          "The lighting along with an audio journey through the ages was an impressive event though the narrator sounded like a British voiceover from a 1950 Newsreel. The entire display lasted 50 minutes and really set the scene for the remainder of our adventure across ancient Egypt.",
          "We did this on our first day in Cairo which means we had not see anything at all till then so this was our first experience with the pyramids...... the light show was amazing but the narration & the sound left a lot to be desired. Also in today\u2019s age of laser & amazing",
          "The show is very out dated. It tells the story of the pyramids and the sphynx and lights up each in turn.it looks amazing but they could do so much better",
          "What can I say... we were promised by our guide to watch this with dinner ( also a letdown), but all we could see was the lighted tip of the pyramid changing colors.",
          "I wasn't too sure about this activity. However it turned out to be amazing. It was also very educational.",
          "Very intimate and mystical light show where you find out how was life in ancient Egypt and how pyramids were bild. Story is told by sfinks and Cheops. We were told ticket was 175 EGP but when we came there we realised that vas VIP first row hehe so I know that price others are",
          "The pyramids and sphinx are spectacular! The lights are spectacular as well. But the story line was hard to follow and cheesy. Way too long and most of our large group was ready to leave half way through. If I were to do it again, I'd look out my hotel window for 5 minutes at",
          "I was somewhat disappointed in the Light Show. The lighting was minimal with a lot of audio. Overpriced for the attraction.",
          "Good light show and picture opportunity to see the pyramids. Bit of a distance from the actual pyramids",
          "The Sound & Light Show at Giza takes you through the labyrinth of Egyptian History with such skill that midway through one becomes a part of the history rather than remaining a mute spectator. It is a must watch show, while in Egypt.",
          "We found the sound and light show was not very well done. It was a beautiful night but the show itself was minimally entertaining. At a minimum should have had bright lights illuminate to take pictures. I would recommend visiting during the day.",
          "One of the best shows you can't miss if you are visiting Cairo As it takes place by the pyramids of Giza",
          "For context, I am a huge history buff and James Bond fan (this show is in, \"The Spy Who Loves Me). The Sound and Light Show was dated and uninteresting. My recommendation is to visit the pyramids during the day with a guide and save yourself some money.",
          "It was nice, I saw the show for free from my hotel room and balcony. I don't know if it was a show I'd pay for but it was nice to hear the history",
          "Though I have not paid the price for the tickets to enter the complex, I have seen back to back two shows from the roof top restaurant of Great Pyramids Inn, which is just a stone's throw away. It is more of a sound than light show. I should describe it as an okay experience. It",
          "It was a new experience to see ahead of the three pyramids and the Sphinx. They tell the story of the Pharaos of that time who built them.",
          "After catching glimpses of the pyramids on our arrival we were very excited to see them and the Sphinx up close of course. Luckily we got to the show early as we could see them in the daylight as I am sorry to say that while the idea is great for the light show it is technically",
          "The show was not the best activity that can be done in Cairo. The story and voices are old and probably should be updated. It was a nice way to spend an hour whilst waiting to catch our late night flight.",
          "We wat he\u2019d the light show from the roof of our hotel - Best View Pyramids hotel rooftop restaurant. So beautiful and informative",
          "And it is beautiful. A good way to be introduced the evening before you tromp around the three great pyramids and take a camel ride and climb into the biggest tomb.",
          "Provides an insight into the pyramids and sphinx with light and sound. There are shows for different languages most days. It is worth paying a little extra for the VIP seats if you want to sit in the front row.",
          "Do not bother ! Such a waste of time If you\u2019ve seen the pyramids with an Egyptologist as part of your tour during the day, there is totally no need to do this in the evening. Enjoy your evening and spend the money elsewhere. It was a total waste of time & money. The only",
          "Egypt Tour - starts with sount & light show. One of most memorable & exciting show to learn about history. Nice place in front of great sphinx & pyramids.",
          "Very impressed with the light show. I found it to be very educational as well. We had front row seats and the evening weather was perfect.",
          "Very cool weather & good laser show. Only the audio could have had a little more clarity. But the background of pyramids & sphinx is awesome.",
          "I wouldn't pay for this show as you can enjoy it from any of the nearby rooftop restaurants. You may miss out on some of the lights on the Sphinx this way but the show itself seemed pretty dull. A few color changing lights and simple story.. a bit out dated but it was nice to",
          "I was so excited to watch the sound and light show at the pyramids. Unfortunately it was a let down. It lasts 50 minutes and the show is too slow and boring. If your are going to make a light show at the pyramids of Giza, make sure you ask HOLLYWOOD to give you some pointers on",
          "We had a long wonderful and busy 9 Days in Egypt, and our last day in Cairo was packed and because we were the only ones on our tour going to this, and we were tired, we almost skipped it. IM SO GLAD WE WENT! First of all: DRESS WARM!!!! ( or borrow a blanket from the hotel if",

          "A must to-do for every traveler visiting this ancient civilization. The story line is crisp. The lighting effect is dramatic. Comfortable seats. Almost empty with very few foreign travelers in September 2017. CLEAN toilets. Friendly staff. Annoying interruptions by a four",
          "Nice manner to show the Egyptian history, for which they can be proud of. View to pyramid an Sphinx is impressive.",
          "The Sound and Light Show at the Great Pyramids of Giza was started way back in 1961 & tells a fascinating story of the Sphinx, Mummification & the building of the Pyramids through a colourful laser projection & synchronized music & commentary. Imagine this happening on a starry",
          "Not really worth the money. You can see pretty much the same thing in a day trip. The light show was highly overrated.",
          "We had a great view of this show from our hotel. It was really cool! They provide the show in 3 different languages so everyone is accommodated. Definitely something to do when at the pyramids!",
          "This is much better than visiting the Sphinx day time. The lighting and the show are good. Overall recommended",
          "Hey, it was a nice good show but I can't say a fantastic one. It needs to be updated and enriched more. The story is funny but not having enough information about Ancient Egypt. The price is very good. You could try it one time for 175EGP the VIP ticket and the first row of",
          "It has an old world charm to it. In the night sky with the cool wind blowing and the pyramids and sphinx to gaze at with the stars, its a nice change... Dont expect too much and just go and enjoy it. If you are tight on budget then you can skip it.",
          "Don't miss this. The way they light up the pyramids and the view of the sphinx from the place you sit is awesome.Worth the money and time spent.",
          "Its different than the Pyramid sound and and light show in Mexico, which uses more laser lights.. This is more historical, rather touching because it is the voice of Omar Sharif narrating the history of the pyramid and the Sphinx. The pyramids are illuminated along with the",
          "This was absolutely terrible. Don't get me wrong the concept is great and the pyramids are incredible but this could be done so much better. The story is sooo slow, the sounds and voices are monotone and boring, the lights are dull. It definitely needs some more flare, more",
          "We think they did a good job with the storytelling and the sound effects. We were able to see the show from the rooftop of our hotel, but because of that weren't able to follow the storyline com-plete-ly. We still enjoyed the lighting 'though.",
          "Best way to see the pyramids and sphinx...as with the lights in the dark you can focus on a specific area when during the day you are just seeing everything together... The audio helps bring the whole thing to life...",
          "It was such an incredible experience to be able to watch that show in three different languages. The colors were spectacular and the story very cool. We really much enjoyed the entire experience.",
          "Having been on a number of tours I understand the importance of having a great tour guide, Egypt Guided Tours is the best I have ever had! The way that Mr. khattab and his team engaged the tour using a range of different techniques to connect with the group was genius. Their",
          "Omg this was so bad it was good. Going since 1961. We felt really rude but could not stop pissing ourselves laughing. The voice over so English, so BBC. Cliches abound. The lights solid colour blocks and outdated technology. It was truly awful and wonderful.",
          "A totally different experience when seeing the pyramids at night. There's a story and music played with different light projected on the pyramid and saphinx. Worth to go for the show or if you stay near the pyramids, perhaps you can just enjoy the show at your hotel.",
          "Its SUPER to see this show on those huge pyramids full of different colored lights and beautiful sound show !!",
          "The night time view of the three ancient pyramids was impressive. I was not sure what to expect, but the theatrical script (in English), the epic music of a late 50s/early 60s movie like Cleopatra, Moses or Ben Hur combined with the lights, history and light dusting of fact made",
          "Beautiful music and very moving to me as it was the first evening in Cairo and I had not had the chance to see the pyramids during the day. Great story although a little long. Got a bit cold by the end, just wish people did not use their phones constantly or got up to take",
          "This show should be amazing, right? It should be a true spectacle. But it falls short. I should offer that I watched it (or as much as I could take) a few times, as I was staying directly across the street. But I never watched it from within the amphitheater. That might have",
          "The seating area is crowded and visibility is poor. The light/laser show is rather silly. It could have been so much better. personally I thought the show was a scam. i'd rather see the pyramids and the Sphinx bathed in realistic lighting than reds and greens, etc. Some",
          "We had heard about the Sound and Light show at Pyramids. The hotel concierge offered to drive us there and back for $17 - we purchased the tickets to the show ourselves (150 EGP, about $8) This open theater is right in front of Valley Temple of Khafre , with his pyramid behind",
          "the show is OK but could do with some improvement. At the present tourist are few so no need to pay for the from row seats. I would not do this on its own but only travel to it if doing the pyramids during the day. check different days are in different languages.",

          "Unbelievable - this light and sound show began in 1961 - it's still the same. Dated and over-priced. I actually have an LP of the soundtrack from this time (1961). I repeat, that's 1961!!! It's titled Son Et Lumiere (Pyramids and Sphinx). Put out by the Ministry Of",
          "This is the best thing in Giza, its at 7:30 pm at night but its spectacular. Make sure you get the English or the language you want on the day of visit. They give you translators if you need. A must must must do. Tip: take the VIP ticket its 175 EGP (normal is 125 or 150), take",
          "there are so many other wonderful things to see.....drop this one, if you aren't sure. The story is interesting, and the music OK. however, the light show, and sound quality is not what most seasoned travelers would expect.....If you need your sleep to get up early to see",
          "Rather than the \"sound and lights show\" I was expecting (a variety of light colors, images, perhaps coordinated to beautiful Egyptian music with stunning laser images), it was a 1950's voiceover history lesson that occasionally light up the site with solid colors. It has so much",
          "Sit in the front right row of the theatre. Great views of the Pyramids behind the Sphinx makes for great pictures. Very informative. Quite cheap. Be aware of the barrage of people when you exit trying to sell you stuff",

          "I went to this against my own better judgement - and certainly wished I hadn't bothered. The sound was dreadful - booming and echoing. There was very little actual light show. For such great monuments, they were very poorly lit, including some some really tacky amateurish",
          "I found this very boring and I fell asleep a couple of times (I admit I was a bit jetlagged). There are cute strays hanging around to make animal friends with, but it was the history of the pyramids. I guess I expected something different?",
          "This was a truly impressive show. It was not crowded at all and was very informative. At night there are not very many people trying to sell things so was less stressful and more enjoyable.",
          "I never had a liking for these Sound and Light shows. Giza was no different. It could have been so much better.",
          "An interesting show and a different way to see the pyramids and learn a little of their history and the general history of ancient Egypt.",
          "After spending a week in Egypt I did this on my last night. I found it quiet boring and was expecting a lot more exciting lights and story line. Maybe I would have found it more exciting if I did it at the start of my holiday.",
          "Maybe because I expected a Jean Michael Jarre' style soundtrack, this boring droned-on show left me underwhelmed. It's a booming vocal story, with lighting highlighting area's that borders on being tacky. Ok, it's a different way to see the Pyramids, and learn some things,",
          "This is truly spellbinding. The advertisements do not do it justice. One tip----avoid the junk stores and vendors that are in the area. It is nothing more than wall to wall 'shlokarana'. The show is something that I shall never forget and I cannot wait for the opportunity to",
          "I did this on the first night and it was great. Some of their lights were broke so I didn't get to see some things but even with that it was still so fun. Lasts about 45 minutes.",
          "If you are staying at the Guardian Guest House just watch the show from the rooftop if you do not want to purchase a ticket. However, I chose to purchase a ticket to support. Im guessing there used to be lots of support for the show but it was nowhere near packed when I went.",

          "We had our guide get us VIP seats and he brought us to the far right of the seats at the end of the row so we'd have the best views of the show. It's a great show and has been done for AGES. It's timeless and who can't love experiencing the Pyramids and Sphinx this way? It was",
          "History lesson at night time with some coloured spot lights illuminating the pyramids. Not worth the admission price.",
          "You get a great histoRy lesson, wrapped up in a sound and light show. It's about an hour long, so young children tend to get bored pretty fast. And dress well as it can get chilly at night.",
          "The show is set to sound and music as well as a light show. The daily shows include various languages, and we enjoyed learning all the additional information in English.",
          "The sound and lights show was good and informative, good value to the tourists and something worth seeing",
          "We were fortunate that we could see and hear this show from the rooftop of our hotel (although by the end of the week we had heard it about 12 times in five different languages!). The lasers light up the site so you can get some great pictures and the narrative is quite",

          "We were to go on the day we reached Eygpt , but due to VIP visit it was post poned later. The sound and light show uses lasers to explain the history of Pyramids. It is wonderful experience to watch it with Pyramids as back drop.",
          "With an excellent surrounding sound, as well as lights and of course, Omar Shariff's voice, this show describes the pyramids and their hystory.",
          "A must do attraction that transports the audience through time and better understanding of ancient pharaonic history Take a jacket as it gets cold. Show available in different languages",
          "This is the first place we visited in our Egypt vacation.Our guide Mohammad Ali took us and help us. It was really a good sound and light show. We enjoyed and got little history to know before starting our next day journey in daytime!!!",
          "I was really looking forward to this show, as I missed it back in 2009, as I was following a group tour which didn't include this. Now in 2017, I come alone and can see it. My guide did warn me that it hasn't changed since the day it was created, but I had high hopes. I was",
          "They have done such a amazing job with the Laser show here at the Giza Pyramids. This is a must see and you can understand the story of the Pyramids just watching the laser show.. A wonderful evening event!",
          "Nice show but not great. Lighting should be a little more brighter. As an open area, the sound should also be adjusted for hearing clearly. Lights on the Pyramids is more beautiful than the Sphinx.",
          "i want to see the pyramids was my only goal but the sound and light gave more that what i wanted... the show was very informative and artististic at the same time... going to the place is traffic but it was worth it...",
          "This was the most wonderful highlight of our trip . You really can't miss this if you happen to be in Cairo or Giza. This is the second best thing I have seen in my life so far only after the great Taj Mahal!!",
          "A great show. It gets chilly in the desert so bring a sweater or light coat. You can't miss this. No crowds.",
          "They rush through centuries by projecting images on a wall. I couldn't keep up with what century we were in and some images hard to make out. Still, an interesting setting. Seeing it once is enough for me.",
          "Book even one night at The Guardian House and see this for free. You will go to a parking lot filled with horse and camel feces. Sit on chairs. And it is the most overrated cheesy event ever. It sounds like the wizard of oz, the pyramids change colors, and they do it 3-4 per",
          "If I had had a longer layover, this is without a doubt, something that I would have done. My guide from Egypt Trip Tours shared with me that they light show actually projects colors onto the pyramids and the sphinx to replicate what they looked like back in the day. Given that",
          "I saw it at least 10 times. You can enjoy it in many languages (english, french, spanish, german, italian or arabic). It gives you another point of view on the pyramids. You will see some detais you can't see under sunlight.",
          "Storylines somewhat interesting, 3000 years of history in 50 minutes, but for the price of the tickets, they really need to give it a facelift, it's more like a show from the 80s.",
          "A pretty spectacular presentation of the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx. Worth the entrance fee for all the color.",
          "The sound and light show was an interesting, educational and fun activity for an evening in Giza. Not the most high-tech light show I have seem, but definitely worth the price of admission.",
          "The story of The Great Sphinx told in the chilling cold night was really interesting! It really took me back to the ancient times",
          "We had heard a lot about this but looks like the lightening effects and sound script have never been upgraded with the times and technology. Reminded one of outdated light and sound shows one saw as a kid. For such a major attraction, it was way below expectations. Even from",
          "Seeing the pyramids and the sphinx and night and all lit up is worthwhile, but the story is way over the top and quite unnecessary.",
          "I was really excited about this because it seems so beautiful in pictures, and the lights on the pyramids and the Sphinx are beautiful, but that is the only good thing. It was absolutely FREEZING cold and you have to sit there for 45 minutes just enduring it. Bring blankets,",
          "We were a tourist group of 100 people visiting Egypt. We had VIP seats to the Light Show so we occupied the first rows. We were dropped off by bus, but the area seemed very limited for available parking. The show is good giving a historical commentary of the Pyramids, but",
          "This is a 1 hour show at sunset at the pyramids. The views of the three pyramids are spectacular, especially backlit by a darkening blue sky. The show itself is a bit hokey, but better than the show at the Karnak temple at Luxor. If you are unsure about going, I would say the",
          "This was our first sighting of the pyramids and Sphinx so it was exciting at first. After 15 minutes the magic was somewhat gone. The narration was hokey and as someone else has posted, rather shallow. We were there in January and wore several layers of clothing but still the",
          "We had a great evening here. We learnt a lot. The show was not to busy it is best to sit on far right side ,and the cheap seats are perfect. Thanks",
          "The program was a bit like a high school production, but you cannot beat watching the lights projected onto these ancient wonders \u2013 The Pyramids of Giza and the Great Sphinx! It was too cold in February and although you can rent blankets for 50 EGP, I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing",
          "We are family of 5 and $25 per person was pretty expensive for us. It was nice to see the Pyramids lighted up in the evening, but I was expecting more from the content of the program, more stories about kings and queens and etc. It was pretty shallow.",
          "The 50 minute show was nice and covered a summary of Egyptian history. The pyramids were lighted up in sequence and together with the commentary. However, more use of laser lighting could have enhanced the presentation. The audio also clashed with the Muslim holy call to prayer",
          "If you've seen the pyramids and the sphinx, you should add this one to the list. It's a great overview of the history of it all! It's stunning what they do with the lights on the sphinx showing you what it use to look like!! However...IF you're here during their winter...bring a",
          "I belive that this show is awesome tk the extend that i belived that the pyramids really talked to us",

          "Frankly it got dull way too fast, there were few majestic moments, like the time when all the pyramids were lit up and the times there were laser projections on them but they were few and far between. It was like we have 30 seconds of cool stuff every 10 minutes and the show is",
          "This is a night time experience that you will never forget. The history of the area, in full view of the pyramids, is brought to life in gorgeous sound and color. A must see attraction which you must do.",
          "We went there expecting a decent show and found out it was basically a matter of the pyramids having coloured flood lights shone on them in different sequences for about one hour long with a commentary describing the history of the Giza plateau . We found it very boring and",
          "The pyramids or the light show? This show needs a serious update. It wasn't worth the price of admission, just something to fill part of an evening before dinner.",
          "The evening show takes place in front of the Giza Sphinx which seems just steps away with the pyramids directly behind it. The best seats are directly in front of the Sphinx so find a seat on the right side as you walk into the viewing area. Plastic chairs are set up in rows and",
          "It is one of its kind and quality with informative and enjoyable presentation in open air and with different languages.",
          "The Sound & Light show is very well presented & gives an insight into the history. But carry something warm as it can get quite cold in the evenings in the winter.",
          "It was a great way to start your trip. The history of the story they told help with other things you see during the remainder of your trip. It is set up for over 500 people but only 50 were there during my attendance.",
          "I was in business trip and After a busy day at work me, and few of my colleagues went to see the show. It's really charming to see different light projections on pyramids and sphinx. Sound quality of voices can be better. Also better and comfortable headphones should be",
          "We had a view of this from the rooftop of our guesthouse, and it was fun. I wouldn't have paid for it, though. Personally, I prefer the pyramids and Sphinx lightly lit up and just normal. But the show was an interesting interruption to the majesty of these mammoth creations.",
          "I love history and I have always wanted to see Cairo. Such a beautiful and amazing city with amazing people who love this city. If you love history and culture. Come here. I'll never forget this trip. I still can't believe I seen some of the things I did and experience the",
          "Very attractive sound and amazing narration about the history of the Pharaohs during ancient Egypt. Better visiting during warm nights. I recommend .",
          "If you are visiting the pyramids, I highly recommend to check out this sound-and-light show. My favorite part was the reconstructed face of the sphinx projected onto the statue. It is mind-numbing to think about how long it has been standing there, and how much it had seen. A",
          "It's a fun show that gives some of the history of the pyramids, and the lights are well done. Very clearly made many decades ago, and could use some updating. Was fun to see once though.",
          "It's a good chance to see the great pyramids by night. The show itself is ... meh! The sound was bad, way too many distortions. There's a lot of info about Pharaohs and the Ancient Egypt civilization delivered in a dramatic way (together with a bunch of cliches). During the last",
          "We were spellbound from the moment it began. The great Sphinx narrates the stories of the Pharoahs and one gets transported to another time and it's most captivating. There are 45 minute shows at 7, 8 and 9 pm.",
          "This was a highlight of my trip to Giza. Very informative with a fascinating light show too. Bring a warm coat - it gets cold at night!",
          "This show was fun to watch and loaded with information. The narration is reminiscent of the educational films you watched in school as a kid 20+ years ago, which made us laugh a few times, but it was good.",
          "Seeing the pyramids from the (back side) is surprising though interesting. The laser show is well done and the commentary (though at times a bit over the top) interesting. Probably best to attend when the weather.",
          "The 1-hour show was well done and it provided an interesting historical perspective. There are two sections of seating with a VIP section up front and regular seating behind the VIP section. I went on a Tuesday evening in January and it was quite cool. Dress warmly or you",
          "We could see it from our room its not worthy .Dont pay anything to see it.Just take some night photos and thats it",
          "This show was about an hour and not very crowded. It was interesting presentation. Although, at times it was a little hard to follow the story. We had seen the pyramids earlier in the day; so knew the basic history already. It was very cold though! Upone entering the seating",
          "We watched the show from our hotel room, thankfully, because it was really not worth paying for.....",
          "On my wish list because of the film. It was January so quite cold. Takes about an hour and its a little over the top but I had to do it. Wouldn't go again but glad I went. You can rent blankets there on cold nights.",
          "After deciding to take a second camel ride with Ashraf Mashre (local licenced camel man) to enjoy the Pyramids at sunset from a neighboring hill, It seemed like a waste to go back to Cairo, and miss the Sound, and Light Show. (after all who can turn down the chance to see the",
          "You do not have to leave Cairo without \"feel \" this experience !! Was one of the best shows and a fantastic trip in the past Egypt - Pyramids",

          "After visiting the pyramids during the day we came back at night for the light show and I am glad we did, seeing the pyramids lit up with colors and lasers was magnificent however the show itself was a little outdated and boring at times. The lights are truly the best part not",
          "So, when the light show started I felt like I had seen it before. James Bond:The Spy Who Loved Me\", at about the 13 minute mark! It is a great show and they show it in many different languages on different nights. Abu Simbel also has one. If you are just exhausted and need",
          "I attended this show on a very cold night in January. It was almost painful to sit through. They did have blankets to rent which we did but were still cold. I imagine on a nice night the experience is much better.",
          "Don't waste an evening, this show is outdated and quite boring. Basically a slide show with narration that lasts much too long. If you are on a tour, you probably heard all the same things from your guide as we did.",
          "Ok, I give this an average, because its old, technology is old, but so are the PYRAMIDS!!. Its a classic, from the voice of Omar Shariff, to the lights on the Great Sphynx. Even though it is an old presentation with little wow factor, its the show on the Giza Plateau, what else",
          "Really should not be missed! Wonderful to see the sphinx and pyramids lit up at night! It's very informative and tells the history in a very interesting storytelling narrative making it quite haunting and riveting. Get there early and take a windbreaker!",
          "A very informative and beautiful, stunning colourful views of Pyramids and Sphinx. The Sound and Light show is very good and again a must visit . The show time is 60 minutes, confirm the time and language beforehand. The narration and lighting is very good. Reach the venue 30-40",
          "The place is very cold and seats are not comfortable. It gives some glimses of egypt old history and creats interest for pyramids. But not able to understand clearly as sound are not very clear. The vehicle's headlights in between the show is very annoying.",
          "Although we were all tired having arrived that day to Egypt, this show was a really good introduction to the history of the pyramids and Sphinx in Giza. Recommended/",
          "A must sea place but please do carry your jackets as it turns to be very cold from minute to minute.",
          "Attended the light show which was okay but nothing spectacular given the opportunity of the Pyramids and Sphinx. Not an absolute must do but okay if you have the time.",
          "I was really excited about going to see this . I was a little disappointed as it was cold and also not what I was expecting . It ended up just being the light being moved around . I hope they can make it a little more interesting .",
          "You absolutely must go to this! Visit the pyramids from 3-5 pm for the sunset then get dinner close-by and return fir the light show. There are 3 shows a night in multiple languages. I could see it from my hotel but it was blocked by street lights so I decided to go the next",
          "Really it's nice show where you can set and enjoy the sound and light show , It's give you the main information about the Egyptian history too.",
          "very good presentation, they tell the entire story of Egyptian history. very cold in the evenings, come fully prepared with warm clothes, else they rent out blankets.",
          "Even with the voice of Omar Sharif, the Light and Sound show at The Pyramids were a disappointment. The Light and Sound show at Karnak Temple at Luxor was such a treat. This one needs thought by Egypt Tourism.",
          "Our homestay was close to this Sound and Light Show. Man, every day for a few hours, in different languages... It's better to listen (go) to this show than to try 'onsite the pyramids' to learn about the history. You won't forget this sound & light show.",
          "I admit I have been quite disappointed by this show. The location, sphinx and pyramids at night, is amazing but unluckily it's the only good thing of the show. The light effects are really nothing special, the audio is quite disturbed and clearly a simple recorded voice.",
          "Every evening 7 PM, an amazing sound and light show starts just near the Sphinx. This 1 hr show takes you through the different phases of construction and the history of the pyramids on Giza plateau and the science behind them through sound and light. The three pyramids are",
          "It is a bit cheesy, but you absolutely must see the pyramids lit up at night. We went without a tour group and just took an Uber to the site. I would recommend doing it this way as the tour companies charge far more than the ticket is worth. We got the tickets for $17.50 and",
          "If your interested in seeing the pyramids lit up at night, then spend the money...but, if your looking for a show, don't waste your time. Our 12 yr old daughter was really excited to do this but was really bored after about 10 mins of the 50 minutes show.",
          "This seems like something that would be too over the top or too kitschy but it works! It's a great way to learn a bit more about the pyramids in a casual and entertaining way. Kids will love it but it\u2019s great for adults as well. Beware - in the winter it can get very cold in the",
          "I just loved this show although temperatures in Cairo in December go low and it is very cold and windy. I enjoyed the explanation with the headphones and it is great that there are language options to choose! I wanted to come back but I ran out of time as I was flying to Luxor.",
          "The Sound and Light show is fun to see and a real plus to be out at night while looking at the pyramids and sphinx. But the show is hokey and not a bit special - basically a tourist rip-off.",
          "I paid a private guide (not knowing any better) but this is some you can take a cab to. It's about $-$10 entrance fee. Bring a jacket because it get's really cold at night. The technology is outdated but it was still a good show. If you're like me and this is your first time",
          "I have to see this show every time I go to Cairo - to see the 5000 year structures with the lights is breath taking. i highly recommend. don't miss it! worth the money. no need to get the extra price tickets with the front seats since it is empty now.",
          "It is a lower quality version of a light show at Disney. The plus side to it is that is tells the history of the pyramids which was very informative and gave nice background information! I'm glad I went once, but I don't think it is something I need to do again.",
          "Took a friend who was visiting Egypt for the first time and sh really enjoyed it, especially cuz it was the pyramids. you should really manage your expectations and keep in mind that the technology is quite outdated, however the history and majesty of the pyramids and sphinx",
          "Fascinating way to learn about the history of Egypt. It is for everybody: people who don't like history, the history veteran and the children. Well worth going to. The show runs 7 days a week tThe show is on 2 evenings a week in English.You need to check what night. The light",
          "A must see show...that was the best I've seen there...you can choose among many languages offered...we had the chance to see it in French...as you walk through the pyramids area you can see the history through different lights such as figures of history and you can hear at the",
          "Tips: -bring your DLSR/tripod, you won't be able to take shots with your phone -rent the blanket after entering, it's cheap and worth it to be warm for an hour -ask about the VIP seats up front if you want the best view Overall it is worth seeing however don't expect a strong",
          "We really enjoyed the light show. It had comfortable seats and was 45 min. long. Not only did they light up the three pyramids but also the sphinx. They also told you a complete story with narrative and projections against the rocks. Well worth the $10.00 to get in. We",
          "The show is nice but I think they can do a lot better with light and sound technology, it's a very basic standard show.",
          "We visited the sound and light show which was nice experience...they explain the history and how the pyramids were built....Nice experience...",
          "It's interesting to see the pyramids and the sphinx in different colours. I got some good photos. Is it the best thing around - probably not. The English language commentary sounds as though the actors recorded it in the 1950s (old fashioned accents) and they use words that",
          "It was not good. Perhaps it's because we are comparing it to the sound and light show with the chichen itza pyramid in Mexico. We thought it was going to be like that. But... no. The \"story\" is not good, the light and the sound is not good. You get the feeling like you are",
          "Of the three Sound & Light shows we saw whilst in Egypt, this is easily the best. Magical and lovely."

Located on the Arab's Gulf, Mediterranean Sea, it lies 106 kilometres (66 mi) west of Alexandria and 240 kilometres (149 mi) northwest of Cairo. As of 2007, it had a population of 7,397 inhabitants.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== El Alamein war museum ===\nEl Alamein has a war museum with artifacts from North African battles. \n\n\n=== Military cemeteries ===\n\n\n==== Germany ====\nVisitors can also go to the Italian and German military cemeteries on Tel el-Eisa Hill outside the town. The German cemetery is an ossuary, built in the style of a medieval fortress.\n\n\n==== Italy ====\nThe Italian cemetery is a mausoleum containing 5,200 tombs. Many tombs bear the soldier's name; many are simply marked IGNOTO, ie. unknown.\n\n\n==== Greek ====\nThere is a separate Greek cemetery at El Alamein.\n\n\n==== Commonwealth of Nations ====\nThere is also a Commonwealth war cemetery, built and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, with graves of soldiers from various countries who fought on the Allied side. Buried here are 6,425 identified Commonwealth service personnel and 815 unidentified ones, besides 102 of other nationalities.

However, like the rest of the northern coast of Egypt, its climate is slightly less hot, compared to the rest of Egypt, because of the prevailing Mediterranean Sea winds.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nTwo important World War II battles were fought in the area:\n\nAt the First Battle of El Alamein (1\u201327 July 1942) the advance of Axis troops on Alexandria was blunted by the Allies, stopping the German Panzers that were trying to outflank the Allies position.\nAt the Second Battle of El Alamein (October 23 \u2013 November 4 1942) Allied forces broke the Axis line and forced them all the way back to Tunisia.

          "I stopped here after visiting the British cemetery. An important note is that the gates are locked if muslim prayer is being performed so make sure you come at the right time. I was expecting a tourist trap type place but it was quite the opposite. The museum is well laid out",

          "We have all heard of the battle of El Alamein, but it is hard to imagine the true sacrifice without visiting this lovingly tended CWGC cemetery. Marking the pivotal point when Britain began to believe that they could overcome Germany along with their allies, this was the result",
          "The museum is small and not high tech, but there is a tremendous amount to learn in this small, far corner of the world. It is amazing to stand in this dusty, little place thousands of miles from home and realize that it is connected with the US and Europe and other allies",
          "Visiting El Alamein Commonwealth War Cemetery, we had a perfect lesson about how WW2 was in the area. Couple of nice young military showed us a dynamic map of the troop movements during the desert war. Then our guide, Sahel from Egypt Tours Portal, told us about the weapons",

          "We did this as an excursion from our cruise ship, and to be honest it is not very good. To be fair the outside exhibits are ok, but inside appears to be trying to cover too much material in a small museum. Either my understanding of history is wrong or the British didn't have as",
          "While i know that they want to tell a story i just think that they seem to be missing things from the Museum. They seem to be trying to please all people when they should just tell the story. The fact they have rooms for the Commonwealth, german and Italy is just wrong. Tell the",
          "The museum is located a short distance from the Commonwealth cemetery and has both indoor and outdoor exhibits. The museum is split into 4 halls (Egyptian, Italian, German and British) and each gives an insight into the various equipment used and the history of each nation in",
          "The museum is great, it will show you a brief about the history of ww2 in north Africa that many of western documentation is missing . all artifacts are real, i recommend you buy the CD to gain more knowledge about the history of the place. i went twice and still interested in",
          "I regret that I must disagree with the positive reviews of this museum as much as I regret undertaking the 4 hour journey. Entry is only LE25 plus LE10 to use a camera inside (I paid but there was nothing worth photographing). The recorded explanation of the \u2018back and forth\u2019",
          "Translations were awful - so don't look here for good explanations. But the display outside the museum of all the vehicles, planes, tanks, etc that were found in the sand is amazing. Look for the Canadian vehicle built by Ford Canada! When they found it in the sand, cleaned it",
          "This museum is well looked after and does full justice to the war in Northern Africa during the second world war. Purists may find Arabic translations off-putting but it is clear to see everything and both axis and allies are well represented. The vehicles and armaments outside",
          "For a place that owes so much to the Australian's there is very very little in the museum about the Aussies. Its like they were never there. That needs to be fixed. It was an old looking museum, I mean its like it got set up in 1970 and not worked on since then. The highlight is",
          "Very moving - make sure that you sign the register, near the gate. The more visitors who sign the register the more teh Commonwealth War Graves Commission will know that their work is appreciated.",
          "There is nothing to dislike about this museum although small it has enough to let you realise what was a very tragic war which killed thousands of young men.",
          "This is a must for all ANZACS and Brits as it was one of the turning points of the second world war and a tribute the immense bravery of the young soldiers involved. The adjioning war cemetary is a must,spend time and reflect on the enormous loss of life.",
          "cool place to go and see some culture/history! I asked for help at the front desk with booking this excursion and the counter girl helped me",
          "You will enjoy the place, tombs of dead soldiers are stored in boxes, each box contains the bones and the stuff of him, with names and DOB written on each boc from outside, this is a place full of dignity",
          "Recorded explanation of the battles that occured is helpful but one needs to pay attention or be familiar with what happened. Displays are interesting but not too extensive -- perhaps lots was lost in the desert. Glad to have made the visit.",
          "I like visiting the monuments and old places, there is a plenty of guns, arms & tanks if you are interested Also the army costumes are available.",
          "The War Museum is filled with lots of info of what happend during the battles. The staff puts on a demonstration of the events/battles on a humongous table. After the demonstration you can walk around the rest of the museum looking at various military items...theres lots of it.",
          "Although The El Alamein War Museum is small, it has much to recommend it.Unfortunately lets itself down. The good points: The small collection of military machinery in the form of planes, tanks, trucks and jeeps displayed as open air museum pieces are in pretty good condition"

Located on the Arab's Gulf, Mediterranean Sea, it lies 106 kilometres (66 mi) west of Alexandria and 240 kilometres (149 mi) northwest of Cairo. As of 2007, it had a population of 7,397 inhabitants.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== El Alamein war museum ===\nEl Alamein has a war museum with artifacts from North African battles. \n\n\n=== Military cemeteries ===\n\n\n==== Germany ====\nVisitors can also go to the Italian and German military cemeteries on Tel el-Eisa Hill outside the town. The German cemetery is an ossuary, built in the style of a medieval fortress.\n\n\n==== Italy ====\nThe Italian cemetery is a mausoleum containing 5,200 tombs. Many tombs bear the soldier's name; many are simply marked IGNOTO, ie. unknown.\n\n\n==== Greek ====\nThere is a separate Greek cemetery at El Alamein.\n\n\n==== Commonwealth of Nations ====\nThere is also a Commonwealth war cemetery, built and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, with graves of soldiers from various countries who fought on the Allied side. Buried here are 6,425 identified Commonwealth service personnel and 815 unidentified ones, besides 102 of other nationalities. These include four Victoria Cross recipients:\nPrivate Percival Gratwick, Australian Imperial Force\nPrivate Arthur Stan Gurney, Australian Imperial Force\nSergeant William Bill Kibby, Australian Imperial Force\nPrivate Adam Wakenshaw, Durham Light InfantryOthers buried here include\n\nSquadron Leader George Barclay, RAF Battle of Britain fighter pilot\nMajor Henry Rew, Royal Tank RegimentThis has monuments commemorating Greek, New Zealand, Australian, South African, Indian  and Canadian forces. The cemetery entrance is through the Alamein Memorial and there is also a separate Alamein Cremation Memorial to 603 Commonwealth service personnel who died in Egypt and Libya and were cremated in line with their religion.The names of 213 Canadian airmen appear on the Alamein Memorial in Egypt.The cemetery was designed by Sir J. Hubert Worthington.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nEl Alamein has a hot desert climate K\u00f6ppen climate classification BWh, in common with most of the Middle East and north Africa. However, like the rest of the northern coast of Egypt, its climate is slightly less hot, compared to the rest of Egypt, because of the prevailing Mediterranean Sea winds.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nTwo important World War II battles were fought in the area:\n\nAt the First Battle of El Alamein (1\u201327 July 1942) the advance of Axis troops on Alexandria was blunted by the Allies, stopping the German Panzers that were trying to outflank the Allies position.\nAt the Second Battle of El Alamein (October 23 \u2013 November 4 1942) Allied forces broke the Axis line and forced them all the way back to Tunisia. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister at the time, said of this victory: \"Now this is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\" After the war, he wrote: \"Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein, we never had a defeat.\"\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nEl Alamein Fountain (war memorial commemorating the battle, in Sydney, Australia)\nEl Alamein International Airport\nEnham Alamein (village in Hampshire in England, renamed after the battle)\nMarina El Alamein (tourist resort)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to El Alamein at Wikimedia Commons\n\nFalling Rain Genomics, Inc. \"Geographical information on Al `Alamayn, Egypt\".

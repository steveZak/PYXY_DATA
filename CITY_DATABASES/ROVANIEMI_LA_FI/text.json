        "wiki": "Santa Claus Village is an amusement park in Rovaniemi in the Lapland region of Finland. It was opened in 1985.\n\n\n== Location and transportation ==\nSanta Claus Village is located about 8 kilometres (5 mi) northeast of Rovaniemi and about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from the Rovaniemi Airport.\nThe first original home of Santa Claus was Korvatunturi. In 1985, Rovaniemi was declared as an official hometown of Santa Claus.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\nArctic Circle: The Arctic Circle cuts right through Santa Claus Village. A white line denoting the Arctic Circle (at its position in 1865) is painted across the park. Visitors officially enter the Arctic area when they cross the line. The line is a very popular photo spot for visitors.\nSanta's House of Snowmobiles: A museum about the history and evolution of snowmobiles in the Arctic areas.\nSanta Claus's Office: A Santa Claus's Office is located inside the main building of the Village, for visitors to take photographs and chat with Santa Claus. However, there is an \"office hour\" for Santa Claus and he may not be in the office all the time even when the Village is open.\nNorthern Lights: also known as Aurora Borealis. The Northern Lights are observed on around 150 nights in a year from mid-August till early April. The Arctic Garden and the top of Ounasvaara fell are the best destinations to witness Northern Lights. According to science, it is caused by electrically charged particles from the sun colliding with air molecules in Earth's atmosphere, and deflected by Earth's magnetic field. This process results in emission of colourful light, visible at night. Green is the most common colour in this process, while red, pink, violet, yellow, and even blue may be observable too.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe Santa Claus Park that is connected to the Santa Claus Village was in 2007 awarded by Topworld International and placed as the second best Travel Adventure in Finland. So long in 2008, it still holds second position after Topworld invited travellers to vote for their own Top 10 list over adventures.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Well it is a must when in Lapland, really it is! Santa's office is fun, really well set up, fun the explore and free to visit. You can buy and post cards there as well. The main attraction of course is meeting Santa and it really is pretty cool. Santa is great and takes a",
          "The whole village is just about selling tourists stuf from the giftshops. We had lunch at misses santa claus and the food was not good and the 'soup buffet' was very small. There was not a lot to choose from. The cost was way to high for what was offered..",
          "It was an amazing tour and the most memorable was the conversation with Santa Claus. The photo was taken nicely too!",
          "It was as magical as I had hoped! We were there yesterday - no crowds and Santa took the time to chat with our 3 girls and they were so excited!!!",
          "I was really impressed than Santa can talk a lot of language, and he interest about you. It feels so great. Unfortunately the price is 40\u20ac just for a picture. So i don't think than is not so nice.",
          "Walking into Santa\u2019s office made me a child again. I was so excited to see and sit next to the man in red. I did not mind the Que. It was worth it as I had the chance to talk to SANTA.",
          "Send letter for Christmas See Santas mail Certificates of 'niceness' available to order for Christmas Lots of cards/postcards and posting options available and staff are very friendly and helpful you can buy collectors stamps and gifts Go early if you can to beat the crowds",
          "Compared to other similar attractions this was friendly and in relaxed atmosphere so children enjoyed it. Although the price for photos and video is quite high, I actually like the video part which is not usually provided in other theme parks we visited in Europe.",
          "For 45 Euros, you get 2 photos plus a video taken of you (or of your group) together with Santa per session. You only buy if you are happy with the video and photos. You cannot take your own shots. Santa will engage you in light banter. So the trick is to get ready, pose, smile",
          "When you visit the arctic circle you must see Santa Claus. Exited place, you see time regulator how Santa can reach children of all over the world. Elf's you just can't missed this.",
          "This place is neat, if you were going for the Santa Clause experience I could maybe see it being worth it. But if your looking for dog sledding, reindeer sleds, or snowmobiles there are much better places with real time in the actual Forrest. Think of a giant souvaneer shop",
          "coming to santa claus village and not being with santa is a big mistake. the office is incredible, it brings us to our childhood memories. Santa Claus himself is an excellent person, he received us in Portuguese. He left me with a huge smile on my face, like a child. thanks",
          "I went inside and took pictures with Santa. But before that, I need to line up for a long time. Another drawback is that the photos that the crew take for you are very expensive.",
          "We didn\u2019t really like visiting Rovaniemi and all that Santa\u2019s kinda of entertainment. There\u2019s nothing special. Santas are just young men in costumes with same learned phrases that requires huge amount of money for a photo, letters, certificates and so on. We really regret that",
          "He looks legitimate. Our line was short at the time we visited. Picture taking is free but you have to pay for the prints or digital copies.",
          "It was neat seeing all the letter that came into Santa Claus, maybe a 10 minute look around and we left.",
          "Tried to see Santa twice the first visit but 3+hours waiting time both times. Its very hot inside so having all your gear on and having to wait so long with little children and very few distractions was not an option. We went back early next say as we were staying only a few",
          "It\u2019s a great place even if you aren\u2019t with kids, also there\u2019s a YouTube live video and you can tell your friends/family to see you through it",
          "The best Ded Moroz place ever! The experience made my son so happy! We spend two sys there full of fun.",
          "The wait wasn\u2019t so long because of the off-peak season we chose. They added nice little attractions on the way to Santa Claus\u2019 Office. A bit pricey: an additional gift bag from Santa \u20ac25, printed photo + link to download 4 photos \u20ac65. Santa Claus was a bit tired I think. But",
          "This place is amazing, You have to see it to believe it. Warm to hot inside full of tourism items and you can see all the post cards being hand stamped, then sent to almost very country in the world. The photo does not do the place justice, you have to see and feel it to believe",
          "We came to Lapland as we were told it would provide a magical Christmas experience. Did it? I\u2019m not sure... The Santa is great and the place does have a magical charm. However it\u2019s tainted by a commercial over tones. Now I\u2019m not naive enough to think the place doesn\u2019t want to",
          "The que waiting time just for a photo with Santa is outrageous especially when you reach an elv only to be told come back at a later time.Not everyone can come back .Put on more Santas for photos.As to the office too many double ques to notice and an elve screaming form one line",
          "Great spot to physically see a crossing of the arctic circle, post letters from the offical Santa Claus post office and meet The real Santa himself. Very friendly staff and elves around the place to help or give advice. I would recommend going as part of a tour and in the",
          "The queue was very long when we came....took us almost 2hrs before we met santa. They photo with santa is really good clear quality unlike in santa park. But souvenirs at the shops are really quite pricey... for a small hand warmer \u20ac10...elf hut \u20ac20 (cheap felt quality) .Bonus",
          "We didn't even bother as we couldn't even get through the front door. Probably worst as it was the day after Christmas. It is clear that MANY tour groups come here as the busses were EVERYWHERE.",
          "Free entrance which is good We got ticket with a time on it but it didn\u2019t allow us to get a faster entrance (we actually don\u2019t know what it was for) Long wait (45min) with some entertainment but it could have more. It was during the peak season so we were prepared to wait. It",
          "The visit to Santa Klaus took few hours of await (the queue was amazing) but into the structure, the bar and the shops were good. The pictures were expensive (1 pict for 20\u20ac) but nice the experience",
          "Ridiculous crowds and fees. Not worth the effort to queue. This whole village was overpriced, commercial and too busy",
          "We went to Santa's office at late afternoon in December 2019 and the queue was only about 10 minutes. Elf helped us to take the photos and videos when we met Santa in person! It was a fun family activity! We bought 2 printed-out copies of the photos, as well as the electronic",
          "It was a great an warm visit to Santa Claus village for three days. There was not so many people, so no longs lines. Of course, to take picture with Santa in one house took about 20-30min waiting, in other it would had taken maybe 10 -20min. In post office for sending christmas",
          "We took our 5 year old grandaughter to see Santa in his office. The process was well organised even to the extent of giving us a bag to store out outdoor clothes as it was quite warm inside. The actuall visit is very controlled but Santa and the elves were great with the",
          "Please keep attention that just at the entrance of the village there is another house called \"Christmas House\" which shows signs inviting the families to go in for meeting Santa Claus. Be careful, it is only a shop and not the original one. They have inside a fake Santa Claus",
          "My daughter loved her time here. She came home and told all of her friends about her elf magic that she learned during the Elf Training Class. She loved the show and the ride. . .and of course Santa Claus. She really had an amazing time and I would definitely do it again.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Santa Claus office. We went on a Saturday evening and had a small wait. There are things to look at to keep the kids entertained as you walk through to get to Santa. They give you bag before meeting Santa for your jackets and you can keep the bag if",
          "I read earlier about the long queues to meet Santa at his office. I didn\u2019t wait more than 15 minutes. Yes, Santa meeting was very very quickly...Didn\u2019t last for more than a minute. Saying hello and taking a picture and that\u2019s it. The picture costs around \u20ac35 and the set (",
          "This place was lovely. We bought postcards for all the kids cousins and sent them some Christmas post! When they arrive it will have the official arctic circle postal stamp! We also secretly got the kids a postcard and sent them one too. You could chose between normal post box",
          "A fun thing to do in Santa\u2019s village. The staff are quick at getting people in and out and keeping the line moving without feeling rushed. They video you from when you walk in, they also take a picture after a quick chat with the big man. On the way out there are a number of",
          "This is a good place for kids, family, couple, solo and specially Santa fans... people post letters here all over the world with Christmas wishes and so on",
          "This is great as you get to walk through where the crates of presents are, which will be loaded on the sleigh on Christmas Eve. Also, you can look through the little keyholes on the walk and see the elves in the workshop making toys. It\u2019s free to to see Santa and you\u2019re under",
          "Amazing place on the Mother Earth, powerful, place, enjoying from the last 5 days, every one has the dream to enjoy here. Destination to visit at least in life",
          "It's a dream place for all people who had heard about Santa Claus during their childhood times. A dreamy place that adorned by Christmas lights, snow, fairies and everything about Christmas. You can meet the Santa but you're not allowed to take picture, instead, they will take",
          "santa claus holds his office here. as i have been working as his stand in (in indonesia) i would like to meet him and discuss the essence of the job. unfortunately, he was not in, but i could sit at his desk. it is very much liked by chinese, who can even pay with their own",
          "We went to visit Santa in his office. The line was short but if it had been a long wait, there were things to see in the queue. When we got there, Santa was quite the conversationalist!",
          "We (two friends, F26 and F32) went to Santa Claus village while in Rovaniemi for a break. Meeting Santa was so much more than we expected. Walking through his toy workshop/grotto was so fun. His elves were friendly and helpful. Santa himself was incredible. As two adults we were",
          "Whichever time of the year you come here, it will always give you the Christmas vibes. Don't forget to take a picture in the Arctic circle post. Visit the post office of Santa and some postcards to your loved ones.",
          "Today we visited the postoffice of Santa. Uptill now Santa received millions of letters from children from all over the world. You can wright you christmas greetings and Santa will take advantage to deliver the post around christmas time. Letters from all parts of the world are",
          "You will get to meet Santa but you will have to stand in a long line. His beard goes down to his waist and he is truly a jolly friendly old fellow. Yes there are real elves there to talk to and meet. This is an entire village with stores, and many exhibits and restaurants, as",
          "This is a official Hometown of Santa Claus, and it is right on the Arctic Circle, you can cross article circle in Santa village, you can also take photos with the 'authentic' -only certified Santa Claus here, mail postcard or letter from Santa Claus village Postoffice, ride",
          "Very good experience to come back children. If visited with kids should be amazing. Unfortunately it has become a business and everything costs too much",
          "It is created in such an authentic way that it makes you wonder if Santa still lives there. The line is long but definitely worth the wait. The surprising factor is that Santa knows every single detail of your home country. We were astonished.",
          "This is an amazing post office ! You are able to buy and write postcards to Santa or just to friends . You can choose to have your letters delivered that day or have the post office mail them in time for Christmas. You can also send packages to be mailed at Christmas time, com8",
          "Maybe children may enjoy it, but it just something to attract visitors to the many shops. A photo costs \u20ac 35. Of course, not only in winter, but all year round.",
          "I can't wait to hear how excited the kids receiving Santa's card will be! It was a great place with delightful staff.",
          "We met Snt Nick on hot day of July, which was a bit weird. But it was such an unforgettable experience and I really believe that Santa truly comes from Finland. The whole family was happy about this visit in Polar Circle.",
          "I was so excited to visit this place. For some reason this is the first time Santa and everything associated with it came alive for me. It's so authentic, and we went right in to see Santa winding our way around the Disneyland-type environments where I'm told the lines can be",
          "Its amazing to see a real Santa claus even for a young adult like me hehe ... what more my kids .The price is quite expensive ,I can say that the quality of the photos is not worth it.",
          "This was a back the childhood visit Really well decorated, you get transported into the xmas spirit The staff is funny and the are acting like santa helpers Recommend for kids and xmas lovers",
          "This is in Santa Cluas Villageand has many souveneirs but so expensive and sadly no brochure on the place only a map",
          "It was a little odd visiting here in mid-June, but the staff made it amazing. Really helpful. Was still pretty busy as we got behind a couple of tour groups. Caf\u00e9 was brilliant, loved the reindeer burgers. We done the full Santa meet n greet (free) and also went in for a photo",
          "Nice things around, and free to visit. You can send postcards with Napapiiri stamp around the world.",
          "Well designed and fun place to be. A trip back to childhood although very commercial. Would go there again!",
          "This place is a must visit if you want to send postcards to family and friends and get a post-mark on your cards that say from the Arctic Circle or Santa's Office. We sent post-dated postcards for next Christmas since we would have been too late for this year. Nice, bright",
          "Excellent - Santa was lovely, great place. Posted cards to my babies from Santa for this coming crimbo.",
          "If you are in Santa Claus village, a visit to uncle Santa and a photograph with him is a must as a great memory of your visit.",
          "We had some letters from my grandchildren to deliver so this was a must. We had limited time but just made it. Santa will turn you into a believer. He was amazing, we were two adults. Great knowledge of the world. worth it.",
          "Very much organised, friendly staff they call them elves, a little expensive. Photo and video with Santa Costed around 45 euros. But is a lifetime experience.",
          "Despite his busy schedule we were able to track down Santa in his office and have a photograph taken with him. A number of photos of famous visitors were on display and the process was well organised. The full photo-pack is over Euros 80 and a single print is over Euros 30 so it",
          "This was my dream trip. It sounds as an interesting experience to see Santa Claus live. And it really is! Video and photos with Santa are optional and bloody expensive, but memories are for free. North pole is crossing the village. As adults, we spent 3,5 hours incl. dinner in",
          "We arrived around 11am and decided to get in to see Santa first. We queued for over an hour. The kids were bored senseless and I just wish there was a member of staff about to let people know rough queue times as we would have come back another time. Due to the layout, you just",
          "Sent postcards from here. It was the best thing about our visit to the village. Letters / postcards could be sent for next Christmas & they had arctic circle stamps",
          "The post office has numerous tables and pens so one can write out post cards or letters to the children back home, all with the North Pole post mark. You can decide of the notes are sent at the time of your visit or around Christmas Time. There are books and stuffed animals",
          "It\u2019s Christmas all year round in Lapland. Wonderful place to visit however be prepared to wait if you want a photo with Santa. Wonderful atmosphere there are many souvenirs to choose from at various prices. You can go to the post office and have cards sent home. It is fairly",
          "Wonderful Santa only suggestion is they ask the child\u2019s name maybe to keep up the experience but it was perfect",
          "Beautiful place, But standing in line for 3 hrs in a dingy not well lit Queue is not worth it. Once your time comes you find that the Picture with Santa is going to cost 35 Euros.which is not at all worth it",
          "I loved having met the Santa, he was really warm and at no point have we felt being rushed through as there was a queue and a wait time of approximately an hour. The staff works efficiently to coordinate everything from managing long queues to print photos. This was such a",
          "A lot of kitschy souvenirs. Fun enough for the kids. See Santa, buy an overpriced photo, move on. Is what it is.",
          "Santa speaks many languages and even know capital cities of many countries. It's free, but the pictures cost 35 euros each and even more if you want to get digital copies of pictures and video.",
          "My daughter is aged 6 and loved this place! The food choice in the restaurant was a little sparse but otherwise we spent a lovely day here and she loved every minute.",
          "this is a good place for families, we were 6 and were able to take a picture with santa all together, that whole area is great during the holidays, and we were able to see the northern lights but not from there, you have to go much farther away where its totally dark.",
          "Dull santa and he was not interested to talk to the children. but the place was nice, and they made a lot off nice stuff to bye :-)",
          "My daughter was pretty excited to meet Santa, she was thrilled to get presents from Santa, we went in second weekend of January so there was not much crowd",
          "Santa Claus office is a must visit place in Santa Claus Village. Meeting a gentle, warm and friendly Santa Claus is surely a life time experience. We were all touched by his warm and sincere greeting. Taking photo with him was another great experience. Most importantly his",
          "The Santa Claus Office employs a charming and multilingual Santa Claus. Long lines for the kids to stare, gobsmacked and a bit shell shocked at the man himself. No personal photos allowed. They will sell you their pictures or digital photo files, for prices from about 39 EUR up.",
          "So well done. We were there right before Christmas but it wasn't more then a 10 minute wait to see Santa (we got there by 10 am). Santa was really lovely and my children loved meeting him at his office. The elves were lovely too. It's not cheap, but it is Finland and we did",
          "Walk along the relatively dark and secretive corridors, finally come to the Santa Claus office. He is kind and adorable. He declines he is hardworking as it is fun for him to work. Wish him to enjoy his fun working and bring love and smiles to children all around the world.",
          "The Santa Claus office opens at 9:00 am, we reached around 9:15 and there were a very small queue in front of us. It was a fun experience meeting Santa. Stan is conversant is many languages, and gives enough time to talk and take pictures. And he does not look tacky at all, it",
          "We visited Santa Claus office with our small children. They both liked it. Santa and the elves were very kind. But latter my older daughter commented about Santa\u2019s fake beard...",
          "We visited the place around the New Year holidays. The place is certainly unique, it\u2019s really cool to see the real Santa Claus, however we found it too commercial rather than atmospheric: too much souvenirs but not enough things to do neither for kids nor for adults. Spending",
          "No words can describe our kids excitement! Luckily the queue wasn\u2019t long and we didn\u2019t have to wait long. Nowadays they offer a video as well as the photo with Santa. The elfs are doing an amazing job. The shop afterwards could be better though.",
          "This is the activity kids like best. They love hugging Santa and taking a picture with him. There can be a 30-40 minute wait time before seeing him.",
          "3rd time we are going there, 2nd time for our youngest who is now 8. The place is still great however it has expanded a lot and it is now very commercialised. Many coaches of rude Chinese tourists who take pictures of everything and who jumped the queues. However, seeing Santa",
          "very emotional... finally meeting the 'true' Santa Claus... a dream come true. Santa is magic and he speaks multiple languages putting your kids in the conditionto have a special moment in their lifes.",
          "A must visit place especially with children. You can buy presents before meeting Santa and ask Santa to give them to the kids. Be prepare of the long waiting time especially around Christmas time!",
          "I cant go into too much detail because it only needs 2 words... simply magical. If you're in Santa's Village then you are going to be coming here anyway. I guess mornings might be better in avoiding some of the queues.",
          "We first visited Santa in Rovaniemi in 2013. This year we went back and saw how much the place had grown - great for business but it has lost its \u201cmagic\u201d a bit. The place is now a sort of theme park. Busloads of Japanese tourists taking photos at every corner, the post office",
          "Quirky place in which to send your letters home. Ours arrived within a few days at our Grandaughters house.",
          "Let's get a few things out of the way first. Is it commercialised? Yes. Is there much to do other than shops ? Not really. But the main event is santa and is he worth it? Yes 100%. He is excellent and for the brief meeting you have with him he is everything u want Santa to be ..",
          "I took my 11 and 14 year old to here. We loved it. We arrived in the dark first thing and enjoyed hot berry juice around a fire followed by a quick husky and reindeer ride. The scenery is breathtaking and the walk through the wood is beautiful. The snow makes it so pretty. Then",
          "The line took a long time but you cant miss Santa! The setup here was great, managing to balance corny commercialism with a realistic magical feeling. Definitely great to go with kids and worth it even without. The post office had a great selection of postcards to send stamped",
          "There is two places you can meet and take a photo with Santa. In the office of santa, you'll have to pass through a passage with decoration, elves and different christmas stuff but the line to see santa is really long. Go to Christmas House instead. There's a small exhibition on",
          "Lovely experience but a bit pricey \u20ac32 for a photo....waited for an hour... In there for 2 mins.. Wouldn't do this again",
          "My 9 year old son was on the cusp of not believing due to his older friends spilling the beans \ud83d\ude0aI am pleased to say that the big man did not disappoint very authentic and friendly that my son said he believes now \ud83d\ude1cof course we gave him a present to give to Ethan that was in",
          "We visited here with our three smalll children and enjoyed writing a postcard to the grandparents back home. We also took pens and paper of our own and wrote a letter to Santa and posted it in the box. You can buy it there but it was Super expensive. A lovely idea and cute.",
          "Amazing! The real one! You can do picture with Santa and gave it later! The cue can be long... but it\u2019s worthy!",
          "We waited about 50 mins and Santa asked many queations to our 7 yr old. I was didappointed that there were no Christmas tunes.playing whilst waiting in line. Maybe some stations alomg the way for thr kids to do activities while waiting for Santa.",
          "This totally ruined Christmas for my 7 year old. We went all the way to Lapland to see the real santa, this one said three words to us, I specifically asked the \u201celf\u201d to ask Santa to call my son by his name so he would know it was the real santa. Santa didn\u2019t acknowledge the",
          "A must if in Lapland! It is a once in a lifetime experience, a total deja vu of emotions from Christmas mornings as a child. Best time to visit is probably early December as it wont be as packed with other tourists",
          "It has been like a dream. It is a very nice place to visit even you are an adult you feel like you are a kid and you want see everything and you want to enjoy the time there, the snow, the lights, to see the huskies and the all happy faces.",
          "Our family visit November 2018 was joyful. Our family found the real Santa at Holiday Village. What a charming, gentle, interested Santa Our grandchildren, ages 7 & 8 are sure this was the REAL Santa not just one of his helpers.",
          "Oh my goodness! You HAVE to visit Joulupukki (Santa Claus) when you come to Santa's Village. He was very personable and you got to spend private time with him.....not a long line of people watching for you to finish so they can have their turn. We also bought a foto with him",
          "Beautiful first impressions with the buildings, snow and lighting; exactly as you would imagine. Santa was talkative and looked as you would expect. BUT sadly it felt like a money making machine. Wasn\u2019t cheap to visit Santa anyway, but then to have to pay \u20ac35 for one printed",
          "Meeting Santa claus is every childs dream. If you are in Finland for holiday, I highly recommend visiting Santa Claus Village!",
          "We were disappointed after visiting Santa's Post Office in the Santa Village. We expected some scenes inside, which cute and belongs to the miraculous ambiance of childrens imagination. Instead of our expectation, we visited another commercial souvenier shop. I think, I told",
          "Santa Claus is very nice and talkative! The queue was a bit long but with a bit of waiting (not more than 30 min) we could see Santa. Thank you!",
          "This was by far the busiest attraction on our trip. However, like everywhere else, the whole experience was organised to perfection and stress was avoided. There is a large tabled area for children and adults alike to sit and write they're letters to Santa. There is an abundance",
          "Overly rated.. Too commercialised and expensive. Nothing much to do and see great for kids for a few hours but that's it. Cost Euro 45 to take photo with Santa. One meal for 3 adults and 1 kid is around Euro 100",
          "If you want to feel like you are 5 years old again, excited and nervous to meet the MAN, Santa Claus, go to Santa Claus Village. It was a wonderful experience and I would recommend it to people of all ages!",
          "This is a warm friendly office where you can buy a letter from Santa to send to a lucky child or you can buy postcards and gifts. Very well organised with plenty of seats, tables, chairs to sit and write your postcards .",
          "When I was 9 years old I was told by friends at school Santa wasn't real. Well I visited his office yesterday and there he was.",
          "We were very lucky and only had a small queue. It is free to visit, although you do pay for photos - there is no obligation to get these. There are very friendly elves along the path to Santa's office - it feels like going into a big cave then a magical office in a giant clock!",
          "Beautiful little place not extravagant or too expensive, surprisingly simple. Just standing in the line to see Santa was exciting for my son. The Santa was jolly big fellow, just happy.",
          "Lovely place where you can meet Santa itself. You are able to have small talk with him and he is a really nice guy. The only minus is that the entrance is free but if you would like to take photos you need to pay 45 euro.",
          "Great experience, would definitely recommend. Photos are extremely overpriced though! The elves are cute!",
          "The Santa Claus center at the arctic circle outside Rovaniemi was both overrated, overprised and overdone. It might be because I was there in cold weather in late August after the kids return to school and in the low season I was disappointed. There were more souvenir shops than",
          "Loved how everything is set to create the ambiance, and meeting Santa was better than expected, much better than your average Mall Santa",
          "Santa's village in Rovaniemi is a once in a lifetime visit for all persons of all ages. The entire village is beautifiul. There is a real Santa here and you can get pictures with him. While mobile and personal cameras are not allowed, you can buy a printed picture from his",
          "And totally worth the visit. You can meet santa for free and surprisingly, he speak several languages. At peak periods the wait can be long, although during low season you can pretty much walk straight in. Friendly staff. Pictures are expensive.",
          "This is an experience not to be missed however your age is, go say hi to santa claus, you will get the feeling that you had when you were 4 years old. Amazing!",
          "This is so magical, I am an adult, and I wished my parents would take me here as a kid. This is truly a magical spot for everyone. I can not wait to go back. I booked my trip for next year again! Thank you for this great experience!",
          "This Santa was the real deal. My wife pinched his cheeks - they were so whitey-pink - and was astonished how soft they were! And when he knew where our hometown Toogoolawah was, well I was astonished. Of course, Santa could get their faster than we could in our",
          "It's really a wonderful visit to meet Santa Claus. He's very nice and chatting with him is a memorable experience. We chose the package with photos and video and got them downloaded to our phones shortly. Outside Santa's office, the area is a bit small considering it as an",
          "Loved visiting Santa's office and seeing the administrative aspects of Santa's life. :) Really fun and great for kids and kids at heart.",
          "we just came back from a 4 day stay at santa claus village and since it was still not the high season the children got to meet santa three days in a row and he took his time talking to them and answering all their questions. we have an 8 year-old and a 7 year old girls and they",
          "Only con is that you have to pay 30-60 euro for the pictures after you see Santa! No personal photos allowed at all, no exceptions! They also will sell you a full video of your Santa interaction with audio! The Santa was super nice and multilingual, and the workshop itself",
          "We were really disapointed. Yes, Santa can two pieces of info about our country. But the place is really without any special feeling. So take a photo, pay 40 euros for 4 pictures and that \u00b4s it.",
          "I visited the place in August so I wasn\u2019t impressed. I guess it looks great in the middle of the winter, with everything covered in snow. Must be magical. But in the summer it has no charm. The meeting with Santa was nice. He\u2019s quite talkative and we spent a while chatting. But",
          "A story place and a must to visit. Perfect place for children. Wonderful location in the winter time.",
          "So how do you explain to a child that Santa is now in this office, when you have just seen him in another building. We avoided the office as we had just visited Santa and didn\u2019t really want to be offered more photos to buy",
          "The Santa was gentle and kind. I love him. I came during last Christmas. I read people queued for a long time to see him. I was lucky. Waited for only 5 minutes. I bought both the photos and video. My comment is, fees of the entry and these items were way too expensive. It's",
          "Once inside the Santa Claus village, we decided to check if we can meet the Santa. And yes, we did. Found it a little strange to pay to meet Santa. Nevertheless, decided to go ahead. You can choose to get only the pictures or video or both of your meeting with Santa. A very well",
          "The Santa was half awake when we got there. He was friendly and so glad we took photo with him. Got an official stamp from the official Santa Claus Village. A must place to go when you go to Rovaniemi.",
          "I have been here several times over the years and it is so special each and every time. If you are in Finland, you must make this journey!! and make sure to leave your address for Santa too because come Christmas, you will receive a card from him.",
          "This is a magical place that makes every childhood bedtime stories come true. It's a wonderful place for children and adults who still have childlike innocence.",
          "Writing letters posting to and from Santa for anytime or Christmas time are great things to do for every child I enjoyed my trip",
          "Really good experience. You can use this post office to send a personalized Xmas postcard to your family world over. And it reads \"from Santa Claus\"",
          "I have order Santa Letter from the office and he website. However, two months past, I got no letters and no reply. I wrote to the office, no one answered. One Santa letter costs 8.5 euro. Is this the right attitude from a Santa Claus office? What a big liar! The track receipt",
          "Santa. Snow. Christmas lights. The wafting smell of warm cinnamon and mulled wine. And the opportunity of a lifetime to send a Christmas Card to friends and family from the North Pole. Enough said. Bucket list ticked and memories made. Incredible!",
          "Crowded, but worth the visit. Unfortunately, not all the countries with children sending letters to Santa Claus were represented and this is awfully frustrating when have to explain it to the kids...",
          "My family and I visited Santa Claus Village on April 2017. The experience was okay, but, we bought two Santa Claus letters to be delivered Christmas 2017 to our country, and they never arrived. Nobody gives us information about it, or even gives us any refund! Don\u2019t buy it!",
          "Must Visit here, if you are at Rovaniemi. Conveniently near an airport. Bit touristy, no photos allowed, you need to buy photo set (digital).",
          "Was in my to-do-list and hence did it.. took the No.8 Bus from Rovaniemi bus station at 2.30 pm, reAched about 3... met Santa , in like 10 minutes in the queue... had a good chat with Santa.. bought a pic with me and Santa for 30\u20ac\ud83d\ude16... ordered Santa\u2019s personalized Christmas",
          "Santa was about the only thing to see here. We were expecting some sort of Christmas display or elf workshop, anything Christmas related really. But all we got was Santa and a gift shop. Santa was lovely and convincing of being the real Santa but it wasn\u2019t worth two flights and",
          "We visited in April and there was hardly anyone else about! There is a wonderful exhibition telling the story of Father Christmas around the world to read as you wait to visit the big man. We had no need to wait and actually spent about 15 minutes with Santa as he had no one",
          "A cute place to send yourself a postcard with the arctic circle stamp mark on it. That\u2019s about it! Staff friendly as always and nice photo opportunity in front of the fire.",
          "What a wonderful place to see Santa Claus outside of Christmas! Our little guy was mesmerized by the sight of him. The presentation of his office was what every child would image what his office would look like. We were able to spend time with him and not feel rushed. There is",
          "It is always a magic experience to see the Santa Claus itself! Be carful to go when there is not so much people, though",
          "Loved this wee place - you can send a letter yourself, either to arrive delayed or straight away as well as sign up to a personalised santa letter for Christmas all the way from Lapland! Also nice touch all the children\u2019s \u201cdummy\u2019s\u201d that where left to santa we\u2019re on display lol",
          "Unfortunately, there was a big tour group ahead of us and we waited for more than an hour to have our photo shoot with Santa Claus. To cut cost and to save time, we took group photos. It was a very memorable events.",
          "Like everything else in Lapland, this is ridiculously overpriced. Santa charges like some 40 euros for a photo. It's built around extorting tourists for a touristy experience.",
          "They have a lot of choice of postcards and stamps, which make you want to write as many as you can. It is very crowded, so you might find difficulties to find some seats to write your card. But if you manage to go to Finland and have idolised Santa Claus when you are a kid. It",
          "Bring your inner child to the front at Santa's own office. It may be a touristy experience, but if you're a Santa fan, you don't want to miss it.",
          "A tourist village, filled with Souvenirs shop, lovely atmosphere, colorful and grrst for kids. Have coffee shop",
          "I was so excited to see SANTA CLAUS for the first time and it was very memorable, the elves didn't know much about stuffs maybe they only know one thing which is helping santa haha",
          "Had a pretty good time. The wait was a bit tedious, but not too bad. The kids had a great time and really liked it.",
          "Santa Claus was wonderful (l thought l was big, but he was \u2018huge\u2019 and so friendly); his helpers were amazing. Had a bit of a hiccup on return home when the code for the photos and DVD didn\u2019t work, but Santa\u2019s little helpers sorted it ...",
          "Coming from HK to visit Santa Claus with friends. I've been here many years ago in summer. It was a great atmosphere during winter season with everything in WHITE. Look like a christmas time eventhough it is in Feb. Like the place very much and took a photo with Santa which",
          "For me it was Christmas in February. I loved every bit of it except for the cold. I initially thought it would not be as bubbly as it should be during Christmas but boy was i wrong! It was buzzing with tourists . The reindeer ride, visiting Santa in his magnificent office was a",
          "There is no entrance fee. There is only one way to go once you enter. Santa looked authentic and spoke several different languages making it more believable he was real. The lines can be long waiting to get into his office. Once you're in the office they will take 3 pictures and",
          "I know what you are going to say...\" no way that's possible\". As a matter of fact yes, this place is so authentic , is attached to the Northern Countries Xmas tradition. Santa wears very simple clothes, he has a long beard and a great attitude. You have to walk through a",
          "If you in or near Rovaniemi you just have to visit. Yes, it is manufactrured but still a wonderful if tacky place to visit. It was nice to say hello to Santa Claus but you are not allowed to take pictures for your own camera. They do a video and take a couple of pictures which",
          "Santa is wonderful! Ok so it\u2019s all very manufactured. And you do get a sense that it is a business, but you get to meet Santa and the few minutes you spend with him are magical. The encounter is filmed and they take pictures. No personal cameras allowed. The pictures and",
          "Without a doubt, you have to go see Santa Claus, greet him, hug him and take the necessary photo.I remember that we will save all our lives.The only problem is that if you go with children, the wait can be long for the children, since they are excited, and you have to stand in",
          "With Santa meeting people all day he can\u2019t have much time to himself First the elves met us and then they took us to Santa We had a chat about Munquee\u2019s travels and a family photo.",
          "Nice place to visit. You have to be at the artic circle and have been to the real santa.clause. Note some time to walk arrived and visit some gift shops to buy a post card and send it. This with the authentic post stamp of Santa.",
          "It was a lovely idea to have the post office. You can send the postcards with the stamps from the Santa Claus Village or fill a form to ask Santa to write a letter to someone you want. It is a lovely idea!",
          "We have such fond memories of visiting Santa Clause Village/Office. It was an extremely pleasant experience and very magical to say the least. Kids enjoyed exploring the village, feeding the reindeers (esp. Rudolph) and talking to Santa Clause in person. He was larger than life",
          "I first visited Santa whilst working in Rovaniemi back in 1986. Things were a little different back then, he lived in a cabin to the rear of the main building and you booked a time to meet him and entered in small groups. You waited patiently and quietly with an Elf or two for",

          "The excitement we felt meeting Father Christmas surprised us both. Beautiful setting. Only thing that was disappointing was the number of tatty/tacky souvenir shops.",
          "We visited Santa Claus office when we visited the Santa Claus Village near Rovaniemi. The office has a fantasy come true for all ages, a personal meeting with the Santa, there was a queue but we could get in in 30 mins. Elves are supervising the office and they usher you in.",
          "This is a must visit place near Rovaniemi but expect large numbers and queues at peak times. Outside of these times it is a far more pleasant experience. The outlet shops have some good bargains and are definitely worth a visit. The eating venues are fairly good and some quite",
          "In Santa Claus village we met Santa Claus himself in his office and it is beyond our imagination. We exchanged greeting and really we liked Santa Claus very much, gentle and polite.",
          "It is really great to see the Office and entire village!!!! You can do a nice walk around and not be bored...",
          "We were desperate to go to the post office and send our loved ones a postcard stamped with the Artic Cirlce. The problem was we were also desperate to look round the whole village, and due to the lack of staff we spent most of our visit in a queue\ud83d\ude1f My son was bored, fed up, it",
          "Santa Claus's office is located on the artic circle and during our visit was covered in snow. It truly does take you back to your childhood and lifts your Christmas spirit. We were lucky to go in early December and the line up to go into the office and see Santa was very short,",

          "Wonderful friendly athmosphere! Santa is very attentive to everyone. You can not miss this place when you come to Lapland for the first time.",
          "So seeing Santa was a bit generic, walking round a themed path. Santa seemed nice and chatted lots while they filmed us. Photos that were taken had one of our eyes closed on both pics but they said we could go back, no thanks, bought them anyway! Just a feeling they are missing",
          "Santa's Village is worth a visit if you are in Rovaniemi, even if you don't have any kids! The ICE Bar was a nice touch as was the tube slide!",
          "Yes, that kind of a place. Watched my daughters faces light up and fill with aw... A well organised visit and we didn\u2019t queue all that long (20mins maybe). Yes, you meet the old fat man himself and, yes, a little effort on his part would have been appreciated (handshakes,",
          "We arrived and it was very unclear where to go, or what queue to get in. No signs. Eventually we were given a queue ticket to come back in an hour. We were not told we would then have to join a very long queue like at a theme park. Very little information on how long you would",

          "This place is touristic, but it's still a beautiful must visit place. You could buy all sorts of souvenirs here. And, yes, meet santa claus as well. Oh, and try the grilled salmon there, worth the queue.",
          "The village is visually amazing with all the lights. Santa\u2019s office is a little dark and creepy, not the jolly place I expected. But the couple of minutes with Santa and watching the look on our son\u2019s face when Santa handed him a gift was PRICELESS. Memories we will hold for a",
          "Very commercialised and packed full of Chinese tourists, so not quite the magical Christmas experience one would expect.",
          "Interesting location, well maintained and best of all it is free to visit. You can of course buy pictures (which we did) or small gifts (which I thought wasn't worth it) but to sit next and have a quick chat with the most impressive Santa I ve ever seen, it's free to do. So",
          "Very short visit, very steep price. It's well done and Santa was fun to meet and chat with, but the price tag of \u20ac30+ for a photo is just ridiculous.",

          "I liked it. I felt the free visit to Santa was good but needed a little tweak to make it magical. A few more automata or actors to entertain the queues. We got a gift that was given to my son and the photo and video were high quality. We didn\u2019t mind spending that little extra as",

          "We happened to be really lucky as it was snowing when we were there which made it exceptionally magical. Being able to meet Santa Claus and post cards from the Santa\u2019s post office was really fun. Great place for a day trip as you visit all the shops and attractions within a day.",

          "The actual post office is very well though out and authentic but the cost of actually sending post from here was very OTT.",
          "Lots to see for the whole family. Santa is really good with children, and doesn't forget adults either.",
          "We went to Santa Park as part of a trip with Thompson, it was really warm inside so don't over dress, it was just lovely inside, the train was fab, there was a bit of a queue for things but not too bad, we saw Santa in his office which was fab but to buy the picture was a bit",
          "The post office is great and can't wait for the kids to get their letter from Santa in December. Problem is the place is just full of crap tourist trap style shops. Santa's office is lacking in magic and could do with a spruce up. They could have gone a lot further to make it",
          "We visited Santa in early March when everything was snow white and the queues very short. It is a nice place to visit, even though it is a bit commercial. We enjoyed ourselves and were surprised we were greeted in our own language",
          "After taking photos with the Santa, you can choose your postcards and mail it to your loved ones. They have the specially chopped stamp on the postcard to signifies the longitude of the arctic circle that you had crossed over to.",
          "We sent post cards home which were actually really cool. It does bring Santa back into your heart for adults also. When we met Santa it was much better than we expected, and yes...we did bring a photo back home!",
          "The house is well designed to not feel waiting before you meet Santa. That was very surprising for me. But when you meet him you feel the hurry. It's just for the photo.",
          "The Post office is really busy but magical - something enchanting about seeing people writing their letters to Santa and folks back home",
          "Much to my husband's disinterest, we joined the queue to see Santa Claus. Photo's purchased because you do. Birthday wishes given by Santa to husband. I was happy!",
          "Meeting Santa, is very happy to meet Santa in Finland. He is so nice. He talk to us in some Chinese.. haha..",
          "To be honest, I didn't believe I'd be so impressed, but meeting Santa was a personal highlight and a lifetime experience. We didn't have to wait too long in the early afternoon, only a few people were in front of us in the queue. Santa was very nice and and we had a nice chat.",
          "We posted some cards from here as it is a novelty to get the arctic circle postmark on them. Reasonable price and a nice gift for loved ones back at home",
          "Brilliant for believers of all ages! Now I know what happened to all those letters I wrote to Santa!",
          "If you have children - so go to meet Santa. Santa looks and speak very intelligent. And if you do not want to buy picture with him - you meet him for free.. But u are not permitted to do your own pictures.",
          "Let the kids see Santa Claus all year long. Lots of shops. It is very beautiful and there are plenty of restaurants and coffee shops.",
          "When is the last time you wrote a postcard to family or friends? Writing a postcard, get a special stamp of Santa Claus and mail your greetings from Finland back home!",
          "The office is located in the heart of Santa Claus Village. We roamed around the souvenir stores for abit before moving up to level 2 to meet Santa. You can meet the Santa for free as you are not obliged to purchase the photo n video taken. But I was overwhelmed after meeting",
          "My wife and I wanted to meet Santa Claus and it was a very nice experience, because the way the village has been built in exactly how you would picture it in the Santa Claus movies, but there are many attractions and good spots to take pictures. It has many sports activities, eg",
          "I think is the best place in Santa's village. Is full of people all the time, but you can buy and send postcard to your family/friends. The prices vary from 1-6\u20ac per postcard but there are lots of them to choose. And there are also another souvenirs that you can buy. The stamps",
          "Just a tourist spot with plenty of souvenir shops and some activities for the kids. Worth a stop just to say you have been there.",
          "We went on a sunday afternoon and there were only a few people around so we didn't have to wait for meeting santa. The entry was free but for the picture you habe to pay but it was worth it. We even could talk to him a while and taking several pictures and we were in no hurry.",
          "We're not children anymore, but we also got very excited to visit the 'real' Santa Claus and have some official photos with one of them :) You can have the video of meeting Santa, along with the photos you choose electronically. A bit overpriced, but worth it, I must say, as",
          "I was very excited to visit SantaClaus village, but disappointed. They told us to come back at 3pm for the photo, but when we go back 3pm, we must line up again for almost 1h. Why tell us come back at 3pm then?? The meeting with Santa was only 2min. He say hello!, photo, bye bye.",
          "We had a lovely trip to Santa clauses office. We only posted postcards as It is very busy and very commercialised. It was nice to post the postcards but we didn't care much for the crowds or souvenirs",
          "Santa claus was so personable he made our day special. Our children were speechless. Lovely to see the wonder in everyone's eyes.",
          "The village is the most horrible experience we could do. Everything is fake, too commercial and made in very low quality. Crowded and no magic at all.",
          "I knew the existence of this place through a travel tv program and since then it is on my travel checklist and I am excited that I have managed to check that off this year. There is nothing much to do other than sending a postcard or letter to people all around the world with",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the visit to Santa's village. The arrangement for photo's with Santa is really very well done. The atmosphere of the entire place at Christmas is quite surreal, with Reindeer rides available just adjoining Santa's office.",
          "of course you must see Santa , nice village and free entrance ; can be very busy there is a waiting line for Santa",
          "We ordered and paid for 32 letters for friends and families children in late August and was told that these letters will be posted in November. These letters were not cheap ! As yet only 2 arrived in England and none as yet in Australia. I rang this post office during the last",
          "Beautiful part of Finland, still some snow around but most of the shops and restaurants were closed. Still got to meet Santa, although queue was a problem if time is short. We did organise Christmas messages from Santa, however, they did not arrive in time for Christmas so very",
          "Inside it is mainly a souvenir shop. The path leading to Santa's office is somehow fascinating for kids, but the wardrobe downstairs and the long waiting line make it less worthwhile. Fortunately we had seen Santa in the morning at Christmas House in the Holiday Village where we",

          "We got there early and it was not too busy. Helpful staff and lots of different things to see and do. Our children enjoyed writing and posting their postcards to Father Christmas, we then had a magical reindeer ride through the forest, without having to wait. The children then",

          "We visited Santa Claus Village in Dec 2015 and it was like a fairytale, it was the best place to spend Christmas , especially meeting Santa at Christmas Eve!! He was soooooo nice!! we enjoyed visiting his office of course, its a very special and magical place!",
          "My 6 year old and I traveled from Alabama to see Santa. We stayed at the Original Sokos Hotel. I reviewed that separately. We arrived by plane from Helsenki and went immediately to Santa's Village. The main thing you need to know is NOT to get off at \"Santa's Park\" That is",

          "It is great. Really easy to see, it is the main building in Santa Claus village. Be aware that Santa might be different along the day. I went twice, first time was quite fast so I did not enjoy the experience. In the afternoon was much better, no people waiting so I could",
          "This is really lovely place but did not have much time hear as we were with Thomson we only had 1 and half hours Did not get a chance to send post cards or to see Santa .There is some nice shops but the price is way over the top",

          "We went on a Thursday, in December at about 11 am. There was a large group of tourists but other than that, the line was pretty short and moved fairly quickly. Santa was absolutely lovely, very kind and patient, just as one would hope Santa would be. I loved our pictures and",

          "The place is very busy. But they have a lot of tables for writing cards. Decoration and all the letter from children all over the world are nice to see. I also liked the outfit of sales persons.",
          "We've gone to Rovaniemi twice now over the years and visiting Santa in his office is always the first thing we've done. The kids are so excited to visit him and it really is a very pleasant visit with the big guy. It doesn't feel rushed and the conversation flows effortlessly.",
          "Visiting Santa Claus Office and meeting Santa himself is like a childhood dream come true...even though I am now an adult. Its a magical feeling.",
          "You get to see the Santa for 5 min, just to take a photo that will cost you 30/40 eur. It is 100% commercial and they're have put zero effort into trying to hide the fact. Not much else to do there but shop for stuff you don't need.",

          "It was such a lovely experience to meet Santa, he was so interested in the letters the children brought with them. You can go a on reindeer sleigh ride, have a lovely lunch in the restaurant, shop up a storm at the many gift shops and post letters from the post office.",
          "We visited on a perfect winter day, it was minus 12 Celsius and the sun was setting. Its a cosy place but loads of shops with things you don't really need. There was a restaurant that looked nice by the igloo hotel. But the other restaurants was burgers and fries. Quite good",
          "This is much fun not just for children! The meeting with Santa is quite magic as well as the way to his office - quite mysterious. The great point is also Santa's Post Office, where you can post card to your friends and relatives (with the original Lapland's stamp), supported by",
          "Nice view especially in snows. Good chat with Santa Claus and staff inside. They sell the pictures and video which record the meeting with Santa Claus. A good memory for all. Once purchased, you can download the picture and video on the website by yourself or share it with",
          "Very touristic but nevertheless a nice experience. Especially if you are travelling with kids you should visit this place. Santa was relaxed and made some good jokes.",
          "Is good for your kids. they dream, enjoyed and for that reason every thing is justified. Is one time.",
          "A nice place, pleasant. There are letters from children from many countries in the world. There was even almost a sexual letter in German...children discovered it....",
          "I know this place is very touristy and everything is designed for us to spend more money, but it has also a magical vibe that no other places can replicate. No detail is left to chance, everything is very well thought of. The experience of meeting Santa was great and very well",
          "I knew in advance that I wouldn't pay for that overpriced video's with Santa and yet is just had too. He's that magical as was the visit!!! Loved it. Must must see",
          "Great place to bring family for a day out or even stay a couple of days. There's plenty of things to do around including reindeer ride, husky farm, snow activities and of course see Santa Claus himself. Seeing him is free but it's $$ to get photos. $40 for some photos and video",
          "Loved meeting Santa here. We visited in Oct 2016 so queue was relatively short (20mins) but well worth it, the trade off is no snow though. Excellent Santa. Very funny. The videos/pictures are available for a fee, but otherwise entrance to Santa Clause's Village + Santa's Office",
          "You can visit Santa's here, take a picture (paid) and talk to him. Also you can see many things as gifts, elves, and his tools to make a present.",
          "In September people still were in line to met Santa. I also with my friend and when we met him, he was speaking Estonian. Very surprising experience! To visit Santa and his villiage in the morning had an advatage- not so many turists (short line).",
          "I was not sure was I only dreaming but I really met Santa and talket to him. I told him about my trip to Rovaniemi and my home town. He promised me to visit my home on Xmas. Only five minutes but enough to show my grandchildren the video \"Santa and me\" make them count the days",
          "Absolutely love this! Be sure to stop by to mail out some post cards to your love one from the Official Santa Claus Office (from the North Pole). My family and friends definitely love the stamp on the post cards.",
          "We visited Santa Claus Village in August. Line to Santa Claus was short, only about 10-15 minutes. Clearly the trip was more important to children but a memorable moment also to adults, at least to me it refreshed the old Christmas memory Santa Claus making me to sing a song.",
          "Again children were not disappointed to meet the real looking Santa at the Santa Claus Office. the way to Santa is interesting already for smaller kids and Santa himself sounds very trustful and charming. Fotoshooting costs 40 \u20ac but once in a lifetime at least it's worth of",
          "Spent there more then 2 hours in Septmeber, not many people around, but personel very polite and nice. Also took a picture of me, my friend and Santa Claus (it costs 35 EUR).",
          "This is place where the fairy tale comes true. Meeting Santa Claus is memorable event in your lifetime. The whole staff makes you feel you are actually in a fairy tale world.",
          "Popped in here during our trip to Rovaniemi. .. How could we pass it by really! You can purchase from the many postcards and stamps and get them sent from Santa's official post office to a loved child or grandchild etc, either on that day or pre arranged for delivery at",
          "Lots and lots of souvenir shops. We didn't stop to see Santa- although if you had children that would be the obvious thing to do. We did visit the huskies which had boundless energy so a little sad maybe to see them in cages. Also visited the reindeer, you were able to feed and",
          "I visited in July and was surprised how many tourists there were. It's a great activity any time of year. You walk through and meet Santa for a photo, though you don't have to buy.",
          "amidst the many souvenir and outlet stores, right on the Arctic Circle there is also a small hut to visit Santa in his own habitat. exciting for kids, dreamland for shopaholics.",
          "the place is rather fairy-tale - an experience you definitely need to offer to your child while he believes in Santa! come at 4-5 p.m - no lines at all!",
          "The Santa Claus Office is a not so exciting place. There is hardly anything to do except from meeting Santa Claus. The old guy was kind but we paid 40 euro per person for some pictures. I found it extremely expensive on a standalone and per value basis too. The only good thing",
          "I won't recommend anyone to go there if they don't mind skipping it.. it's just a post office which you can post some postcards to friends with quite high postal fees.",
          "Meeting Santa was a big tick on my bucket list and he certainly didn't dissapoint he was so genuine asking relavent questions and interested in my answers I walked away very happy indeed",
          "Good experience for both kids and adults. A photo with Santa is an amazing souvenir from the Santa Claus Office",
          "You can meet santa here, but we couldn't. When we went he was not available, so that was a bummer. But we met santa claus in the santa holiday village. So that was ok. Apart from that, this is just a bunch of shops and nothing special. We barely spent 10 mins here to get",

          "It has to be done once in your lifetime ;) lots of people, but lots of different attractions as well and meeting Santa is a must for everyone :)",
          "It is good for kids and adult who have feelings like a kids :-). I think this place could be much better. Photo shoting is not cheap, and you need about 2 hours only for Santa home.",
          "I think it is a very beautiful place, very close to Rovaniemi. You can visit different places in the Santa Claus park.",
          "We came here in end of April, so we don't wait too long to see the Santa Claus. This is a good place we can continue the hope and dream with our children, especially when they see the Santa Claus appeared and talked with them like a grand father, and try to encourage them to be",

          "As expected, it is a tourist attraction. you get to take a photo with the Santa for about 30-40 euros. The arrangement is well made and is enjoyable for the family. I found all the souvenir shops expensive in this part. Overall, fun place for the family and kids.",
          "My daughters believe in Santa, so we brought them to see him in real life. They were very impressed.",
          "We visited here pre children in 2005 and returned in 2014 with young children. The difference was amazing. What an great atmosphere leading up to see santa which stops children from becoming bored. Well worth the wait... magical for kids and adults. Thoroughly recommend!",
          "I am from Taiwan. I am so amazed that Santa Claus say \"hello\" to me in Chinese. In the office, you will have couple pictures and they are going to have a video recording since you step into Santa Claus's office. It's worth to have it home because you seldom speak to Santa",
          "Santa Claus Office located in the post office in the heart of Santa Claus Village. The village is close to Rovaniemi. In Santa Claus office you can sit and write and send post cards to your home address in order to receive with the postal stamp of the village. People from",

          "It was very nice, Santa was fun and very friendly. We even said a song together as we were the last in the queue he had time for a chat and joke with us. But the only way to get a photo is by paying \u20ac40 euro for it. Which is a lot!! (Free entrance though)",

          "Firstly, it's a nice idea to meet Santa in his hometown. The Post Office from Santa is a must see because you could buy some postcards whow will arrive just around christmas. But, it's such a huge marketing maschine which cave me a little bit to think about it...",
          "This is THE attraction of Rovaniemi although I think it is very commericalised and over-rated. You are not advised that your visit with Santa will be on live cam except for a sign at the door to the Santa room - too late for anyone who doesn't want to be appear on live cam.",
          "Although traveling with a group of 18 adults only, we all found this last stop before the airport rather amusing, recalling the photos we made every year in our child days... We had photos taken with Santa which are good quality, they look nice and are even a funny souvenir to",

          "A visit to Santa is a must when you visit Rovaneimi.Santa was a huge nan & I felt like 6 years old again. Absolutely magical & we were videotaped the whole time & offered to us for purchase as we were leaving. Great marketing & we both loved our few minutes with Santa as it",
          "Free to enter although santa only works 9-5 and when you see him at the end you feel obliged to buy the picture taken with you. I'm sure this is the catch up to take your own pic you feel like you have to buy. Deffienlty worth going too see him regardless",
          "We went in to see Santa Claus. He was nice and friendly. We took a photo with him, but we didn't buy it. They don't let you use your phone or camera inside. Photo cost 30 euros and up.",
          "This place is mandatory. Meeting Santa is one of a lifetime experience no matter how old you may be. It is touristy, but hey, it's done well, so there's nothing wrong with a little commercial flavor. I would recommend this place, indeed",

          "To have a photo with santa claus you have to wait on the line. And 40 euros are a little bit high for this kind of experience. But may be fun for the kids. There is better attractions in the village like taking the reindeer tour .But no need to go to Santa village by tour",

          "Beautiful place with excellent service in terms of everything, from the post office to Santa Claus and buying gifts. The arctic line is just across the village in case you want to take pics, photos with Santa cost a bomb but it's a decision which is subjective to your Budget.",

          "We were quite sceptical of the visit to Santa Claus, and while queueing we were sure we would not pay the \u20ac30/40 for our picture with Santa. Yet meeting Santa felt incredibly nice, we felt like children again! And we ended up buying the pictures of our meeting. Definitely",
          "Ok first of all no cameras. You can't use your own camera and you have to buy the photo and the video. There are several package deals and I took the one with all the photos and videos. I could download them through their web so basically I bought a code so I can do that. Paid",
          "Great fun, fantastic Santa and entrance in, bit of a slow queue but not rushed when we got to sit with him and take the photo, which of course is a bit pricy ;)",
          "After 17.00 it was less crowded and we spent with Santa as much time as we wanted. I will intentionally skip the details as it should remain a mystery. Should you have the opportunity do not hesitate going to Santa's office!",

          "1. Food is great, we had burger and chips 2. Photo with Santa queue is short, price of 20 Euro is reasonable 3. Lots of slopes covered with snow for my 6 year old son to play toboggan 4. Reindeer rides is fun for both kids and adults 5. Overall, great Christmas experience",

          "Santa was absolutely beautiful, he is defiantly the \"real\" Santa. Very well organised on approaching the meeting. I guess to ensure the line goes quickly he didn't ask my daughter what she wanted for Christmas. When I tried to encourage her to tell Santa he asked her to write",
          "The photo moment with santa was great. He took the effort to talk Dutch with us and the kids where very impressed. You pay an acceptable amount of money for the photo and all is a must do when in Lapland",

          "Okay, it's cheesy and all, but why else go there? You can buy a video of the experience as well. I accidentally dropped my iPad and smashed the screen just before I sat next to Santa, so now I have that on film to show the travel insurer.",
          "Ok so maybe as were slightly older it wasn't as magical plus it was really raining when we visited BUT I still feel this place was a total rip off! There is loads of different Santa's all over the place! They wouldn't let you stroke the rain deer unless you paid! Plus 10000 over",
          "Even though we are adults my girlfirend and I had a good time here. The main attraction is to meet with santa then you can buy the pictures for about 35-40 euros. A lot of people find this expensive but you are only here once and I think it was worth it. The ice bar wasn't ready",
          "As an adult I have to say tahat seeing the real Santa is a highlight. I was lucky enough to go n August when he was not busy and had a private audience. Super guy recorded a message to a friends sick daughter. The REAL thing.",
          "it was fun and sweet to meet papa noel :) Really cool experience ! You have to do this absolutely if you come to santa claus village",

          "We got there off-season so there was not much people, but I guess during xmas it will be very crowdy. Well the meeeting was nice, few words of chitchat, one photo, which you cat buy for 40 EUR and thats it. For kids definitely great, but typical tourist trap.",
          "Regardless of your age there is always an excitement to meet Santa Claus. The Office includes history of how the Christmas had been celebrated in Finland thru the years and a nice souvenir shop. There is also an opportunity to make a memorable Christmas for a kid: you can paid",
          "If you go to Rovaniemi is mainly because you wanna see Santa Claus and his office... Well his office is , in reality, an enormous gift shop. I didn't like this place,because it takes out the most part of the \"magic\" of Santa... If you go to Rovaniemi, try something else....",
          "Although Santa Claus does not exist, this place makes dreams of children and adults (with a kid in them) come true. I hope this place never closes. Thank you Santa Claus!",
          "So this is the residence of the \"Official\" Santa Claus in Rovaniemi, on the Arctic Circle! If you want to show your kids what Christmas and Winter Wonderland are about \u2013 this is the place to be. Anyone can meet Santa for free, however, the photo with him costs rather big money.",
          "Even if this is the only worth thing to do in the village, it is really worth it. There is some magical around the office and whether you are 5 or 55, you must feel some emotion when you enter the room for the first time. We were lucky to be in a low season period so we could",
          "He DOES EXIST! We saw him. It is probably better to go there when the snow is also here but it is great for children and parents. He took time for us",
          "A few shops, some activities for the children, cute post office that I'm sure would be great for posting to Santa etc for children. Better to go in snow season and closer to Christmas!",
          "It really was interesting to meet the Santa (or not) in person we were able to take a family picture there. If you have kids you gotta bring them here! You gotta pay for the photos tho xD",

          "We went here by chance. And I must admit that the visit was not good. The Santa Claus made some jokes (he probably thought they were fun) regarding the father of family, and the son of the family remembered those and mentioned some of them over and over again during the travel",
          "Being sceptical we thought this would be another tourist trap. We were pleasantly surprised. Relive your childhood and visit! Have your photo taken and the best part...chat with the guy in the red suit. He is great...great conversationist and makes you feel special.",

          "Santa was the nicest man on the planet. Let me just say that across the plaza from Santa's place was a nice place to eat. We had reindeer burgers. Is it bad taste (pun intended) to eat reindeer at Santa's place? Was that poor reindeer an underperformer? Is that what happens",
          "I guess it was the raining day that made my trip a bit disappointing. I think I will try visit this place during winter. The Santa was very welcoming and friendly.",

          "I visited Santa just as the office opened on a weekday morning in April - there was no one else at the Office so the atmosphere was a little strange, in fact the pat to go and see Santa was a little spooky. However when I got there I was welcomed by a very friendly elf, and",
          "Nice and warm atmosphere, our kids (5&7) loved the opportunity to shake hands with father Xmas. I was pleasantly surprised by the experience.",
          "Really touristic place with a lot of souvenirs shops. Visit Santa's is magical, even if you are a grown-up. He is nice and talk to you. The business in this place, apart from the souvenirs, are the pictures with Santa (that mostly everybody buy) that are really expensive",
          "We always like visiting Santa when close to Rovaniemi. The staff, or Santa and the elves to be more precise, have never disappointed us. Buying the pictures/video with Santa is not cheap but on the other hand it's free to visit and you can choose not to buy the photo if it",

          "Worth a visit and we came here to see the arctic circle. The shops were good but a lot of them were selling the same type of thing but guess that is to be expected. Great that you can send cards that will be sent at christmas time and sure it would be more magical at Christmas",
          "This is more about the experience than other thing. Sure Rovaniemi has things to do but to come so far you need an extra motivation. Coming with kids so they can see Santa and give him their letter for Christmas is great. They love such experience and I believe even later they",

          "We visited in May but it was great fun all the same and we enjoyed looking round the small christmas museum and saying hello to Santa. The village is very close to Rovaniemi airport and there is lots of choice of food and drink (overpriced as usual in major tourist attractions)",

          "During my 6 month long association with Lapland, this is one of the places that left a lasting impression on me. I'll start with the huge temperature indicator tower erected right in the center. While walking to work everyday in the center, I loved checking the city weather",
          "If you stay in Rovaniemi city Centre, definitely worth staying close to Lordi square. We where here when it was snowing and that made it even more magical! They have ice skating and slides. You can hire skates and mats to use on the slides all at very reasonable prices. Nice",

Sampokeskus on one spot, grocermarkets in another. It\u2019s near the Scandic Rov and the Arctic Hotels. And a couple of restos as well ie Nili. Now",

          "Plenty of tourist town restaurants (hamburgers, pizzas, reindeer, salmon), a few pubs, an internal shopping mall with normal clothes outlets, nothing particularly special. All the property is built after the 1950s, as the town was destroyed by fire when the German troops left",
          "No statue there just hand prints of the Eurovision song contest winner band LORD. Shops and restaurants.",

          "Very nice place where you can find christmas trees, shops, resturants.. & everything you need. Recommend to see",
          "Right in the centre of town, so rather hard to miss. Nothing special about it except it us in fascinating Rovaniemi. Just another square and no need to search it out as you will walk through it anyway. There are often stalks, exhibitions etc there.",
          "Its a nice place to lounge when you have nothing to do in Rovaniemi. Decorated with Christmas trees and festoons makes you feel Christmas is just around the corner,",
          "This is a square in the city center of Rovaniemi, where we visited early March. It has nice shops and is reachable easily. We stayed in Rovaniemi only for a week and came on the square several times, especially for the coffee ... enough to do with restaurants, bars and local",
          "This square was a beautiful place during winter, the christmas trees, lights and holiday market shops were great. Plenty of restaurants, bars and shops all the way along this square. everything you need from supermarket through to department stores. The holiday pop-up market",

          "Went here as needed to visit the tourist information center. There was some little stalls close by and very reasonable prices. We bought a lovely cheese grater made from reindeer antlers for EUR10 and everywhere else the same one was around EUR20.",

          "Can get the deer fur here, cheaper here if compare price at husky farm. Managed to get some wooden knife here. There is a mart there with food. Also a small chinese restaurant which price is reasonable.",
          "Expected a bit more of this square, because it`s center of Rovaniemi. In Christmas time this square looks more nice then most city centers with christmas trees, but that's not enought for city where Santa Claus lives :)",
          "In December there's pretty little sunlight, so the Square offers a bit of light. It's spacious, is very well looked after and affectionately decorated at Christmas time. All shops and restaurants lead from it. There's a handy tower which displays the time and temperature.",

          "A great place to hangout when it is not snowing. If you are going to stay in Rovaniemi this is the place to be. There isn't much to see. But every where else is not lively as here.",
          "I liked everything we experienced in Rovaniemi and Lapland. However, Lordi's Square is a pretty depressing place. The whole city centre (five shopping malls in a radius of 100 meters?!?!) has something depressive about it. Please add some warmth. Some wood, a fountain, trees...",
          "For a little town, it has lots to do and the square is great focus point. There are nice shops and the coffee is good!",
          "No much things to see in this place but hey, there's a tribute to Lordi and that should be enough to give the first three stars. Some shops, malls, occasionally little city events. A square, but with Lordi.",
          "Walked through the square and down the street and didn't even realise what the place was until afterwards. It was very quiet when we were here in August lots of shops, restaurants and at least three shopping centers. So exactly what you would expect to find in the Centre of a",

          "If you visit Rovaniemi there is almost no chance to miss this little place as most of the restaurants are in a short walking distance from here. Renamed after Finnland winning the Eurovision Song Contest to the name of the band, that comes from the city it now features a small",
          "This is a great place to go to, if you are looking for some adventure and fun. We (11 bikerfreaks) went here just for a week. Our guides, Jussi and Thomas - very funny guys - their service at all were very good. We certainly had an interesting experience at snowmobiling and a",
          "have an icecream, watch people go by, skaters perform, or just stroll up and down to kemijoki river and back.",
          "This is a pretty standard square in the centre of Rovaniemi, but a must visit if you're a Eurovision fan: who doesn't want to place their hands into the moulds made by Lordi? Surely this is the heart of the A-rock-alypse? :-)",
          "Is a pedestrian and picturesque zone and if you walk around you can't miss the place. There are a lot of shops and a tourist center there.",
          "Just a small inconspicuous square in an ordinary town. Difference is that it is a tribute to the band Lordi previous winners of Eurovision. For us it was no question we just had to visit. Nice tribute even though it was heavily snowed at the time. Easy walk",
          "Maybe it's winter time..street covered with snow..just a normal walking street. There are shopping malls and restaurants surround.",

          "Whilst strolling through the main Rovaniemi shopping street it doesn't hurt to stop and look around this particular square for a few minutes. It's nothing special really, but the Songfestival/Lordi connection makes it fun looking around a a few minutes or so.",
          "its just a square where some people sent up some shops to sell there items. Nothing really special about it.",
          "Nice little snow covered square. Nothing fancy, but it's a good diversion from all the tourist traps here.",
          "If you go shopping or for central Rovaniemi hotels you are forced to go through this place. The activity at this square is relative quite during standard evenings. People tend to be here only if there is a spesific reason?",
          "Have no idea who is Lordi, so interesting that they can name a square for them. Nevertheless this is something that you will definitely come across in town, great place to check out the temperature and time via the tower + using as checkpoint Charlie as you wander around town.",
          "Worth a look but my title says it all. I found a shop that was nice to buy gifts for home but other than that, nothing to see really.",
          "Close to our hotel and offers shopping and great snow playing. Very picturesque. Safe and also very festive with the Christmas shopping.",
          "Great centre tower with clock and temp shown which is helpful during our stay. It is wonderfully lit up by lights all day and night and is home to the great information centre too. Nice market stalls when open.",

          "You may think that this very centrally located square attracts lots of people. Well, it does not, at least most of the time. If you are lucky, you will find some kind of a happening here. Mostly it attracts people wondering what they are doing here and where is everybody. Shops",
          "The only square in Rovaniemi but you can everything what you need. And there are lots of restaurants and bars.",
          "The square was not very special and huge. However, you can find the tourist information centre, shopping malls, restaurants, cafes, \u201cvery famous fast food shop\u201d, or even you can get a taxi here. I thought the winter view was quite good and it looked more stunning in the evening.",
          "This Square in the middle of the pedestrian streets was renamed after Lordi's 2006 Eurovision Song Contest win(remember Hard Rock Hallelujah?). It kind of is Centre of Rovaniemi and in this region you can find shopping malls, pubs, restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops etc.",
          "I'm not sure I'd call a square a \"tourist attraction\", it's just a square. But it's nice, it's a useful meeting point, it has a clock and shows the temperature (the temperature display seemed to be photographed more than the Lordi handprints!), there's the tourist info, a Coffee",
          "The square itself is not that special, but it is the crossing of several streets where you can shop \u00e1nd the entrance of a lovely Shopping Mall named Sampokeskus! In the surrounding you can find a lovely coffeehouse which is named Coffee House Rovaniemi, they serve a delicious",

          "Just a monument for the Lordi members. Nice town square and often empty which makes for quiet good photos.",
          "That's how EuroSong contest is declined in Finland. How great is that? Walk of fame in the arctic circle looks very different.",
          "It's small with a monument in the centre of it where u can see imprints of...palms?=) of the Lordi band - Eurovision 2006 winner. Just as weird as the band itself=))) Might be valuable for fans=))",
          "This is a pretty boring square other than the fact it is named after the Finnish Eurovision winners Lordi and has the band members hand prints set in a central column. It makes for a briefly diverting pilgrimage for Eurovision fans but in truth the square itself is rather dull.",
          "Not a big deal, just hands on a wall...then it's normal mall or shopping. Nothing big or overwhelming.",
          "Somebody told me that they named this square because of the music group who won the Eurovision Song Contest (these ones who where dressed up like monsters few years ago). You can see their hands in the clock of the square. The place is full of shops and coffee shops. Nice place",

        "wiki": "Rovaniemi (Finnish: [\u02c8ro\u028b\u0251niemi] (listen)) is a city and municipality of Finland. It is the administrative capital and commercial centre of Finland's northernmost province, Lapland. It is situated about 6 kilometres (4 miles) south of the Arctic Circle and is between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korkalovaara, at the confluence of the river Kemijoki and its tributary, the Ounasjoki. \nThe city and the surrounding Rovaniemen maalaiskunta (Rural municipality of Rovaniemi) were consolidated into a single entity on 1 January 2006. The resulting city of Rovaniemi is considered the largest city in all of Europe by land area, because the defined limits of the city proper extend far beyond the actual urban area.Rovaniemi municipality has an approximate population of 63,000. The urban area of Rovaniemi has a population of 53 361, in an area of 59,77 km\u00b2. Rovaniemi is a unilingual Finnish-speaking municipality and, uncommonly for larger Finnish towns, it is also known by its Finnish name and spelling in the Swedish language.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe rova part in the name Rovaniemi has often been considered to be of Saamic origin, as roavve in Saami denotes a forested ridge or hill or the site of an old forest fire. In Southern Saami dialects, however, rova means a heap of stones, a rock or a group of rocks in a stretch of rapids or even a sauna stove. The niemi part of the name means \"cape\".\nNames in the Samic languages include Inari Sami: Ru\u00e1vinjarg\u00e2, Northern Sami: Roavenj\u00e1rga and Roavvenj\u00e1rga and Skolt Sami: Ru\u00e4\u02cavnjargg.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeriodic clearance of new land for agriculture and the practise of slash-and-burn cultivation began around 750\u2013530 BC. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travellers from Karelia in the east, H\u00e4me in the south and the Arctic Ocean coast in the north must have come there from 500 AD onwards. The Sami are considered to be Lapland's most indigenous existing population.\nIt is first mentioned by name in official documents in 1453, existing effectively as a set of small villages whose inhabitants earned their living mainly in agriculture and animal husbandry\u2014with fishing and hunting the most important offshoots.The exploitation of Lapland's natural resources in the 1800s boosted Rovaniemi's growth. Extensive logging sites and gold fever attracted thousands of people to Lapland. As the mining of natural resources was increased, Rovaniemi became the business centre of the province of Lapland.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring the Second World War, Finland signed the Moscow Armistice and found itself involved in the Lapland War with its former German ally. Retreating German forces utilised scorched earth tactics, and though initially German General Lothar Rendulic ordered only the public buildings in Rovaniemi to be destroyed, on 13 October 1944 the German army received orders to destroy all the buildings in Rovaniemi, only excluding hospitals and houses where inhabitants were present. While the German rear guard was going about the destruction, an ammunition train in Rovaniemi station exploded and set fire to the wooden houses of the town. The German troops suffered many casualties, mainly from glass splinters. A Finnish commando unit claimed to have blown up the ammunition train and may well have been the primary cause of the town's ruin. The cause was then unknown and generally assumed to be the deliberate intent of Rendulic. During these hostilities 90% of all the buildings in Rovaniemi were destroyed. There is a German cemetery 19 km from Rovaniemi where soldiers killed fighting in Lapland during the war are buried.\nAlthough there has been continuous human settlement in the Rovaniemi area since at least the Stone Age, few of the buildings date back before 1944 since most of the city was destroyed during WWII. When the city was rebuilt, it was designed with input by famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, who planned the city's footprint in the shape of a reindeer's head, with the city roads forming the antlers, and the local stadium as the reindeer's eye.\n\n\n== Modern day ==\n\nSince Rovaniemi is the capital of the region of Lapland, many government institutions have their offices there. About 10,000 of the inhabitants are students. Rovaniemi is home to not only the University of Lapland but also the Lapland University of Applied Sciences (formerly known as the Rovaniemi Polytechnic), which comprises institutes of information and traditional technology, business, health and social care, culinary studies, forestry, rural studies, and sports. Local newspapers include the Lapin Kansa, Uusi Rovaniemi and Lappilainen.\nRovaniemi's most prominent landmarks include the J\u00e4tk\u00e4nkynttil\u00e4 bridge with its eternal flame over the Kemijoki river, the Arktikum Science Museum which rises out of the bank of the Ounasjoki river, the Rovaniemi Town Hall, the Lappia House (which serves as a theatre, concert hall, and congress centre), and the library. The last three mentioned buildings are designed by the famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. The Arktikum Science Museum is a comprehensive museum of Finland's, and the world's, Arctic regions.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nBecause of the unspoiled nature of the area and numerous recreational opportunities, tourism is an important industry in Rovaniemi. The city has a number of hotels and restaurants located both in the centre and on the outskirts of the town, hosting over 481,000 visitors in 2013.Rovaniemi is also considered by Finns to be the official home town of Santa Claus. It is home to the Santa Claus Village at the Arctic Circle and SantaPark Arctic World, which is located 8 km (5 mi) north of the centre. \nDirectly across the river from the town is the Ounasvaara ski centre. The top of the Ounasvaara hill bears the site of some of the earliest known human settlements in the area.\nA phenomenon also attracting numerous tourists is the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights. In Finnish Lapland, the number of auroral displays can be as high as 200 a year whereas in southern Finland the number is usually fewer than 20.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVR Group, the Finnish state railway system, operates direct daytime and overnight passenger trains from Rovaniemi Station to Oulu, Tampere, Helsinki and Turku. Diesel-powered passenger trains operated north-east of Rovaniemi to Kemij\u00e4rvi until March 2014, when electrification to Kemij\u00e4rvi was completed. Rovaniemi Airport is located about 10 kilometres (6 mi) north of the Rovaniemi city centre.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDue to its location near the Arctic Circle, Rovaniemi has a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfc) with short, pleasant summers, while the winters are long, cold and snowy. The city lies just south of the 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) mean annual isotherm, but freezing in the soil is very limited even during the winter due to typical heavy snow cover. Its extreme northerly location combined with frequent overcast skies leads to very low levels of sunshine in the winter months; December averages just under six minutes of sunshine daily. Winters are somewhat modified by marine air from the North Atlantic Current that ensures average temperatures are less extreme than expected for an inland area at such a northerly latitude.\nOn 26 April 2019, Rovaniemi recorded its warmest April day on record with 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F).\n\nThe average annual temperature in Rovaniemi is 0.9 \u00b0C (33.6 \u00b0F). Snow stays on the ground 175 days a year on average. The lowest temperature ever recorded at the airport is \u221238.1 \u00b0C (\u221237 \u00b0F), recorded on 28 January 1999. However, on the same day temperatures as cold as -47.5 C were recorded at nearby weather stations.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded is 32.2 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F), recorded on July 18, 2018 at the railway station.Despite the fact that Rovaniemi experiences polar day between 7 June and 6 July (30 days) it does not experience polar night.

However, there is an \"office hour\" for Santa Claus and he may not be in the office all the time even when the Village is open.\nNorthern Lights: also known as Aurora Borealis. The Northern Lights are observed on around 150 nights in a year from mid-August till early April. The Arctic Garden and the top of Ounasvaara fell are the best destinations to witness Northern Lights. According to science, it is caused by electrically charged particles from the sun colliding with air molecules in Earth's atmosphere, and deflected by Earth's magnetic field. This process results in emission of colourful light, visible at night. Green is the most common colour in this process, while red, pink, violet, yellow, and even blue may be observable too.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe Santa Claus Park that is connected to the Santa Claus Village was in 2007 awarded by Topworld International and placed as the second best Travel Adventure in Finland. So long in 2008, it still holds second position after Topworld invited travellers to vote for their own Top 10 list over adventures.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "It was August, not December but in the village the music was all about Christmas. You can find the Santa house, post office, a lot of shops, restaurants, but everything is very commercial; you pay a lot for every souvenir and it doesnot worth the money. For children is very nice",
          "Inside the Arctic Circle! A lot of shopping, close to Lapland tours, and of course the official post office for Santa Claus!",
          "We were there in March 2017. Upon our arrival, our big appartement was already heated up which was really good. It was perfectly clean. We didn't enjoy it much because we were too busy exploring the place even though there is not much to see BUT...around 18h there was nobody",
          "It is very pretty in the snow, particularly as it gets dark so I am giving a little extra for that, but mostly it is cheap and nasty souvenir shops. There are some decent shops as well and a visit to the Santa Claus Office is great fun (separate review for that), but the rest",
          "Santa Claus Village is a magical place. Although the place is quite deserted because of the pandemic, it was business as usual. All facilities and restaurants were open. Santa Claus was still welcoming guests in his office. We wanted to experience the village after dark and",
          "We took the bus from Rovaniemi train station and spent half a day here. It was super fun and a great experience to have, especially visiting Santa! It is very touristy, but that\u2019s expected.",
          "Loved our visit to Santa Claus Village today. Even with the worries around the Coronavirus situation we were made to feel welcome and there were still things to do and look at. Loved our visit to Santa \ud83d\ude0a",
          "We had a nice morning at this extremely touristic attraction.. meeting with Santa and do some pictures? 45 euros... never the less the atmosphere is great and the attractions next to Santa are nice... Touristic and expensive, but in the end we had a nice morning! Tip if you",
          "This is a great place to go with kids so that they can see everything in one place and visit Santa. But overall Santa Claus Village is quite touristy.",
          "We had some time left after our tour to see reindeers and huskies. It\u2019s quite a cute place and most certainly fabulous for smaller children. There\u2019s plenty to see and do but obviously also quite touristy at the same time.",
          "The childrens snowmobile ride was fun, reindeers were cute and snow was shining. For the rest, you can feel at every step that the customer service is not of their priority in Santa's village cause probably most of the people go there just once - so why bother? Except us, it was",
          "Lovely place to visit and take photo. There are many souvenir shops around to shop. However, the closing time are slightly early.",
          "Honestly, i really wanted to come here but the problem is than is no so nice. I think it must to be great with children. Is a Christmas time all the year and the souvenir shop are more expensive than in Rovaniemi.",
          "We visited this place because it is very famous and on all tour guides. This place, in fact, is very touristy and unfortunately, perhaps for this reason, it has completely lost its Christmas atmosphere. I only save the Santa Claus post office and the small restaurant where they",
          "We went to Rovaniemi for the Aurora but if you are there You have to go to Santa's Village it's a must-see place. My wife loved it (of course she loves Christmas). We went as couple for next time definitely bringing the rest of the family.",
          "nice place for 2 hours maximum . you can see some thing and buy expensive gift . but if you are in the area it's recommended to go",
          "Accommodation in Finland can be expensive, for the price this place exceeded expectations. We stayed as a couple but of course is great for families also. I thought the place would feel too busy being in Santa Claus Village but it didn't and the accommodation is private and",
          "I was there in February 2019 with my friends that live in Finland for the last several years. I've heard a lot about that place and it was a good chance to visit it. A lot of snow with small fabulous houses make this place really stunning. There're a vast of entertainment you",

          "Children were excited and as an adult, I must admit i was too. The short waiting queue was a bag of small nerves. Kids signed the Santa book. We all hugged Santa and took a memorable photo (obviously at a price). But well worth it. Santa Park was absolutely full of fun for",
          "Well\u2026 probably one of the most touristy places in Lapland\u2026 but I understand why it is great for families and younger children in general. Meeting Santa Claus is one of the deepest wishes during childhood. On the other hand\u2026 Santa Claus Village is an industry in which parents are",
          "Even though it's February and no longer Christmas time, there are still Christmas carols playing in the public area in Santa Claus Village! It really feels like a magical place. Also the Arctic Circle line is within Santa Claus Village and you will cross into the Arctic Circle",
          "The whole visit is magical. We started our visit with Santa office to meet Father Christmas. And then we checked the Post Office to send xmas postcards for posting xmas 2020. We did husky and reindeer ride and many more. Highly recommend it.",
          "Santa Village is an amazing place to visit with children. There is so much to do and play for all ages. A lot if activities are to be paid for and are a bit expensive however when there is snow everywhere kids can play and slide all around the village. There are lots of gift",
          "If you come all the way upto Artic circle, of course you want to meet Santa Claus! Ofcourse this place us super commercial and touristy with a bit over priced souvenirs, but I enjoyed our short visit here. It's very lively... I found the idea of sending x mas post cards from",

          "If you come all the way to Rovaniemi it should be a place to visit apparently. For me, it was practically not more than a small theme park. However, it is also true that all the snow and lights make it a quite magical vibe and cheering pleasure.",
          "Is a christmas day every day you visit this place. Everything is set to inspire your Christmas spirit. I went in low season, so the visit was great, no queue, the place have a very good salmon restaurant, very easy to reach the place with public transport. It have enough",
          "Beautiful place. Everything a child could dream of. I took a 9yr old and a 19yr old. Both had equally as much fun. Friendly, helpful people. Plenty to do (usually at extra cost); Snowman World, Husky Rides, Reindeer Sleigh Rides, Santa's Post Office, seeing the big man himself",

Expected more. Happend to find a lot of raindeers accross the road in the forest for free. Lifted the",

          "Everything at Santa clause village was awesome be it the activities, cafes or meeting Santa. The entire theme of the place was very lively and cozy at the same time. I highly recommend it for families with small children. However, the picture they took with Santa was a little",
          "Nice trip for children - good to see if you spend your holiday nearby anyway. We drove two and a half hours each way and were disappointed :-( Only recommendable for people being ready to spend a lot of money. Walking around and shopping (the whole village consists more or less",
          "The place is really beautiful and it felt like living my childhood dreams of having a white Christmas. We had the chance to spend time with Santa Claus and the elves. Crossed the Arctic circle, tried snowmobile and did husky sledding. It was a really fun holiday! I should warn",
          "If you are already in Rovaniemi, you might as well visit this place. While this place is open everyday of the year, winter is the best time to visit to experience that Santa-Christmas feel. Get into the mood and re-live your childhood.",
          "Took a lot of trips here during the summer as well as winter. Santa Claus Village is open year round, no matter what time of the year you choose to visit it. And you can find santa there in his office during his working hours. Get a photo clicked with him, it's all for free.",
          "Now I know how Santa affords all those presents for the kiddies ... via the extortionate and crass commercialism on display here. I mainly killed time waiting for the return bus by writing postcards to everyone I know, but even the postcards were a bit sad and schlocky and",
          "We stayed a couple of nights in the new tempur suite and it was amazing experience. The room was spacious, clean include a large private balcony with nice views and a private sauna. The area is huge with all the facilities, attractions,rides,various restaurants and shops that",
          "Our kids are twelve, the village is for much younger kids. Not too much things to do. Also much smaller than what we expected. The snowman world is the most interesting thing over there.",
          "We spent a couple of hours at the village in the morning, finishing with a coffee and then transport to Bearhill Husky. Sending postcards from Santa\u2019s Post Office is good fun and if you want Christmas Tree decorations this is the place. A couple of hours is long enough if you\u2019re",
          "My kids loved it and it is visually stunning, but I would recommend some of the private Santa meetings if this is the main reason for your visit to Rov. The meeting with Santa is very brief and most the buildings are gift shops.",
          "It's like a shopping mall, but expensive. You have to pay for nearly everything, even if you want to see reindeers. Wouldn't recommend. P.s the salmon is good...but expensive",
          "What can you say it's Santa's Village! Chance to send a postcard with a special stamp on it as well as heaps of the obligatory souvenirs. Glad we weren't here in December as it would have been chaos. Had a lovely time walking around in the snow and taking it all in. Great",
          "For those who come from a cold climate environment like Canada or the Northern part of the USA, it's something to see. Visiitng the village when its all lite up, meaning after 3:330pm (15:30) is very nice. The multi color theme and snow and ice is great for the kids and those",
          "We didn\u2019t really like visiting Rovaniemi and all that Santa\u2019s kinda of entertainment. There\u2019s nothing special. And there are 2 Santas, both boring and saying same learned phrases. Santas are just young men in costumes with same learned phrases that requires huge amount of money",
          "We went to santas village but in particular went to the snow man village. The Ice sculptures were gorgeous, there was a beautiful ice resturant and bar (we didn't have time to eat here sadly). Ice skating around the halls. And the best bit, ice slides that you can slide down on",
          "A really story book kind of place. We were warned it would be expensive however we didn't find it too bad. Staff very obliging and helpful",
          "This is a resort type of place with everything to offer to the young and the old. Nothing is more wonderful than to allow your imagination to run wild in the snow magical fun filled place. From visiting Santa\u2019s post office, husky petting, snow tubing, ice skating, reindeer",
          "How can anyone be sad here? Snow and Christmas! Just so wonderful! Lots to do here. Food is amazing (go to the salmon hut-see my other review) Crossed the arctic circle So many activities including reindeer and dog sledding Definitely visit!",
          "Santa Claus village is an extraordinary tourist attraction, lots of beautiful shops, the local hand made knife shop, Marttiini a must visit if you appreciate good knives. Recommend any of the restaurants to dine at Santa Claus village",
          "I purchased my artic circle certificate and promptly book a husky sled ride which I thoroughly enjoyed. The dogs were in great condition and very friendly all staff and husky handlers were great and took some great photos for me. The post office is fun. Plenty of other",
          "Was neat going through the Artic Circle with the live webcam, meeting Santa Claus and having a quick dinner. After 3 hours my 7 year old was done and we returned to our Igloo.",
          "Nice place to go with your kids But I think they need more directions and in the map they should put where we can go and do stuff because we were lost on what can we do other than visiting Santa",
          "This is a village setup as Santa Claus home and has many winter sports to try including snow mobiling, huski and reindeer sledding, rubber tubing, ice skating, etc and also the opportunity to visit Santa Claus.",
          "Met Santa for a photo, which was fantastic! Overall it\u2019s very pretty and exciting especially for children, but pricey and somewhat commercialised. I\u2019ve been once, and probably won\u2019t go again. Was most excited to stand on either side of the arctic circle.",
          "Just make sure you\u2019ve taken the time to do a Fat Bike ride with Roll Outdoors, and an Electric Snowmobile tour, before wasting your time here. Once you\u2019ve experienced the delights of the real world Rova forest a few times, then by all means kill some junk time at this kinda",
          "Northern lights trip and greet Santa Claus .No entrance fee but if take photo have to pay 35 euros .In village there are gift shops and restaurants.",
          "Had a magical time at the Santa village. Met the real Santa and stepped across the artic circle. The experience was magic.",
          "It\u2019s absolutely beautiful! If you want to buy a souvenir get it from the other stores rather than Santa\u2019s main office because the one I bought for 8\u20ac was in the other ones for 4\u20ac",
          "Nice marketplace with cute cafes and tourist shops and a post office to send Christmas cards from Santa. A nice place to spend 1-2 hours.",
          "A visit here was 'Must Do', but this place is designed to extract $$ from families by the bucket load. It was nice to have a look around, but there is not much here for couples. It really is a fantasy land for the children to enjoy the magic of Christmas and Santa Claus \ud83c\udf85",
          "Came a few years ago during Autumn. Teenage son played along well on this trip for his young sister! The village has expanded and was much busier. 1Hour queue to meet Santa in his office but worth the wait. Got to ride with reindeer and huskys. Good food on the cafe. Lovely",
          "I am not a Christmas type of person. I am the real grinch But I visited and was one of the best experience of my life. I meet the real Santa and had reindeer sleigh ride you could spend the whole day without getting bored. Shops or more expensive than other shops but a lot of",
          "You get to meet Santa, ride snowmobiles, reindeers, huskies and many more activities in the santa village. There is a snowman world made of ice with ice bar, ice restaurant inside.",
          "This was not the dream destination we had hoped for, it's very busy, commercialised and expensive. Tried to see Santa several times, the queue was 3hrs plus, had to return early next morning to see Santa before all the coaches arrived. You are not allowed to take your own",
          "A great day out at Santa Claus Village. The ice bar and restaurant are a must do. We had drinks in the Ice bar and lunch in the Restaurant. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Also go and visit Santa is his home. The village not only caters for children but adults also. A",
          "This place was special. Even as an adult it felt magical. It was so pretty, lit up with lights in the trees around the village and felt really peaceful even when it was busy (if that makes sense!) it was actually snowing when we visited which just added to the atmosphere. It",
          "This place appears to be a tourist scam. Everything is pricey in Santa Claus Village, but people like it, the view, the environment, the snowman and real time webcam etc. Queue up for one hour to take photo with Santa Claus and willingly pay $xx for the photo and short video",
          "Went once in Jan 2018 and the second time in Dec 2019. Recommendation is to avoid the Christmas period in December until New Year as the park tends to get really crowded and it will get really difficult to get a good shot of the area. However, in January, the crowd thins and",
          "Okay so the cost to get there can be a bit of a show stopper. It's worth it. You will be amazed that at 3 pm you are taking photos in the dark in December, the cold you will remember as it is very cold. You will find hot coffee, chocolate, and tea of all forms around. The",
          "It\u2019s a pretty adorable place! We really liked it. A lot of stores to buy souvenirs from but what was disappointing is meeting Santa. It took ages to get through the queue and you get photographers by their cameras you can\u2019t use your phone so you have to buy the pictures, which",
          "We have a nice day in Santa Claus Village, this is a fantastic experience. But a small event in the very end made us really unhappy and even ruined our emotion for the whole day. We visited the souvenir store in the downstair of loft coffe(Joulumaantie 1, 96930 Napapiiri) which",
          "Visiting Santa Claus Village first time for this year. I recommend house of Mrs Santa, shopping in shops and enjoying the athmosphere, lights and snow. We had our german friend with us and she liked this place too!",
          "Our Daughter was only 8 months old at the time of the visit, so most if not all the attractions were lost on her... but it was still very charming and to see Santa was a treat. Notes - We carried our daughter so did not travel with a stroller (I do think that the snow is",
          "Wonderful Santa Claus and Christmas themed village. Many activities including reindeer sleighs, dog sledding and snowmobiling. The Finnish people are delightful to be around and everyone is fluent in English.",
          "My husband and I arrived to Rovaniemi by train to stay at the ArcticSnow Hotel, and decided to make a pit stop here. We had three pieces of luggage with us that we were able to store in a gift shop for about 7 euros. The village is cute, it's super commercialized obviously,",
          "We visited the day before Christmas Eve (12/23/19) which is when they have the big send off parade (it starts at 7 p.m.) It is free to park and walk about the village. There are shops, restaurants, snow sleds, etc. You can see Santa for free but you cannot take pictures, their",
          "Very touristic but pleasant place to visit ! During Christmas season is even more beautiful ! We met Santa Claus, the real one !",
          "Place is amazing and spotless. Everyone here is just so happy to be there. Kids had an amazing day. Snowman world very expensive for small area. But Santa Claus village is amazing !!",
          "Loved The Santa Claus Village! So much to do for everyone - young and old alike! Make sure you stop by the Reindeer Park, Santa Claus Post Office, meet the real Santa Claus, and cross the Arctic Circle. A once in a lifetime experience you will not forget!",
          "Santa village Positives: - Cute buildings especially when covered in thick snow. Sledges lying around that kids can use free of charge. - Short reindeer rides that you don't need to book in advance (5 mins and 15 mins) - Convenient for booking tours. Side note: You really",
          "Wonderful winter wonderland, reminds me of what Walt Disney has created at Disney land, they have created here for Christmas",
          "This is the fairytale winter wonderland for kids. The snow is superb and the whole atmosphere magical. Arrive early to see Santa - the queues can be lengthy. At Christmas it\u2019s a good idea to pre-book husky sledding & the lunch package in Snowman World. The reindeer ride was",
          "We came here to see Father Christmas. If you want him to give your child a present, this happens right before you go in. I hit worried so I wanted others to know. We actually spent 2 days here because my daughter loves playing in the snow so much. We did the huskies and reindeer",
          "It's all hype. Buildings and Christmas lights are just a trap for the cheapest flea market merchandise and some \"Finland\" wool hats and sweaters that is sold at any store. The merchandise is so bad that the kids couldn't find anything on which to spend 50 Euros we gave them",
          "Arrived at Santa Village 9.30am of the 24 December 2019 well before the crowds .As the bus approaches the village your excitement mounts and with all the lights in the trees and the sun beginning to rise it is a magical atmosphere that greets you.And then reality hits this is",
          "My partner and I were really excited to visit the Santa Claus village, our joy disappeared quickly when we saw skinny and sad looking reindeers waiting to take tourists on a 400m ride for 18 euros. While the reindeers waited for their turn to take tourists around, they were tied",
          "Please don't waste your time going here, until this place adjusts itself by listening to its reviewers. The long and short of it is that the public are spending hard earned money to reach this place, only to be disappointed, it is purely commercial, and full of cringey tat, and",
          "We visited here during the afternoon a few days before Xmas. Was beautiful with lights and had a real magical feeling. Was very busy though and pretty expensive in the shops. We planned to return in the morning the next day or day after as thought it would be quieter then, but",
          "Visited Santa Claus Village on 29th December. This place is definitely over rated! It was so busy. People were pushing in and que jumping. The visit to Santa was a waste of time, it\u2019s literally photo taken with him then get out. Photo cost \u00a327! Snowman world entry is cash only.",
          "If you come late morning there will be queue everywhere. The sledge are free to use . You can have husky and reindeer rides here but be early.",
          "Quite disappointed. Basically a place with shops, restaurants and tacky souvenirs. Everything even more expensive than everywhere in Finland. Coffee terrible. Not much to do there. All the attractions very expensive. Better save your time and money for Disneyland or Legoland",
          "We had lots of fun here although we never actually got to see Santa; the sheer number of people there meant we had to wait 6 hours for an \u2018appointment\u2019 with a further huge queue after that, taking us well past the last bus back to the city. (and this was post-Christmas). Given",

          "Totally not what I was expecting, it might be fun for kids (they have sleigh rides, etc -- but other tours are a better and less-frenzied way of seeing those things). There's one tacky souvenir stall after another, with very low-end \"cafes\" and walk-up food counters. We wanted",
          "I didn\u2019t liked that much, it\u2019s overly commercialised with only restuarants( more than 5-6 I guess). Because of this and overcrowd, place was less charming. Good thing, I have to wait like 15-20 min only to meet Santa, but 40 euros for phot with him( hard copy) . It\u2019s a nice",
          "We drove from Lule\u00e5 and arrived for about 2pm. It was not too busy when we arrived so we decided to make our way to see Santa. We were extremely disappointed to find out you cannot just queue to see him like I did last time. We were given a time a lot of 18:15 ( a very long",
          "This is the most Christmasy place to be over Christmas. The cottages were great and had no complaints. They drive you to the door and pick you up at the door so you don't have to drag bags thru the snow. There is instant hot water you don't have to wait for it to get hot. Rooms",
          "In August I filled out the Post Office forms for 4 Santa letters to be delivered to Australia by Christmas. None have arrived by today, NY\u2019s Eve. The cost was 8.90 euro each. Likewise I wrote and paid for 4 Christmas postcards to be delivered to Australia and New Zealand by",
          "This is not a great place especially if your on a package holiday and you have already done the reindeer and huskies etc. I was there with my 5yr old daughter who wasn't overly excited at all. Its mainly shops all repeating what the other shops have and staff are extremely rude.",
          "Lovely to visit if you are really into Christmas. Very touristy location but still great. I would definitely stay here rather than in Rovaniemi if I had my time again. Everything available to you in Rovaniemi is available here (snow mobiles; Reindeer Rides; Sledding) plus",
          "Nice place to be visited. Nice the experience to meet Santa Claus. The only cons is that everything is too commercial.... But... Business is business... I recommend anyway a visit if you're around",
          "It's a nice little place beautifully decorated for Christmas. The colourful lighting of the trees is simply spectacular. What you can do here is ride a reindeer sleigh or husky sleigh. Both are very expensive: we tried the reindeer sleight and paid 50 eur (a family of 3) for a",
          "We truly enjoyed our stay here because there were several types of activities ranging from traditional skiing, reindeer interaction, snowmobiles, ice sculptures/bar/restaurant etc. It was very cool to see that there were sledges lurking around everywhere and one could grab them",

          "If it wasn't Christmas then you wouldn't bother going. It's very over crowded and very expensive. The line to see Santa was many hours wait, standing outside in the cold. The attractions close at 1700 so you have to get there very early to beat the ques. It is very icey and",
          "We decided last minute to visit Santa at Lapland with our kids. Although the village is a lot more commercial than we anticipated we had a ball. The Snowman ice cave is incredible, the reindeer rides are great and the main man himself is top class!! there are lots of fun things",

          "We went here several times on our 8 night stay in Rovaniemi. We hired a car and found this the best way to beat the crowds. They have a bus which goes from the city centre but it was 4-5 Euro a person. By having the car you could come and go when you pleased. It is also very",
          "It's strange as the title sums this place up. If it wasn't Christmas then you wouldn't bother going. Yes it's touristy, yes it's expensive and yes you do cross the Artic circle. Free parking scattered around the many different restaurants (cafe to high end available). Many",
          "We visited mostly to mail postcards from the post office, but also wandered around for a bit. This is definitely a must do when visiting Rovaniemi and definitely gets you in the Christmas spirit. The area is well lit and decorated including an arctic circle sign (could not see",
          "Look, if you head to Rovaniemi a few weeks before Christmas you are mad to go here but a fool if you don't. You dragged your family all the way to the Arctic, are all wearing 2-3 pairs of pants, and none of you can put your arms all the way down you are so bundled up, so you",
          "Let\u2019s face it: you\u2019re only going to visit this place once, so don\u2019t let the crowds and queues get to you: it\u2019s worth it. There is a long wait for Santa, as you would expect. We bought the digital photo package @45 euros - pricey, but when you\u2019ve travelled so far to get here,",
          "Perhaps it was a little too touristy but the vibes of the place really oozes the spirit of Christmas. I can see how this place really brings out the inner child for adults. Nice place to visit in the winter.",
          "Personally, I think for first timer, that is a must visit place in Roveniemi. The admmission is free and there are many activities in the village (need to purchase tickets). There are many activities in the park like Reindeer rides; husky rides; visiting igloo house; crossing",
          "If you haven't seen the Santa Claus or cross the Arctic Circle, this is the best place to go ! Recommended to spend a whole day here during winter where you can enjoy and immerse into the Christmas festive and feels. This place is truly magical and it is quite an eye-opening for",
          "This village is a blend of exciting activities, nice restaurants, cozy boutique hotels and commerce. Enjoyed the Snowmobile for kids, the Santa Claus meeting, the dinner in the igloo, and so on. Fabulous experience for a kid of any age.",
          "Worst place ever ! So many better places to visit in Finland .... get close to the locals and stay away from those Americain attraction park lol",
          "Nice visit even for adults. Awakens the child and memories in you. Good service. Finland delivered quality. We will coming back for sure. Mary Christmas!",
          "this is just rubbish. perhaps interesting for kids below the age of 8, but other then that really nothing to recommend.",
          "Santa Claus Village is a cute purpose built village on a large site that straddles the Arctic Circle, a short distance from Rovaniemi. There are numerous hotels and other types of accommodation based here, together with all the infrastructure to support that number of tourists",
          "We went to see Santa yesterday. It was so disappointing, I didn\u2019t know what to say to my 8 year old son. We didn\u2019t pay an extra 25 euros for a gift (I told my son Santa already had his list and was bringing gifts at Christmas). Santa only shook hands with us and didn\u2019t ask my",
          "Wow, wow and wow what an amazing place Rovaneimi is especially this time of year, been home almost a week and still can't quite believe we went there. This place is just where you need to go to get the spirit of Christmas back in your life, my husband and I are 64 and 60 and we",

          "On our way to the airport after our three night TUI stay we were taken to the village. I hadn\u2019t researched this beforehand but it\u2019s an outdoor area and we had returned all our thermal gear so weren\u2019t dressed for an hour outside. You are taken there to spend money, which we",
          "You can let your kids go in a play structure! Festive atmosphere, nicely decorated with lights and giant snowmen. Sleds everywhere for pulling your kids around and so your kids can sled down the little hills. Plenty to do, those reviewed separately. No charge for admission.",
          "Great place with nice lighting & the artic circle. Make sure you take a lot of photos. Also, try the salmon BBQ, it's delicious.",
          "We had a dash around here en route to the airport with TUI. It was OK but not as good as Santa Park. I would guess you'd need about 2 and a half hours to see it all. You may be bored after 2 hours and 35 mins!",
          "My husband and I visit Santa Claus village and both of us being in our 30\u2019s thought it was great! We spent an afternoon here as there was so much to see and do. The place came alive as it got darker and there is so many activities for kids (or adults) to enjoy. A few things",
          "Had a family trip here (youngest 10yo and oldest 60+) and all of us enjoyed ourselves so much! Go visit the Santa Post office, sign up for the husky safaris, snowmobile + Northern ride, reindeer sleigh ride, snowman world etc.",
          "Good place for a day out, many activities mostly catered for children, get there early so you don't have to wait in a long queue to see Santa.",
          "This is a must if you are in Rovaniemi, in the winter it is just magical, its definitely a tourist destination but not at all tacky like a lot of places. Loved our time here and would definitely come back if we get the chance",
          "We stayed in a small village/town much further north of here. At the end of the holiday our tour operator stopped here for an hour and a half to allow everyone on the coach to go shopping. I am so glad we didnt book our holiday here. Sorry if I offend anyone but I felt it was",
          "Loved Santa\u2019s village \ud83d\ude0a lovely little place, great for kids, visited with my Husband, did the ice bar, inflatable ring to slide down the hill (great fun!!!) loved that. Lovely little shops in The central shopping area, very very reasonable prices considering the location.",
          "Santa Claus village is good for kids with ice house, snow mobiling and crossing the artic circle. There's loads of souvenir shops and places to eat. There is a Santa there but we didn't go to this one. Worth a visit",
          "Excellent place for 9 year olds Lots of activities and our 2 loved the snow mobiles at 20 Euro for 10 mins which was long enough at -14 C. if it's forecast to be cold do take hand and foot warmers as many kids were cold and crying. Food reasonably priced for the location. If",

          "While I enjoyed my visit, I think if they brought together the best of Santa's Park and Santa's Village it would make for a more impressive experience. Further one Santa and one post office would make it more real.",
          "Crowded, expensive and overrated I think it\u2019s for families rather than couples But still, the only interesting thing is taking photo with santa, which takes a 3 hours wait and 30euros to get the photo Also, the post office is over crowded and way overpriced I came here already",
          "We were greeted and picked up from airport to the hotel. As we arrived early in the morning and since it is the peak season, our room was not available. Check-in is normally at 4:00pm. If rooms available, the shuttle bus will take your luggage and yourself directly to your",
          "Santa Claus Village is a wonderful place if you bring your kids to visit. We visited in December 2019 and it was wonderful experience. We met Santa at his office, took reindeer riding, husky riding, snowmobiling, Santa's fun day, visiting snowman world, and did lots of shopping",
          "I have recently returned from a four day trip to Lapland, during which time the travel company will \"push\" their excursions at unbelievably high prices which will add a serious amount of money to your vacation cost. All of the excursion options, i.e., Santa himself, huskies,",
          "Wonderful place to visit. It is full of shops. Found that their prices are pretty much the same. I like that they have sleighs so that you can pull the kids around the village. I would recommend sending a postcard from the official postoffice. They sell the card and stamps",
          "Nice place to begin your stay in Rovaniemi, Finland. Santa Claus Office is right on the Arctic Circle Line (66\u00b032\u203235\u2033 north of the Equator). You can meet and talk to Santa Claus in his office, buy souvenirs and postcards in one of many souvenir shops, send them by post in Santa",

          "So loved this village and the magical side of it. Being there on a very snowy day made it so much more special. I got to meet Santa, but the cost of the photo with him and the video of you meeting him was a bit out of my price range. Perhaps they could offer a smaller size photo",
          "There are a lot of little shops, activities and places to eat, but it can be expensive. As a one off it is a great day out for young and old.",
          "It\u2019s a delightful places for children. I really think kids should come here and experience Santa. It\u2019s magical.",
          "Besides seeing Father Christmas there is lots to do and you can easily fill your day with reindeer rides, elves farm, sled slopes, snowmobiles etc appart from the shops and the post office inside the arctic circle. It gets very cold so be prepared the warmest we saw was minus",
          "A magic place, not so many people after 5 pm. Must see Santa, send postcards to friends, have a ride by reindeer, husky, snowmobile.",
          "Free visit to meet and hug Santa Claus! The staffs are all accommodating and very helpful. Looking forward to visit the place again when we have our kids. Santa \ud83c\udf85 knows our wish! Highly recommended place to visit.",
          "We stayed two night towards the end of November this year, family group of 16 ages ranged from 4-79 years. From the free pick up from the airport which took us straight to our cabins and told to check in at reception when we were ready which was fab, to when we left really late",
          "Close to the Arctic circle and the Santa Claus office. It's also just a few minutes ride from Rovaniemi airport. There are 2 rooms to a house, and each room has its own bath, kitchenette, dining place and sauna. Rooms are spacious and nicely decorated in keeping with the lapland",
          "Want to have a Feel of Real Christmas spirit you must visit this village . Perfect setting at the Arctic Circle .",
          "Nice place to spend couple of hours and spend a lot of money, since everything is attractive and expensive, but worth going there for Santa or to let the kids have fun. Dont miss it anyway.",
          "You have to visit this village! A lot of different entertainment, husky, reindeer rides, Santa Claus office, many restaurants, souvenirs shops, Arctic circle etc.",
          "Since I visited the village during December I felt the original Christmas atmosphere. I had fun crossing the Arctic circle. So many nice shops in the village. Several restaurants too but they are busy most of the time. Don\u2019t miss the chocolate shop...The people who work at the",
          "Where to start..... we flew to Rovaniemi from London Gatwick on the first flight out (6am) with our young children (6 & 1), we hired a car and drove the 5 minute drive to Santa Claus Village. It was super easy to find, the roads were very clear and safe despite it being covered",
          "Absolutely waste of money, from the minute we got on the plane there was not enough kids activitie packs so my daughter didnt get one, got to the Santa village and there was a massive queue for the entrance into the place so people just started queue jumping its absolute mayhem",
          "It won\u2019t blow your mind but will live up to the expectations based on what u would have read online. Everything just as stated - nothing more , nothing less. If one is from tropical country like I am then the sheer fun of playing with your kids in the snow just makes it worth it.",
          "It was very pretty, especially in the evening, Santa himself was a nice Santa and authentic looking, however the location, at the side of the gift shop was a bit deflating and unimaginative. With all of the woodland that is there I was expecting some sort of magical fairy light",
          "Was great to go to. Kids would love it. Visited Santa but couldnt take own photos. Cost 32 euros minimum for professional Santa photo.",
          "The village is very nice but it\u2019s all so expensive! There\u2019s nothing to do except taking a pic with santa but the wait in line could up to 3 hrs!",
          "The two main attractions in this city is the Santa Claus village which is not far from the airport and the museum Artikum. The main attraction here is to take a picture with Santa Claus. There is the one hour queque when I was there. the photographer quickly took three shots",
          "This was not included in our tour so we did it on our own. It was freezing out there but worth it. We crossed the Arctic circle,posted a few postcards,met Santa and went on reindeer sleigh ride. It was 0\u00b0but really worth it.",
          "This place is beautiful with so many souvenir shops around, santa clause is here, Post Office, Huskies, Reindeer, Snowmobile and so on... Lovely place with snow falls and complete Christmas feeling",
          "Such a great feeling in this little place. There is lots to do there like husky rides, reindeer rides, kids and adult snow mobile rides. Lots of food places here, some expensive and some cheap. We used one of the sleds which was just left lying around to pull around my",
          "A few different things on offer here....reindeer, huskies, snowmobiles and of course the fellow in the red suit. A must if you have kids of course...And a place where you can prove you crossed the Arctic Circle!",

          "We went in mid November with our 2 children aged 1& 3 , some people didn\u2019t cate about this they would push past and knock in to your children . Everything is about making money and nothing is free ( meeting Santa is but you have to pay for photos as you go out) the reindeer ride",

          "Meeting Santa in person seemed like a childish activity. But I saw myself squealing in delight as I got to stand face to face with the guy himself. The line was short when we got to his office and the elves were very cordial and entertaining. The shops were teeming with lots of",
          "It might just be me, although it was nice getting the Arctic circle crossing certificate, I do feel the place has a lot more potential than what it currently offers. You normally associate Christmas with hot drinks and snacks in the snow which this place lacked unless you went",
          "For two big kids, this place was great. We were lucky to have had so much snow, which just made it a magical spot to wander around. Accept it will be expensive and just get into it.",
          "Great place to stay as a family and friends. Children would love this and everything is around here basically.",
          "I was not sure about going or not and I have been very well surprised: the place is super nice with the typical red wood houses. You can see the Santa Klaus house, post office, renders and mucho more. And you can also step onto the parallel that marks the Arctic Circle!!",
          "This is definitely a tourist location but it was so much cuter than I had anticipated! We primarily went to visit the Arctic Circle and pet the reindeer (both magical experiences), but there are also quite a few other excursion options around the village. Super cute walkway to",

          "Loved Santa Claus Village! November was the best time of year. Still had the snow for a winter wonderland feeling and barely any lines for the shops, reindeer sleigh rides, restaurants and even to meet Santa. Highly recommend visiting Santa Claus Village as there is so much to",
          "You can't help but feel happy here. The temperature may be cold but our hearts were warm. There are so many fun little things to do here and it made me feel like a kid again.",
          "We went to Rovaniemi only to go to Santa's village. our little girls were obviously dreaming of this moment. Turned out the place was not at all what I expected. nice yes, but without much spirit. There was a huge gift shop much to the happiness of the hordes of people there.",
          "Definately a must. The Santa is so authentic there and made an effort to send a video message to my children, lots and lots of things to do including the post office, reindeer farm etc. Would not recommend this in their season as we heard people would wait 4 - 5 hours to meet",
          "The kids enjoyed this afternoon out very much. Luckily with snow and Christmas lights. For us, as adults, it was a strange experience as Santa wasn\u2019t quite what we were expecting. Bit of a strange show. Nevertheless, the entire site was really decorated in the Christmas spirit.",
          "It is a theme park, I visited in the worst moment, beggining of autumm. They are growing with new hotels and activities. Nice visit to Santa Claus and post office.",
          "We visit during non festive season it's seem can't felt the Christmas happiness although surrounding decorate with Christmas celebrations. So advice visit it during winter season. Can meet the Santa Claus in the village by queue. The Santa Claus is friendly and welcoming. But",
          "Visit Santa Clause they say, it is Free..... not Xmas yet but it is my birthday and chose this day to visit him. Enjoyable chat and paid for our photos to be taken. Go over to the post office and sent some Xmas postcards home. Many shopping outlets nearby and some good",
          "We visited because we came by on our way to the north part of Finland. It was a nice stop on the way. Great place to get all kinds of souvenirs. We visited just before the great season of Christmas and were glad for that. Even out of season it was a little bit stressful and",
          "Nice and cost cottages. The pricier cabins have a sauna in them and even thou it comes with an electric stove it will give you a decent steam bath. Each cabin has it\u2019s own parking space right next to the cabin and all the services of the hotel within walking distances. It is a",
          "It does not matter which time of the year you visit, it will always give you the Christmas vibes. Make sure to send some postcards from the official post office of the village. Also, don\u2018t forget to take a picture in the arctic circle sign.",
          "We were really looking forward to visiting Santa's village and meeting himself, but we ended up truly disappointed. The place is super expensive, souvenirs cost more than at the Norwegian Cape North. Xmas spirit? Well, if this means jolly lights and Christmas carols, then yes.",
          "Me and my friend visited Santa Claus Village on the second day of our visit. It was even more magical than we thought it would be. Even though Christmas is still a little away, walking through the village made that special Christmas magic to light up. We've met Santa Claus and",
          "This is the place to go to enjoy the spirit of Christmas at any time of the year. From meeting Santa's reindeer to meeting Santa & his elves and indulging in some Christmas shopping and of course crossing the Arctic Circle and getting a certificate - this place is a must visit",
          "It looked like a scene straight out of a fairy tale..lights glowing, snowy trees, happy, laughing people. Santa Clause has his office here, even a Post Office (they get millions of letters every year from all over the globe) and you can meet Santa himself and get yourselves",
          "This is the place to be in December During autumn month many things are closed or have limited hours. Although its a beautiful place, everyone is smiling and joyful. Reindeer and husky are the main attraction in automn without the rides.",

          "We travelled far to come here, from Adelaide Australia and it was certainly a nice experience however I can imagine it to seem more magical in the snow season. One thing I found very unusual is that I asked at reception if there are any lockers where I could leave my bag. I was",
          "I use to imagine santa clause village will be all jolly plenty of kids and lights. Just like disneyland. But to my dismay it is close to gloomy. Only few people. When you picture with santa it will cost you 30 euros. The santa souvenirs you can also buy here in the Philippines",
          "This place lacks atmosphere. A series of disjointed buildings full of Christmas shops and cafes. There were two Santas to visit but no reindeer or elves to be found. It might look better in the snow/winter which would cover up the barren paths and bitumen but really it needs",
          "During our Scandinavia tour by camper, we also visited this place. The Arctic Circle is in the middle of this village. It's a strange feeling to stand over there. Lots of shops are part of the village, lots of Christmas items, candies, toys and all kinds of clothing are sold",
          "I visited Santa Claus Village (and Santa!!!!) in September and from the moment I stepped out of the car, I got goosebumps and butterflies with excitement! I had to pinch myself and remind myself it wasn't Christmas yet! From the Christmas music to the Elves running around and of",
          "The Santa Claus Village is mainly a tourist trap with nothing more than shop after shop. The merchandise are of the touristy nature like reindeer horns, Moomin mugs and the like. We got to visit with 'Santa' for a bit. He was really in character, which was fun. But it was, at",
          "You live a fairytale here. Visit santa, xmas goodies, snow, reindeer , elves, toys, very beautiful place to visit for kids, family and also not to forget the north-pole.There is post office to post xmas cards, meet and greet with santa, shop for goodies, restaurant, snow",

          "Well worth the visit for children and adults. You can visit Santa, post a letter, feed the reindeer, visit the arctic circle line and purchase souvineers. They have many more activities available in the cold weather, but in August, some are not available. It is free to enter",
          "This is a large village were Santa lives year round. Many stores, restaurants and the Arctic Circle goes through the village. A must stop for young and old.",
          "We come here because we would like to cross the polar circle. We was soooo lucky that we didnt have time before 6pm. Everything here was closed, no people at all, no damn sellers. So we have the best pictures only of us. Also moist of us appreciate that we didnt have the chance",
          "It is true that this place is very commercial, full of souvenir shops etc. and possibly in summer it is really not as great as in winter but there is still much to do (and at least it is not crowded), we could spend there a great 3-4 hours and really enjoyed it, even my fianc\u00e9e",
          "During summer it's a little sad, but it's always the Santa Claus home. Here it's possible met Santa Claus, Unfortunately, it's all a bit too commercial but it's a must with or without childs",

          "If you want to but Christmas souvenirs, this is the place to go since there are a lot of souvenir shop. As one can expect, the price is quite high. Obviously, there is Santa and the post office. Entrance is free, but one has to pay for a photo with Santa and to visit",
          "We visited Santa Claus Village as part of TUI itinerary and to be honest we were pretty bored, a few good photo opportunities but mainly a bunch of overpriced shops. There are much better ways to spend your time in Rovaniemi.",
          "Honestly we did not expect \"the home of Santa Claus\" to be such a big thing! It was great fun to see so many good ideas, suvenier shops, restaurants and Caf\u00e9s all around that topic - and the actual arctic circle line drawn and ready to jump over - man we had so much fun and good",
          "Just me and my husband went as the kids are adults now and Finland was our holiday destination. So why not take a trip to Lapland? Plus our main objective was to say we'd crossed the arctic circle. The village is free to enter and walk around but everything you buy costs a",

          "After flying in to Rovaniemi, we made a stop here before continuing on to Tankavaara. Although a typical tourist trap, it was still a fun place. The Arctic Circle passes right through and is marked by a wide white line on the pavement with the latitude given (66o 32\u2019 35\u201d).",
          "It is a rather funny place to stay in the summer. Everything is Christmas and the only thing we were missing was snow. The cabin was good and there was what you needed. Plus TV, wifi and a little kitchen. You can park the car outside the cabin. They are arranging a lot of",

          "Why does anyone go with kids to Rovaniemi in Finland in December, unless it's to take them to see Santa Clause...? While the village experience is to be expected - expensive, and mostly tacky...it falls short of creating a Disney-syle wonderland - it was the visit to Santa in",
          "It was quite an experience when - arriving to the place at the end of June - you are greeted by a red-dressed Sainta Clauses Band playing \"Jingle Bells\"! Because of the crowds of visitors and widespread commercialization (souvenirs, of course) a visit to this place is not an",
          "This has no charge to go in but once it everything is so expensive. Santa Claus was very knowlegable and could speak perfect English and knew where Melbourne Australia was. However the only way to get a phopto is to buy a postcard and take a phopto ofthat as 35 euros is too",
          "It was a little odd visiting here in mid-June, but the staff made it amazing. Really helpful. Was still pretty busy as we got behind a couple of tour groups. Caf\u00e9 was brilliant, loved the reindeer burgers. We done the full Santa meet n greet (free) and also went in for a photo",
          "This is out of town and has a Santa Express service but I went to the bus stop and only saw a local bus. Luckily I went via Cosmos . It also has an Arctic information centre and is further on than Santa Park",
          "The park is very touristic. There are many souvenir shops and visiting santa was nothing special. The reindeer in the park do not look very healthy. My highlight was to write postcards which they will send on christmas.",
          "We visited here as part of a Leger Holiday tour just before midsummers day. Perhaps it was the 20C temperature and the lack of any activities except shopping, but I found the place rather depressing. We paid 5 Euro each to see the reindeer--4 apathetic animals who were barely",

          "We stayed next door at Santa Claus Holiday Village which is a short walk to the village. A few cafes which seem reasonable but cannot comment on food there as we only eat at our hotel. Lots of Christmas and souvenir shops. You can take a short reindeer sleigh ride at the back of",

          "We visited late afternoon and found the village to be quiet and small. We were happy to find the famous knife shop that sells the reindeer skin for the cheapest we could find. They even engrave your knife for you! Great place",
          "As the name suggests, this is a fun-filled place for kids and adults. It's approx 40 mins ride from Rovaniemi. Bus No 8 goes every 40 mins from Rovaniemi. Can check the timetable online. It's a full day trip and can be done on our own as it's cheaper rather than going through",
          "Souvenir shops, post office, exposition and...the house of Santa Claus. Great to take some nice photo's right on the Polar-circle. We had an audience with Santa, it was fun, he spoke even our language (Dutch) LOL Have sent some postcards who will arrive home at Christmas time, a",

          "Not much to do here. Mainly tourist shops and cafes / restaurant. Obviously Santa is there to go and see but we didn\u2019t. Also sleigh rides, raindeers and huskies to see. If I had gone as a child I think it would have ruined my image of where Santa lived.",
          "Most of the things in the village are souvenir shops, even the the \"post office\" is another souvenir shop. If you don't like shopping, that's a disappointment, however if you want to meet Santa that's the place to go. The visit is \"free\", however as photos are not allowed,",
          "The only reason I went to this place was to send postcards from the post office. And that was about all I could handle. If strip malls are your thing, this is the place for you because it's one big souvenir shop off the highway. They've got some reindeer, they've got Santa, and",

          "Kids would definitely find this place magical. Coming here means you can finally tell your friends that you met Santa Claus in the North Pole - that is if you paid to see him. Was there during the Christmas seasons. It was very crowded with many children running around and",
          "We had a fantastic day at the village. It is all about shopping, but every thing is so nicely decorated, inside and outside, that time flies really fast. You can easily spend a whole day there.",
          "The children were so happy spending time here, riding the snow mobile, reindeer, play with snow and took picture with Santa",
          "As far as I\u2019m concerned Santa is real and I met him! I\u2019d always dreamt about meeting Santa and my trip here was a dream come true. I can\u2019t recommend this enough, Young or old, the experience is breathtaking. Do expect long queues though but if you are like me it wouldn\u2019t matter.",
          "This was such a fun place to visit! Lots of cute shops and the lights in the trees made it just seem like a magical place. There are lots of other activities around the village so you can get a taste of all the winter activities without having to leave for a bigger safari",
          "Glad we visited but would have been really upset if we had paid for a tour to/from. We got the local bus from Rovaniemi town centre (7 Euro). Entry to the park and the mostly souvenir shops is free. This place is super crowded in the winter months so expect to line up to see",
          "Even with a broken arm I was able to enjoy this incredible place. You can visit the post office where elves help you make sure your letters get mailed to Santa. Waiting in line to see Santa is so worth it as he is the most amazing Santa and he greets everyone in their own",
          "The Santa Claus village is a nice place to visit. It is a little bit more expensive than other places but it is ok. I just think that it would be improved. The shops and the restaurants are not that ready to receive tourists. Everything looks a bit non professional. We were",
          "It was crowded but definitely a happy place for family to visit. It was a fun winter experience and so happy to meet Santa. Like a kid\u2019s dream comes true !",
          "Its quite expensive but worth it for the kids reaction. We did the huskies and reindeer ride, very fun and unforgettable. We also went to snowman world (I think thats the name) the 2 slides there with the rings are also very good. Would recommend",
          "Fun place for the kids but you need to pay for each attraction. We particularly liked the snowman world experience and the reindeer ride.",
          "A must-visit in Rovaniemi! The place is so beautiful, there is a real winter wonderland feeling and although very touristy, it does not seem fake. There are lots of different activities which can be done, including meeting Santa Claus himself, posting items from his post office,",
          "We loved Santas village at Xmas time. Very busy but worth seeing all the lights, shops, restaurants, and communal sleighs for the kids to use for free. Last bus leaves at 7pm in Winter tho so you will need to Taxi home if u go for dinner.",
          "We spent a couple of hours here and a place where children would delight. There are sleigh and husky rides, a playground and plenty of shops. The line to see Santa was very long but he was the most charming Santa we have ever met. Cameras are forbidden and elves take photos and",
          "During our Lapland Tour the first place we have visited was Santa Claus Town. It was just a village that built up for commersial purposes as I expected. Every single thing related with Santa Clause are being promoted and sold there.",
          "lots of things to see, all for a cost. We did the reindeer ride but passed on the santa visits as out of our age range ! The Arctic Circle crossing is the highlight for us, indoor and outdoor",
          "What a great place to visit. We took our 4 kids ages 10, 14, 21 & 25. We did have to wait over an hour to see Santa, you can\u2019t tell how long the line is and that is frustrating but the Santa meeting was very nice. We did all kinds of activities. Dog sledding, reindeer sledding,",
          "Visited again after 10yrs this time with kids - huge upgrade! It doesn\u2019t get more Christmasy than this. One can say that its too commercial with the big number of shops but still. Kids loved it! We were very lucky being the same day when Santa begins the trip which made it even",
          "Tack, tack, tack, tack tack, tack......!!! :-( I cannot believe we flew all the way to Lapland just to go to this overly-commericalised pile of nonsense. It is just a collection of souvenir shops, cafes and restaurants. Stereotypical tourist trap. Nothing authentic and Lappish",
          "Great theme park if you are excited about snow, Christmas, animals, and fun. Reindeer rides, husky park, snowman works, Santa Claus post office, article circle, animal petting farm, etc. We went twice and spent about 6 hours. Very good place for children (we brought our ten year",
          "We had a wonderful visit to Santa Claus village on three occasions during our holiday. There\u2019s lots to see and do here. We particularly enjoyed the reindeer ride. However the queue was absolutely manic - we had purchased tickets from the information desk and didn\u2019t realise that",
          "We went there on the first day of the year and had a lot of fun. Just being in this amazing place and it\u2019s magical atmosphere give you a feeling of a fairytale. We just had a late lunch, strolled though the snowy village and went to a couple shops. We missed Santa as he seems",
          "More than a simple village with a tons of activities offered there around. easy for family, you can tailoryour experience to what you like/can most",
          "My son loved this trip but i feel it was more for the snow than anything else. I was disappointed when visiting santa at santa village. He only spoke about 7 words to my son. Normally he would be raving seeing santa but didnt really say anything. But the santa park santa is far",
          "After an amazing couple of days in Rovaniemi, our visit to Santa Claus\u2019 village was highly anticipated. The complex is well light up and decorated and you can \u2018officially\u2019 cross the arctic circle here. There are numerous gift shops and whilst you may think they are expensive,",
          "A fantastic place. We felt the spirit of Lapland. I highly recommend to visit this unique place. We were so excited. The atmosphere was great.",
          "Visiting the Santa Claus Village is just like a dream comes true. A must visit esp with kids. Be prepare that it is a bit touristy",
          "This is a great place for young family with kids Lots to see and do Restaurants are not the best so recommend bringing your own food or having a big breakfast before you go Once your in the village, most attractions have an entry fee",
          "Really enjoyable visit. The post office was great (much better than Santa parks post office). Well worth a visit",
          "We had a great time there! visited with 10 yo child. Definitely would recommend an ice restaurant and snowman world!",
          "What a wonderful place. You have to come here with child like eyes and leave your cynicism at the door but if you are prepared to do this and take in all the views and the sights and sounds then this place is wonderful. We were lucky to come just a few days before Xmas which",
          "A great place to stay for families with children. Here you can meet Santa, have the reindeer ride, take good photos. The atmosphere is good when visiting in December.",
          "This is really a fantasy village where the old and young fall inside this fantastic dream land. It is such a magical dream land and especially during the Christmas season which you virtually falls inside this winter wonderland. Is a must go place if you visit Rovaniemi but must",
          "We had a fantastic day at Santa Claus Village. Individual venders coming together to make a marvellous day out for visitors. Offering visits with Santa (two locations), sleigh rides, snowmobiles, dog sleds etc. The day we spent here was magical!",
          "We came with our 21 and 18 year old to have a wander on a free day between two activity days and found enough to keep us all interested for at least 3 hours! We got the bus from just past the McDonald\u2019s- return journey for 4 adults 28\u20ac. Check what the bus looks like and remember",
          "I was reading a few reviews and decided I must post for those who really want to know what it\u2019s like. I come from Africa where we don\u2019t experience the snow and the cold and maybe it\u2019s also about how we have raised our kids- still to believe in the magic. Also we went",
          "There's no need anyone to bring you around. Is a very small place with plenty of snow. The first thing to do is queue to take pics with Santa! Then, roam around to take 1000 photos. However, the people in the gift stalls are simply hostile and rude. Don't take any pics inside",
          "Went on the 26th of December. Surprisingly the Christmas decorations are really substandard for Santa\u2019s home. The rooms charge you for towel changes - and you have to bring the used towels to the reception, 13 euros! Busy place but designed to manage the flow of people so",
          "It was a truly an white winter experience for someone from the equatorial part of the world. Everything is white and bitingly cold. Went for a husky sleigh ride. A word of advice: after getting the tickets from the various ticketing sites within the village, go straight to the",
          "Great place to visit. Lots to see and you can cross over into the artic circle and get a certificate to prove it.",
          "Santa Claus Village is very pretty- they have done a great job with the lights. Going to get your photo with Santa has big queues as you would expect- it took us about an hour to meet the man himself but he was great, gave us 'our moment' with him and we got our photo. They jave",
          "We stayed in the neighbouring hotel \u2018Santa Claus Holiday Village\u2019. We spent most days wandering around the village. My kids loved strolling through on the sleds. The only activity we did was an overpriced reindeer ride. My husband didn\u2019t even do that because he thought it was",
          "Everything is here, including santa if you dont want to wait in the queue at santa park.....it was -25 when we walked round so its good that everything is inside",
          "We have had this trip planned for a year, the first trip cancelled due to no snow, im so glad we went when there was snow as it was bad enough with snow !! We got to Santa\u2019s village at 13.30 we had to get back on the coach at 18.00 , we had to que for 1.5 hours to see Santa ,",
          "Take a cab from town and I suggest you get there early to avoid the crowds and cues. We spent about 4 hours which was sufficient. The bus tours are longer, but four hours was perfect for us. Many places to eat, but don\u2019t expect gourmet good! Young kids will love it. Make sure",
          "Not a lot to say other than a MUST visit. Believe in Santa. We were lucky as he hadn't left to deliver all those presents. To get there simply catch the Santa Express bus in Rovaniemi. 6.60 euros return",
          "Amazing place... We absolutely loved it... Thanks finland for a fantastic experience... Cant wait to see you again X",
          "Beautiful village and very magical. Shops and eateries are expensive, however to be expected. We really enjoyed this family trip and the kids were catered for very well.",
          "Santa Village is something worth seeing even if you don\u2019t have young children. Had a beautiful meal in the ice restaurant where the service was fantastic and the food was certainly good. The ice sculptures were to behold as it must\u2019ve taken many hours if not days to create.",
          "We visited here the first day and drove and parked without any issues. We visited Santa first and only had to wait about 10minutes. Santa looked great and interacted nicely with the children. We were really impressed with the quality of the photos and video that you could",
          "Although we weren\u2019t with children, we still had a fun meeting with Santa and there was plenty to do around the town. Also cool to have sent some Christmas cards from Lapland.",
          "Nice visit to real Santa Claus Village! A lot of amenities! It\u2019s the original one so you can\u2019t be betrayed! Great atmosphere!",
          "We visited the Village as part of a 3 day Lapland visit with Magic Vacations. It was beautiful and really added to the tour. But the prices were astoundingly high. To be fair, it was the first part of the trip that we had to pay for anything and it's obviously all voluntary at",
          "A number of tour operators had cancelled flights / re-scheduled due to a lack of snow in Early December. Thomas Cook however refused to change the date, however took some comfort in the fact Thomas cook promised to bring in snow so activities could carry on and nothing would be",
          "Good place to purchase some Lapland reminders. Quite a lot of tat but some nice smaller shops. Also enjoy the Artic circle.",
          "We visited the village as part of our Sleighbell Sleepover. It was a wonderful experience. We loved our visit to the Husky Farm and went into the various souvenir shops, eateries and experiences. It was truly memorable to have the line at which the Arctic Circle began and our",
          "so much to do and see for prople of all ages children will have as much fun as the adults here lots of shops",
          "From what I had seen on line I expected much more things for kids to do. Yes there was reindeer rides, mini snow mobiles, the post office and santa's office; but everywhere you went inside the village the main attraction was a souvenir shop or cafe. They dominated every single",
          "You must go at Christmas time. Go about 2pm, when the lights are on and the magic happens. You will be captivated.",
          "A must visit for children to keep the dream alive of seeing the big man in person. Loads of snow with temperatures of -12/-14 at times, great fun for the kids either having a snowball fight on the Arctic Circle or just being pulled along on a sleigh on the snow. The wait to meet",
          "This village has many shops and restaurants with a Santa Claus theme. A great place for souvenirs and to walk around absorbing the atmosphere. We were lucky that it had snowed during the week before we arrived as that added to the atmosphere. We visited Santa whilst we were",
          "So much to see and do. I was amazed at how many little businesses are in the village. Great concept allowing so much variety. We arrived for lunch and left after 5pm and saw the village lit up. Absolutely wonderful place",
          "Its a wierd place cuz there is not a lot to do, but toi can Just Feel the magic with all the big whites trees and the elf everywhere. Maybe its easier with \u00e0 christmas freak like me;) Stayed there for 4 hours, but could've stayed more. They' re reindeer rides, huskies farm and",
          "What a fabulous magical place takes you right back to childhood. Seeing is believing you will not want to leave",
          "Two travelers in our mid 20's and truly enjoyed the trip. Not as Santa/Christmas orientated as I had imagined but really festive and thankfully it had just snowed before our arrival which was really nice! Very close to the airport with transfers there and to the city every hour",
          "A must if in Lapland! It is a once in a lifetime experience, a total deja vu of emotions from Christmas mornings as a child. Best time to visit is probably early December as it wont be as packed with other tourists. I had the time of my life there, and kept going back to visit",
          "Truly a magical place to visit, not just for the young ones but even the young at heart. Take the reindeer ride and cross the Arctic line. Pay a little bit extra for that certificate as proof of crossing the Arctic line.",
          "Although very commercialised there really is something for everyone here. Including shops, restaurants, husky experience, sleigh rides, chances to meet father Christmas and the opportunity to cross the Arctic circle. Also the official post office of Father Christmas. Plenty of",
          "The Arctic Circle full of colour and snow!! Not as tacky as I was expecting and great shops and don't forget to post a letter from here too.",
          "Perhaps in the depths of win Brett amid with children in tow this place would be great entertainment. But on a very wet September day, it was forlorn, almost shabby looking. On a bright note we did manage to arrange letters from santa for the young friends wet have and the",
          "What to say when you live a day in magic? Santa's is the real one, the place is the real place, you step across the arctic circle and everything becomes a fairy tale. You write your desire...you send your wishes...and you can find him..the real only one Santa Claus. Then you",
          "Absolutely amazing place! We booked a holiday through TUI and we have 3 small children. There is no other word I can use to describe this place other than MAGICAL. Lots of fabulous activities, children can ride reindeer, drive mini snow mobiles, go tubing/sledging as well as",
          "Just went to visit Santa on the 2 day, one night trip from Belfast to Lapland and we are disappointed as are other people in our group. Santa was fake and impersonal and the kids could tell straight away he wasn\u2019t the \u2018real\u2019 Santa. Huskies ride was short but fun, reindeer ride",
          "We absolutely loved our time here. We tried to get a hotel room here but they were completely booked up. We stay in a Hotel in Rovaniemi. It was a short 10 minute drive from our Hotel to the Village. There are truly SO many activities and shop and restaurants there. One",
          "It is more, a collection of souvenir shops, than Santa's home. There was some activity around which are interesting to kids, like taking a reindeer or husky circle, or driving a snowmobile. To visiting there Santa, had to wait too long, because it is free. It does not worth it,",
          "So so annoyed, Tui took us here and gave us an hour and twenty minutes to go round this park. It was one of the best attractions we had been at since we came to Lapland. Our whole party was loving the atmosphere , then it was time to return to our coach and go to the airport.",
          "This place is amazing There are many things to do here If your into photography then this is the place for you Fininish forest",
          "This place is great for kids. It is a bit like a Christmas Disneyland. Nice to visit in the lead up to Christmas, but probably only for 2 to 3 hours unless you have kids.",
          "Although this is mainly aimed at children, there is plenty to do for adults too - reindeer/husky rides, snowmobiling...",
          "We did a day trip to Lapland with Thomas cook. We visited here for an hour and a half at the end of the day after we had done activities elsewhere. It was great to cross the arctic circle, we paid 4 euro 50 each for a certificate to say we had done so at the tourist info place",
          "Too commercialised.. Over rated and expensive. Great for kids for a few hours.. Nothing much for adults to do except..",
          "I am really surprised about the high reviews for this place. As someone who been to amazing Christmas markets around Europe with lots of entertainment, this was a pure disappointment. They could have put in so much more effort but instead they decided to use every possible way",
          "Beautiful place...that's about it. Reindeer experience - \u20ac18 to be dragged around 5mins? You can find a 1hr authentic reindeer farm about 10mins away which includes feeding, sleigh ride and Q&A for \u20ac10 more. Snowman World - \u20ac20 for access to an igloo, that has a bar where you",
          "In our case, we are adults without children, so it is a beautiful place to spend few hours meeting Santa, but 40\u20ac the photo?? Sooo expensive I think. Ride reindeer crossing the artic circle or send postcard wherever you want. Only just a tip, in front of the village there is a",
          "It is cosy but thats it! We came at 17 a'clock. Went with the reindeers for 400 meters and payed 64\u20ac f\u00f6r 2 adults and 2 small kids. Expensive! And not so nice view either. Nothing to see exept the reindeers butt. Then it is only souveniers stores and 3 restaurants. And they are",
          "As a big kid, I'm easily pleased for this kind of thing, but it really lived up to my biggest expectations. I recommend the santa salmon place to eat as delicious. All the staff are merry and really helpful. A very satisfied customer. Thanks",
          "Miserable check in a Newcastle. Try hard flight attendants no inflight entertainment - was asked by the stewards for an elf name but no introduction or reasons. Arrival at Rovaniemi was good and elves were attentive. Transfer to kit store was ok. There was no snow or snow",
          "We came to the village with an open mind, half-expecting it to be heavily-commercialised and pricey. I was not feeling festive at all before our trip yet that was soon to change! We decided to stay in the village as figured this is the destination for tour operators anyway.",
          "Make sure you leave plenty of time for this attraction especially if you want a photo with Santa or to post a letter at his post office. Some of the people in our group waited 20+ minutes just to get their picture done. It costs nothing to have the photo done but they make up",
          "What a disappointment. Without snow the whole of Rovaniemi is such a disappointment. I write this as someone who has always had a great love of Christmas and grew up believing Lapland was the ultimate Christmas destination. Of course to very young children they will hopefully",
          "We had an excellent day at the village. Christmas carols played as we walked around. The Christmas trees shine brightly and the magic was set for meeting Father Christmas It was a childhood dream for me to sit in Father Christmas lap and I did. Father Christmas was a striking",
          "Just came back I was so excited go to santas village. There were loads of shops and a few restaurants. Took kids to see Santa, cost me \u20ac50 for pic and video. Then i realised there was another santa, so had to avoid that one. Post office is an actual post office not an elf",
          "Not really much to see here, pretty sure kids would love it though and the santa pic you can get is good - so 3 stars",
          "Santa's Village is the best Christmas present for a child. The actor who plays this Santa Claus is very attentive to all children. Photos and videos are expensive - more than 30 euros. You can give presents (by choosing and paying at the entrance) There is still little snow in",
          "We only spent 1.5 hours because there's not much to do in the village itself. Everything is way too commercial...many shops and restaurants. The only nice place was Santa Office, but the official photo is too expensive-32\u20ac. I recommend more Santa Park: ticket is valid for 2",
          "A special trip to see santa before my grandsons stopped believing. Unfortunately this worked the opposite way as there are lots of photos of santa on the wall while you queue, showing lots of different santas .. not good. The santa we saw asked the kids their name then it was",
          "This Village is wonderful for adults and children alike. I had a wonderful time. The elves are so friendly and Santa spoke to me for quite a while making a childhood dream a reality. It\u2019s everything I hoped it would be!",
          "We stayed in the Cottages for our family of four. We brought the train up from Helsinki, and took a short cab ride over to the Village. There were lots of things to do in the Village and in the surrounding area. There was a restaurant that was geared more towards kids that we",
          "There was no snow in Rovaniemi in November end this year but the village is still the most exciting place on the Arctic Circle. A must visit even if you have no kids as it brings out the child in everyone. Make sure you post a postcard from Santa\u2019s post office. Husky park is",
          "Got chargeD \u00a3200 for two people when the park is FREE. Absolutely disgusted with tripadvisor fir advertising it that amount of money. Not much to do there mainly shops after shops after shops. Not good at all really.",
          "Great day, you spend a lot of money so save up. It is truly magical. The elves are fantastic. Even with no snow",
          "Magical, well worth the trip, just wish we had some snow! I loved the little chalet style houses you stay in, it has everything you need. Good shower, really comfortable beds...",
          "We booked a reindeer and husky ride tour and the reception staff told us that there would be rides even though it was not snowing as the operators would \"make snow\" for the rides to happen. However on the day of the tour, we were surprised when the tour guide told us that there",
          "We visited the village for the opening night of Xmas season. Not much to do here beyond saying you have crossed the Arctic Circle and of course you can do husky riding, reindeer sledding (not enough snow when we went). There is alot of souvenir shops and some eating places.",
          "Don\u2019t be fooled into thinking this place is as magical as it portrays on the websites, or even how the tour operators describe the place. First of all the village is free to enter and it\u2019s also free to see santa, the number 8 bus takes you to the village for 3.30 Euros, about",
          "Wow! This place is so magical and a great place to come with the kids. We wrote postcards to send home and a letter to Father Christmas. We visited Father Christmas, who was brilliant and authentic. He spent ages talking to us and making our experience extra special.",
          "Lots of gift shops all selling similar products. No Christmas music which was a real shame- would have made it much better (especially since it was a grey rainy day!) Santa was great but the photo was a total rip off... especially when we went to the Christmas house and",

          "This is a bigger complex than we had expected. Lots of separate buildings offer shops, cafes, restaurants, and all the Christmas trimmings you can handle! We were lucky to be there as a light dusting of snow turned the scenery into a Winter Wondeland without freezing cold, or",
          "We booked the sleigh ride with Santa, 1 day excursion via Thomas Cook. We visited the first weekend in December 2017, with two adults and two children (6 & 4). We flew from Manchester; the flight was fairly early in the morning, so coming from Chester, we did have to leave the",
          "We went to visit but when we arrived in the afternoon, the only thing open was the gift shop. Not even a cafe for a hot drink? The pub was also closed and the place mainly looked like a building site as they were getting ready for the winter season. I'm sure over Christmas it",
          "Perfect fun for kids and adults alike. Free entry, even to see santa. You pay a hefty price for photos thou, but recommended. Plenty of shops to find local and Finnish design and souvenirs.",
          "A must visit experience, the whole town was great, we had dinner inside the ice restaurant the food was great, we went to visit santa Claus and just walking inside gives you the best christmassy feeling ever!! A must visit! will even do it again",
          "Came to fulfill dreams. Revisited memory lane and meet Mr Santa and was pampered. Mr Santa came to live and we were young again.",
          "Fantastic village full of shops and cafes. Visit Santa, feed the reindeers and visit the huskies. Shame Santa park is only open for a short time each year but the village is special for in its own right",

Village is free to walk around however pay to feed reindeer \u20ac5 pp, ride \u20ac30, husky park \u20ac10, ride extra. Many boutique specialty craft shops and cafes. The best part was Santa Claus House.",

          "There are so many restaurants, shops, and a place to feed the reindeer here at Santa Claus Village! It's a wonderful place for kids and families and an even better spot for souvenirs.",
          "We visited a few times during our one week stay in the area between 29th Sept and 6th Oct. Luckily for us the very first snowfall of the season coincided with our final visit so it made it even more fun. There are a lot of shops selling all manner of Christmas and non",

          "It was mostly just tourist shops, but I was also there out of season. The food options may bring it up a notch, when they are all functioning. The best experience I had there was the fun experience of petting the reindeer and just the Christmas festivities that permeated everything at all times.",

The post office was very good, plenty of post cards to choose from. Santa 9/10, value for money 3/10 (santa himself is free but all the extras are very over priced). A once in a lifetime trip only needed once.",

          "Interesting place and nice tourist attraction",
          "It's of course very beautiful and special for winter holidays. But extreamly overpriced and overcrouded in times which of corse sky rockets prices even further. Would visit it just once in a life time, planning the trip upfront as early as possible.",

          "It's great to take the kids but it's really becoming a very touristy spot since our last visit 7 years ago. I mean it's not a bad experience by any measure, but there have been some shortcuts taken to reduce waiting time which to me kinda \u2026",
          "Only Santa was worth it. All other activities requires extra money... I rather they charge a entrance fee. Very commercial.",

          "Its Magical and lots of fun for all !",
          "A great attraction for the kids. It is magical but try to beat xmas day or 25th as it is as expected very busy. A day or two before xmas is much better and easier to navigate. You can visit the post office to see all the letters sent to \u2026",

          "Really expensive village. Entrance is free (obviously), but you have to pay for every activity there, like riding with huskies or reindeers. Seeing Santa is free, but be careful: sometimes you have to spend a lot of time in the line. \u2026",

          "Great fun for kids 1 to 100.",
          "My opinions about Santa Claus Village Perhaps would be different from some others. We were there in the Autumn Season with Cosmos Tour. It was still very exciting experience. Because from there we entered Artic Circle! A historical moment \u2026",
          "The queue for taking photos with santa what's a little long but wasn't too long of a wait. Lots of souvenir shops around and price was fair!",

          "Very beautifull place. Recommend!",

          "Exceeded expectations. Adult fun also!",
          "Excellent for seeing the lighting. Husky ride was good. Reindeer ride was not so great. Snow mobiling at night was excellent and value for money",
          "Good place for children but the price is not good for parents.",
          "I hope it to be much better. The christmas shops are well but no as nicer as in Norway. Otherwise, the visit with Santa and the experience was good.",

          "The husky and Reindeer park were a must visit places. We went during summer so Snow related areas were shut. The one and only place where you can meet Mr. Santa and get a picture clicked with him. And yes the Arctic Circle passes right through it.",
          "Super for the winter potentially though the charm is missing when it operates as an expensive souvenir mini-mall. \n\nKudos to the developers, managers, and Rovaniemi city council to drum up ideas to support the local economy!\n\nReally happy \u2026",
          "Maybe in winter it looks better, but to me it is way too commercial. Like nearly only shops with silly gifts.",

          "Awesome time. Kids loved it",
          "A tourist trap designed apparently for Asian tourists mostly.\n\nBarely a Xmas Carol in the background and barely any holiday spirit to be felt. Dull straight faces, extremely kitschy offerings.\n\nMore like the Grinch's house...",
          "A magical experience for kids off all ages. Walk through the forest and have fun sliding down ice  slides, have a snowball fight and get to meet the big man himself. The most authentic experience of you want to meet the real Santa and \u2026",

          "Kids will love the playground and activities. Adults will get bored after half an hour",
          "A wide range of activities that are rather expensive, but of good quality. A good place for tourists. Santa himself was exceptionally good and he can be fully recommended.",

          "Magic experience..well worth the visit",
          "It was so cold, snowy, the works, but great to get to the Arctic Circle, and good to meet the big man to boot. Basically a place where Santa and Lapland kitsch memorabilia is sold with husky and Reindeer rides too. is it cheesy - yes. Did we have fun - certainly. Did our kid enjoy it - absolutely",

          "Pathatic handwriting on the certificate..  Else place is good",

          "This is purely merchandising area. Good for kids, but disappointing for parents.",
          "I love Christmas! I mean who doesn't? I was super excited to visit Santa Claus October of last year. It's funny that he stayed in character when I asked him what he does when Christmas is too far away. He said he goes to the beach and has even been to my home country. Hahaha! I'll go back to Rovaniemi when I have kids in the future.",

          "Free to enter the grounds. Mostly just shops with souvenirs. The Polar circle is clearly marked.",
          "Wonderful place. It's made for tourists it but as a Finn I really enjoyed visiting there. If you go there u have to meet Santa. He's in the \"main building\" at the central of the village. It's pretty expensive there in the Santa village but that's understandable.",
          "Nice place to be at during Christmas",
          "Amazing chance for gifts and photos",
          "Expensive tourist attraction. Santa hides between walls \ud83d\ude14",
          "It is a fairy tale place which brings you to your childhood and closer to magic. The only negative thing is that everything is too expensive, but the experience is amazing!",
          "Moneymaking tourist trap but with some nice souveniers like the 0 euro bill. You can also send postcards that arrive on christmas. Very empty and grim this time of the year. Free bathrooms are readily available. I recommend going for the santa forest walk to see some nature.",
          "Honestly one of the best holidays we have taken the children on! This holiday is not just a place for children, no matter what age you are this place is magical. We have been to Santa Claus Village a few times now. Each time in December so \u2026",

Since I had visited during the winters there are loads of winter sports that one can enjoy and you can book all of it from the same facility information desk. Visit the artic circle and many attractions around the place.",

          "If you are visiting Rovaniemi you have to at least visit the original Santa once and see what's all the fuss about. Nice shopping area with the music box store and knife shop being my highlights.",

          "We arrived 11:45 am on christmas eve to the line to see Santa Claus. They gave us a time to come back to see Santa, because at that moment was too busy they said. Our time was 16:30. So we waited 4,5 hours in the village to see Santa with \u2026",
          "Nothing except for Post office and Dear Santa is special about this place",
          "I liked the place, you can see where the arctic circle is, see reindeer... lots of souvenir store, but i expected that. You know, if you came to Rovaniemi, you need to visit this place.",
          "This is the home of Santa. Yes, he is really there to meet with. It was great in summer and it would be just awesome in winter",
          "More giftshops than things to do and see",
          "Nice place. Very few activities like husky ride snowmobiling and rendeer sledding. Santa Post office to send postcards to home. Tourist information people were less friendly and accommodating unlike others. Shop keepers were very friendly \u2026",

          "You don't get to meet Santa everyday... Isn't it?",
          "Touristic? Yes! But still a lovely experience.  Sending post cards. Grilling sausages over a fire. Meet Santa. Meet many friendly Elves.  Just a great day.",
          "Must visit for at least one in life time!",
          "Its place totally commercial and like resort nothing more.",
          "Great place for a  family activities with young kids. Limited restaurant choices available but the popular grilled salmon could take a wait standing in the cold. Taking a picture with Santa could cost a meal for two but all good fun with Santa who enjoys  amusing tourists with his acquired lingusitic gift.",
          "Nice, but very touristic attraction. We were there between Christmas and New Year.",
          "Right place to meet Santa in Finland. Lot of gift shops are there in the village. At the post office you can send a post card to anywhere in the world only for 1.6 euros. Post cards are available from 1 euros. If you are a dog lover avoid \u2026",
          "We went in the very low season autumn. It was deeeeead! Haha kinda creepy!! It's a little drab and needs some $$ splashed to spruce it up",
          "Obviously a bit commercial and cheesy but it is very well done. Some decent shops selling quality items as well as Christmas tat. Seeing Santa is free (but you pay for photos) but it is very well done.",
          "Magic atmosphere.",
          "Too busy at Christmas but lovely all the same. Calmed down on boxing Day and we could explore more freely. Seeing off Santa earlier on the 23rd was great too.",

          "Great place to visit the attractions were good.",
          "Tourist trap. Very boring experience. Even with kids.\n\nNothing to do here except feeding 3 deers a branch or taking a 40 euros picture with Santa in a faker than Disney atmosphere. Nobody was impressed. \n\nNor adults nor children. Would maybe be 2 stars in Xmas season just for the snow and lights.",
          "Magical, we didn't have enough time there to give a thorough review however the retail outlets we visited had something for everyone's price range. Would love to go back.",
          "Truly a wonderful and spectacular experience. If you are in Rovaniemi, the Santa Claus village is one of many things to consider looking at during your stop here. \n\nYou can not only get to meet Santa Claus himself, but you can also explore \u2026",

          "Friendly staff!",
          "Childhood dream comes true! Pretty and colorful, but a bit expensive",
          "Although entrance is free, it is more a shopping village with quite high prices (except the outlet stores).\nIf you are around it is still worth a visit to cross the polar circle, the playground and walking through the shops.",
          "Beautiful place",
          "Amazing place, the best in Finland!",
          "Amazing fairyland, just so magical and so much to do for free - the lights, giant snowman, sitting by a fire in the snow, seeing reindeer close up, hearing huskies, straddling the Arctic Circle line, visiting Santa Claus Main Post Office and of course seeing Santa Claus in his office and more.  Very highly recommended!",
          "Visit santas base of operations",
          "It was cool and silent place, must visit in winter, have rides. More shops and restaurants for shopping and refreshments",
          "It is definitely a nice place, cabins, snows and pine trees everywhere, with a lot of Christmas lights decorations around it, you'll feel you're in Christmas town. This place is packed with souvenir shops and people actually line up to get \u2026",
          "It is always nice to be here!",
          "It is a pretty awesome place to go to during Christmas. 2-3 days can be spent. It is a fun place to be at even if you aren't a kid. The reindeer ride and huskies ride and huskies farm are a must watch thing to do.",

          "Romantic and beautiful place.",
          "Its corona time :D",
          "One of the main reasons why you come to Rovaniemi.  One of the best things to do is send an actual mail via the post office. The place is really nice to take photos but be warned the photos you take with Santa cost an arm & a leg. You can't use your own camera to take a photo with Santa.",
          "Very touristy, as if somebody invented commercial christmas and built a town around it. Prices are not reasonable.",
          "Now I am a child. Amazing place.",
          "Magical Place",
          "This place look amazing. Very touristic but it should be expected. Feels great on a white Christmas. The husky ride is definitely amazing and dreamy!!",

          "We visited Santa - and he totally lived up expectations and even our hopes!!!  Not just a mug in a suit and beard; we felt like we were with the real Santa!",
          "Beautiful place. They might trick you into visiting the Santa for free but, when you go in they take a picture of you and you have to pay for that! It feels great to cross the polar circle by one step.",
          "It's a place for quick stay(1h max) and go to next place.",
          "It is a really beautiful place, but kind of a tourist trap in my opinion. Everywhere the prices are really high and they charge you minimum 32 Euro for a picture with Santa \ud83d\ude1c. It gets really crowded during Christmas holidays. Still worth a visit!",
          "Even though it was summer when we visited all the facilities were still open (except the snowman village but fair enough) and it was delightful",

          "Place was beautiful and cozy",

          "It\u2019s a nice place, with multiple things to do. Make sure those attractions are open. In our case, last week of Oct, many attractions and cafes were closed preparing for upcoming high season.\n\nThree Elves restaurant have couple of vegetarian dishes.\n\nFrom airport, you can take private transfer bus which charges 7euros per person.",
          "The first destination target to visit in Rovaniemi. Its a good feeling in the environment, an international feel with all the tourists. Summer visit was awesome. Santa's village is quite big and alot to see and souvenir to take home. The artic circle line, pictures taken with santa,... amongst few. Recommended for a family or groups.",

          "I loved it. Going really early in the morning when it was all lit up it was just so magical. I wish I hadn't chosen such a cold day to go though. 2 days before would have been perfect when it was only about -8\u00b0 but the day we went it was \u2026",

          "Because Santa lives here - and he is lovely and a polyglot",
          "The first time I visit the Santa village it was a big disappointment. The staff was in a bad mood there was no music and no good atmosphere. The second time I visit was so much better. The people were nice and Santa spoke dutch! We did a short reindeer trip. And it was ok for the price",
          "What a fun place to visit. The highlight for us was taking pictures at the arctic circle! There are many shops and restaurants to choose from. If you have children, there's Santa to visit as well",

          "Absolutely wonderful under the snow. You can see, not a Santa, but the real one haha. The good point is that is free and you have to pay depending on the activities that you want to do. There is also a post office to send your letter.",

        "wiki": "Rovaniemi (Finnish: [\u02c8ro\u028b\u0251niemi] (listen)) is a city and municipality of Finland. It is the administrative capital and commercial centre of Finland's northernmost province, Lapland. It is situated about 6 kilometres (4 miles) south of the Arctic Circle and is between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korkalovaara, at the confluence of the river Kemijoki and its tributary, the Ounasjoki. \nThe city and the surrounding Rovaniemen maalaiskunta (Rural municipality of Rovaniemi) were consolidated into a single entity on 1 January 2006. The resulting city of Rovaniemi is considered the largest city in all of Europe by land area, because the defined limits of the city proper extend far beyond the actual urban area.Rovaniemi municipality has an approximate population of 63,000. The urban area of Rovaniemi has a population of 53 361, in an area of 59,77 km\u00b2. Rovaniemi is a unilingual Finnish-speaking municipality and, uncommonly for larger Finnish towns, it is also known by its Finnish name and spelling in the Swedish language.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe rova part in the name Rovaniemi has often been considered to be of Saamic origin, as roavve in Saami denotes a forested ridge or hill or the site of an old forest fire. In Southern Saami dialects, however, rova means a heap of stones, a rock or a group of rocks in a stretch of rapids or even a sauna stove. The niemi part of the name means \"cape\".\nNames in the Samic languages include Inari Sami: Ru\u00e1vinjarg\u00e2, Northern Sami: Roavenj\u00e1rga and Roavvenj\u00e1rga and Skolt Sami: Ru\u00e4\u02cavnjargg.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeriodic clearance of new land for agriculture and the practise of slash-and-burn cultivation began around 750\u2013530 BC. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travellers from Karelia in the east, H\u00e4me in the south and the Arctic Ocean coast in the north must have come there from 500 AD onwards. The Sami are considered to be Lapland's most indigenous existing population.\nIt is first mentioned by name in official documents in 1453, existing effectively as a set of small villages whose inhabitants earned their living mainly in agriculture and animal husbandry\u2014with fishing and hunting the most important offshoots.The exploitation of Lapland's natural resources in the 1800s boosted Rovaniemi's growth. Extensive logging sites and gold fever attracted thousands of people to Lapland. As the mining of natural resources was increased, Rovaniemi became the business centre of the province of Lapland.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring the Second World War, Finland signed the Moscow Armistice and found itself involved in the Lapland War with its former German ally. Retreating German forces utilised scorched earth tactics, and though initially German General Lothar Rendulic ordered only the public buildings in Rovaniemi to be destroyed, on 13 October 1944 the German army received orders to destroy all the buildings in Rovaniemi, only excluding hospitals and houses where inhabitants were present. While the German rear guard was going about the destruction, an ammunition train in Rovaniemi station exploded and set fire to the wooden houses of the town. The German troops suffered many casualties, mainly from glass splinters. A Finnish commando unit claimed to have blown up the ammunition train and may well have been the primary cause of the town's ruin. The cause was then unknown and generally assumed to be the deliberate intent of Rendulic. During these hostilities 90% of all the buildings in Rovaniemi were destroyed. There is a German cemetery 19 km from Rovaniemi where soldiers killed fighting in Lapland during the war are buried.\nAlthough there has been continuous human settlement in the Rovaniemi area since at least the Stone Age, few of the buildings date back before 1944 since most of the city was destroyed during WWII. When the city was rebuilt, it was designed with input by famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, who planned the city's footprint in the shape of a reindeer's head, with the city roads forming the antlers, and the local stadium as the reindeer's eye.\n\n\n== Modern day ==\n\nSince Rovaniemi is the capital of the region of Lapland, many government institutions have their offices there. About 10,000 of the inhabitants are students. Rovaniemi is home to not only the University of Lapland but also the Lapland University of Applied Sciences (formerly known as the Rovaniemi Polytechnic), which comprises institutes of information and traditional technology, business, health and social care, culinary studies, forestry, rural studies, and sports. Local newspapers include the Lapin Kansa, Uusi Rovaniemi and Lappilainen.\nRovaniemi's most prominent landmarks include the J\u00e4tk\u00e4nkynttil\u00e4 bridge with its eternal flame over the Kemijoki river, the Arktikum Science Museum which rises out of the bank of the Ounasjoki river, the Rovaniemi Town Hall, the Lappia House (which serves as a theatre, concert hall, and congress centre), and the library. The last three mentioned buildings are designed by the famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. The Arktikum Science Museum is a comprehensive museum of Finland's, and the world's, Arctic regions.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nBecause of the unspoiled nature of the area and numerous recreational opportunities, tourism is an important industry in Rovaniemi. The city has a number of hotels and restaurants located both in the centre and on the outskirts of the town, hosting over 481,000 visitors in 2013.Rovaniemi is also considered by Finns to be the official home town of Santa Claus. It is home to the Santa Claus Village at the Arctic Circle and SantaPark Arctic World, which is located 8 km (5 mi) north of the centre. \nDirectly across the river from the town is the Ounasvaara ski centre. The top of the Ounasvaara hill bears the site of some of the earliest known human settlements in the area.\nA phenomenon also attracting numerous tourists is the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights. In Finnish Lapland, the number of auroral displays can be as high as 200 a year whereas in southern Finland the number is usually fewer than 20.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVR Group, the Finnish state railway system, operates direct daytime and overnight passenger trains from Rovaniemi Station to Oulu, Tampere, Helsinki and Turku. Diesel-powered passenger trains operated north-east of Rovaniemi to Kemij\u00e4rvi until March 2014, when electrification to Kemij\u00e4rvi was completed. Rovaniemi Airport is located about 10 kilometres (6 mi) north of the Rovaniemi city centre.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDue to its location near the Arctic Circle, Rovaniemi has a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfc) with short, pleasant summers, while the winters are long, cold and snowy. The city lies just south of the 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) mean annual isotherm, but freezing in the soil is very limited even during the winter due to typical heavy snow cover. Its extreme northerly location combined with frequent overcast skies leads to very low levels of sunshine in the winter months; December averages just under six minutes of sunshine daily. Winters are somewhat modified by marine air from the North Atlantic Current that ensures average temperatures are less extreme than expected for an inland area at such a northerly latitude.\nOn 26 April 2019, Rovaniemi recorded its warmest April day on record with 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F).\n\nThe average annual temperature in Rovaniemi is 0.9 \u00b0C (33.6 \u00b0F). Snow stays on the ground 175 days a year on average. The lowest temperature ever recorded at the airport is \u221238.1 \u00b0C (\u221237 \u00b0F), recorded on 28 January 1999. However, on the same day temperatures as cold as -47.5 C were recorded at nearby weather stations.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded is 32.2 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F), recorded on July 18, 2018 at the railway station.Despite the fact that Rovaniemi experiences polar day between 7 June and 6 July (30 days) it does not experience polar night. However, the sun barely gets above the horizon in the winter.\n\n\n== Twin cities ==\nRovaniemi is twinned with:\n Ajka, Hungary\n Alanya, Turkey\n Cadillac, Michigan, United States\n Drvar, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n Grindav\u00edk, Iceland\n Harbin, China\n St. Johann in Tirol, Austria\n Kassel, Germany\n Kiruna, Sweden\n Murmansk, Russia\n Narvik, Norway\n Neustrelitz, Germany\n Olsztyn, Poland\n Veszpr\u00e9m, Hungary\n\n\n== Famous inhabitants ==\n\nJari Tervo, author\nHarri Olli, ski jumper\nwriter Timo K.

In the game, Rovaniemi houses military facilities critical to a missile shield for a European Federation.Rovaniemi is a central scene in a documentary film Reindeerspotting.\nTV-Star Bam Margera and his friends travelled to Rovaniemi in their film Bam Margera Presents: Where the \u266f$&% Is Santa? in order to find Santa Claus who is assumed to live in Rovaniemi.\nA version of the music video for Lordi's song \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\" was filmed near Rovaniemi.The video for the Nightwish single \"The Islander\" was filmed in Rovaniemi by Stobe Harju.\nRovaniemi used to have the northernmost location of any McDonald's in the world until the opening of a McDonald's in Murmansk in 2013, 23 years after it first opened in that country. There are plenty of different restaurants to go for food in Rovaniemi from expensive to less expensive.\nRovaniemi appears as one location of Gavin Lyall's 1963 book The Most Dangerous Game , a spy-thriller set in Lapland and the northern USSR.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe city is home to the football clubs Rovaniemen Palloseura, or RoPS, part of the Veikkausliiga, the Finnish premier division, and FC Santa Claus, part of the third division; to the ice hockey team Rovaniemen Kiekko, or RoKi, whose home arena is Lappi Areena and which currently competes on Mestis, the second-highest league in Finland; and to the volleyball team called Team Lakkap\u00e4\u00e4 (formerly Rovaniemen Santasport and Perungan Pojat), which plays in the Finland Volleyball League and won the national championship in 2003, 2007, 2008 and 2011.\nRovaniemi has hosted several international ski competition, including the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1984, several FIS Nordic Combined World Cup and FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup events, the 2005 FIS Nordic Junior World Ski Championships, the 1970 Winter Universiade and the 2008 Winter Transplant Games.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPilke House\nUniversity of the Arctic\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Further reading ===\n\"The dark, ruined city that became the home of Christmas\" (Video and Text).

        "wiki": "Rovaniemi (Finnish: [\u02c8ro\u028b\u0251niemi] (listen)) is a city and municipality of Finland. It is the administrative capital and commercial centre of Finland's northernmost province, Lapland. It is situated about 6 kilometres (4 miles) south of the Arctic Circle and is between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korkalovaara, at the confluence of the river Kemijoki and its tributary, the Ounasjoki. \nThe city and the surrounding Rovaniemen maalaiskunta (Rural municipality of Rovaniemi) were consolidated into a single entity on 1 January 2006. The resulting city of Rovaniemi is considered the largest city in all of Europe by land area, because the defined limits of the city proper extend far beyond the actual urban area.Rovaniemi municipality has an approximate population of 63,000. The urban area of Rovaniemi has a population of 53 361, in an area of 59,77 km\u00b2. Rovaniemi is a unilingual Finnish-speaking municipality and, uncommonly for larger Finnish towns, it is also known by its Finnish name and spelling in the Swedish language.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe rova part in the name Rovaniemi has often been considered to be of Saamic origin, as roavve in Saami denotes a forested ridge or hill or the site of an old forest fire. In Southern Saami dialects, however, rova means a heap of stones, a rock or a group of rocks in a stretch of rapids or even a sauna stove. The niemi part of the name means \"cape\".\nNames in the Samic languages include Inari Sami: Ru\u00e1vinjarg\u00e2, Northern Sami: Roavenj\u00e1rga and Roavvenj\u00e1rga and Skolt Sami: Ru\u00e4\u02cavnjargg.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeriodic clearance of new land for agriculture and the practise of slash-and-burn cultivation began around 750\u2013530 BC. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travellers from Karelia in the east, H\u00e4me in the south and the Arctic Ocean coast in the north must have come there from 500 AD onwards. The Sami are considered to be Lapland's most indigenous existing population.\nIt is first mentioned by name in official documents in 1453, existing effectively as a set of small villages whose inhabitants earned their living mainly in agriculture and animal husbandry\u2014with fishing and hunting the most important offshoots.The exploitation of Lapland's natural resources in the 1800s boosted Rovaniemi's growth. Extensive logging sites and gold fever attracted thousands of people to Lapland. As the mining of natural resources was increased, Rovaniemi became the business centre of the province of Lapland.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring the Second World War, Finland signed the Moscow Armistice and found itself involved in the Lapland War with its former German ally. Retreating German forces utilised scorched earth tactics, and though initially German General Lothar Rendulic ordered only the public buildings in Rovaniemi to be destroyed, on 13 October 1944 the German army received orders to destroy all the buildings in Rovaniemi, only excluding hospitals and houses where inhabitants were present. While the German rear guard was going about the destruction, an ammunition train in Rovaniemi station exploded and set fire to the wooden houses of the town. The German troops suffered many casualties, mainly from glass splinters. A Finnish commando unit claimed to have blown up the ammunition train and may well have been the primary cause of the town's ruin. The cause was then unknown and generally assumed to be the deliberate intent of Rendulic. During these hostilities 90% of all the buildings in Rovaniemi were destroyed. There is a German cemetery 19 km from Rovaniemi where soldiers killed fighting in Lapland during the war are buried.\nAlthough there has been continuous human settlement in the Rovaniemi area since at least the Stone Age, few of the buildings date back before 1944 since most of the city was destroyed during WWII. When the city was rebuilt, it was designed with input by famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, who planned the city's footprint in the shape of a reindeer's head, with the city roads forming the antlers, and the local stadium as the reindeer's eye.\n\n\n== Modern day ==\n\nSince Rovaniemi is the capital of the region of Lapland, many government institutions have their offices there. About 10,000 of the inhabitants are students. Rovaniemi is home to not only the University of Lapland but also the Lapland University of Applied Sciences (formerly known as the Rovaniemi Polytechnic), which comprises institutes of information and traditional technology, business, health and social care, culinary studies, forestry, rural studies, and sports. Local newspapers include the Lapin Kansa, Uusi Rovaniemi and Lappilainen.\nRovaniemi's most prominent landmarks include the J\u00e4tk\u00e4nkynttil\u00e4 bridge with its eternal flame over the Kemijoki river, the Arktikum Science Museum which rises out of the bank of the Ounasjoki river, the Rovaniemi Town Hall, the Lappia House (which serves as a theatre, concert hall, and congress centre), and the library. The last three mentioned buildings are designed by the famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. The Arktikum Science Museum is a comprehensive museum of Finland's, and the world's, Arctic regions.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nBecause of the unspoiled nature of the area and numerous recreational opportunities, tourism is an important industry in Rovaniemi. The city has a number of hotels and restaurants located both in the centre and on the outskirts of the town, hosting over 481,000 visitors in 2013.Rovaniemi is also considered by Finns to be the official home town of Santa Claus. It is home to the Santa Claus Village at the Arctic Circle and SantaPark Arctic World, which is located 8 km (5 mi) north of the centre. \nDirectly across the river from the town is the Ounasvaara ski centre. The top of the Ounasvaara hill bears the site of some of the earliest known human settlements in the area.\nA phenomenon also attracting numerous tourists is the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights. In Finnish Lapland, the number of auroral displays can be as high as 200 a year whereas in southern Finland the number is usually fewer than 20.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVR Group, the Finnish state railway system, operates direct daytime and overnight passenger trains from Rovaniemi Station to Oulu, Tampere, Helsinki and Turku. Diesel-powered passenger trains operated north-east of Rovaniemi to Kemij\u00e4rvi until March 2014, when electrification to Kemij\u00e4rvi was completed. Rovaniemi Airport is located about 10 kilometres (6 mi) north of the Rovaniemi city centre.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDue to its location near the Arctic Circle, Rovaniemi has a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfc) with short, pleasant summers, while the winters are long, cold and snowy. The city lies just south of the 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) mean annual isotherm, but freezing in the soil is very limited even during the winter due to typical heavy snow cover. Its extreme northerly location combined with frequent overcast skies leads to very low levels of sunshine in the winter months; December averages just under six minutes of sunshine daily. Winters are somewhat modified by marine air from the North Atlantic Current that ensures average temperatures are less extreme than expected for an inland area at such a northerly latitude.\nOn 26 April 2019, Rovaniemi recorded its warmest April day on record with 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F).\n\nThe average annual temperature in Rovaniemi is 0.9 \u00b0C (33.6 \u00b0F). Snow stays on the ground 175 days a year on average. The lowest temperature ever recorded at the airport is \u221238.1 \u00b0C (\u221237 \u00b0F), recorded on 28 January 1999.

        "wiki": "Rovaniemi (Finnish: [\u02c8ro\u028b\u0251niemi] (listen)) is a city and municipality of Finland. It is the administrative capital and commercial centre of Finland's northernmost province, Lapland. It is situated about 6 kilometres (4 miles) south of the Arctic Circle and is between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korkalovaara, at the confluence of the river Kemijoki and its tributary, the Ounasjoki. \nThe city and the surrounding Rovaniemen maalaiskunta (Rural municipality of Rovaniemi) were consolidated into a single entity on 1 January 2006. The resulting city of Rovaniemi is considered the largest city in all of Europe by land area, because the defined limits of the city proper extend far beyond the actual urban area.Rovaniemi municipality has an approximate population of 63,000. The urban area of Rovaniemi has a population of 53 361, in an area of 59,77 km\u00b2. Rovaniemi is a unilingual Finnish-speaking municipality and, uncommonly for larger Finnish towns, it is also known by its Finnish name and spelling in the Swedish language.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe rova part in the name Rovaniemi has often been considered to be of Saamic origin, as roavve in Saami denotes a forested ridge or hill or the site of an old forest fire. In Southern Saami dialects, however, rova means a heap of stones, a rock or a group of rocks in a stretch of rapids or even a sauna stove. The niemi part of the name means \"cape\".\nNames in the Samic languages include Inari Sami: Ru\u00e1vinjarg\u00e2, Northern Sami: Roavenj\u00e1rga and Roavvenj\u00e1rga and Skolt Sami: Ru\u00e4\u02cavnjargg.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeriodic clearance of new land for agriculture and the practise of slash-and-burn cultivation began around 750\u2013530 BC. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travellers from Karelia in the east, H\u00e4me in the south and the Arctic Ocean coast in the north must have come there from 500 AD onwards. The Sami are considered to be Lapland's most indigenous existing population.\nIt is first mentioned by name in official documents in 1453, existing effectively as a set of small villages whose inhabitants earned their living mainly in agriculture and animal husbandry\u2014with fishing and hunting the most important offshoots.The exploitation of Lapland's natural resources in the 1800s boosted Rovaniemi's growth. Extensive logging sites and gold fever attracted thousands of people to Lapland. As the mining of natural resources was increased, Rovaniemi became the business centre of the province of Lapland.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring the Second World War, Finland signed the Moscow Armistice and found itself involved in the Lapland War with its former German ally. Retreating German forces utilised scorched earth tactics, and though initially German General Lothar Rendulic ordered only the public buildings in Rovaniemi to be destroyed, on 13 October 1944 the German army received orders to destroy all the buildings in Rovaniemi, only excluding hospitals and houses where inhabitants were present. While the German rear guard was going about the destruction, an ammunition train in Rovaniemi station exploded and set fire to the wooden houses of the town. The German troops suffered many casualties, mainly from glass splinters. A Finnish commando unit claimed to have blown up the ammunition train and may well have been the primary cause of the town's ruin. The cause was then unknown and generally assumed to be the deliberate intent of Rendulic. During these hostilities 90% of all the buildings in Rovaniemi were destroyed. There is a German cemetery 19 km from Rovaniemi where soldiers killed fighting in Lapland during the war are buried.\nAlthough there has been continuous human settlement in the Rovaniemi area since at least the Stone Age, few of the buildings date back before 1944 since most of the city was destroyed during WWII. When the city was rebuilt, it was designed with input by famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, who planned the city's footprint in the shape of a reindeer's head, with the city roads forming the antlers, and the local stadium as the reindeer's eye.\n\n\n== Modern day ==\n\nSince Rovaniemi is the capital of the region of Lapland, many government institutions have their offices there. About 10,000 of the inhabitants are students. Rovaniemi is home to not only the University of Lapland but also the Lapland University of Applied Sciences (formerly known as the Rovaniemi Polytechnic), which comprises institutes of information and traditional technology, business, health and social care, culinary studies, forestry, rural studies, and sports. Local newspapers include the Lapin Kansa, Uusi Rovaniemi and Lappilainen.\nRovaniemi's most prominent landmarks include the J\u00e4tk\u00e4nkynttil\u00e4 bridge with its eternal flame over the Kemijoki river, the Arktikum Science Museum which rises out of the bank of the Ounasjoki river, the Rovaniemi Town Hall, the Lappia House (which serves as a theatre, concert hall, and congress centre), and the library. The last three mentioned buildings are designed by the famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. The Arktikum Science Museum is a comprehensive museum of Finland's, and the world's, Arctic regions.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nBecause of the unspoiled nature of the area and numerous recreational opportunities, tourism is an important industry in Rovaniemi. The city has a number of hotels and restaurants located both in the centre and on the outskirts of the town, hosting over 481,000 visitors in 2013.Rovaniemi is also considered by Finns to be the official home town of Santa Claus. It is home to the Santa Claus Village at the Arctic Circle and SantaPark Arctic World, which is located 8 km (5 mi) north of the centre. \nDirectly across the river from the town is the Ounasvaara ski centre. The top of the Ounasvaara hill bears the site of some of the earliest known human settlements in the area.\nA phenomenon also attracting numerous tourists is the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights. In Finnish Lapland, the number of auroral displays can be as high as 200 a year whereas in southern Finland the number is usually fewer than 20.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVR Group, the Finnish state railway system, operates direct daytime and overnight passenger trains from Rovaniemi Station to Oulu, Tampere, Helsinki and Turku. Diesel-powered passenger trains operated north-east of Rovaniemi to Kemij\u00e4rvi until March 2014, when electrification to Kemij\u00e4rvi was completed. Rovaniemi Airport is located about 10 kilometres (6 mi) north of the Rovaniemi city centre.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDue to its location near the Arctic Circle, Rovaniemi has a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfc) with short, pleasant summers, while the winters are long, cold and snowy. The city lies just south of the 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) mean annual isotherm, but freezing in the soil is very limited even during the winter due to typical heavy snow cover. Its extreme northerly location combined with frequent overcast skies leads to very low levels of sunshine in the winter months; December averages just under six minutes of sunshine daily. Winters are somewhat modified by marine air from the North Atlantic Current that ensures average temperatures are less extreme than expected for an inland area at such a northerly latitude.\nOn 26 April 2019, Rovaniemi recorded its warmest April day on record with 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F).\n\nThe average annual temperature in Rovaniemi is 0.9 \u00b0C (33.6 \u00b0F). Snow stays on the ground 175 days a year on average. The lowest temperature ever recorded at the airport is \u221238.1 \u00b0C (\u221237 \u00b0F), recorded on 28 January 1999. However, on the same day temperatures as cold as -47.5 C were recorded at nearby weather stations.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded is 32.2 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F), recorded on July 18, 2018 at the railway station.Despite the fact that Rovaniemi experiences polar day between 7 June and 6 July (30 days) it does not experience polar night. However, the sun barely gets above the horizon in the winter.\n\n\n== Twin cities ==\nRovaniemi is twinned with:\n Ajka, Hungary\n Alanya, Turkey\n Cadillac, Michigan, United States\n Drvar, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n Grindav\u00edk, Iceland\n Harbin, China\n St. Johann in Tirol, Austria\n Kassel, Germany\n Kiruna, Sweden\n Murmansk, Russia\n Narvik, Norway\n Neustrelitz, Germany\n Olsztyn, Poland\n Veszpr\u00e9m, Hungary\n\n\n== Famous inhabitants ==\n\nJari Tervo, author\nHarri Olli, ski jumper\nwriter Timo K.

          "The ride seemed expensive at first but turned out to be one of the most unique experience we had in Rovaniemi. I don't want to compare but husky ride feels more exotic, adventurous than reindeer ride. I hope they take care of the dogs a bit more. Totally recommend!",

        "wiki": "SantaPark is a Christmas theme park and visitor attraction in Rovaniemi in the Lapland region of Finland. SantaPark was opened 28 November 1998.\n\n\n== Theme ==\nThe park is designed to emulate the cavern residence of Santa Claus on the Arctic circle. Popular culture often depicts Santa Claus (or joulupukki in Finnish) coming from Lapland. Therefore, tourists come every year to Rovaniemi to meet Santa Claus.\nSantaPark is a Christmassy theme park known as Santa Claus\u2019s own home cavern. During summertime, it is open from the middle of June to the first weeks of August. In winter season the park is open from the late November to the beginning of January. There is an entrance fee for the park. \nIn SantaPark visitors can meet Santa Claus in his office and take pictures free-of-charge with him. In addition, it is possible to visit in Mrs. Gingerbread\u2019s Gingerbread Bakery, see Ice Princess in her Icy kingdom called \"Ice Gallery\" and send postcards from the Post Office. Also, Candybar, Magic Train, Kota Caf\u00e9, Shopping area, Elf School and Handicraft\u2019s area are included in the entrance ticket's price. On the main stage acrobatics show \u2013 Magic Christmas, is performed 3 times a day. \nSantaPark is a part of SantaPark Arctic World \u2013 brand, which also includes Santa Claus Secret Forest \u2013 Joulukka, Arctic Forest Spa \u2013 Mets\u00e4kyly, Lapland Luxury, Arctic TreeHouse Hotel, and Rakas Restaurant & Bar.\n\n\n== History and the business concept ==\nSantaPark was opened on 28 November 1998 as an amusement park. The concept was created by Santaworld Ltd. (UK) and the cost of construction was  6.7 million Euros. The ownership consisted of Finnish companies such as Finnair, MTV, Sampo, Lasten P\u00e4iv\u00e4n S\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6, Posti. Ministry of Trade and Industry was also involved. As an amusement park Santa Park did not reach its economical goals. Renewal of the concept was attempted in 2002 with a new ownership structure where the municipality of Rovaniemi was involved. The new concept featured Santa Claus, Christmas and Lappish culture and nature. On 24 March 2009 ownership was transferred to Santa's Holding Ltd. where the majority is held by Mr. Ilkka L\u00e4nkinen and Mrs. Katja Ik\u00e4heimo-L\u00e4nkinen.Currently another owner with shares of SantaPark is Lappset Group Oy. Former owners are Eero Sarin, Lasten P\u00e4iv\u00e4n S\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6, Sampo Oyj, Tapsan Tapuli Oy, TeliaSonera Finland Oyj, MTV Oy and Lappish newspaper Lapin Kansa Oy. New owners Ilkka L\u00e4nkinen and Katja-Ik\u00e4heimo L\u00e4nkinen have announced that they will focus more in the sales and marketing of SantaPark.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nThe attractions of SantaPark include\n\nChristmas Magic Show\nSanta's Office\nPost Office\nMrs. Gingerbread Bakery\nMagic Train\nElf School\nElf Workshop\nPost Office\nIce Gallery\nUndercrossing of the Arctic CircleToy Factory Shopping Area and Kota Hut Cafe also serve customers.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe themepark is located in a cavern inside bedrock where visitors descend via a large portal. The space was originally designed as air-raid shelter.\n\n\n== Location and transportation ==\nSantaPark can be reached by car along the national highway 4. It is located about 9 km northeast of Rovaniemi and about 2 km from Rovaniemi Airport. Frequent flights from Helsinki and other cities to Rovaniemi are offered throughout the year. The majority of international tourists switch their plane at Helsinki-Vantaa airport. Also in the Christmas time there are many charter flights from Sweden, the United Kingdom and other countries that fly directly to Rovaniemi. Additionally there are Ryanair flights to Tampere which has regular connection to Rovaniemi as well. Finally there are regular bus and train connections to most major cities in Finland. Local transportation is provided by Santa's Express (bus line number 8) from the centre of Rovaniemi to SantaPark and Santa Claus Village. The bus trip to SantaPark takes about 15 minutes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSanta Claus Village\nSanta Claus Office\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Web Site",

          "Had a great time at Santa Park with our 6yo in early December. Definitely better for younger children. We travelled under our own steam and arrived just after it opened. However after lunch 700 people on day trips from the UK turned up and the place was overwhelmed.",
          "What a total rip off!!!! The place is pretty much a load of overpriced shops and a restaurant. Crying we spent over \u00a3100 on a family ticket and we were done in an hour. Even after paying a huge amount to get in they wanted you to pay extra to decorate a gingerbread man! My",
          "We were on a three-night trip with TUI and visited the park on our second day. It\u2019s pretty cool that it\u2019s a cave, I hadn\u2019t researched so it was a nice surprise. We probably spent three hours indoors and enjoyed the little ride, meeting Santa, making gingerbread hearts, Elf",
          "TUI organised our trip and it was fab ul ous. Our 6 year old had a great time, meeting Santa, crossing the Arctic circle, going to elf school, watching a great acrobat show, and making a gingerbread 'thing'. 3 hours is about right.",
          "I Took my five year old son to the TUI Santa day trip and basically spent \u00a31500 to queue all day. Queue to see Santa, queue to get outdoor clothing, queue to go on a husky ride which lasted all of 30seconds and queue to go sledging down a man made hill! To top it off the food",
          "Santa park was like Santa Claus the movie. Covered in snow out in the forest with magic excellent elves and Santa. Amazing experience for the whole family. Loved every minute of it",
          "We visited on Friday 13th December 2019. I hadn't pre booked the tickets and arrived just after 10:30am and were able to purchase tickets on the door. The entrance fee of 35 Euros in my opinion is a little high. The website over sells this place and I was expecting a bit",
          "Went to elf school and graduated with diploma, made my own santa claus card, took the ride and of course meeting Santa himself! Meeting Santa was great as we chatted for awhile. Worth experiencing especially for kids. The elfs were very friendly too. However i would recommend",
          "After my parents took my children 18 years ago to see Santa at Roveniemi, they buzzed about a magical experience, so decided to take my grandchildren this year......what a DISAPPOINTMENT, we were at Santa Park approximately 4 hours and spent 3 hours of that in 3 queues, an hour",
          "It's mostly directed towards children. Adults can pretty much only eat and shop. A lot of activities there, but not for adults. The show on the main stage was great though. Both for young and old.",
          "Extortionate prices for beverages, best bring your own food and drinks. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity, although can get boring very quickly after a few activities. It is mainly for children aged 4-8. Wouldn\u2019t recommend buying the ticket as it doesn\u2019t take two days to",
          "We came back from our trip to Lapland and sadly realised that the pendrive we bought with our photos with Santa contains some other guys' photos I opened a claim through email, giving them the exact time when they charged the fee (32\u20ac) to my VISA card, so locating the right",
          "Wonderful way to meet Santa. We liked it here more then Santa Village because you can take as many pictures with Santa as well as videos. Santa was very niche with the kids. You can also buy their pictures if you want. We enjoyed the show and lunch. It is a buffet. Thought is",
          "Very special place for all people, not only children and children at heart. There you can visit Santa Claus in his office, take a magic train ride, see Santa's elves and their shows on stage, visit really amazing ice gallery, gingerbread room and eat in a restaurant. I had a",

          "Went with my 5-year-old granddaughter to see Father Christmas but it turned out there was much more to see and do. It was underground and quite warm so they have a cloakroom to leave you outer clothing. An entertaining show by the elves several times during the day as well as a",
          "A nightmare day from start to finish.. They ran out of activity books which said love from santa on the books, half the kids on the flight didn't get one... Arriving at santa Park in Finland at 1.30pm we were advised our coach back to the airport was at 5.pm that gave us 3.5",

          "This really is the worst experience for what was supposed to be a magical day for the family. I really am not one to complain but this was just diabolical and I must let others know so that they don't have to endure the same experience. My brother booked this trip for his and",
          "We had a child of 9 and \u2018child\u2019 of 19 with us and this was ok for both but def more geared to youngsters (unlike village which is great for the adults too). My 19 year old did like the ice bar though and her Vodka shot in the ice glass even if it was 10 euros ! We watched the",
          "Perfect for the younger ones. My 7 year old was absolutely amazed by it and was almost speechless when he met the \"real\" Santa in his actual home in Lapland. The smile on his face as Santa read his letter was something I'll never forget. Include the elf school, gingerbread",
          "This is the place where Christmas commercialism comes to its peak. You pay 35 euro to get in to a place where everything is about spending even more money. For instance, you can decorate your own gingerbread. That is not included in the entrance fee. For 3 extra euros you get",

          "Well the idea was great ..Take the children to see the 'real' Santa in Lapland. The start was great super plane, pilot and crew. Fun on the trip out. Arrival was fine out onto a waiting coach with Elves then 10 minute ride to location. This is where the stress started off the",
          "We were there without kids, so the most amazing for us was Santa Claus, very friendly and funny) there\u2019s also Elf\u2019s school, ginger bread bakery, cafeterias, souvenirs shop, iced bar, train. But it\u2019s a bit dark inside Santa park because it\u2019s located in the cave.",

          "We travelled yesterday (30th Nov) as a party of 3, 2 adults and our 8 year old son. It was a very early start and we knew it would be a very long day but we knew what we were letting ourselves in for. The flight out from Birmingham was great fun, the staff were dressed up and",
          "Please don\u2019t take this out on Santa park the issues we had were down to Tui\u2019s greed and inability to manage such a large group of adults and children. I would give Santa park 5 stars as the staff here were absolutely fantastic with the amount of people that arrived and the",
          "We were really disappointed with this trip yesterday 30/11/19, we went on this trip with a 5 year old and a 7 year old, it was rushed, manic, and just far too busy to enjoy anything! We couldn\u2019t spend any time together as a family because we had to take it in turns to stand in",
          "We visited Santa park 30th November 2019. First impressions were great and there was lots to do for the 6 hours we had. We started by being greeted by people everywhere and were pointed towards the end point of the park which meant we headed outside. We signed the declaration",
          "we booked with TUI for a day trip to Lapland. The day trip takes place at \u2018SantaPark\u2019 Santa park is an amazing, magical place but due to the organisation of TUI, unfortunately it was a really expensive, terrible day. I knew from reading the reviews that it wasn\u2019t possible to",
          "Do not book this day trip with Tui! We flew from Gatwick and were promised a magical day of activities. What we actually got was 4 hours of queueing for a 30 second husky ride and a cup of warm juice. This trip is oversold and it is impossible to do anything other than stand in",
          "It is a park for child...and adulta! After a while we were all captured by Xmas feeling. Elves are in everywhere as well as fun and colour. Ice gallery, Santa's post office, gingerbread bakery and many more are waiting for you!! I would also recommend the restaurant inside the",
          "Not a Disney or universal for sure and yet pretty expensive entrance fees. Man made Theme parks are not their thing. Stick to things made of snow",
          "This place is 2kms away from Arctic Circle information center. Not many people go there because of confusion about which is real snata house and which is not. We'll both the places you get to meet santa but Santa Park is a small fun place to experience everything in a quick",
          "Wow, this was the biggest let down of our trip. For kids that can\u2019t sit still for a couple of minutes this is a nightmare. There is not a lot to do here apart from the train which takes ~3 minutes, gingerbread decorating(extra cost), elf face decorating and the ice gallery.",
          "This is a lovely place to spend a few hours with your younger children. I'd say up to 10 year olds would love it. There was a few workshops to get involved with. My girls just decorated gingerbread, but that was their choice (they are in their twenties after all). Seriously",
          "We came in mid November and it wasn\u2019t too busy , I\u2019m guessing it is a different story in December. We were able to do most of the activities without much of a wait. Staff were friendly and interacted well with our 1 & 3 year old. There were the same staff doing most of the",
          "This place is undercave christmas activity place for children with different xmas activities, shows, craft activities, gingerbread making, arts and crafts, food and xmas shows and also there is a meet and greet with santa. And a Ice cafe",
          "SantaPark is found in in a grotto. As soon as, one goes in, one finds immerse in the atmosphere of Christmas. Inside you will find an elf school, baking area, an ice bar, a short ride and Santa's office. Although, we were both adults, we enjoyed taking photos with Santa",
          "We did the VIP pack and it was amazing. They sell the experience really well to the children and it feels like Santa's proper grotto.",
          "We visited as part of TUI itinerary so we were limited for time, but if you are able to - spend the whole day there. Kids loved it, lots of activities to get involved in, see and do. The elf show was spectacular!",
          "A really fun place to stay in the summer. You get in Christmas mood. There are a lot of activities for children. There is an ice room.",
          "We went on Christmas eve and absolutely loved it!!! it's nice that it is inside...The staff was super friendly, go early and buy tickets ahead of time, it does get very crowded during the holiday season! Santa was great and you can take as many of your own pictures as you want.",
          "everything was so expensive. long way to see santa with four kids and cold inside there. thanks but no thanks.",
          "We spent about 4.5 hrs at Santa Park and loved every minute of it. The kids had so much to see and do. We must have done the train ride 4 times as we loved it so much. There were lots of craft activities for the kids to do. Elf school was brilliant. The show was incredible.",
          "We enjoyed Santa Park and especially the Ballerina dance and Elf show, it was very funny. The magic ride is good for young children and the Ice sculptures are also very nice, it's underground so escape from the cold weather during winter",
          "Santa Park is entirely underground, housed in an abandoned air raid shelter. It was originally built by British investors, so maybe I get it. The Brits did bring us the London Underground and it's an exceptional feat of engineering and logistics. Maybe? No. There's something",
          "We spent 3,5 hours there without anyone getting bored. Nice different sections and actions for everybody But especially for children. Elf-school, santa claus, splendid acrobatic elves-show. Really Good and original place to visit. Food in the restaurant was moderate, I would",
          "The good thing is that it's indoors, so it's a good hideout from the winter cold. The drawbacks were that the place was too small with few activities. Main things were the elf lesson which was a little dry, then some craft work stations, the ice sculptures room, a very short",
          "The entry into this place is one of the best parts - you walk down into the main area and the lighting is really cool. They say the tickets are good for 2 days but honestly if you spend 2 hours you've seen everything. We were there on a pretty quiet day so it was easy to do all",
          "Even as an adult I really enjoyed this place. Coming during the last week offers the advantage of an almost empty place. There are no lines except for the train but that was only 5 minutes. You can cross the Arctic Circle underground and get the certificate for \u20ac5 and you can",
          "Good place to visit. Santa was great. Food was ok, like Ikea meatballs if you know what I mean. Outdoor activities were great, husky ride was the best. The reindeer ride is to be avoided, the raindeers were struggling and some had blood showing where the straps had dug into",
          "It was well laid out however we were waiting over 40mins to see Santa. The food was not good at all and the tables were very dirty. The ice room was good. We would consider returning",
          "Lots to do and all indoors so great on a cold day. Meet Santa, magical train ride, wonderful show and lots of crafts to do. Cafe is pricy but as a captive audience not extremely over priced. Spent the whole day there and had a great time.",
          "concept is great all underground with different workshops and activities in different directions. However it was extremely busy. There is an ice bar and ice sculptures and ice fairy this was great as least crowded. Decorate gingerbread good but so busy and cramped. Elf school",
          "I cannot believe we flew all the way to Lapland just to go to this overly-commericalised indoor theme park!! All my dreams of Santa being in a quaint little, magical workshop are now ruined. This behemouth of a tacky rubbish is all underground. The top floor is sponsored by",
          "We all loved this place. It was a nice break from the cold and the children would happily have stayed in the play area all day. The Santa was very authentic and we had a five minute wait when we went in the week before Christmas. The gingerbread decorating was great as was elf",
          "Stopped in for a visit, its all about Santa, so why not. Interesting place, kids love it, staff were really polite and helpful.",
          "The theme park is completely indoors with 7-8 activity areas. Great for small children. Lots of dress up interactive personnel. Short queues, luggage and jacket keeping room, food area. A good place to spend 2-3 hours.",
          "We visited with TUI with our toddler (16 months). We had a lovely time doing all of the taster sessions and then going into the park which was really great for our daughter. She really loved the train/sleigh ride and seeing Santa. We were the first group to go to the park in the",
          "A nice close and warm place.very nice show from the elfs and kids can enjoy... i. the end looks more like a huge souvenirs seller than everything else.",

          "We visited here with tui, they really need to either set off earlier or leave later as by the time we got there it was 12.30pm and we had to leave by 5pm when we first arrived we queued in a huge queue for 45mins to get near the front and be told this is for your coats, we",
          "We visited this park on xmas day with TUI. It was awful. The Santa was terrible (after queuing over an hr for). Elf school was rubbish, magic train is ok for under 4\u2019s. The ice bar is a counter where you can purchase hot choc or hot choc with an alcoholic shot! Not really a bar",
          "It\u2019s a great place but for younger kids. For my 10yo it was boring. The show was great. Long queues to see Santa and for the train ride",
          "This is a fun park but really designed for very young children. We took our 8 and 10 year olds and neither wanted to see Santa, and both thought Elf School was too childish for them. They were over it all in less than an hour. The free show is very impressive (acrobatics,",
          "Took my daughter and 6 year old Grandson , on the TUI Santa Park Day Trip . After waking at 4am we headed to the Airport for a 7am flight . The Crew on the plane ended the last half hour with some games , we landed and headed on a short coach ride to Santa Park . We were given",
          "While the entry price is high, this place is more for families with very young children..definitely not for teens, as quite cheesy. The staff are lovely and are attentive, staying in character the whole time.",
          "I was originally hesitant about a trip to Santa park. I shouldn't have been. Top tips. Visit early 10-12 or late 3-6. Entry ticket valid for 2 days. Bus from Rovaniemi (8) or Santa express is unreliable. They don't wait for the timetable (allow time). Taxi \u20ac20-25 to Rovaniemi",
          "Everything you need is at Santa Park and is all based indoors. Souvenir shops, food and drink outlet, Santa, cooking decorating, ice sculptures, elf school, short train ride, etc. It does get very busy as the day goes on, therefore I would recommend visiting Santa on arrival in",
          "After a disastrous visit to Santa at his office in Santa Village I prayed the Park would turn this Lapland experience around for us and they went above and beyond to make it a magical morning!! We began by taking the bus from Rovaniemi, a few stops later we arrived, paid in",
          "Santa Park is well set up for Children and would be a great place if you had small kids. Unfortunately the queues to get into attractions were extremely long and slow which was a bit frustrating. The cafe food is minimal unless you get the buffet which is quite expensive.",
          "We spent about 5h here with our 8 and 11 year old kids and it was really nice. Even grandpa liked it even if he thought that queuing was too hard for the back. Better wait with taking the picture with Santa until after 3pm when there's less people. The place itself is pretty",
          "Obviously setup for a kids experience and for that you can't fault it. From an adults perspective not sure its worth a $30 entrance fee. You can easily walk round it in an hour. Santaclaus village is far better and free. Tip - take a walk between the two parks. About 2km and",
          "This is a very commercialised park - Santa lives in Santa \u2018Park\u2019?? On arrival you are basically left to your own devices, no queue control etc, magic train aimed at under 5s at best, 90 min wait for Santa, just to have a very mundane 2 mins and very cheap present! Out of 5.5hr",
          "Arrived here by short snowmobile and get to go on a short husky ride, then a sleigh ride, then a beautiful walk through the forest to find Santa. Quite a big queue for Santa, but very lovely Santa, lots to do here, but I think it\u2019s more for children under 8, but we spent 5",
          "When asked what my children liked the best on our trip to Rovaniemi, Santa Park was on the top of the list. Lapland is expensive so Santa Park is also the same. My children loved going deep into the earth to see the underground layer of Santa\u2019s world. The elf school was well",
          "Visited the Santa Park the day after our Santa Village visit. I think this place is a bit overpriced for what it offers. Kids will definitely enjoy making little elves and decorating own Christmas cards and the show on the main stage was very good.",
          "Firstly the main event - Santa - was great. No rush, 20-25 minute queue (6 or 8 families). Very good with our kids as you\u2019d expect. Elf school was really nicely done and entertaining for the kids, the train suitably Lappish and a bit weird/wacky (we went a few times) though",
          "We visited this place as part of the Magic Vacations 3 day Lapland holiday. We all loved the Santa Park. The elf show was just amazing, and the place itself is fantastic. All underground and very scenic. The ice room is fabulous and the arts and crafts activities went down a",
          "Sadly the experience was atrocious from start to finish. We had the misfortune to book this 'magical' day out for our joint 3 grandchildren to see the great man in person. He was just an old Finnish Man dressed in a red suit. Difficult to understand and little in common with the",
          "If you want the 'Santa Claus' experience this is the place to go. The whole park is underground so not dependent on the weather. I went with my adult daughter and we had a wonderful time. We arrived early so avoided the crowds of children that arrived later. We had a ride on the",
          "Travelling with family and gran children we were hopeful of something magical. Alas it did not live up to expectations. We went for a day and had around 6 hours on sight. It tool nearly an hour to check in coats and suit up. Seeing the queue for Santa - a wait time of around",
          "Brilliantly well designed park with a bit of everything. Great fun for the kids who at the end of the afternoon did not want to leave. Easy to get to b the Santa Express bus from downtown. Food at the eatery was sufficiently varied to satisfy two demanding children and the",
          "We visited Santapark with my 9 year old granddaughter and it was better than I expected. It was good to be in a cave as we could take our heavy winter coats off and it was nice and warm. There were lots of things to do such as gingerbread decorating, arts and crafts, a train",
          "We booked our holiday through TUI to Lapland on 5th December and Santa park was one of the first places we visited. We had 3 young children and had a fantastic day. Children were able to participate it lots of different activities such as elf school, gingerbread decorating,",
          "Reason of the bad weather condition, we decided to visit Santa Park. It was a very good decision. This cave built up to children. Every corner has some surprises to kids. Ice sculptures, Santa factory railway, Santa's Post Office, Elf School, and of course Santa Claus are",
          "This place is very expensive just to enter It's actually for kids Don't waste your time here there are better places to go",
          "We went to Santa Park on 8/12/18 for the day with our 5 year old daughter as part of a TUI day trip. We were there for around 4 hours. Everything had massive queues, making it impossible to actually enjoy the day or do most of the actives. All the time was spent queuing. In",
          "There\u2019s no doubt my 5 year old had a good day but this wasn\u2019t the \u2018magical\u2019 place I was expecting. The outside activities were ok but 40 seconds on a husky sleigh and 4 minutes on a reindeer ride weren\u2019t exactly the image that\u2019s portrayed. Santa and the elves were good in",
          "Not a bad price to get in and our ticket was valid for 2 days - though the day was enough to see and do everything. The staff were super helpful and nice and spoke a bunch of languages to cater to everyone. Food was a little pricy but nothing unusual for the town in question.",
          "My husband & I and our 8 year old daughter arrived at 10 am opening. She got to decorate the gingerbread cookie (\u20ac2 for cookie), we took a 10 minute trade ride through elf workshop, went to Elf school (15 minutes & everyone gets a diploma \ud83d\ude02 I first class at 11 am and last the",
          "We went here as a family of four with my 15 years old and 9 years old daughters yesterday with TUI day tour from Dublin. The 3 hours trip went well, chartered exclusively for TUI costumers. There were children singing x-mas songs on our way to Rovaniemi, free food( breakfast",
          "This place IS magical. Not only do you meet the REAL SANTA but it\u2019s underground in a mountain so even if you look on google earth you can\u2019t see his factory or elves houses (incase your child has searched for Santa online as mins have) you start by going down a slope and taking",
          "This was a disappointment we had looked forward to for so long to see the magical home of Santa. What a let down, the Santa experience never happened you were led into a queue through a door and into Santa who ushered the kids to sit down, an elf rushed in handed Santa two",
          "But! There is NO lockers to lock in bags, jackets and other things. You have to carry your stuff around. There is only hooks. Otherwise it is great! Very cosy christmas feeling eveywere! Great staff with so much kindness. The Santa (5/12-18) was wonderful! He took time to talk",
          "Can\u2019t say enough about it! Magical from start to finish for small people! We loved it! Food average, alcohol in cans which is not great but that\u2019s not what it\u2019s for. The play area was fabulous. The train was utterly magic! We loved it!",
          "The concept is great if you want to see lots of Christmas activities BUT don\u2019t use this for a magical Santa visit. We queued for nearly 2 hours to be rushed through. Santa asked the kids names then told them to sit down ready for their photos taken, which by the way will cost",
          "Quite expensive for what you actually end up with access to. The initial appearance is pretty cool, everything inside looks lovely and the staff were all friendly and focused on pleading the kids, but there are only a handful of things to do once you're in, aside from wandering",
          "Cost \u20ac155 to get in for a family of 4 children and two adults. Booked online through there website as it was cheaper. It was full of festive fun elves dressed up, Xmas music, shows, loads to do. It was the best thing about my holiday",
          "My husband and I are older and found little to do for our age. They have a nice indoor play area where it is a good place to let little ones run off some excess energy. There are also crafts available to encourage their creativity. We really enjoyed the acrobatic show. The",
          "We spent two days at SantaPark this past week -your ticket is good for two consecutive days. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and there was so much to do! The entire park is inside, so you can check your warm clothes at the door and move jacket/snow attire free throughout the",
          "Magical day spent at Santa Park. Loads to do. Particularly enjoyed the Elf School. The also put on a lovely show with some amazing moves! A nice buffet lunch is available which was reasonably priced for Rovaniemi!. Kids loved it",
          "I went there the day of the opening so I could enter for free but the normal ticket is 34\u20ac (if I don\u2019t remember wrong) which I think it\u2019s too expensive for what you get inside. There are few souvenir shops, some thematic rooms (not too many though) and you can ride in a train.",
          "Came here as part of a day excursion. It's a great place for young children, to feel like they're at the real workshops. You can decorate cakes and visit Santa. Sadly though, the only thing for older kids and adults is the ice bar, which is good for a non-alcoholic drink from an",
          "Good to spend a few hours out of the biting cold. Same activities largely as Joulukka (although more here) so not necessary to do both. Children\u2019s play area is great for some inside activity :)",
          "It was really nice. I do recommend this. The elfs are so nice and perky. The experience was great and it felt like Christmas.",
          "This is what Christmas is all about. As it\u2019s underground you don\u2019t have the problem of no snow, it\u2019s always Christmas. Two adults and a teenager spent two and a half hours here, with younger ones it could be a lot longer. Most of the sections are based around a circle. I",
          "Really nice experience even if it\u2019s summertime. Our teenagers was a little to old but they enjoyed the visit also. The entrance in to the mountain is exciting and you really get a good christmas feeling. The acrobatic elf show was fantastic. The staff (santas elfs) are really",
          "Since I was coming so close to the Arctic Circle, I knew I wanted to visit Santa. I\u2019m glad I saw the info about both Santa Park and Santa Village, because the is hands above the best of the two. I felt I got fairly good value for my 15 euros per adult. I especially felt the",
          "We went to Santa Park during a heat wave in Finland. Since Santa Park is underground and air conditioned, it was perfect! The ice sculptures were wonderful and the cold room made it even better. We didn't know what to expect from the show but were delighted with the",
          "We took a short bus trip from the town to the village. The village has everything for Christmas and is particularly suitable for children. We visited and spoke to Santa Claus and arranged to have Christmas cards sent to grandchildren for Christmas 2017.",
          "I highly recommend Rovaniemi and the Santa Park if you want to experience a really cute tourist village, neat souvenirs, arctic circle, sledding, reindeer rides, snowmobile rides, and dog sled driving. Great for kids, parents, tweens and teens.",
          "Make sure to send postcard from here! Worth the money to get the official Santa Claus stamp sent to your friends and family!",
          "I would give the elves 5 stars. They are friendly, helpful and smile all the time. Their singing and dancing at the airport was entertaining. However, I have to provide the following negative points: 1) the Santa had a fake beard. My kids figured it out straightaway. The magical",
          "Great fun at Santa Park. The kids got to graduate from elves school and we watched the elves show. Ice everywhere! The only downside was the queues for the drinks were huge and quite a bit of a wait. Magical for the kids though",
          "Made a special trip to see the park only to find that it is closed until June 25th. I was not the only one that didn't know the park was closed. When I was returning to the car I met 3 other couples walking to the door. They were upset also.",
          "We visited Santa Park as part of the TUI holiday package, it only allowed us around a 2-3 hour stay there, which really wasn\u2019t enough time to enjoy everything it has to offer. It\u2019s all under ground, which is a little difficult to contemplate if you have t been ! There are lots",
          "Meant primarily for children, this is another overpriced experience. They should have included many more interesting activities for the bomb that they charge.",
          "This activity is every child\u2019s dream come true!! Every child who believes in Santa MUST do this activity before they grow up and the magic fades away. I would highly recommend obtaining a VIP pass, again our Tour guide sorted this out for us and our children were escorted by an",
          "It's underground...a park underneath the surface...you will hear wolves are howling at the entrance , and you will have to walk down until you see the main gate. It's not very big, but you spend a great time. This place is runned by elves, with pointy noses and ears.....and of",
          "This facility offers an ice sculpture exhibit and excellent food. Loved the reindeer meat! This facility is also an underground shelter as well as restaurant and tourist attraction. Friendly and accommodating staff.",
          "Even if is recommended mostly for kids, we wanted to enjoy this attraction and we were very disappointed to find it close at beginning of February when the area is still full of tourists and is still winter!",
          "We arrived today after a 3 hour ride to find the park closed. It was quite the disappointment. If we read the sign correctly it will be closed for the next few months.",
          "Santa Park is inside Santa village. We enjoyed the park. Met Santa, have lot of photographs. There is souveinier shop for tourists.",
          "Christmas 2017 saw our family go to Rovaniemi. Santa Park is another attraction well worth the visit. Its a fully indoor, underground attraction that offers a more hands on day with Elf School and Elf Show well worth seeing. Enjoy making ginger bread cookies and santa",
          "Nice but old style place. They should upgrade the santa mailing pipe to make it more attractive. The elves is kind and friendly, but some new tech in this place will give younger generation more exciting",
          "Santa Park is a great place to visit with kids but for adults, too. It is build with care to amuse. There you can meet Santa himself, participate in Elf school, decorate ginger breads and drive magic train through Santa\u00b4s world.",
          "Wow, this place is underground! A long way underground too, don't let this put you off, you don't realise you are! Rooms available to hang your snow suits up, just choose a peg and remember your number, really simple affective system as you really don't need you snow clothes on",
          "Was a funy visit to Santa Clauss. All the staff really nice and Santa Claus speak a little bit of Spanish and Portuguese. I think is well maded.",
          "A beautiful indoor place with plenty of activities for young kids such as cooking,making Christmas cards, taking a photo with Santa and a lot more. Don\u2019t miss the elf show!!! Souvenir shops, a playground, a restaurant.",
          "We visited with our 10 year old after a disastrous day at Santa claus village 3 days before christmas. The place is absolutely magical. The interaction of the elves with the kids was fantastic. It was very quiet- a bit busier would have made it better. But no queues for santa (",
          "It was lovely going into SantaPark and going under the Arctic Circle line. Nice and warm inside - especially after the sub zero temperatures outside. As we went after Christmas it was quiet and we were able to go into the ice room, train and see Santa and the Elf Show in just",
          "My family and I (2 adults and 2 children age 7 and nearky 4) visited SantaPark as a day trip with TUI on 2nd December. We flew from Manchester leaving at 7am, the flight was around 2 3/4 hours and actually the flight itself went fairly quickly as we were brought breakfast and",
          "Small kids will surely enjoy this place and find a lot of interesting adventures, entertainments and lessons",
          "This place is inside, there\u2019s a show on at set times which you can watch with acrobats etc if the kids don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 it they can play in the play area while you watch. Easy to navigate around just follow the path. Lots to see on the way round.. different experience to Santa Claus",
          "You will need to spend at least a day her or a good 5/6 hours to do all activities. Indoors so nice and warm. But absolutely recommend for children. Elf school was the best.",
          "It is the most uninteresting thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life for such price. Total waste of money. For price of the ticket of Disneyland or Port Aventura you receive tinny underground, where you can see few elves, visit cafe and buy some common souvenirs. All the entertainment",
          "Coming straight from Santa Claus Village... You will pay 100\u20ac entrance fee for the privilege of visiting a few shops with exorbitant prices, watching a poor malabar show by the elves and being asked to pay more for the cookies if you want to join the decorating party. Oh, I",
          "Kids liked every single minute spent in Santa park. From decorating gingerbread coockies to walking among the ice sculptures, from going by train through the elves kingdom to fun in the Elves school. Lots of nice emotions!",
          "Nice amusment park for kids. Nothing extrodinary but young children will like it. Half a day will do to visit and experiance all the park.",
          "Have not been much impressed as there activities seemed only for little age my kid was 8 and it was just fun, staff seemed a bit unsure how to communicate with kids including Santa, only one elf came to chat with my soon and made a conversation, slightly disappointed",
          "Nice place to take the kids. The elves are fantastic. The elf show was my favourite. They put on a very good show. There is a nice play area for kids while you eat.",
          "If you want to waste time go otherwise avoid to spend 33 euro adult and 27,5 euro child. Is dark is expensive and there are few attraction included into the ticket",
          "As we were in Rovaniemi we thought about spending a day in Santa Park. Beside the fact that it is underground and therefore with good temperature, it is a total waste of time. Only 2-3 things to do beside the cafeteria and crowded... a better definition would be Santa",
          "Executive Summary: This day trip flying from Gatwick to Rovaniemi was poor value for money. My advice is save your money, avoid package deals and arrange it yourself. Staying overnight is a must in order to fit everything in. Flights and transfers meant we arrived at the park",
          "We travelled with TUI on 2nd December for a day trip. Sadly the plane was 45mins delayed on landing in Lapland, which meant less time in the Santa Park. As soon as we arrived we did all the outdoor activities as well as have fun in the snow. The snow suits, footwear and gloves",
          "The ticket price is bit expensive given the size of the themepark. However, unlike what most said, I think the lunch buffet (17\u20ac) there is worth the money. I like the elf show as well.",
          "Santapark is superb! Elves are amazing with the kids. The Elf show is excellent and kept my 3 year old glued on them for 30 mins. The underground location is amazing and all locations within Santapark are worth a visit. Our tour operator TUI only gave you 90 mins but we opted to",
          "This place is brilliant for kids, lots to do and to keep the little ones entertained. We only had about 2 hours here so was a little gutted not to have stayed longer. Highly recommended the show it's amazing. Lots of things to do, ride on a train, decorate gingerbread, go to elf",
          "Nice way to spend a day, however a bit expensive for what it has to offer. The ticket is valid for two consecutive days, but after a few hours the kids ( ages three to seven) completed all the activities. The elf school was fun, and the train ride was definetly the favourite.",
          "Visited here not knowing what to expect. Didn\u2019t need ur coat/snowsuit so either had to leave unattended or carry with u as it was so warm. Long queues for everything which is boring for young kids, we went to elf school and decorated a gingerbread heart but the queue for the",
          "We went to santa park not knowing what to expect (given mix of reviews) and found it ok, but a little confusing. The whole place is under ground, there is a cloak room, but no need to bring ski wear. The ice room is OK, but I preferred the one at snowman world at Santa village.",
          "We went on Christmas Day due to the suggestion of our concierge, and this was the worst Christmas experience possible. It was tacky (the ride is horrific), run down, very fake and geared towards children under 3 years old exclusively. I can\u2019t believe they get away with this! It",
          "It took hours to go through all attractions there. I loved elf\u2019s school the most. Also Santa\u2019s facebook was lovely. And the icebar was so interesting. Kids loved it there. I would go again if should take a trip to Lapland.",
          "I found a variety of reviews and decided to go anyway. I went with 2 adults and 3 big teenagers (18,16 & 13). Firstly, this place is NOT Santa Claus Village. They are two very different places sperated by about 5km. As opposed to Santa Claus Village, Santa Park is indoors.",
          "This place is nice. Elves were so friendly. You will feel young visiting this place. The entrance fee \u20ac33 is for 2 consecutive days,so u can always comeback the next day. You will meet Santa in his office and send post cards from the Post Office. Do not forget to buy the",
          "Went with my wife. Mostly targeted at children but a nice half day activity for adults looking to see some Christmas themed things",
          "Visited Santa Park on the Tui Lapland trip. The facilities and activities are great for young children however the Tui trip could do with spending another hour at the park to allow guests to get the most out of it as per other reviews it was a bit rushed and we didn't see",
          "Santa Park does not disappoint at all! You walk into a cave leading underground and you are greeted by friendly Elfs ! It only gets better from there as you have Santa's Post Office and a gingerbread making area. There is a show featuring more elves , Elf school is a definite",
          "Go early and there are no q s anywhere. 10 am open see Santa. Then 11 elf school then 12 magic show then ice and done. If you mess up the timings it takes 3 times longer. Hotel next door is great.",
          "We were two adults visiting Santapark. Many of the activities are definitely for children, but it is overall a nice, though pricey experience. Santa\u2019s helpers school (tonttukoulu) is fun for all and the show that runs at the stage is very nice. Ice sculptures are literally",
          "don\u00b4t miss this opportunity to have different experiencies in a warm environment...its not easy to have that!!! you have a lot to do and shop...don\u00b4t miss the elf show, santa claus letter, gengibre cookies, artic arts, angry birds play ground, the old post office, the fun sleigh",
          "it was a rushed TUI event , there for 1 hr ... show , ice bar and gingerbread stuff that was it .if we had more time, may have been better , but its crammed in and very busy !",
          "It is a great place for kids. It was underground, which was good to keep the cold at bay. There wasn\u2019t as much to do as we thought. The ice sculptures and ice bar were terrific.",
          "This is a glorified expensive shopping area. Kids can decorate gingerbread men. We did see a short show that was excellent. don't worry if you miss this park.",
          "My three children (ages 5, 11, 11) had a good time here. There's a good amount of small activities for the children - crafts, elf school, gingerbread cookie decorating (buy your cookie and then use the decorations they provide), indoor playground, etc. There's also a room of",
          "As others have said it\u2019s NOT Disney but still a great experience for the kids. We took our 2 grandchildren on a day visit with Thomson, the staff on our flight were great and could not be faulted, they put on a great show for the kids and made the flight more bearable. Arrival",
          "We went with TUI with 6 adults and 2 children. From the flight where there were Christmas carols, coloring competitions and other activities it was brilliant. We arrived just before 1pm, We had a 30 minute wait to see Santa, the children really enjoyed it you get around a 5",
          "This is a cute place to visit if you have kids and is the place to \u2018do\u2019 rather than Santa Village which is for shopping really. There are 5/6 things to do - Elf school, Elf show, Magic Train, Bakery with cookie decorating, Ice sculptures, Santa\u2019s post office. With Tui trip you",
          "We were here at the beginning of December, on a day trip with TUI. Firstly on arrival there is a cloakroom to leave your big coats etc just a tip it\u2019s really warm around the village so dressing in normal clothes is ample, then put any thermals on before you go outside. We were",
          "Well the day trip began with a great flight with tui to visit this magical place,this is a second visit to lapland last time santa village ,short coach trip to the park then the magic begins,you walk through the cave and securely locking your personal belongings away then you",
          "For one it\u2019s all indoors so to be able to walk around in normal clothing is great alone. My young boys enjoyed there visit here. Indoor play area. Train sleigh ride. Even elf school. We did not see santa here because they had already seen him in santa village and I did not want",
          "We (myself, partner and 2 kids aged 4 and 6) visited for two days in Dec 2017. We totally filled each day by participating in the various 'included' activities and watching the fabulous elf show. This is a first class experience not to be missed. It is hard not to get into the",
          "After reading some of the reviews we were a bit scared about how this place would be, but we selected it instead of the Santa Village because we could spend almost the whole day and covered, so weather wouldn't be a problem. We were very happy with the decision. The place is",
          "I think this place was a waste of a day for me as the kids are over 10. I think I will be a good day for the very young. Expensive though.",
          "This is a must for families with children. The first day we visited the Santa Claus Village which was nice but the magic feeling and attention paid to details made the visit in Santa Park an unforgettable experience. The entrance is not cheap but clearly value for money as all",
          "You can find a show in specific time.And the most important think you can have selfie with Santa Claus free~Also there is a Elf school!after the school you are the qualified Elf",
          "We were five adults and three children age 12,8and4. After visiting Santa\u2019s village in the morning we visited Santa\u2019s park a five minute drive.

          "Set underground you are welcomed by elves as you go in. There is a place to leave your outdoor clothing as it is very warm inside. We visited as part of a package tour with TUI and had 2 hours there. There is an Angry birds soft play area that my 3 year old grandson enjoyed. We",
          "We spent 5 hours at this amazing place with our 6 year old. He loved it and there was lots of activities to occupy us. The show was very high standard and much better than expected with a great display of aerial and circus skills. Food was not great but was adequate...After the",
          "It's a shame, my wife is a \"big kid\" and loves Santa, in fact that is the ONLY reason why we visited Rovaniemi. The Santa Village, we enjoyed walking around, and looking at the various shops. However, when you pay $66 Euros to get in somewhere, you expect it to be pretty",
          "very welcoming staff.. you need to have leisure time of at least 4-5 hours to enjoy ride, meeting with santa, post & make greeting cards, ginger biscuits preparation , watch some classic shows",

          "I took my granddaughter on Saturday 2 DECEMBER to santapark and it was worth every penny just to see her face,I paid just over \u00a31000 for the day didn't even think of the time difference ,our flight was at 07.00 from Exeter and it was delayed in flight so we arrive at 10.45 in",
          "SantaPark is quite fun and we loved that it's entirely inside! The elves were friendly and it wasn't very busy in the middle of the week in November.",
          "We took our 7-year old son here, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. The details were well thought out - the elves were in character throughout the park. It is about 4-5 hours of activity to do everything. We arrive early, it was not crowded. They have a show and lunch buffet.",
          "Having only a long weekend in Rovaniemi, I wasn\u2019t sure where to spend time as I wanted to be sure we packed all the magic we could into our visit. This was a brilliant choice! We entered SantaPark through a dimly-lit tunnel into the vast underground labyrinth that was SantaPark.",
          "We visited the santa park as we\u2019re staying next door and our room wasn\u2019t ready. It\u2019s all indoors, pay on the door and then most of the activities are included . This is great if you have really tiny ones that can\u2019t walk around outdoors for hours. It\u2019s ok, there are better santa",
          "Its really a tourist area. Expensive ride of reindeer and husky. Other than that, nothing much to see.",
          "Only half a day out but it was magical. Very authentic and the children enjoyed all the activities. They went on the ride and made cookies and did the elf show then visited the elf.workshop and saw the ice bar. Really glad we went was so lovely for.the children .",
          "There are lots of \"people\" (elves) taking care of you and they are really enjoying the job and so can you enjoy the magical atmosphere. You can undergo the arctic circle, visit ice chamber, travel through a land of elves by a train or even train to be an elf. The cherry on the",
          "Yes, it is hidden, really. Not easy to find, and the road up to the park is not really giving the impression of an operational place. But, what a surprise we got when we came there. Starting with the entry area, and from there on we were submerged into another underworld full of",
          "I thought this was an amusement park like Linnanm\u00e4ki. I was suprised how well elves made us feel welcome! No rides, more elf school and cincerbread decorations. Works with toddlers. Thank you, this was a high light of our trip! Keep on beeing nice. Entrance is bit spooky for",
          "It's a great place to feel child again. Maybe it is very commercial but sometimes it is needed. Everywhere are Santa's Elves, they are of course very helpful. There is a lot of activities for small and the older children can also take a part in them. You can feel Christmas even",
          "OMG..... this place is amazing. Brings tears of Christmas joy to my eyes thinking about it. Send post cards back to Australia from the North Pole.....(they arrived about 3 weeks later). Photos with Santa, shows, arts and craft activities for the younger ones and much more.",
          "The staff were wonderful and got into character playing elves. They had a few great things for kids to do - elf school, playground, train, elf concert, Santa, gingerbread men, meet the Snow Princess. Unfortunately the food, drinks, additionals are expensive. I felt Santa was",
          "Arrived plane was fun, staff dressed as elves. It was soooo cold, but the park is underground and warm. Leave coats but I would take your own gloves, scarves and hat if you have decent ones because in the outdoor area, which is like a campsite, your children's hand will freeze",
          "The snow experience outside is amazing, they provide all clothing and boots, so absolutely perfect. Watch out for the attacking reindeer though :-)",
          "What an amazing place, we really got involved in all the activities. We are in our 30's but this didn't stop us. Great idea to leave your coat in the cloakroom area as it gets really hot in there.",
          "Impressively underground, the caverns alone make this place worth seeing. For children older than ten years this might be a bit too cute. The elves that walk around stay very much in role and the activities are centred around the myth of Father Christmas and DIY activities.",
          "This was a pretty magical day spent at the Arctic Circle as part of a package with Thomson. The park in a deep underground grotto and certainly feels 'magical'. My little one (8 years old) thoroughly enjoyed the day. Meeting Santa is very rushed and you have about a minute",
          "You enter a huge cave in the cliff side and decend underground in to santa park. Here you can go to elf school, go on a ride, see an elf show, visit shops, visit Father Christmas and walk under the Arctic Circle line which is very cool! It as nearly everything in Rovaniemi",
          "A nice place to visit especially if you would like to feel and see that Santa Claus is real ;) You can even send a postcard in his post office.",
          "It was nice & sunny so just walked around in the snow. Mostly souvenir shops which I enjoyed browsing through but did not shop. Also an outlet there - kitchen stuff mostly. Go into Santa's office for a Christmas feel. Recommended especially for children. There is also a Santa",
          "The only thing to see is the reindeer, but go see them anywere else. The entire complex was nothing but souvenirs shops and it was very crowded and unpleasent.",
          "My son and I were a little disappointed with the Santa Claus village so paid around 40 euros to come here afterwards and were so glad we did. Loads to do for children and a much better Santa that didn't rush the children out of the door.",
          "This is the ultimate kids outing, tons of snow, sleds a plenty, really friendly and helpful happy elves, full of fun and laughter and well switched on to kids imaginations. Open air wood fires and hot berry juice and ginger biscuits in plentiful supply, elf school is great fun.",
          "We arrived expecting to spend a full day but 4 hrs max is enough, we watched a very child orientated show which was good fun for all, had a shot in the ice bar looking at all the sculptures. A ride on an indoor sledge and ripped off visiting santa. Worth a visit as your 50 m",
          "There are not enough words to describe our amazing experience at Santa Park. Everyone from the elves to the staff members made the visit magic. The elf school was amazing and offered an interactive experience of magic at its best. The same goes for the astounding ice bar, post",
          "Visited Santa Park on Friday. I was a bit concerned initially as my youngest daughter was quite scared, because they play extremely scary howling wolves throughout the cave entrance and she was petrified. I found this quite peculiar- I would have expected some kind of happy",
          "As two adults we did wonder want to expect... however, if you go with the flow and get into the spirit you'll have a blast. Grab a shot in the Ice Bar out of an ice glass, go under the arctic circle and watch the show. All good fun!",
          "This is an expensive park, but when in Rovaniemi you have to see Santa! Elves and snow maidens are present too! There is an Angry birds playground, a small ride, small crafts, and cookie decorating. It is Underground, the entrance impressed my kids.",
          "We were taken here as part of our daytrip with Thomsons. Personally I thought it was excellent and for the kids worth every penny I paid. We went to elf school first which I thought was excellently done and believable for the children..they were mesmerised. We were told to do",
          "We have visited Santa Park four times in the past 10 years, both with children and without. Once thing we have noticed over the years is that it's constantly declining and old nice things which get out of function or broken are nor replaced or replaced with much poorer",
          "If you expect too much, you will not be able to enjoy it even if it is made perfectly! We liked this place because all it was done with love. My child liked it, and I again felt myself a child.. The organizers tried to create the interiors, sounds and the atmosphere of magic",
          "The first place in Rovaniemi that you should visit while you are here with kids during Christmass and New Year hollidays. Very nice show, attractions, and in general all the activities should be attended.",
          "Unusual and dramatic building, really only for small kids, elves are great characters, elf school was the best show. Santa was a grumpy and aggressive toward us and his helpers which was poor form. Overall worth visiting, but surprisongly little time required if no long queues",
          "Well we came with high hopes to end our 2nd Lapland trip with our two girls aged 8 and 11. The whole thing looks dated and in need of investment. Santa was ' feeding the reindeer ' ( you'd think they would have more than one, given most kids are there to see him ) The train",
          "Went to santa park today! And yay! It was great, there weren't too many people and we got to finish almost every other attraction in a speedy manner. Staff and service was good. Wrote some postcards, had lunch there. Decorated a ginger bread at a minimum cost and made mini",
          "Visited the santa park on Xmas eve as part of our packaged holiday with thomson. Santa park is amazing for the whole family. We all graduated from elf school which was so funny the elves English was amazing and they spoke so funny. We also got to decorate a ginger biscuits at",
          "A Second World War bunker used as a Santa Claus factory is, at least, very weird! A friend told me that was not very interesting, so I kept my expectations very low. However in our last day we had nothing to do, and thought why not? We bought tickets and went at 10am (opening",
          "Fantastic day out though because of the 2 hour time difference and 3 hour flight each way the day is pretty action packed! Plenty to do in this underground Santa residence - a visit with the man himself, elf school, gingerbread decoration, train ride, shows, ice gallery/bar,",
          "I spent a wonderful few hours here - on my own! I attended elf school, learnt calligraphy, decorated gingerbread, met Santa, went on an enchanting train ride, had a drink from an ice cup with the snow queen and watched a very entertaining elf show! Truly a wonderful Christmas",
          "Unfortunate it was nothing special. I felt like we totally wasted EUR 100 for the entrance. It can be much better. Train ride didn't even have Christmas music playing and soooo boring, almost embarrassing. Calligraphy School is ink and plastic \"feathers \" laying around, ice",

          "We travelled on 10th December & have to say that although it was an expensive trip it certainly was a lovely experience for the family. Upon arrival we were issued with colour passes for a time slot to see Santa, luckily we were the first coach to arrive so had the first hour",
          "I have to say this was a really lovely experience. It takes you deep down into the caves where the elves make a magical experience for the children. Plenty of activities for the young and old to do and plenty of food on offer. Definitely worth a visit.",

          "This was a great place to get out of the cold for a while. Admittedly was a bit busy and theme park-ish, but nonetheless was great to graduate from Elf School, decorate gingerbread men, ride the Santa train, meet the man himself and buy a professional photo. Visited as part of",
          "Had a great time in this magical place, in fact we've spent nearly half a day. The train and the show are both fantastic. It was also nice meeting Father Christmas and taking pics in the ice bar. This park is worth a visit so don't let the negative reviews influence you.",
          "Well!!!!! What an adventure from start to finish. Thomson pulled out all the stops an amazing holiday. Day 1. On arrival greeted with elves and reps spreading Christmas cheer, taken to get our thermals. The rest of the day for exploring we hired the kids sledges \u00a310 euro at",

          "Disappointingly, we only had about 1.5hrs here.... it needs 3 or 4 on a fairly busy day. The entrance is impressive - very Disney-like. Elf School is a must - gets busy, so go there first. Elf Show - very acrobatic and worthy of watching. Angry Birds play area is small",
          "Hi I'm just back from the santa clause village in Rovantemi in the Arctic circle. [Day trip) I can honestly say I just thought it OK, the best part was the snow activities, which I would have liked more time to enjoy. What is going on in the main building could be catered for at",

          "We went in December 2005 and returned in 2014 with young children. Vastly improved. Magical place. The train ride was magical. Decorating gingerbread men was great, so atmospheric. The sift play is wicked. Fantastic... a place where memories are made!",

          "The Santa we met was fun. I am not sure how many Santa grandfathers are there, but my kids enjoyed that Santa :-)",
          "It's 33 euros per adult to go here but worth the money. It's a separate place from the village (which is what I was first confused about reading through the information miles away) but it made sense when I arrived. At the park you can visit Santa, participate in Elf school,",
          "While staying in Rovaniemi we have spent one full day in Santapark. The entrance is a little bit overpriced but there are lot of activities there: ice figures, Elf school, Santa's train and many more. Children will remain impressed. Adults will remain satisfied. I recommend for",

          "This place is an underground play centre. Well there is a small angry birds area for playing. You can visit Santa, go on a small train ride, decorate a gingerbread and decorate an elf. There is elf school and a show (no speaking due to multilple) languages. The ticket lets",
          "From the moment we arrived we were caught up in the magic of meeting the real Father Christmas. Knowing that we would be given 'outside clothing' we didn't bother with coats so we didn't need to check them in; and headed straight outside to the Reindeer and Husky Taster",
          "Our children loved this, yes its commercialised, but who cares!! Its christmas. The excitement that this place is filled with money can not buy. My children loved Elf School, if was wonderful and on graduation they received their very own Elf Hat. They decorated cookies in",
          "Till I visit Rovaniemi and all the attractions all around I did not find any reason to leave my house during winter except for skiing. The Husky trips, Santa's Office,the Reindeer trip, the snowmobile trips for adults and kids, restaurants, everything made for me a perfect",

          "We visited this place 2 times during our few days stay in Rovaniemi. Easily accessible by public bus Nr 8 (2 adults + 1 child, one way - 9.80 Euro). Our daughter loved the place. Amongst different activities the crafting Santa heads was her favorite. We spent few hours in total",

          "This place is advertised as one of main atractions in Rovaniemi. It is interesting for children aged 4-8, but otherwise quite boring, especially taking into account steep price (and add-ons on every step) you have to pay for maximum 2 hours it takes. Elf school is really boring,",
          "Santa Park is a great attraction for children and can be nice for adults. It offers a great number of activities that people can actually do, like decoration of cookies and making of handcraft. Also when you meet Santa, unlike Santa Claus Village, you can take pictures with your",

          "So this was an actual mine underground. Very nice, very spaceus and well done. You might need half a day to enjoy it fully and do all the activities. The good thing is that when you buy the ticket It is valid for 2 days. So it is great to combine half a day here and half a day",
          "Rovaniemi is my home town and I really enjoy to visit SantaPark occasionally. The atmosphere is just perfect and it always make me feel like christmas. It's a bit pricey, but worth of it if you like christmas. Area is not huge but there is few attractions specially for younger",

          "The approach to the venue is gorgeous with lots of lights and trees leading to a huge \"cave entrance\" with colourfully lit tunnels leading to a welcome from elves , pixies and snow fairies. The train into santas workshops is a must, apparently the elf school is also worth seeing",
          "Now I still miss the original Santa Park with Candle making etc. but we do enjoy visiting this place with Mrs Santa and her Gingerbread decorating and the Elf School is fantastic. The ice sculptures etc are great. Feel it is a little over priced for what it is as feel something",

        "wiki": "Rovaniemi (Finnish: [\u02c8ro\u028b\u0251niemi] (listen)) is a city and municipality of Finland. It is the administrative capital and commercial centre of Finland's northernmost province, Lapland. It is situated about 6 kilometres (4 miles) south of the Arctic Circle and is between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korkalovaara, at the confluence of the river Kemijoki and its tributary, the Ounasjoki. \nThe city and the surrounding Rovaniemen maalaiskunta (Rural municipality of Rovaniemi) were consolidated into a single entity on 1 January 2006. The resulting city of Rovaniemi is considered the largest city in all of Europe by land area, because the defined limits of the city proper extend far beyond the actual urban area.Rovaniemi municipality has an approximate population of 63,000. The urban area of Rovaniemi has a population of 53 361, in an area of 59,77 km\u00b2. Rovaniemi is a unilingual Finnish-speaking municipality and, uncommonly for larger Finnish towns, it is also known by its Finnish name and spelling in the Swedish language.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe rova part in the name Rovaniemi has often been considered to be of Saamic origin, as roavve in Saami denotes a forested ridge or hill or the site of an old forest fire. In Southern Saami dialects, however, rova means a heap of stones, a rock or a group of rocks in a stretch of rapids or even a sauna stove. The niemi part of the name means \"cape\".\nNames in the Samic languages include Inari Sami: Ru\u00e1vinjarg\u00e2, Northern Sami: Roavenj\u00e1rga and Roavvenj\u00e1rga and Skolt Sami: Ru\u00e4\u02cavnjargg.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeriodic clearance of new land for agriculture and the practise of slash-and-burn cultivation began around 750\u2013530 BC. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travellers from Karelia in the east, H\u00e4me in the south and the Arctic Ocean coast in the north must have come there from 500 AD onwards. The Sami are considered to be Lapland's most indigenous existing population.\nIt is first mentioned by name in official documents in 1453, existing effectively as a set of small villages whose inhabitants earned their living mainly in agriculture and animal husbandry\u2014with fishing and hunting the most important offshoots.The exploitation of Lapland's natural resources in the 1800s boosted Rovaniemi's growth. Extensive logging sites and gold fever attracted thousands of people to Lapland. As the mining of natural resources was increased, Rovaniemi became the business centre of the province of Lapland.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring the Second World War, Finland signed the Moscow Armistice and found itself involved in the Lapland War with its former German ally. Retreating German forces utilised scorched earth tactics, and though initially German General Lothar Rendulic ordered only the public buildings in Rovaniemi to be destroyed, on 13 October 1944 the German army received orders to destroy all the buildings in Rovaniemi, only excluding hospitals and houses where inhabitants were present. While the German rear guard was going about the destruction, an ammunition train in Rovaniemi station exploded and set fire to the wooden houses of the town. The German troops suffered many casualties, mainly from glass splinters. A Finnish commando unit claimed to have blown up the ammunition train and may well have been the primary cause of the town's ruin. The cause was then unknown and generally assumed to be the deliberate intent of Rendulic. During these hostilities 90% of all the buildings in Rovaniemi were destroyed. There is a German cemetery 19 km from Rovaniemi where soldiers killed fighting in Lapland during the war are buried.\nAlthough there has been continuous human settlement in the Rovaniemi area since at least the Stone Age, few of the buildings date back before 1944 since most of the city was destroyed during WWII. When the city was rebuilt, it was designed with input by famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, who planned the city's footprint in the shape of a reindeer's head, with the city roads forming the antlers, and the local stadium as the reindeer's eye.\n\n\n== Modern day ==\n\nSince Rovaniemi is the capital of the region of Lapland, many government institutions have their offices there. About 10,000 of the inhabitants are students. Rovaniemi is home to not only the University of Lapland but also the Lapland University of Applied Sciences (formerly known as the Rovaniemi Polytechnic), which comprises institutes of information and traditional technology, business, health and social care, culinary studies, forestry, rural studies, and sports. Local newspapers include the Lapin Kansa, Uusi Rovaniemi and Lappilainen.\nRovaniemi's most prominent landmarks include the J\u00e4tk\u00e4nkynttil\u00e4 bridge with its eternal flame over the Kemijoki river, the Arktikum Science Museum which rises out of the bank of the Ounasjoki river, the Rovaniemi Town Hall, the Lappia House (which serves as a theatre, concert hall, and congress centre), and the library. The last three mentioned buildings are designed by the famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. The Arktikum Science Museum is a comprehensive museum of Finland's, and the world's, Arctic regions.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nBecause of the unspoiled nature of the area and numerous recreational opportunities, tourism is an important industry in Rovaniemi. The city has a number of hotels and restaurants located both in the centre and on the outskirts of the town, hosting over 481,000 visitors in 2013.Rovaniemi is also considered by Finns to be the official home town of Santa Claus. It is home to the Santa Claus Village at the Arctic Circle and SantaPark Arctic World, which is located 8 km (5 mi) north of the centre. \nDirectly across the river from the town is the Ounasvaara ski centre. The top of the Ounasvaara hill bears the site of some of the earliest known human settlements in the area.\nA phenomenon also attracting numerous tourists is the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights. In Finnish Lapland, the number of auroral displays can be as high as 200 a year whereas in southern Finland the number is usually fewer than 20.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVR Group, the Finnish state railway system, operates direct daytime and overnight passenger trains from Rovaniemi Station to Oulu, Tampere, Helsinki and Turku. Diesel-powered passenger trains operated north-east of Rovaniemi to Kemij\u00e4rvi until March 2014, when electrification to Kemij\u00e4rvi was completed. Rovaniemi Airport is located about 10 kilometres (6 mi) north of the Rovaniemi city centre.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDue to its location near the Arctic Circle, Rovaniemi has a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfc) with short, pleasant summers, while the winters are long, cold and snowy. The city lies just south of the 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) mean annual isotherm, but freezing in the soil is very limited even during the winter due to typical heavy snow cover. Its extreme northerly location combined with frequent overcast skies leads to very low levels of sunshine in the winter months; December averages just under six minutes of sunshine daily. Winters are somewhat modified by marine air from the North Atlantic Current that ensures average temperatures are less extreme than expected for an inland area at such a northerly latitude.\nOn 26 April 2019, Rovaniemi recorded its warmest April day on record with 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F).\n\nThe average annual temperature in Rovaniemi is 0.9 \u00b0C (33.6 \u00b0F). Snow stays on the ground 175 days a year on average. The lowest temperature ever recorded at the airport is \u221238.1 \u00b0C (\u221237 \u00b0F), recorded on 28 January 1999. However, on the same day temperatures as cold as -47.5 C were recorded at nearby weather stations.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded is 32.2 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F), recorded on July 18, 2018 at the railway station.Despite the fact that Rovaniemi experiences polar day between 7 June and 6 July (30 days) it does not experience polar night. However, the sun barely gets above the horizon in the winter.\n\n\n== Twin cities ==\nRovaniemi is twinned with:\n Ajka, Hungary\n Alanya, Turkey\n Cadillac, Michigan, United States\n Drvar, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n Grindav\u00edk, Iceland\n Harbin, China\n St. Johann in Tirol, Austria\n Kassel, Germany\n Kiruna, Sweden\n Murmansk, Russia\n Narvik, Norway\n Neustrelitz, Germany\n Olsztyn, Poland\n Veszpr\u00e9m, Hungary\n\n\n== Famous inhabitants ==\n\nJari Tervo, author\nHarri Olli, ski jumper\nwriter Timo K.

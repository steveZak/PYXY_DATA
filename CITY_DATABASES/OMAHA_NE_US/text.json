        "wiki": "Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is a zoo in Omaha, Nebraska, located at 3701 South 10th Street. It can be accessed by I-80. It is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Its mission is conservation, research, recreation, and education. In August 2014, TripAdvisor proclaimed Henry Doorly Zoo the \"world's best zoo\", leading San Diego Zoo and Loro Parque, based on an algorithmic assimilation of millions of reviews for 275 major zoos worldwide.Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is nationally renowned for its leadership in animal conservation and research. Evolving from the public Riverview Park Zoo established in 1894, today the zoo includes several notable exhibits. It features the largest cat complex in North America; \"Kingdoms of the Night\" is the world's largest nocturnal exhibit and indoor swamp; the Lied Jungle is one of the world's largest indoor rainforests, and the \"Desert Dome\" is one of the world's largest indoor deserts, as well as the largest glazed geodesic dome in the world. The zoo is Nebraska's top paid attendance attraction and has welcomed more than 25 million visitors over the past 40 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe zoo originally began in 1894 as Riverview Park Zoo. Four years later, it had over 120 animals. In 1952, the Omaha Zoological Society was created with aims to improve the zoo. In 1963, Margaret Hitchcock Doorly donated $750,000. In doing so, she stipulated that the zoo be renamed in memory of her late husband, Henry Doorly, chairman of the World Publishing Company. Union Pacific helped the zoo lay down 2.5 mi (4.0 km) of track in 1968 with the inaugural run of the Omaha Zoo Railroad made on July 22, 1968.Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium has two rides that circumnavigate the zoo (tram and train), a carousel and the Skyfari, an aerial tram which opened in 2009 and which takes visitors from the Butterfly and Insect Pavilion to the new lion viewing exhibit.\nThe zoo is adjacent to the former site of Rosenblatt Stadium. In 2011, the zoo began developing the land at former Rosenblatt Stadium to become the new parking area and visitor center, leaving a small memorial at the location of home plate. Rosenblatt was replaced by the new TD Ameritrade Park downtown.\n\n\n=== Zoo history timeline ===\nThis is a selected list of when buildings and exhibits were created:\n\n1894: Riverview Park opened.\n1898: The park had a varied animal population of over 120 animals.\n1920s : Gould Dietz donated cat cages.\n1930s : The WPA built cat and bear exhibits.\n1952: The Omaha Zoological Society was organized for the improvement and administration of the zoo.\n1963: Margaret Hitchcock Doorly donated $750,000 to the zoo with the stipulation that the zoo be named after her late husband, Henry Doorly.\n1965: The Omaha Zoological Society was reorganized as a nonprofit organization, and the first phase of the zoo, which included bear grottos, gorilla and orangutan buildings, and Ak-sar-ben Nature Kingdom, was dedicated.\n1968: The inaugural run of Omaha Zoo Railroad was in July, and the Eugene C.

The center has discovered several new species. The world's first in vitro-fertilized (\"test-tube\") gorilla resides at the zoo. The world's first artificially inseminated tiger was born in Omaha in 1991, followed by the world's first artificially inseminated gaur. The original 16,448-square-foot (1,528.1 m2) facility was constructed in 1996.\nIn 2006, it underwent a $6 million expansion which brings the total space to 32,000 sq ft (3,000 m2).The research center focuses on six areas:\n\nEducation and technology transfer\nConservation medicine\nMolecular genetics\nReproductive physiology\nHorticulture\nNutrition\n\n\n=== Mouse lemurs ===\nA study led by Edward Louis, a conservation geneticist at the zoo, identified three new mouse lemurs (Simmons' mouse lemur, Mittermeier's mouse lemur, and Jolly's mouse lemur) with the first named after Lee Simmons, the zoo's director.\n\n\n== Rides and transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railroad ===\n\nThe Omaha Zoo Railroad is a 2.5-mile (4.0 km), 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) narrow gauge train that loops through the zoo.\nThe railroad began operations on July 22, 1968, after the track was laid down by the Union Pacific railroad. The train operates with one of two oil-powered steam locomotives. Riva is about twice as powerful (although is almost 80 years older) as the #119 and is regularly used on weekends when more visitors are present. The #119 is the original locomotive for the zoo. A new diesel locomotive arrived in September 2008.

          "Always enjoy this zoo, great to see updates to displays, hope there are more to come. Wish property was a little more spread out to relieve volumes or people in popular areas",
          "I ranked the Zoo based on the exhibits that were open. Because of Covid, some displays were closed but the ones that were open were excellent, as usual. I made an appointment (per rules during Covid) for early morning and spent the day there. I found extra care being taken to",
          "Lots to see and do! Great way to get out of the house and not think about covid! Lots to see. We spent 3 hours and didn't see everything!",
          "Regardless of the Covid closures we can't wait to go back when the famous dome is opened and the new stingray exhibit. Definitely looking forward to visiting again",
          "This was our first post-COVID visit to the Zoo and we were very happy to be back. The nocturnal animals exhibit was closed but nearly everything else was. Masks were required for ages 5 and up and there were hand sanitizing stations everywhere. We made reservations on-line",
          "Zoo did a good job distancing groups during Covid. This is a great zoo for children and adults. Lots of new areas to visit. I visited over 20 years ago. This zoo just gets better and better.",
          "The Henry Dooley Zoo is amazing, so much to see it takes up about half a day. The zoo is huge! Must check out the rainforest, aquarium, butterfly\u2019s pavilion and the swamp! Very clean and well kept. Will definitely be going again.",
          "We usually only go to the zoo with our kids but we are traveling without them and decided to check out the zoo anyway. We are so glad we did, it is a beautiful zoo, very well landscaped. The highlight though was seeing the gorillas. The gorilla exhibit is so well done you can",
          "Honestly, I am not a zoo person, but having been in Omaha I needed to stop at the zoo. I have heard great things. Partially due to covid19, the heat and the fact that I\u2019m not a zoo enthusiast, I was pretty much over it by the time I made it through Africa. Now! That being said,",
          "The staff was amazing! They were helpful and friendly. The zoo boasts a wide variety of animals and Skyfari. We chose the Skyfari to see more of the zoo because one needs two days or a full day to see it all.",
          "Wow! This zoo is huge!! We were there for 7 hours and walked 8.25 miles to see everything. They have an incredible array of animals and different activites to do. We were able to see a movie in their giant theater. Almost every exhibit was open even though we went during the",
          "I had this place on my list to visit for a while and it did not disappoint. While a few attractions were closed, like the butterfly exhibit, we still spent the whole day looking around and enjoying it. One of the coolest things they do is let you bring your own drinks and food",
          "Spectacular. Every impressive step of the way. Thank you, so much, for adhering to the highest of standards in providing close-to natural environments for the animals, and giving families an opportunity to spend time together, in an outdoor environment. Kudos to Henry Dooley",
          "Whole place has been in construction for several years now, the splash zone and aquarium are about the only thing open but you still have to pay 30 dollars to go in, place is well monitored and mask required.",
          "This is a huge zoo. Between Covid and it being an overcast day, not many animals were out. But we did enjoy the African elephants as they tore tree branches apart, the rhinos soon after they were let out, and the female lions that started playing and p9ouncing on each other.",
          "We came here instead of getting married like we were supposed to - I've been here several times, but I just love the zoo! This zoo has so many great and interesting enclosures and designs that I just love to see. They have such a wide range of animals as well as some of the",
          "We had other commitments, so we only had about three hours to spend at the zoo. Since this was our first time to the zoo, we were not familiar with the zoo layout. We should have printed the map of the zoo before visiting since they are not currently handing out maps (due to",
          "Great zoo, anytime of year. I love the fact that there are plenty of \"indoor\" exhibits....so that, during bad weather, freezing cold days, extreme heat, etc....we can still enjoy many aspects of the zoo. My favorite exhibits are the Gorillas and the Lied Jungle.",
          "I'm not much of a zoo person. My experience with zoos is mostly limited to Brookfield Zoo and Lincoln Park Zoo, both in Chicago. While the exhibits at this zoo seemed to be of higher caliber, what I appreciated was how the zoo was filled with trees. It is also surrounded by",
          "Our first visit to HD Zoo in Omaha during a short family trip. We spent 6 hours there. Lines not long, even with social distancing. We LOVED the gorilla, monkey, exhibits. Loved how the zoo was sectioned into areas/continents the animals came from (Africa/Asian/Australian,",
          "We spent the day here and covid19 restrictions were in place: closed water fountains, wearing masks indoors and restricting numbers in exhibits, no train or tram. It was quite hot outside but shade generally available. Or only complaint was that food service places are all",
          "THIS IS THE BEST ZOO IN THE ENTIRE WORLD! I've been here over 30 times and it never fails to amaze me. I've visited many of the \"famous\" zoos in the country (San Diego Zoo, Bronx Zoo, LA zoo) and none of them even come close in comparison to Henry Doorly Zoo. The LIED Jungle is",
          "We did visit during COVID-19 restrictions, so I was unsure with how much would be open. Although there were multiple exhibits closed, the zoo was amazing!! A very clean and beautiful zoo. The Skyfari is an absolutely MUST DO!! Amazing views of the animals, especially the lions",
          "We visited the zoo in June 2020. We purchased our tickets 2 days in advance. Due to required social distancing, many of the exhibits were not available to the public. The animals were out for us to see. It was a really hot day so they had misting stations available for the",
          "We visited during the Covid-19 restrictions. Basically only Africa and Asia was open but we saw some amazing exhibits. As the summer progreses in sure more will open up.",
          "We were in town for a wedding and didn't have much time but the layout of the zoo was nice for even a quick trip! The tree-house feel of the primate exhibit really makes you feel like you are in the jungle. The exhibits look natural and allow close viewing.",
          "Since the zoo was closed due to COVID-19, persons with zoo memberships were admitted to the Safari P.arl without paying admission. We took advantage of the offer and enjoyed our drive.",
          "We had a wonderful day at the zoo. There is so much to see and do it easily filled the day. Although there is some construction many of the animals were active. The new Asian Highlands is such a beautiful area. This is without a doubt a must visit in Omaha!!!",
          "It was the first nice spring weekend of the season and spring break for our youngest grandson. His first trip to this zoo and our first for at least 10 years. We were disappointed that none of the rides were operating and very few concessions were. Many of the water fountains",
          "Zoo was impressive. The aquarium was my favorite and could have stayed there for hours. Desert dome was fascinating. Lots of hills but it had great resting areas to watch he animals. Of from out of town this is a recommended stop!",
          "Henry Dorley is always rated in the top 3 or 4 zoo's in the world. I believe it will take 3 days to see it all.",
          "Me and my husband went for the day so much to see and do. Wear your walking shoes. Admission was a little steep. But worth it I think.overall i enjoyed it.",
          "After years of waiting, I finally visited the Henry Doorly Zoo for the first time last week. My overall experience was very positive, and the zoo is quite impressive for a city the size of Omaha. While I can't rate it quite as highly as the San Diego Zoo, Toronto Zoo, St. Louis",
          "It didn't hurt that the temperature was 55 degrees in the middle of February, but every place at the zoo that we were able to visit was just awesome! Indoors and out it was just plain fun. My only regret was that we didn't have the time to explore the entire site, but that",
          "This Zoo is well maintained and reflects investment in growth. I was told that the Zoo had recently been expanded and it was far larger than I remember when I visited in my youth. The animals are well maintained and have ample space to walk in their enclosures, this is not",
          "We have memberships and frequent the zoo often. We love this zoo so much and could go there everyday. You definitely will need to spend multiple days here if you want to see everything thoroughly. I\u2019ve read multiple times that this zoo is ranked 1 or 2 best zoo in the world",
          "Very few zoos in the U.S. can compare with this medium size zoo in Omaha. While I generally do not favor keeping animals imprisoned, if keeping them safe from extinction in an environment close to their natural habitat protects the species, it is a good thing. That describes",
          "Went on a 35 degree day! A number of indoor buildings, so it was ok ++ not crowded! The jungle is 2 floors so you see more & you walk in the tropics! Several statues to enjoy as well as flowers. A world class zoo.. go enjoy year round!!",
          "World class zoo has won many awards for layout, variety of animals, animal breeding program, display spaces, aquarium, desert dome...the list goes on & on. Many activities for all ages. Easy to walk. Very appealing to the eye. Our family loves this zoo!",
          "We have been to this zoo twice in the last six years. Once in the late spring and once in the winter. Recommend going in the late spring due to the weather and many animals are inside and cannot be seen in the outdoor enclosures. This is one of the best zoos in the country, so",
          "There are so many amazing exhibits and fin interactive things to participate in! The only thing I wasn't impressed with was teh Desert Dome, when it was first built I thought we were going to be able to be more interactive with the animals, it's ok once.",
          "I've been a member of the zoo for a little over a year now, and I can attest that it is a world-class establishment. Not only are there plenty of really exciting outdoor attractions (including the new Asian Highlands area), but there are enough unique indoor exhibits that a",
          "there is so much stuff to do at this place you should go see Belsky fall aka really my uncle and my dads brother",
          "Very well done and informative. Would recommend seeing it. Wear some comfortable shoes. Lots of parking. Thank you!",
          "Plan on spending a full day here. This is a beautiful zoo with lots to see. Make sure to visit the aquarium.",
          "Growing up in Chicagoland, I have access to two good zoos, but was blown away by this zoo, aquarium and more. The desert dome was a gem and we spent quite some time, especially viewing the nocturnal section. Worth a trip to Omaha!",
          "Lied Jungle and the desert dome are fun to walk through. The sights, smells and sounds of the swamp in the lower level of the desert dome are probably my favorite spot.",
          "We are trying to travel to each state and everywhere we go we visit the zoo, this one is by far the best! HUGE! You can pet and feed stingrays. The indoor desert is amazing, they have a nocturnal exhibit that is amazing. Don't miss this zoo!",
          "One of top two or three zoos in the country. World class everything. Interesting for the entire family. You are going to be walking a lot. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. If the weather is good pack a lunch, will save funds that you will spend in the gift shop. If you",
          "Went to three indoor attractions and all were high quality. The forest building was large, detailed and as close to the real deal as you could get.",
          "This zoo is always expanding and wanting to get better. A premier zoo in the WORLD !! Looking forward to the new exhibit this coming year 2020",
          "This is probably the best zoo I have been to. The zoo is organized and quite clean. They have an amazing (simulated) cave and its incredible. I definitely had a good time, however sad at the same time because they had some areas closed due to winter season and constructions",
          "Even when the weather outside isn't friendly, this is a great place to visit. Make sure to eat lunch by the windows in the Tree Top Cafe to see the monkeys play (cafe ala carte items that aren't inexpensive, but you can pick cheaper options also). The jungle is a great escape",
          "We went to the zoo in December and it was a not so pleasant day, however, we ended up spending 4 hours easily there! Considering it was December, a lot of the animals were indoors, but some were able to be seen/viewed. They are working on improving the aquarium, but it is",
          "One of the highest rated zoos in the world, and for good reason. Give yourself two half days or an entire day.",
          "This is the BEST zoo I have ever been to. Could be a little cheaper, but I understand it is expensive to keep all those animals.",
          "This zoo is very nice and large. Since we went in November, half of the exhibits were closed. We expected some closures but not to the level this zoo took it. The aquarium was very nice, I would stay away from the butterfly exhibit, they don't want to come to humans.",
          "Hands down the best zoo in the country. Why? Because our whole community believes in & supports our zoo. We donate because we are all dedicated to the zoo's mission on conservation. We visit because it is the best destination for, relaxing, or high energy entertainment for all",
          "Loved every minute of our visit to the zoo. The exhibits are very creative and really give you a sense of the animal's habitat.",
          "My family has been going to the zoo for over 50 years. It gets better and better as time flys by! I\u2019m not a fan of circuses or a lot of zoos. I dont feel as though the animals are treated well at many of these places. I do believe that the Henry Dorley Zoo very much cares for",
          "go early it takes all day. many indoor exhibits. about a 5 min. walk between buildings.food at snack bars ok.",
          "Have been here often with the family. Incredible selection of animals, well kept, fun for the kids and adults!",
          "Without a doubt the best zoo in the country. Plan on spending a full day if you want to see everything. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes and be ready to see some of the best exhibits anywhere in the world. The Asian and African exhibits are my favorites....Amazing!",
          "I visited the aquarium with a group on a special tour at night. It was excellent. The exhibits let you feel like you are almost swimming with the fish and penguins.",
          "World class zoo! I took my daughter and granddaughter twice and we still didn\u2019t see everything! Unlike most places, you can pack in your own food and drink, you just can\u2019t take it into any of the on-site restaurants. ( Which are very good but very expensive.) Wear your",
          "This is easily the best zoo in America. The amount of stuff you can do and see, it's just unreal. I took that time out and get it in a 2-day trip. Well worth the time and money!",
          "I have been to a few Zoo's in the US but this one is amazing! There is so much to do there that we didn't even get through the whole thing in one day. The indoor desert was very true to life. Going into the jungle when the bats were active (late afternoon) were everyone's",
          "The great apes and the penguins are my favorites. Their enclosures are state of the art. The zoo is funded by some of Omaha\u2019s millionaires and it shows. Constantly adding new exhibits. Best to go when the weather is nice.",
          "We had a great time. I went with 3 kids and we went through twice. There was literally so much to enjoy.",
          "My daughter lives in Omaha, so I\u2019m there pretty often. I get my daughter & her family a membership for the zoo every year. They go year-round with their kids and they all love it. Very family-friendly. Fun on holidays. Truly recommend going there. Omaha itself is an",
          "I feel very fortunate to live in the same city as this amazing place. The henry doorly zoo is the best. I love that they keep adding and updating. It is such a wonderful place to visit.",
          "If you enjoy a zoo, this is a wonderful one to visit. The exhibits are varied. It is large enough to include a lot, but small enough to visit comfortably. We will certainly return someday.",
          "Lots of reviews on HDZ so I\u2019ll just add that you should not miss Hubbard Gorilla Valley, one of my favorites. The gorillas always deal you a good experience and they seem to always have a baby or juvenile on display.",
          "I really enjoyed the various exhibits at the Doorly Zoo, but there were two exhibits that made me sad. In the orangutan exhibit there were two separate areas and in each one was a lone orangutan. They were sitting as close as they could to each other, but were too far apart to",
          "We visited in the fall, so all the trees were changing and it really added to the beauty of the zoo. This zoo has lots of exhibits that are indoors, including an aquarium and cave experience. The butterfly pavilion is amazing! There\u2019s a good variety of different attractions",
          "Henry Doorly is one of my favorite zoos. The attention to detail is unmatched. Spent a little over four hours and covered the entire zoo. The Desert Dome, Kingdoms of the Night, Scott Aquarium, and Lied Jungle were favorites. When the weather is cold, there is plenty to see",
          "By far the best zoo in America! I recommend a trip yearly due to all of the updates that are always happening.",
          "One of the best Zoo's in the World. If this is your first time, you need to plan on being there all day to see everything.",
          "I grew up in Nebraska and have never seen the Henry Doorley Zoo until this last September. The ouside animal collections are ok and not any more spectactulor than a number of other zoo's - Minneapolis, Miami, Ft. Worth , Dallas, Toronto or Barcelona. What makes the Henry",
          "We were able to see all animals in the exhibits unlike other zoos where the animals always seem to be hiding. The aquarium and stingray beach are great as well.",
          "My family and I drove 5.5 hours to visit this zoo and it was worth it. The only downside was the amount of construction that was occurring which made getting between different exhibits a little more difficult. There are so many different animals and habitat types. We spent two",
          "This is an amazing zoo! If you are a senior, cost for admittance is $17.50. Is you have a local zoo, check to see if membership at your local zoo is reciprocal with Henry Doorly Zoo. We were able to get admittance for buy one senior, get the second free. You can rent strollers",
          "Nice Zoo but where are the animals? We visited several exhibits and found no animals! And having enjoyed the St. Louis zoo where we lived for many years and there is no entrance fee, we found the experience quite expensive. How does a family of four or five afford to go and",
          "This was a large zoo, we couldn't see all the exhibits in one trip. I enjoyed the layout, being circular, we didn't have to backtrack. Many ways to enjoy the experience with a train ride or a skytram. Overall great attraction for out of town visiters.",
          "Not a zoo family but when we read that this is the #1 zoo in America, we knew we had to see it while in Omaha. We were impressed after just entering the first building. We were there for 5 hours and still hadn't seen 2/3 of it. One good thing is that this zoo has SO much space.",
          "I love this zoo. It is clean, enclosures are huge and the animals appear healthy and happy. What more can you ask for.",
          "Zoo is great, but right now under a lot of Construction. Most Construction will be done in late Spring.",
          "This zoo was one of the best zoos we\u2019ve visited in the world. Large spaces for the large animals to roam make the viewing very enjoyable. The indoor spaces are world class. The rain forest, the desert, and the aquarium are all top notch",
          "Visited this place in very early spring on a cold, snow-spitting day-- not many other visitors, but it was still really fun to meander around at my own pace without the crushing crowds. Desert Dome was really interesting (and warm!). Construction happening on several exhibits so",
          "We go here with kids and grand kids several times a year. Always fun, and learn new things. They are constantly adding new and exciting exzibits.",
          "The zoo is super affordable, we were blown away by how clean everything was from the restrooms to the animal enclosures it seemed as everything was very meticulously taken care of. The animals looked healthy and happy. Plenty to do for an entire day. I did think the cost to",
          "We went on a weekend, of course it was packed! It was still a very wonderful experience. Definitely will be taking the family again!",
          "Best zoo in the world! Ranked that for a reason. Always updating! You can get so close to the giraffes and elephants!",
          "This zoo is outstanding with such great displays. The butterfly pavilion is incredible as is the desert dome and the new African exhibit. We were there for 3+ hours and could have stayed much longer.",
          "The best part of the zoo was the aquarium which was only partially accessible due to construction. We were yelled at immediately upon entering the lemur exhibit. All we did was open the door. If the lemurs are napping within a couple of feet of the door, they should have put a",
          "This by far is one of the best zoo's I have ever visited. The aquarium alone was worth the price of admission. You could see most animals clearly from well designed viewpoints. The habitats were clean and well maintained.",
          "The Omaha Zoo is so much more than just a zoo to see animals. The newer exhibits are very interactive!! It\u2019s a Zoo with an outdoor children\u2019s museum! Some trips the kids play in the stream for hours others they are all about seeing the animals!!",
          "If you want to get your exercise and see lots of different animals, this is your place to go. Enjoyed everything.",
          "Best part was seeing a trainer acclimate a brand new baby orangutan - with Mom watching every move very carefully! Took the tram around once to get my bearings and then walked, walked, walked!",
          "we went to the Zoo that we have been to numerous times and this was the most dissapointing, no polar bear no tigers, oh my. the aquarium is outstanding, desert dome is very bare inside hardly any animals, swamp is very interesting and jungle is neat, the kid zone/ petting zoo",
          "Did the backstage the aquarium and it was great. It was a surprise for my daughters birthday and she loved it!",
          "I've been to quite a few Zoos but had heard many times that Henry Dourly was one of the best, and it really is. I particularly liked the nocturnal animals exhibit (Kingdoms of the NIght), where the place is kept dark during the day so the animals are active. There were plenty",
          "We were visiting \"family\" and they took us here, both AF veterans, the clerk at the Ticket Booth gave us all military discount..they had available wheelchairs for my mom and sister..the gift shop very well organized...we did not get to go through the entire zoo BUT what we did",
          "We took the behind the sceens golf cart tour, it turned out to be a waste of time. We saw lots of empty enclosures, but heard how the interns lived on site, and various other lame stories about why there were no animals to see. I had heard for years how great this place was, I",
          "The park has outstanding landscaping! I arrived at 9am and parked at the North entrance, the cashier was very friendly and helpful with the park map. The train was not running yesterday so that was a disappointment, and the sky safari doesn't open until 10am. Those were two",
          "I like that this zoo did not have caged animals, but most were in open natural settings. Of course the lions, tigers and monkeys were behind wire or glass, but still had lots of space to roam. The setting were nice with rain forests, exhibits, and safari like areas. There were",
          "Again this year, Omaha zoo was a part of the vacation. The elephants exhibit was amazing. It was closed last I was here. Love this place!",
          "Our girls love all of the recent renovations. So much so that it's hard to get them to leave Adventure Trails! We are members so it's not too big of a deal when we don't get to see the rest of the zoo, but I'm always very impressed with the updates our zoo makes!",
          "My wife had been there before years ago.Sites seem to improve but not this zoo,mostly under construction and what was there to see had less animals than our small zoo in Des,Moines",
          "I've been to this zoo 25-30 times in the last 8 years, even though it's a 3 hour commute. We take young children and a very able-bodied octogenarian. I used to be thrilled with it and brag on it, and rank it much higher than my local zoo. Not true anymore. Under ludicrous",
          "Spent a full day at the zoo and walked many miles. It was a Sept weekday and not many refreshment stands open - would have been helpful for drinks as it was 90 degrees plus. The environment recreations in the buildings are phenomenal to say the least. The outdoor pens are",
          "Cannot say enough about this zoo. They consider every detail. Aquarium is fantastic, desert dome so cool and the Lied Jungle was probably our absolute favorite! We spent the entire day here and could have stayed longer. Feed the giraffes and ask questions because the staff is",
          "More than a zoo. The aquarium is an unexpected midwest gem. The jungle and the desert attractions are unique and create the feel you are actually in the wild - many plant and animal species within your reach - but please don't touch! Make sure to take the sky tram for a great",
          "This is a really great zoo with lots of interactive things for children to do. They have a good number of giraffes and the viewing area is great with a feeding area and guide to tell us about them!",
          "Took my wife, younger daughter and the two granddaughters to Henry Doorly Zoo recently. Wowza...what an enjoyable experience !!! We entered via the North Entrance because the kids zone is located nearest to that entrance. During the course of the visit, we did the Bay Family",
          "This is a beautiful zoo. The animals were well taken care of and the exibits were incredible. I particularly loved the asian area, the desert dome, the indoor rainforest, and the underground night world. As a bat lover, this zoo was extra special because there were so many",
          "We enjoyed our visit. You could spend several days there it is so massive. We spent a full day seeing all the animals with our grandchildren. We have been there twice and it never disappoints.",
          "We are seniors and spent 4 hours walking the zoo. Enjoyed the variety of animals including butterfly house, aquarium and desert dome. Our complaint is we entered via north entrance and was directed to main area for restrooms. Looking for lunch options we only saw closed sign",
          "This zoo is so massive with too much to see in a day. The zoo just gets better every year. Don\u2019t miss this experience.",
          "We spent the entire day at the zoo until it closed at 6. We went to every animal exhibit, spending extra time at our grandson\u2019s favorites. The animals are in big enclosures which have been made as natural as possible. The elephant viewing inside and out was amazing. We spent a",
          "It is a very nice zoo, my only complaint is that there are not many areas to get food other than snack stands and when we did finally stop to get lunch we waited in line for over an hour. Lesson learned, best to pack a lunch and have a picnic.",
          "As senior citizens, have seen many a zoo. Wonderful to see families of animals (as versus the lone example), both inside and outside accommodations for them. cared for human creatures as well, with sunscreen dispensers in the restroom. Not just \u201cjungle creatures.\u201d But",
          "We loved this zoo. Went on a Thursday so the place was not very busy at all. We spent the whole day walking around and seeing some of the exhibits multiple times. We took a ride on the skyfari chair lift which we recommend. Suggest doing some pre-planning and looking into all",
          "Henry Doorly zoo is fantastic. There was a lot of construction, so we missed my favorite part- the aquarium. My sister uses a wheelchair and the majority of the place is wheelchair accessible. Some of the habitat buildings have roots in the path, so some extra maneuvering is",

          "This zoo is huge. There are many interesting exhibits to walk through. However, one thing that is a little confusing is that there aren\u2019t actually many animals. A lot of mammals that I am used to see in larger groups at other zoos were often solitary.",
          "Omaha's Doorly Zoo is incredible. We were debating between one and two days for our visit, chose to go only one, and didn't quite make it to everything. The kids had fun feeding archer fish (watch out, they spit) and prairie dogs. My wife's favorite section was the nocturnal",

          "We spent almost 8 hours there today with our 8,7, and 3 year old. It really lives up to the hype. Best zoo we have been to. We weren\u2019t bored once.

          "I visited here on 8/24/2019. It has grown a lot since I last visited here. We enjoyed the Lied Jungle and Desert Dome. With the tram and train it gives you more ways to see the zoo. We caught the 2 o'clock show with the elephants and the 3 o'clock show with the lions. All the",

          "Had heard this as good as San Diego but skeptical. It is truly world class. Plenty of pleasant staff, beautiful vegetation, and delightful exhibits. Was there before crowds and saw most animals (missed more gorillas though). Kudos to security staff who were so professional to",
          "We go to the zoo each year. This year, we were there shortly after it opened, and immediately walked down to the Africa exhibit. Unfortunately, most animals were not out yet. We continued our walk and went through the Gorilla house. There were some animals out here, but again it",

          "This zoo is consistently rated among the top zoos in the country, and for good reason. It's a very large zoo with fantastic habitats and exhibits. Don't miss the Lied Jungle (indoor jungle building) - it's very impressive, with 2 levels to walk through, including a waterfall",

          "We love the Henry Doorly Zoo. We planned for 2 days at the zoo, which I think is needed to be able to have fun and not feel rushed. We got to ride the skyfari - which I enjoyed looking down into the animal pens. I don't think that the train ride is worth it, just not much",
          "The best zoo I have ever been too. The aqaurum was beautiful. A lot of walking but was worth it. I will be back. Again, beautiful zoo.",
          "Didn't have enough time for all, but saw the Lied Jungle and Aquarium. Very impressive! Only $20 admission fee and so much to see, as well as helpful staff when you need a map or how to find your way... I have been many times and love it!",
          "The zoo is nice. Waste of time and money. We thought we'd see some animals along the route and save some walking. Nope. You see the backside of buildings and it goes too quickly past what animals are visible. The commentator is difficult to hear/understand. Don't bother.",
          "We recently visited the Henry Doorly Zoo for about the fifth time and continue to be amazed at this gem. We have been to multiple zoos - including the San Diego Zoo - and this attraction rivals any zoo throughout the entire nation. The variety of animals, the ease of getting",

          "I'm a lifelong Nebraskan but I hadn't been to the HD Zoo for over 10 years. I was amazed at how much has changed and been upgraded. One special touch that impressed me was that the zoo employs experts in different areas to answer questions about the exhibits and I found that",

          "I\u2019m from Chicago and while our local zoos (Lincoln Park and Brookfield) are nice medium-sized zoos, they are not even in the same class as Henry Doorly Zoo. It is amazing! It was so cool to see such large, natural animal habitats. The herd of elephants is so cool. The aquarium",
          "There was so much to see and do ! This is an amazing zoo and I especially loved the sky safari ride . It\u2019s relaxing to let your feet dangle and see the animals from above . My best friend and I had a blast- even though it was a little crowded . My recommendation would be to go",
          "We're from St. Louis, and we have no shame in touting our own wonderful zoo. But we were not prepared for the Doorly! Thinking a few hours would do, we were there for 5 hours and were far from seeing everything. Touted by locals as one of the top two zoos in the country, it was",
          "This zoo is highly rated, worth the trip and the crowds. I try to come here every year, at least once, when I visit family in Council Bluffs, Iowa. I grew up in the area, so I have always known Henry Doorly Zoo. I have seen huge improvements over the last 60+ years. The newest",
          "The grounds were well groomed, walking paths nice everything was well maintained. We walked the entire zoo as well as doing the sky tram. Would recommend the sky tram as we seen things from above that we could not see from the pathway. The highlights for me were the baby",

          "This is an Omaha treasure. Named one of the best zoos in the US. Very well maintained, friendly staff and the animals appear to be treated well and cared for. The focus of the zoo is clearly educational. The picture is one found in the children's play area. I wish school",
          "I\u2019d heard that this the one of the best zoos in the world. Every exhibit was engaging, interactive, and focused ultimately on conservation and appreciation of the natural world. We especially enjoyed Stingray Beach (who knew stingrays could be so engaging and cute?), and the",

          "We love this zoo! The cost always is a little worrisome when you first pay and enter, but by the end of the day it is all worth it. We learn so much about animals and have so many great experiences when we visit. They are constantly improving and changing the exhibits too.",

          "Lots of walking for us but the gradkids always love this place. Neat place was the Stingray feeding building was really interesting. They come swimming right over your hand to eat the prepared minnows. The lion enclose was big but all we could see was a male lioin mane as he",

          "Wow! Comparable to Denver Zoo in size. It was well run and easy to navigate. I recommend bring the kids' swimsuits of you go in the heat. The Alaskan Aventure Splash Park was a lifesaver after being in the heat all day. It closed right at 5 and by the time we got to the",

          "A must see when my granddaughter visits from California. We especially enjoyed the giraffes this time since the baby giraffe, Zoey, was there. We took advantage of the trolley this year to get us from place to place. You HAVE to see the Stingrays. They are amazing.",
          "This zoo is such a well designed space! In the Adventure Trails area alone there is a long creek and sand play area, waterfalls, a HUGE playground/climbing structure with actual monkeys climbing around you in their own nets, a raft you can pull yourself, goat petting, so so",
          "Very Busy Saturday. Very slow moving Lines out the door for both the Desert Dome and the Aquarium. Did not get to see either as the young children could not wait in such long, very slow moving lines. There were no signs for or visible water fountains and every food station and",
          "If I were to choose the best thing about the zoo, It would be difficult to decide. Let's talk about the Desert Dome, That has got to be the number 1. You can see landscapes like the Namib Desert and the Sonoran Desert. Animals like Rattlesnakes and Merrcats are my favorite.",
          "Love the sky ride; it was a great way to see the animals and to give your feet a rest! A highlight for me was feeding the giraffes. For only $3 you get to hold a branch ( tightly) while the giraffe strips the leaves from the branch. Love that they have sunscreen dispensers",
          "The zoo was a lot of fun. It was very clean. The exhibits were not too far from each other. Seemed like most the animals were out except the giraffes. They were doing work on the aquarium but it didn't feel like a cluster or a mess. They had plenty of misting areas for the kids",
          "It was 100 degrees when we visited. I was worried about that but there were so many indoor places to cool off. I am a big aquarium fan and have visited many throughout the US and Europe, but this one is the best! My family absolutely loved this zoo!",
          "This is a world class zoo. I visit a lot of zoo's. Except for the Panda's, the Doorly Zoo is far better than the National Zoo in DC. Much better maintained than a lot of zoos. The one thing not to miss is the aquarium. Recently updated and expanded. The coral is",

          "A wonderful Zoo. This something we enjoy is the many Zoo in the US. This one is right up there as one of the best. The the day we were there the Elephants were not out. The encloses are very realistic which help understand the animals environment. Could of done another day if we",

There are so many things to do that it never gets old. I would especially recommend going to Sting Ray Beach. Although it costs a",
          "I knew the Omaha Zoo would be amazing, but that was definitely an understatement! It is pricey, but with good reason! The exhibits are thought through and they keep going and going. I was amazed at how very large the aquarium is! Forget seeing two or three penguins, how about",
          "The zoo during the summer can be a good experience depending on crowds. The animals were not very active since it was hot outside. I would recommend a visit in the spring or the fall.",
          "Living in Colorado, I have access to two wonderful zoos - Denver Zoo and Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. However, they both pale in comparison to Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo. This 185-acre zoo is spectacular! The animal enclosures are huge, giving the wildlife lots of space to roam. I was",
          "Such a great zoo! My 15teen&9yr loved it. They had some construction going on by the gorillas but probably putting in something amazing. Love the desserts dome building, rain forest building, king of the night which housed so many different kinds of snakes,bats,",

          "We have been to a lot of zoos, but this was outstanding! Lots of animals, giraffe feedings, etc. The tram and train was cool. The Dome was fantastic. Cooling most stations were great as it was a hot day. Rainforest exhibit and gorillas were awesome too!",
          "This is without a doubt the best zoo, the aquarium is delightful. The penguins are obviously well cared for, and the under water tunnel is amazing! The desert dome is large but could be better utilized. A must see.",
          "I grew up in CA, so I have been to many of the countries top zoos and I was extremely pleased to see such a fantastic zoo in the middle of Nebraska! This is perfect for a family with small children or older children. The animals seem to be treated well, which is so important!",
          "It is clear that lots of really wealthy people have made and continue to make substantial gifts to this zoo. It is very clean, highly staffed, great habitat, lots of animals. Really first class. Their budget must be much larger than a typical city zoo could afford. They must",

          "This zoo is beautiful. The nice thing is that it has plenty of tree cover to keep the sun off of you. The animals have nice habitats and there are plenty of them. The only downside is that the vendors don\u2019t open until 10 or later and we had to wait until 11 just to get a water.",

          "It has been fun to watch this zoo evolve over the years. I first went to this zoo in 1990. It was terrific then. It has turned into one of the best zoos in the country, if not world. The Desert Dome is terrific, but beneath it is the swamp exhibit which is flat out",

          "The Henry Doorly Zoo seems like a hidden gem. We had never even heard of the zoo until we went to Omaha for the College World Series several years ago. Now, it is a regular visit. And, it has things that help those that may have mobility issues such as the train, or the",
          "We've been to this zoo several times and always find it educational, entertaining, and enlightening. Last visit I was able to use the motorized wheelchair and that was a great benefit to me as well. I highly recommend this fabulous facility to all, though those with mobility",
          "This is definitely a \"Must Do\" if you are in the Omaha area. If you plan on making it a 2 time trip, just purchase a family membership. With that you get the iMax theater also. There is so much to see. Don't spend too much time in the children's entertainment areas, splash",
          "Been a few years since I\u2019ve been and they have done a great job with updates and additions. The kids play area, the splash pad, and Asian highlands were all big and nice. Still love the aquarium walk through tunnel and jellyfish room. Was over 90 that day so a lot of animals",
          "We spent over 20 years in Houston and many near Atlanta, so we appreciate a great zoo. Raising our kids in Houston, where the phenomenal zoo was free, set us up for a lifetime of sticker shock! $40 entrance fee sort of set our expectations high. This zoo didn't disappoint. We",
          "The Omaha zoo is our #1 choice for our family for many reasons. First the variety of exhibits from the aquarium which is absolutely top notch to the Alaskan Adventure (our sons favorite place in the zoo). Second, because it was the place where my wife and I had our first date.",
          "Needed an alone day and strange as it sounds even with a lot of folks around it was pleasant to just go and be alone. New elephant enclosure is perfect for watching the young ones play. Gorilla house is like being inside with them. And the aquarium and penguin display is a",
          "Spent about four hours here with our 2-year old in 100+ degree weather and still thought it was awesome. There's a good mix of indoor and outdoor animal areas so you can still have a good time during inclement weather. We left after four hours because our son needed a nap but",
          "We didn't know what to expect so we arrived a little afternoon and since we were only in the city for the weekend unfortunately we did not get to see the whole place. This place is huge!!! We bought the pass that included the extra attractions like the carousel and train ride.",
          "We had a great day. The zoo is beautiful and clean and set up well. My kids are 12 and 8 and they had a blast. We drove 8 hours to come to the zoo and it was well worth it.",
          "The Omaha zoo was not on our original travel plans but we are glad we stopped. My teenage and school aged kids were so excited to being visiting a zoo. The entire zoo was able to be walked and viewed by us in 4 hours.",
          "Very nice zoo that is well laid out. I also recommend the train ride and Skyfari to give additional views. You will get your steps in for sure!!",
          "We LOVE this zoo, we have been here no less than a dozen times. It gets better every time with all the new habitats being built. The only downside, all of the hills you have to walk up and down. Do not attempt this zoo if you are not able to walk!",
          "We visited the Zoo while in Omaha for the CWS and it did not disappoint. Very nice exhibits - interesting aquarium with many varieties of sea creatures - lots for kids to be interested in as well as adults.",
          "We only had a short period of time to visit so we opted to do the train, the tram, and visit the aquarium and the Wild Kingdom! We did not walk around very much, but we did see lots of animals! The aquarium was my favorite part! The fish were beautiful and very colorful! Very",
          "I love coming here with my family! We get to see everything and we love the train ride! We always have so much fun here! Just make sure if you have young kids to bring lots of waters it gets very hot walking around!",
          "We were here almost the entire day and missed 2 of the exhibits. Nicely done. Very clean. Easy to walk. Pretty average for the most part but loved the variety of animals and how clean everything was, all the way down to the restrooms.",
          "All four of my children loved this zoo. We were able to stay about 5 hours but easily could have come back a second day to keep exploring. The aquarium alone was worth the stop. Other favorites were the butterflies, huge and enclosed play area, and the elephants.",
          "I\u2019ve enjoyed our time at the Henry Doorly Zoo but it does not live up to the hype. The desert dome and Lied Jungle are unique, but there is one entrance and one exit. If you get bored halfway through there is no other exit. the rest of the Zoo is trite. There are no bears aside",
          "My wife and I took a day off from the CWS to relax at the zoo and we had a blast! I heard a local complaining about how crowded it was but I didn\u2019t think it was bad, the lines were not long and the atmosphere was fun. I can\u2019t wait to come back.",
          "Family trip to the zoo on Saturday and it was just fantastic! There is literally something for everyone to enjoy! I love that you can bring in your own lunch and drinks. It allows us to spend money on other fun things, like the train or tram! The aquarium is hard to navigate",
          "This is a very nice zoo. The gorilla exhibit is quite good. Lots of construction going on right now but still worth the visit.",
          "This is our absolute favorite zoo! We travel to come here almost every summer. The new giraffe and elephant enclosures really add to the zoo. Can\u2019t wait to come again.",
          "We recently visited the zoo for the first time since moving to the Omaha area. The first thing we noticed is that it costs waaaaaaaaay more than any other zoo we've ever been to. A word of advice - if you just want to occasionally ride the tram to get from place to place, do not",
          "Pricy but you could spend the day here. Wonderful collections of animals and well displayed in a parklike setting. Other attractions include water pad, carousel, train, tram, Sky lift. The plantings are gorgeous. Lots of docents who are very helpful. Wonderful program for youth",
          "This is one of the top zoos in the country, hands down!!! We were visiting from Detroit and we are zoo buffs, so we wanted to check out this zoo. We have been to 11 zoos around the country, including San Diego, Atlanta, and D.C.. This zoo is the second best zoo on our list. We",
          "This is an amazing zoo. Easily in the top 5 in the USA. As most of the reviewers have already said, this an experience not to be missed. Our friends who go frequently suggested that since we only had one day to spend here, we would see a great deal more if we took the golf cart",
          "Overall the zoo is awesome and always growing and getting better. Most of the exhibits are setup great. They only have a few left that are outdated. But they are making them better to see and better for the animals. Usually have a membership each year and enjoy just taking a",
          "This is a very nice zoo, but has a lot of incline walking. Needs to have better signs to tell how to exit the zoo.",
          "I brought my daughter back and they have added quite a bit. Really impressive. The elephants were so cool. Everything is pretty much all together. I wish they had more places to eat throughout the zoo and maybe more stands with drinks and snacks. This is why the four star",
          "Living in Omaha you find yourself doing what the tourists do. Not really. I've been going to the Henry Doorly Zoo since I could remember (25+ years) and I still enjoy every part of the zoo. There is construction going on now for improvements.",
          "This is without a doubt the #1 thing I would recommend to those visiting our city. Plan to spend an entire day here without a doubt and you could still not get to see it all. The zoo features a movie theatre, carousel, Skyfari (view animals from the air and get transportation",
          "You can tell this is one of the top 2 zoos in America, and taking good care of the animals is a priority, which is why they got rid of the cat complex and gave all the big cats away to other zoos that could take better care of them. Same with the bears. I hope in the future",
          "We were not visiting with children but still found the zoo enjoyable with just adults in our party. It was also really affordable too (admission was close to $45 for two adults) plus extras were not to bad like train rides for $6 each. There is a lot to see and walking around to",
          "I must admit I was skeptical. I was told over and over it was one of the top zoos in the country. Penguins! Yes, there are penguins. I've visited some of the top zoos in the country to include San Diego. I'll admit Henry Doorly falls into that category.",
          "Well this zoo has lived up to all of its accolades ! I spent the entire day visiting all the different areas. I enjoyed trekking through the desert dome. I got to see flora and fauna I normally do not see at zoos. I know all the zoos I visit promote conservation, but there is",
          "It lived up to all of our expectations. It is a beautiful zoo and the staff are very friendly. Make the trip!",
          "I lived in this area 28 years ago and I just couldn't wait to visit this zoo again. For me this zoo is the absolute best zoo I've ever been to. It got even better and I wish I had more time because I only got to see the aquarium, butterfly exhibit, dessert dome and jungle with",
          "The zoo is awesome! You can bring a picnic lunch and see all the animals take a ride on the train! They also have a spray park for the kids!",
          "We visited the Henry Doorly Zoo on Memorial Weekend with our grown kids that live in Omaha. It rates in my top 2 zoos in the USA. This beautiful and well designed zoo knows how to move people in quickly on the busiest holiday weekends and the design of the zoo is excellent and",
          "Henry Doorly Zoo has been considered one of the \"Top 10\" Zoos in America for a long while, and it certainly deserves that. It has probably been 8-10 years since I visited the zoo last and the renovations that have been completed since then offer an even greater visitor",
          "This is a very good zoo, I spent 7 hours here with our grandchildren aged 3, 5 and 9 and we did not see everything. Besides being a good zoo, there are a lot of exceptional play areas for kids for them to decompress. Some of the concession stands were very slow but others",
          "This is one of the best zoo experiences in the country. The new Asian exhibits are phenomenal, especially how they made the newly constructed structures look like they've been there for hundreds of years. So many giraffes, elephants, and gorillas. Awesome indoor exhibits when",
          "We have visited many Zoos during our trips to the states and this definitely rates one of the best, it\u2019s the only zoo you can walk around in an orderly fashion so you don\u2019t miss any of the animals, it was a very hot day when we visited so many of the animals were hiding in the",
          "One of many great things to do in Omaha. The zoo offers an awesome skyfari (sky ride) that gives one a great overview of the zoo. The penguins are a can\u2019t miss stop. The aquarium gives a unique perspective to aquatic life. Well laid out zoo. We ate at the Omaha Steak",
          "Had a great time at the zoo! Can bring your own food/drink in the zoo if you like but food /drink prices weren't too bad. Especially liked the food and ice cream at Glacier Bay Landing which was new to us.",
          "Who knew the best zoo in America was in Omaha, Nebraska?! My mom and I were visiting family in Omaha and were told to 100% go to the zoo ~ Certainly glad we did! Highlights were the aviary, desert eco-system, rain forest eco-system, butterfly garden, the sky tram & the movie",
          "It\u2019s like any regular zoo that you may have visited in the past. It has same animals just like other zoos. The one thing that distinguishes it though is the desert dome and the skyfari and train and tram. They have a section called glacier bay which is to model after how a",
          "I saw that the Henry Doorly zoo was rated #1 in the WORLD back in 2014 and had a couple people tell me it was amazing, so we thought we would check it out for Memorial Weekend this year. We made the 5 hour drive with 2 adults and 4 kids (12, 11, 2 and 10 months) and we are so",
          "First time here and two things I will take away from this trip: the size of the zoo and how well/strategically placed the places to eat are, practically intertwined with exhibits. Probably all has been said before many times in other reviews but plan on being here all day if",
          "This place never disappoints. We take an annual trip w/ our boys. They love it. Only bad thing is it's hard to get everything in 1 day!",
          "My boyfriend and I try and visit a local aquarium or local zoo every trip we take. This zoo is by far the best I've ever been to. Exotic animals I've never seen, beautiful birds which are my favorite, knowledgable zoo staff at every turn.",
          "At the entrance to the Dome area, my friend and I both said, \"ok, so this is to share what plants and trees can thrive in this hot environmen\" then we went around the last display and seen so much more. Follow the path and experience the different themes. The bat feeding area",
          "As someone who\u2019s been to this zoo multiple times, I can say that this zoo is one of the best zoos in the midwest. This zoo is ranked one of the best in the United States for a reason. It\u2019s split up into multiple sections, including the aquarium, the insect housing, the african",
          "I have been to this zoo a few times and have enjoyed it every time. Always finding something I didn\u2019t see the last time I went. It\u2019s big, many many different animals to see and it is kept up really well. This is the best zoo I have been to. I prefer it over the well known San",
          "For where it is, there was a lot of ground to cover. I was impressed at the size of the zoo, even though it was busy, it never felt it was to crowded, lot of interactive exhibits and newer housing for the animals cages. Some were impressive by the types of areas they had",
          "The zoo is always changing and being more family friendly. They have just finished the Asia Highlands and it is a must see!",
          "Do yourself a favor and come early to spend the whole day here! I couldn't finish everything (didn't visit the museum and some areas) despite coming in at 9:45am. The desert dome was alright despite the hype and to me the main highlights were the Kingdoms of the Night (beneath",
          "We are zoo and aquarium people so we had high expectations going into this place. They absolutely delivered on out expectation level! The zoo was massive and they had a built in aquarium as a display. While the display wasnt massive, it was nice and our family enjoyed it. The",
          "This was our second visit. We saw that there was a ~ 1yr old baby pygmy hippo there now, so we had to go the week of its birthday! We watched the hippos for a long while in the Lied Jungle. This zoo is probably the best we have ever been to. Lots of animals in various",
          "I hadn't been here in about 15 years and it was great then. It has improved even more since then and was amazing. The landscaping is wonderful and the animals have great enclosures with lots of room to move.",
          "This is a wonderful zoo and aquarium. The habitats where the animals roam are lush and natural, with unobtrusive barriers. There are educational exhibits and an informative theater. There is so much to see, I would suggest visiting online and planning out must see exhibits,",
          "when you are on the road you see advise saying that this is the best zoo of the world's. I don't know for the World but in US and Canada it'S really the best zo we have ever made it has the Aquarium include so you don't have to buy 2 tickets going in two differents place.",
          "Here are some tips. Go early and do the indoor attractions- the desert dome, Lied Jungle, insect house and aquarium as they get very crowded. In some areas there is a narrow pathway where strollers or wheel chairs take almost the entire path (mainly at desert dome). This",
          "Really nice zoo. Plan to walk a lot. Take sunscreen. They do allow food and drinks. On weekends consider buying tickets online as the line took 10-15 minutes. Families with small children will love the train. The aquarium was much bigger than I expected. Some new areas are",
          "In one day I felt like I had swam with sharks and walked through a lush rain-forest. What an amazing zoo. The animals and grounds are so well kept. The staff was helpful and kind. Thank you for a wonderful day - full of wonderment.",
          "What a neat zoo. Everything was very clean, spaced out enough that people weren't all stuck together. Plenty of animals and exibits to keep everyone interested. Well worth the price of admission...highly recommend going if you get the chance",
          "What an incredible zoo. I haven't gone to many since I was a child but even as an adult I was captivated. We had the chance to see the new baby giraffe in the barn which was just so cute! I have to say be prepared for sticker shock if you don't bring food and drink into the",
          "The kids loved this zoo! So many things to do and see not sure how someone could see it all in one day! One tip bring your own snacks, food and drinks. The snack stands weren\u2019t open yet and the dining with seating food was very pricey. We did enjoy the French fries but that\u2019s",
          "Who knew that Omaha had one of the top five zoos in the world! We were so thrilled that we had sufficient time to be able to spend a day at the zoo. The exhibits were amazing - the animals have wonderful facilities to live in and are clearly very well cared for and every",
          "Came here with my granddaughter last summer expecting a nice clean zoo. This zoo is something not to be missed for zoo lovers. From the butterfly house to the \"swamp\" with alligators. Every \"land\" amazed us. Put it on your to do list if visiting.",
          "Gorgeous! They are always expanding and improving, but how else do you maintain the reputation for being the best zoo in the world? I have been coming here since 1977, and I am never disappointed. A few pics are below.",
          "Always rated as one of the best zoosk in the US for good reason, Henry Doorly is a great place for family enjoyment. The IMAX theater adds versatility to the location in the event of rain. This is a must-visit and worth a trip to Omaha from wherever you are, especially if you",
          "The zoo is fantastic for everyone, young or old. You can easily spend an entire day and still not get through the entire attraction. The Swamp, and the Rain Forrest are my personal favorites, but the new Africa attraction is pretty spectacular as well! Must visit",
          "I absolutely love this zoo. It is by far the best I have been to. The exhibits are very spacious and are geared toward the natural environment of the animals. It's educational and fun for the entire family. A MUST see in Omaha",
          "This zoo is absolutely beautiful. As a child I loved visiting this zoo and bow as a mother I have loved watching it grow and love taking my children there. We love that you can pet sting rays and its awesome they allow you to bring your own food and drinks!",
          "very beautiful place to spend the day with the family, The new kids area is a blast so much to see and do",
          "There were some interesting animals, and the biosphere was informative. But on the whole the zoo sections that we saw seemed very old school with cages that were relatively small and little to no environment. It made me sad",
          "If I could give this zoo a ten I would. We aren\u2019t really zoo people but we\u2019re told not to miss it by locals. This zoo is fantastic. Extremely well kept and more then you can see in one day. Please don\u2019t miss it if your in Omaha. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",
          "I like zoos okay. We didn\u2019t have plans to go while we were in Omaha but everyone kept raving about it so we decided to go. We planned on a two hour visit. We were there for six and half hours and could have spent more time. This is not just a zoo. It has an aquarium, botanical",
          "We basically drove to Omaha from Denver for steak and the zoo. A new city we've never been too. The zoo was tons of fun though be prepared to walk some hills. One section was under construction for a whole new exhibit but that's ok, there was plenty to see. It still took us",
          "Do yourself a favor and go see this attraction when Omaha. This is one of the best Zoo's in the world. I believe it ranks in the top 10 and you will see why when you visit. The Rain Forest is phenomenal!! The aquarium, saffari, the dessert dome...and on and on. This is a",
          "We spent all day at the zoo with a 13 year old and 8 year old. My 17 year old stayed a few hours. We loved the desert dome, nocturnal building, a great aquarium , lied jungle, & the gorillas! Parking was free! Lunch was expensive and just ok as expected for a zoo.",

          "I visit this zoo on a regular basis as I and my family live in the area. We have older kids now so we don't frequent like we used to but it's always a go-to place for visiting friends and family and not only are they always blown away but we are as well. They are always adding",
          "We visited the Zoo and only had a few hours to explore. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Our favorites were the penguins, tigers, elephants and the aquarium. This would be a great place to bring your kids/grandkids.",
          "I have gone here several times and there's so much to do that you can't see it all in one day. Plus unlike most parks and zoos they allow you to bring outside food and drink so you can save money if you want to.",
          "Always amazing time! So much to see there so make sure to plan on a full day. Well worth it every time making great memories with the family!",
          "There is so much to see and do--it is a fantastic place for adults and children alike. I live 6 hours away and will definitely go back.",
          "It was my very first time visiting the Henry Doorly Zoo and I was blown away. I worked at the Blank Park Zoo which is a bit smaller but the Henry Zoo is so beautiful and well maintained. The animals have plenty of room indoors and outdoors. Staff are very knowledgeable and very",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed this zoo. It was a bit cold out, so not all of the animals were outside. Never fear. There is the tropical rainforest, the desert dome, the aquarium and the butterfly exhibit to keep you busy!! The aquarium has a tube you walk through and the fish,",

          "I live this zoo. It's cold out, so did not see a ton of animals out. The dome is cool. Love this place when its warmer out.",
          "Visited with family on April 1st. Absolutely stunning zoo - this and Columbus are neck&neck for the best zoo I've experienced. So much to do - thankful we had a full day to see as much as we could.",
          "First time visit to the Omaha Zoo. Great layout, enclosures, and exhibits. The Desert Dome and Lied Jungle rainforest were outstanding. Did not experience the large movie screen though. Well worth the $18 admission with discount. Visited on a cool weekday out of the summer",
          "Amazing experience! Great value! Will be part of many trips in the future with family! Something for everyone and something new to discover every time you visit!",
          "Wonderful zoo. Can't wait to go back when it is warmer and the rides are working!! Aquarium was great.",
          "This is truly a great place to come with family and friends. Lots of walking, bring a cart or rent ones for young children. Food is good but a little pricey- may be smart to pack a lunch. The Jungle and the Aquarium are not to be missed.",
          "They are constantly adding and updating exhibits and buildings. Some sections are a little hilly through the zoo. Otherwise great zoo!",
          "I love \u2764\ufe0f this Zoo! Just bought an annual membership so I can go more often. The Lied Jungle dome is like being in a tropical rainforest - great when winter is still hanging on a bit. Some construction going on right now for the new Asian exhibit but desert dome, aquarium and",

Looking forward to return trip in warmer",
          "Henry Dorley zoo is great and most weather conditions as there are many indoor under cover activities and displays. And on a beautiful day it just can\u2019t be beat. If you wanna exercise there\u2019s lots of hills and there\u2019s also ways around them if you are looking for a less",

          "This is always an amazing experience with children. Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo has ruined other zoo visits for me because this is such an excellent zoo, nothing else can compare. It is nearly impossible to enjoy/appreciate all the exhibits in one visit. The attractions they",

          "Weither your from the Midwest, or not, Omaha's zoo is a must see attractiom. It far surpasses any zoo I have ever been to. There is a reason why it is the #1 zoo in the United states. The zoo is great. It is full of many attraction weither you crave serenity or some adventure,",
          "World class zoo-the animals do not disappoint. Baby pigmy hippo was well cared for but still easily visible. Gorillas are interactive. Recommend bringing your own food as there are not enough vendors and the wait is ridiculous for ordering.",

          "We've been to the HD Zoo now a couple of times, with a wide range of ages. Our youngest is a cheetah fanatic and was not disappointed...although we were a bit confused as they weren't in the 'big cat' area. It was worth the walk to the far end of the zoo to see them in a large",
          "This zoo is one fantastic place! When I first moved to Omaha 40 years ago -- it was just getting off the ground! Today, it is one top-notch zoo with animals on display, but much more going on behind the scenes in studying and conservation of animals. Don't miss this if you",
          "The Henry Doorly Zoo here in Omaha is the best I've ever been to. It takes more that 2 days to see it properly. The Aquarium and the Rain Forest are my favorites, but the rest is so awesome, it's hard to claim a favorite. The animals are very well cared for and their diets",

          "This zoo is the best in the world! It has a brand new Asian exhibit including a Red Panda. It has a brand new African exhibit including many interactive experiences. It has the largest indoor rainforest in the world, a butterfly pavilion, a desert dome and a top notch aquarium.",
          "We went to the Henry Doorly Zoo and it was very fun. We go there often but it never gets old. The animal are very entertaining for all ages. We went during a winter month so none of the rides were open and most of the animals were not out. After we walked for awhile our feet",
          "It was snowing when we went. Like frEEzing cold. We spent almost 2 hours inside the warm domb. It was amazing. Then, we went to the aquarium. We were there over 5 hours and spent very little time walking around outside in the freezing cold (The animals were mostly holed up",
          "I have been to 25 different zoos and this zoo has become my new favorite. The zoo has large enclosures for the animals, the enclosures look very natural to the actual animals habitats in the wild and are well laid out so you can see the animals from different angles. If you",

          "Who would have thought that Omaha has the best zoo I've ever been to in the country, granted we went in November when some of the exhibits were closed, but, that didn't matter. There is so much to see there, I can imagine it taking a couple of days to see everything.",
          "The Henry Doorly Zoo is a very good zoo. However, the price of tickets almost makes it unaffordable for families who come to visit once a year. Once inside the zoo, many attractions require additional money to participate.",
          "Took a zoo road trip, this was the first stop. Even though it was only 6 degrees, we spent the entire day and loved it. We will have to come back when warmer to see the outside animals.",
          "I worked as a teenager in 1966 for Dr Lee Simons when he started to revitalize the zoo. Since then there have been so many changes I couldn't name them. What is important is that they all moved the zoo in the positive direction. I'm proud to have been a very small part of it.",
          "Absolutely a great place to go. My husband and I go frequently just for couple hours, walk around, watch an I MAX show, have a fresh burger off the grill. Our kids are grown and live out of town. One of the things they like to do when they are here to visit in summer, fall and",
          "This Zoo is the best thing to do in Omaha. It is entretaining for adults and young children. It is big and the heat in the summer can be suffocating (wear comfortable clothes and drink lots of water) there is little shade. There are a lot of exhibits that are indoors so it is a",
          "Love the zoo and aquarium here! Neat areas that allow guests to step into different climates. We love the zoo!! This was our second visit, and we are looking forward to going back to ride the skyfari!",
          "The Henry Doorly Zoo in my opinion is the best Zoo in the US. There are so many unique exhibits that you can\u2019t see it all in a day. Even the railroad is unique, the large locomotive was built in Austria in the 1800\u2019s. Go check it out it\u2019s worth it.",
          "The Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha is one of my favorite places!! It is so beautiful there! The staff is phenomenal. They all have smiles on their faces while they are working. They are very passionate about their jobs, about the animals and conservation in general. The staff enjoys",
          "The zoo is a great place to spend time but come prepared to walk... and there are definite hills to contend with. Even when the weather isn't so good, the zoo will accommodate. Plenty of indoor exhibits and the animals seem well cared for, for a zoo that is. Good family fun.",

          "In every town where we have lived, we have been season ticket holders at the Zoo. Henry Dorley is our hands-down favorite. The animals seem happy, well nurtured, and live in a clean environment. The park is a pleasant place to walk and stroll with children.",
          "This zoo is wonderful! Super nice facility, grounds. Tons of animals, exhibits. One full day isn't enough time to get through it!",
          "We visited on a relatively warm January day, and it was great. We omly stayed for about two hours (got there late in the afternoon) but it was a fun visit. The rain forest dome is amazing (just watch for bat poop!). :) Truly truly loved the visit.",
          "Had a great time on a chilly day in February visiting the zoo. I\u2019d heard great things so I had high expectations. It was about 20-30 degrees out and overcast, and it was a great day to go the zoo. It wasn\u2019t too busy, even with lots of families and young kids. The animals didn\u2019t",
          "I've been to various Zoos around the world and Omaha's Zoo is simply wonderful. Attractions and habitats that I'm certain are the envy if zookeepers everywhere. Arrive early because you can easily spend the entire day and not get bored.",
          "This Zoo is almost unparalleled. Consistently ranked as one of the Best Zoos in the World. My favorites exhibits are the lemur walk and the Lied Jungle.",
          "This zoo isn\u2019t ranked #1 because it in Omaha it\u2019s ranked #1 because it\u2019s the best and one of a kind! Enjoy your visit",

          "The Henry Doorly Zoo has consistently been recognized as one of the best zoos in the country and has earned its reputation. The exhibits are amazing. The aquarium is state of the art with an enclosed tunnel where sharks and turtles are swimming all around you. The giraffe,",
          "We stayed in Omaha for a couple of days last summer and went to the zoo for a change from our usual activities. This was a great zoo! Everything was clean and the animals all seemed well-cared for. We really liked all the information provided about the particular species.",
          "Best Zoo in the World!! Great way to spend the day with the family. Something for everyone. The new play are is great for younger kids.",
          "I went here when I was a kid, but don't remember much. When I returned this summer after 25 years, I was not as impressed as I expected to be. The place is enormous, but there don't seem to be all that many animals to see. I've been more impressed by smaller zoos. There are",
          "My first time at the zoo. We were going to visit on New Years Day, but it was 8 degrees. We waited until the next day for a balmy 37 degrees. I can\u2019t wait to come back in the warm weather! There is still a ton to see in the winter. Loved TreeTops cafe with their Omaha steak",

          "Visited here with family, we had a wonderful time, good exhibits, lots to see and do. We mainly went to see the 'underwater' aquarium. We had one family member who had recently been injured, and the zoo was a lot of walking and hills, so it was very relieving to see on the",
          "I am always fascinated by the zoo and the ongoing renovations and attractions that they add. It is a fun place to go and this last visit was with someone who had never been there and he was very impressed. It is truly a family place to be and visit.",
          "We love the zoo! We buy a zoo pass every year and use it year round! There is so much to do you can even use it in the winter. Great tool for winter break when you have kids that are cooped up.",
          "This place is incredible. So much to see, in 4 hours we couldn't walk anymore! Not a bad thing, if we had an extra day we would have come again. Hard to even pick a favorite part, was all spectacular. A must see",
          "Family from out of town visiting and always enjoy the Henry Doorly Zoo. Our Membership allows for additional adults and the 2 hours spent exploring was enjoyed.",
          "This is truly an amazing zoo! Don\u2019t let cold weather stop you from going because there is plenty to see indoors. The Jungle area (indoors) is phenomenal. There are 2 levels. There was a \u201cbridge\u201d to cross, bats, beautiful plants, etc. The swamp area was a favorite as well as the",
          "Haven't been to the zoo for a number of years and got to see a lot of the new exhibits and buildings that they have built since then. It was a lot of fun with the kids and even the old exhibits were impressive and how they were kept out. Only negative was the price but it was a",

          "words do not describe what you will see at Henty Doorly Zoo. I been going every year for the past 40 years and every time I go there is something new. They do a incredible job of updating different parts of the park. This is a place you go and will have memories for a life time.",
          "Don\u2019t let winter discourage you from going to HDZ. So much to see and do inside anymore, they\u2019ve done a wonderful job expanding and upgrading the facilities. IMAX is great too. There is a reason is the worlds top rated zoo on trip advisor.",
          "I have been to a couple of Zoos, but Henry Doorly is truly something special. A good place to visit at all times of year (since they have indoor exhibits too), their IMAX is great and has plently of educational options for those interested in learning more about animals or",
          "We spent the day during our College World series trip and walked around the zoo, rode the train and enjoyed the bird show and the attractive exhibits. The Zoo has a very good reputation and they lived up to it. It was slightly smaller than I expected, so it was easier on my",

          "Henry Dooley Zoo is the top in the world because it has the most species of any other zoo! Every year it grows & improves. Always a must see for out-of-town company. Pro-tip: if you are unfamiliar with the food options at the African Lodge you can ask for a chicken option.",
          "Best zoo in the USA. So many animals and new exhibits every year. Check out the bat cave it rocks. The new giraffe encloser is great. So many great animal to see. 5 stars in my book. Very inexpensive for a full days fun.",
          "Granted, I haven\u2019t been to any other zoo, but this one is amazing! So much to see! The rainforest, desert dome, and kingdom of the night exhibits are must-sees. You could easily spend a full day here. It is crowded and parking is kind of a pain, but so worth it. Anyone of any",
          "I\u2019ve been going to this zoo for 36 years and it only gets better! Many of the new exhibits are large and allow the animals to wander similar to their natural habitats. We recently had an overnight and slept in the aquarium and it was fun and well organized!",
          "We went to the zoo on a snowy December day, so not a lot of people were there. It was so awesome, because there were lots of zoo keepers to answer our many questions! One zoo employee joined us for an hour or more, and gave us a personal tour! She definitely went out of her way",
          "Great zoo, great exhibits and had a great time! Centrally located right off the interstate so easy to visit. We go to this zoo at least 10 times a year! Love taking family and friends to the zoo with us. We have family that come into town from all over and everytime we take",

          "The tour book said to plan on 5 hours at the zoo which we thought was too long. This zoo is wonderful, easy to follow the map, and docents to explain things in the indoor arenas. The animals are in natural settings and look quite content. We actually stayed longer than the 5",
          "We spent the entire day from open to close here and still didn't see it all! My daughter is an animal lover and she had a blast - especially watching the cheetah cubs. The theming throughout the door is fabulous. Worth a trip to Omaha.",
          "I have been to multiple very nice zoos out there (I like San Diego, Milwaukee County, and Toledo, etc). The zoo is great and right up there with them. The dome really sets it apart from the others, though. It gives the zoo a very distinctive feature that took a long time to",
          "Although the weather was good on the November day we went, so much of the zoo was shut down, yet we were charged full price. The \u201cWorld Class\u201d label is overused, as are the sponsors\u2019 names and piped in music. The apes area is excellent, but overall we were disappointed with",
          "We were free on Thanksgiving the temperature was in the 60s what do you do?? You stroll through fish, elephants, butterflies, lions, giraffes and all the other delights of the Henry Doorly Zoo! It was not crowded everyone was taking their time and you could see all of the",
          "My mom too my wife and me to the museum today. I felt like I was traveling around the world. The jungle and desert exhibits were built to look like the natural terrain. Animals were plentiful and easy to see. It is 1000 times better than our hometown zoo in DC.",
          "Like many zoos things get quiet in the late fall, with many displayed animals in their inside quarters, understandably. Still by midday there were many young families there seeing the animals. We were so impressed by the zoo layout, many zoo interpreters available to visit with,",
          "This ain\u2019t your ordinary zoo... this place has had some serious backing and you can\u2019t sit there and say. \u201cOh our zoo in (insert some town here) is better than this\u201d,!... good for you and your prolly in denial. I haven\u2019t been to a zoo where you can get so close to the animals",
          "I love the HDZ and make trips there on a regular basis. I know some complain about the crowds but go during the winter and on a weekday and you will have the zoo to yourself. Grat place to just go for a walk. Changes every year and they are improving all of the time!",
          "Always a great day at HD. Grand kids enjoy playground area and exhibits. Wife likes awuarium and lemurs. Food priced as expected and continuous construction and improvements can be distracting but consider it making best better, Great time every time. Expect to cover alot of",
          "The weather was fairly cold but that didn't stop us from having fun here. There is quite a bit of stuff to do inside at this zoo, more than normal. I have been to several zoos all around the country, and this one stands up to the best. If you are in the area and have a day to",

          "This is a great zoo, even on a cold fall day when most of the outside exhibits were not available. Despite the cold weather, this zoo did not disappoint. Great exhibits, things you do not see often, especially in the Midwest. As far as a zoo in the Midwest, probably the best I",
          "Plan for an entire day. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking a lot. There is so much to see! The zoo is constantly adding new animals and exhibits. The Scott Aquarium is Fantastic!! You will not be disappointed!",

          "It has been many, many years since we have visited a zoo and we heard so many good things about this one, we decided it's time. We would like to visit again if we are ever in this area since the day we visited, it was cloudy, chilly and very windy for walking between exhibits.",
          "Had a great time taking cousins from California. When we went a lot of the animals were fairly active. They have sure improved the access and infrastructure over the years. Great time.",

          "We always have an enjoyable time visiting the Zoo. There is so much to see including exhibits not found anywhere else in the world. The Desert Dome, the Aquarium, The Gorilla house, all are top notch. Some side activities, like the skyfari skilift or train ride, may seem a bit",
          "Excellent zoo. We spent most of the time in the desert dome...so much to see. We also went into the butterfly pavilion. We rode the aerial tram to get overview of zoo. Some exhibits were closed. The train was not running. Will return to this zoo.",

          "I skipped the iMax this time so I could see more of the zoo. The iMax shows are very good, but I may be able to see some of them in the Chicago area where I live. I think the desert dome is a highlight of this zoo (see my pictures). The giraffe exhibit was fully open this",

          "It is surprising that a city the size of Omaha has such an amazing zoo--but it does. It was raining pretty hard and was chilly so we tried to stay indoors; there was still plenty to see. I would recommend the desert, wild kingdom and aquarium when the weather is bad. We did",
          "This zoo was spectacular. So well laid out so that you can see the animals up close and personal from many different angles, yet the animals have large habitats. The aquarium was amazing. This is going to be the place we go annually when we visit our son in Des Moines.",
          "This Zoo is the best and you will want to go several times a year so you can see it all and participate in all their offerings. The Zoo pass pays for itself usually after 1 trip!",

          "We recently visited family in Omaha. They strongly recommended seeing the zoo while there. Great suggestion. The zoo is ranked one of the best in the world. The unique design and fast displays kept us busy for hours. You get so close to the animals and everything is so well",
          "I\u2019m impressed with the ingenuity of the designers at this zoo. There is literally something for everyone. We are used to the KC zoo which is underwhelming for the most part so Omaha\u2019s is remarkable in comparison. In addition to the train, carousel type things every zoo has, they",

          "Very beautiful and clean. The animals all seemed content and well taken care of. Even though the park was still taking Covid precautions, it was well worth the visit. If I stay in Omaha, I will definitely buy season passes. I probably only got to see only 1/3 of what the zoo has to offer, and it was still amazing.",
          "Always enjoy going to the zoo, had business to handle in omaha made a family day of the zoo to make the trip for sure worth it. We were two days to early for an exhibit that is now open, sad but we are already planning our trip for next year .",

It is a nice place for kids to spend some time. The staff is nice and they take good care of the place and the animals. I would recommend.",
          "One of the best zoos in the country. We got there at opening and the timing was perfect.",

          "Zoo was amazing. Don't bother eat there. Waited in line for an hour for an ice cold burger and I'm not even exaggerating. Sent it back and they gave me the same cold burger! Horrible experience! Love the zoo though. Get there early if you want see everything.",
          "I enjoyed it while on my trip to Nebraska! Took us 4 hours to walk everything before it got uncomfortably crowded. Some things are closed right now and are listed online. However, be aware, that right now people are not very mask friendly \u2026",

          "Really big, clean and safe zoo. The aquarium was amazing",
          "The zoo was huge and super awesome. We went pretty early and most of the animals were out and about. When we went 7/23/20 a lot of stuff was closed most likely due to Covid 19 but it was still a great experience. Don't miss the aquarium. \u2026",
          "Been to quite a few zoo's but this one is a must see if you are close to it.  Drove 6.5 hrs to get here and wasn't disappointed will be back again.",

          "This is probably one of my top favorite zoos to visit. I love the aquarium tunnel! The only thing I hated was that some of the kids were rude. We had one little boy, maybe 13, they knowingly walked in front of us when I was trying to get a \u2026",
          "Huge zoo with a very good selection of animals to view. Went during the \"off season\" and still spent the entire day there. The desert dome is amazing and all of the animals appear happy and well kept. Can't wait to return during the main season to see what other exhibits will be open.",
          "Very disappointed wasn't worth the $50.00 to get in and then on top of that we drove up here from Iowa City on a motorcycle. 5 hours to come to the zoo.. everything was closed and couldn't even but a drink or ice cream, it says online that you can lock the zoo within 5 6 or 7 hours and it only took us an hour very disappointed..",
          "This zoo is wonderful! I've been visiting it for the last 15 yrs and watching it grow and expand has been great fun. It's large enough to spend a whole day there with the kids. The jungle and aquarium are my favorite places.",
          "One of the best Zoos in the country!",
          "Our large party of 15 arrived at our reserved arrival time if 9:00 and we stayed until 4:00. We were disappointed that the restaurant and several of the exhibits weren't opened,  but we still had a wonderful time with the family.  Petting & \u2026",
          "We all loved the sharks and big fish at the aquarium. Also the giraffes, elephants, and gorillas were fun to watch.My grandsons loved the sharks and monkeys and lemurs. Rode the tran too was a fun filled day.",
          "This place is an amazing place to be. This is world's seventh best Zoo, and once you have been there, you know this for a fact. Their specialities are their Enclosures (Desert Dome) and the Aquarium.",
          "Very big zoo. Decide what you want to cover within a days. Wide variety of wild life collection. The butterfly section is very exciting.",
          "Second only to San Diego. The Gorilla exhibit is truly amazing. The Desert dome is super cool and you can see it from miles away and when the light hits, it looks almost like Epcot. Bathrooms were kind of hard to find, but that's literally \u2026",
          "We loved the aquarium.  It was one of our favorites.  When we went they had a lot of animal's not out. Only one elephant.  No zebras or lions or cheetahs. Some other animals  weren't out. Buildings besides the aquarium were closed.",
          "Good zoo not everything is open at the moment with COVID-19 but also not to busy.",
          "I love the desert dome and rainforest exhibit. There's so many cool things to experience here. I do wish the staff took better precautions with cleanliness, though. Maybe wipe down the glass that's covered in handprints and require more sanitation and social distancing.",
          "Amazing place.  Some exhibits closed due to the plandemic. Lots of changes since the last time we visited in 2014. All for the better. Will return again someday.",
          "Have been here many times over the years.  A couple of times a few years. There always seems to be something new almost every year. The whole family always has a great time enjoying the zoo.",
          "Great experience. Moving through went much faster with the thinner crowds. Not all eateries are open, but there are enough to keep you refreshed and energized.",
          "Definitely the best zoo I have ever been to. Wide open animal enclosures allow for great views of the animals! The variety of animals to see is also impressive!",
          "It was good. Definitely not the best zoo in the country and a little overhyped in our opinion...at least on the day we went. Several of the exhibits had one animal and some were just empty. Still some cool stuff to see and not a bad way to spend the day but it\u2019s NOT 5 stars in my opinion.",
          "One of the largest Zoo in the world. You should have atleast 1 day to surf it. Very well maintained and proper information of everything . No need to hire a guide. Summer will be the best season to visit.It is 1-2 miles near Omaha Airport.",
          "Eh. It was ok. I heard a lot of hype from a lot of people that its 1 of the best n the country. Not sure what zoos they have been to to compare, but this one didnt rate that high for me. A lot was still closed due to Covid, so hoping that \u2026",
          "An annual trip for us.  Outstanding zoo!",
          "My second time at the Omaha zoo went with my wife our children and grand kids I was telling my grandchildren how IMPORTANT ZOO'S are to preserving, breeding, and protecting animals from extinction I was very pleased with the zoo there's \u2026",
          "Always a great experience at the Henry Doorly Zoo! They are forever expanding and improving their exhibits. Overall fun and enjoyment for all ages.",
          "Amazing zoo and aquarium. Plenty to see and do. Definitely an all day adventure. Exhibits are all well maintained, though some are undergoing renovations for next year. The Ghouls and Glow event was definitely a great event as well. The lantern area in the Children's Maze was awesome.",
          "The zoo is constantly updating and changing exhibits. We havent been there for a while, so it seemed like lots of changes. While some of the exhibits were still closed, there is still a lot to see. Bring your walking shoes, it's a lot of \u2026",
          "So much to see and do - you could easily spend a few days here and take your time. Always super clean. I wish the big cats were out more! We've found becoming members is a great value for our family. When school is in session it's quiet and the perfect place to bring little ones.",
          "The zoo was really neat! It would have been nice to know that the exit was about 1/2 mile from the entrance, where we parked. I'm still giving 5 stars because they have done the best they can reopening, just wished we would have known about the parking situation.",
          "I've been hear so many times, there isn't anything that I havent seen.  Our whole family loves going to the place.  One of the best zoos in the country!!",
          "Very fun with lots of animals to see! Friendly staff",
          "Me and my boyfriend came down looking forward to the zoo, we\u2019ve been a couple other times and we both enjoyed it, this time not so much. I understand having restrictions because of COVID, however they have closed many of the attractions \u2026",
          "I loved the experience of getting to go and see all the animals from all over the world! The animals were taken good care of, and the paths and walkways were clean, safe, and great for strollers. Whether an adult or a child, you'll love the experience of going through this zoo :) .",
          "Very hot, make sure to bring water and your masks. Masks required to enter any of the buildings, lots of food stands shut down -understandably so- Enjoyed our day there but left early due to lack of food/water stands, kiddos got grumpy. Gift shop was great tho!!",
          "This zoo is amazing and i love coming here! The admission is decently cheap and the employees really care for their zoo. The animals look well feed and cared for, plus they have a wide array of animals. The zoo is beautiful, clean, and they \u2026",
          "We love coming here with our family and friends. Always fun and they continue to improve the zoo as well to make it more accommodating to parents who have kids at any age with them. As long as we live close, we will continue to get the pass every year!!",
          "Everything in the concessions are overpriced and they don't taste outstanding or anything. The admission is pricey as well, but if you plan to become a regular, purchasing a membership will help. Other than that, it's a great place for fun \u2026",
          "Best Zoo in the world. Bar none! No question about it.  Amazing place and worth 5x the cost of admission.",
          "Having been to other big zoos in North America, this is the best zoo so far in terms of reception by kids, cleanliness, facilities, and variety of animal species. I will definitely come back.",
          "An amazing zoo! Worth the price. Be sure to bring extra money, you are going to want it.",
          "Oh. My. Goodness. Best zoo I've been to so far. The only downside is, it's so big we couldn't get through it all in one day. The aquarium alone is worth it, though.",
          "This was the best zoo I've ever been to!! So modern,  clean and well layed out! Nicely done! With new areas to come!!",
          "Great experience even with covid-19 going around. Would be amazing to have it more open but it's good to be safe than sorry!! Flawless experience and I hope they put up more misters. Those really helped!",
          "What a great zoo! Was only there for one day but could have spent another! So many different and unique displays and exhibits!",
          "Henry doorly is amazing. After i went here, i havent enjoyed another zoo as mich as this one. The thought and effort that goes into the animal exhibits is astounding. Would recommend anyone to go here. Its an all day outing and well worth it!",
          "Went this weekend because they are supposed to enforce a mask policy when indoors and encourage masks outdoors, however that was not the case. For some background my mother and I are both immuno-comprimised so if we get the virus we would \u2026",
          "Best zoo I've been to so far and I've been to many. Friendly employees always there to help if needed. Do to the covid its not all open but still worth going I say. Planning on going back soon!",
          "This place was truly amazing! We went in the fall so everything was not open but honestly just three buildings themselves were worth it.  My kids loved the Lied jungle, desert dome, and the aquarium. If we were here in the summer with all \u2026",
          "Great experience! Vast amounts of attractions to see. Everything is costly. User experience needs more attention.",
          "I have  always loved the Zoo. I buy the pass. I take my own food. What a way to spend  your day or a couple of hours by yourself , with family   a friend, unlimited,  use your imagination.",
          "The Omaha Zoo is one of the best places to visit, and being a Patron member allows us to partake in great events like a preview of the zoo before it opens to the general public on June 1st.\n\nKudos to the zoo for finding a way to open during this pandemic and still provide a quality experience!",
          "I drove from Kansas City to visit the zoo. We visited on June 10th and it was by far the worst! We have been here before 12 years ago and it was amazing, but what we saw (which was VERY few animals) was BEYOND disappointing!!! I would not \u2026",
          "This was a fun place. So open , not crowded",
          "I love this place! The food is one of a kind and the animals seem like they are well being and in good condition. The attractions are great also. It seems that everytime i visit the zoo there is something new! Overall this is a great place to go, you could spend a whole day there and not want to leave.",
          "Very expensive and half the exhibits were closed. They should at least give a discount based on what's open. It's a LOTOf walking to to see exhibit closed signs",
          "Can never go wrong with the Omaha Zoo! It's well worth the trip! Kids enjoy it just as much as the parents do! Hope the splash pad opens this year!",
          "This is our favorite zoo in the US! My son and I have been here a few times, and it gets better with each visit. There are so many unique animals and exhibits. The desert dome feels like desert, the swamp feels like you are walking through \u2026",
          "Of course this zoo is amazing! 17$adults 11$kids It\u2019s the worlds best! And we even got to pet and feed stingrays for only 3$ worlds biggest desert dome! Inside jungle with no bars between you and animals! IMAX theatre and lots of food options. It\u2019s top of the line",
          "Can't wait for all the stuff to be back available to the public, but still great place to get out and be adventurous.",
          "Too much walking to see all the animals.  Too many hills",
          "Great zoo! One of the top in the world! Have a little bit if something for everyone.  Highly suggest.  Could easily take 2 days to see, 1 for all the inside stuff and another for outside stuff.  Lots of good food and sights.",
          "This zoo is phenomenal! The only drawback is that you will be ruined for all other zoos after this experience. Arrive early; parking can be tricky and some exhibits like the desert dome and aquarium get crowded. Plenty of outdoor and indoor \u2026",
          "Fairly modern enclosures. Animals looked healthy. Limited information about animals. Lots of construction going on. Limited access to buildings due to Covid precautions.",
          "Month of Sep is too hot to visit but it is worth for money",
          "My mother, niece, and I took my 2-year-old to the zoo for the first time. He loved it. This is a beautiful zoo, with a lot to do and see. There is a lot of construction going on, but it did not interfere with any of the open exhibits and is \u2026",
          "Amazing zoo that is affordable, fun, family friendly, and easy to walk. The annual pass is a steal if you have younger kids. Lots of events for both families and for adult's only.\n\nThe zoo is world class and it shows. Having visited several \u2026",
          "Awesome zoo. It was pretty hot so some of the animal were tucked away in the shade but I can't really blame them for that. Brought our own water bottles and refilled them at the refill stations so you don't have to buy $5 water. We spent \u2026",
          "I can't believe what they have done to this place. It is really wonderful to see the animals in their own habitats. The vegetation is incredible as well. This has to be one of the premier zoos in the country.",
          "Absolutely lovely place. Exhibits are well maintained and immersive.  I've never had a bad visit here.",
          "Amazing place! Truly deserving of being one of the best zoos in the world. They are adopting better display practices by keeping large cats in much larger exhibits and have done well in their newer Asian Highlands exhibit. The aquarium is \u2026",
          "Amazing place to visit. You might want to plan for more than one day, especially with children.  The play areas for kids is simply an entire day by itself. Also, we saw tons of animals. Even when they were sleeping we saw then. Try have free roaming animals as well.  My daughter loved the experience and we will be going back.",
          "I've loved this zoo so much since I was a kid I even worked there for a time, still love it! Especially the new areas.",
          "Remember the first Jurassic Park movie? When they start past the gates and the voice over their radio talks about all the different things they should be seeing at certain points... yet they see nothing.  Most of our day was spent like \u2026",
          "It's always an amazing adventure and I always see something that I have never seen and the staff are very helpful and informative can't wait till they open all the attentions if you ever have a chance to visit I promise the memory will be one you will never forget",
          "A great zoo! I've been to about 15 different zoos in the US and this one is pretty close to becoming my favorite! Lots to do and see. Absolutely LOVE the children's area and the splash pad. We spent the day here and there was not enough \u2026",
          "Fantastic zoo, one of the best places to visit in Omaha. I highly recommend it to anyone in the area.",
          "I have to admit this is a great zoo, it will physically kick your butt if you don't plan a path through it, but has a great assortment of exhibits and different views of animals.\n\nAlso animals seem cared for, seemed very active and playful, \u2026",
          "Wonderful place. Many places to sit and cool down. Friendly staff and the animals all look beautiful.",
          "You can honestly vibe in this zoo.  They've made several remodels and additions over the past years since I last visited the zoo.  Dealing with covid, the zoo does a good job or trying to constantly remind everyone of 6 foot and making sure \u2026",
          "Our trip to the Omaha  Zoo. This is the best zoo I have been to in my opinion.  Their prices on food and drinks are high but have other great adventures for the family. The water park, play area and animals are super cool. Their sky lift was amazing and long too. Gave you great advantages for photos. Wonderful  zoo!",
          "Great zoo, they have handicap chairs you can rent, and see the whole place. Definitely worth seeing.",
          "Another cool zoo, lots of different animals and cool exhibits. The Desert Dome was my favorite place there. The zoo is pretty expansive so be prepared to walk a lot. Some of it was under construction so it wasn't as impressive as I thought it would be.",
          "Because of covid not everything was accessible and open.  But there was plenty to see.  I would love to see more water bottle refill stations on the property.  It's far too hot to not have refill services accessible.",
          "The area is huge. I heard people compare it to the SanDiego zoo. Which I could see that from the exhibits....but I think it was just too early in the year for the animals to come out fully. San Diego still is number one to me. I gave it a \u2026",
          "One of the best zoos in the world. Varieties of species.",
          "Best place to go during a weekend. We got a lot of fun over there and enjoyed the huge number of animals. This place worth your visit, and explore insects world in the butterfly and insects pavilion, exploring the wild animals in door and \u2026",
          "No better way to spend either a Saturday or even just a quick trip to see the gorillas, amazing creatures. Sometimes if I have a early day from work the wife and I sneak over quick. Ha ha. Family memberships are well worth it. And includes theater also.",
          "One of the best zoos in the country many new attractions and animals as well. Fun for the entire family.",
          "I took the Union Pacific train ride first as I wanted to see the \" big picture \" of what I wanted to visit. Besides my dad worked for them. After taking the round trip ride. I decided to start at the geodesic dome which housed a lot of \u2026",
          "There is a reason this zoo is the best in America! Just love it! There has been a lot of construction over the past few years (and that will continue in 2019) but it is all to continue to make the zoo better. One of the first animals you \u2026",
          "One of the best zoos I\u2019ve ever been to. Huge! And the landscaping is beautiful",
          "Great all the way around love the family fun",
          "Great day at the zoo! We couldn't go in my favorite building, I'm sure due to covid. :(",
          "This zoo tops all the zoos I have  visited so far. There is lots to do here.",
          "We arrived at 12pm. \nWe started at the desert dome. That alone was sooooooo gigantic. And it took us close to an hour. \nWe ended up leaving at 6. Everything was closed already.. we didn't even get to see everything.\nThe zoo itself was absolutely AMAZING and I can't wait to go back when it warms up!!!",
          "A great zoo, well worth your time",
          "This zoo is rated 5 stars for a reason. There is something for everybody there, its beyond kid friendly. They have anything and everything you could want to. We have seasonal passes there and they are worth every penny. Its our favorite \u2026",
          "We travel a little under 3 hours every summer to go to Omaha's zoo!!! First of all for those who do not know if you have a zoo membership elsewhere that may get you a discount for their daily prices!! ***Worth checking into!!*** such a \u2026",
          "Website doesn't mention that over half of the attractions are closed. You can only walk and  see the safari part of the zoo. None of the inside attractions where open. Which is fine but should be posted on there website. Admission prices are the same for seeing only a third of the zoo.",
          "Such an amazing zoo! A must see when in Nebraska!",
          "Such an amazing zoo and it just keeps getting bigger and better. I'd suggest planning on going from open to close. Also if you don't like crowds go during the off season. The zoo today was hardly busy and allowed for great views of the animals",
          "Truly an incredible zoo. I've once said that if you seen one zoo, you've seen them all. Well I have never been so glad to have been proven wrong. Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo is amazing.",
          "They revamped the outside of the aquarium and it looks great! Always a good time.",
          "Normally 5 stars, but during restrictions of covid its not quite as fun.  Still highly recommend.",
          "I've been going to this zoo for years and I love that its always changing to better the life of its animals!",
          "Fun zoo time. They take precautions for Covid. The skylift & some exhibits were closed though :(",
          "We drove from Kansas City Missouri to Omaha excited to finally see the zoo other's have highly spoke of.  This zoo was such a disappointment in addition to a waste of time and money.  We recently visited the Kansas city zoo and had an \u2026",
          "One of the best zoos in the country. I have been to the San Diego Zoo and the National Zoo in Washington DC and would rank the Omaha Zoo overall better than both of them. Not to mention all the other zoos I have visited.",
          "The Covid restrictions have closed a lot of what makes the zoo stand out from other zoos. The theater, desert dome, aquarium and part of the rainforest are open though and are still worth a visit.",
          "Had a blast! All the animals seemed happy and well fed, we saw multiple caregivers giving animals snacks and special attention throughout the day.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the good is SO PRICEY!  However, you can bring \u2026",
          "Omaha\u2019s Zoo and Aquarium is probably the best tourist attraction in the city.   If you wanted to see everything, including all of the indoor exhibits, ride the train and catch a film you could easily spend the entire day there.  Definitely \u2026",
          "So much fun! If you get a chance to go to one of their excellent zoo brews or one of the very fun sleepovers, I highly suggest it! The sleepover was an incredible experience and worth every penny!! I can\u2019t wait to see what new and fun \u2026",
          "Amazing zoo! Spent all day and still missed one exhibit, there's so much to see and do! Stingray beach was my favorite because you get to pet them and they are like little sea puppies! To be safe I'd say to try to go 2 days in order not to rush and be able to see everything. Had such a good time, would definitely go back again!",
          "Always incredible. Plan accordingly. Eat the pretzel at the savanna. The aquarium is the best in the region. The zoo is one of the best in the country. Bring towels and a swimsuit for the kids in the summer. Do the splash park and adventure trails when it is warm!",
          "One of the best Zoos I\u2019ve been too. The animals had great, natural environments and seemed happy!",
          "My family loves going to our zoo.  There is something for everyone my Granddaughter loves the big slide and the stream in the adventure area. We get a z pass every year so we can go anytime we want for however long we want. Highly recommend this to everyone and be sure and not miss the carousel",
          "It is for everyone enjoyment, family friends fun time",
          "It was a tiring time but interesting as well.",
          "Lots of construction and closed exhibits, but the zoo is always a good time.  They're working hard to put good exhibits out and give guests a positive experience while keeping guests and animals safe!",
          "There was a lot of kid friendly activities and very helpful staff. The family loved every moment of it.",
          "I have always heard this was a great zoo and after visiting, it lived up to expectations.  We ended up buying a yearly pass because  we were so impressed! Lots of places to go to the bathroom and get food.   I loved the aquarium and the \u2026",
          "I've been coming to this zoo for years! With the world's largest indoor desert dome it's top notch and yes it's in Nebraska! Rated one of the best in this United States. Come see why!! remember good quality customer service? They got it \u2026",
          "Had a great time visiting the zoo and Nebraska. \nWe really enjoyed the way the zoo was designed. One is able to view the different sections indoors and outdoors. I have visited several zoo's, but none laid out in this manner. \nVisitors are \u2026",
          "It\u2019s clean, they do awesome animal shows! This zoo offers train rides, tram ride, and a sky lift! There is a huge play area for kids at the lower entrance, the animals are clean and well taken care of. It\u2019s really fun to look at the animals. There are imax movies to watch! Just  enjoy yourself!",
          "This is probably the best zoo I\u2019ve ever been to. It\u2019s over 7 acres and has every animal capable of being in a zoo in its natural habitat. Do not miss out on the Lied Jungle, which was my favorite. They\u2019ve setup trees which are indigenous to \u2026",
          "Needs more shaded areas if they expect people to walk up all those hills the misting spots are nice but if its really hot need more shade. Nashville zoo has foliage covering there walk ways and it's amazing. Don't get me wrong the Omaha zoo \u2026",
          "Over of the largest and  interesting zoo I've ever visited. The indoor rainforest and desert environment was mesmerizing and extensively detailed. A lot of exhibits were closed due to construction. I only wished staff would've posted area \u2026",
          "Very Clean and great variety of animals to see",
          "Seriously one of my favorite places. Always seem to have something new. Even if it's cold or rainy out there are lots of things inside to do. Go all year round. Was my first time going since the Asian highlands has fully opened and it is \u2026",
          "Great zoo! It was rainy, but there is so much to see, and it was really well done.",
          "Wish the trip was a little better, a lot of exibits are closed due to covid.  No aquarium or dome. And a lot of things are under construction. Hope it changes soon so our family can experience what everyone talks about. They probably should reduce tickets to half price. definitely not worth full price right now.",
          "Really nice zoo. Kids loved it.",
          "So glad we have access to such a great zoo! Very well-kept and clean, overall awesome experience. I would recommend avoiding food options as they are a bit pricey and are very subpar.",
          "I've grown up here in Omaha and go to the zoo at least twice a year.  One of my favorite places in Omaha and so many good memories here.  There is so much to see it's hard to fit it all in on one trip!  Definitely a great place to go with friends, take your kids, or go on a date!",
          "My family loves to go to zoos, and this is definitely the best we have ever been to. They have an amazing array of animals, and we saw many that we have never seen before. The Desert Dome has to be the coolest exhibit that I have ever seen! There are so many things to see that we could barely fit it into one day!"

The garden also features a parking garden and arrival garden with annual and perennial flowers. The festival garden, with colorful annual plantings and open lawn expanses, is the site of several annual events; the Victorian garden combines characteristics of both English and Victorian gardens; the Song of the Lark Meadow is reminiscent of Nebraska's prairies and is filled with wildflowers and the 4-acre (1.6 ha) arboretum and bird sanctuary contains seven regional plant communities and demonstrates how to attract and identify Midwestern birds. In 2003, the woodland trail, which winds through a native hardwood community and features hilltop overlooks, and the Garden in the Glen, a space with a stream, pools and small waterfalls, were dedicated. A rose garden staircase and woodland waterfall were 2004 additions. The Sunpu Castle Gate and Mt. Fuji replica were constructed on the site of the future Japanese garden in 2005, and the tree peony garden and English perennial border were installed in 2006. In 2007, the model railroad garden opened in July with an expansion opening in June 2008. The Garden of Memories opened in the Spring 2009.\nOpen since October 2001, the 32,000-square-foot (3,000 m2) visitor and education center includes a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) floral display hall, an education wing containing two classrooms, and one of the region's only horticultural libraries. Additionally, the visitor center houses the great hall, community room, caf\u00e9, and gift shop. The floral display halls holds three major floral shows per year; the fall chrysanthemum festival, holiday poinsettia show, and spring bulb show.  The vaulted glass roof of the center, standing 65 feet (20 m) tall, makes it the predominant visible feature from the westbound lanes of Interstate 80 as travelers cross the Missouri River into Nebraska.\nThe Marjorie K. Daugherty Conservatory, a $20 million greenhouse addition, opened in 2014.Today, the site thrives near downtown Omaha. The garden hosted 220,000 visitors in 2015 and currently has more than 12,000 member households and 250 regular volunteers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in the United States\nLauritzen Corporation\nKenefick Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Awesome grounds. Though I was disappointed the indoor domed area was closed. Perhaps, it was noted on their website before purchasing my tickets for a specific arrival time, but I didn't see it. The rest of the grounds are just breathtaking. Great place to take in Mother",
          "This is a wonderful outdoor experience for families. Easy walking, lots to see. It is much larger than it looks, so plan for a couple hours. The conservatory was not open, now was the tram running, due to the pandemic, so we will have to go back to check that out. There is a",

          "The glass house and the smaller gardens are quite nice. The Bonsais were nice, though I'm uncomfortable with the concept of it. Walk all the way to the Japanese garden. The added attractions are the 2 plinthed locomotives and the miniature railway. It'd be good if the cafe had",

          "I absolutely love the grounds of Lauritzen Gardens. The walkways are mostly paved and wide enough for 5 people to walk side by side. There are hidden spaces that are a joy to experience. There is an outdoor miniature train exhibit that is three layers high. You can walk below,",
          "There were some flowers and plants to look at but many of the garden exhibits were far past their prime outdoors. They added mums to give it some color but I would have enjoyed it far more in the summer. The indoor tropical exhibit was still great though.",

          "We took the tram ride, it saved a lot of walking in the 93 degree weather. The flowers-plants were nice, but the hi-lite for me was the garden railroad set up. I even was invited into the hollow tree control room and repair shop, for a look around The indoor glass buildings",

          "We came here to see the giant locomotives, but spent most of our time on the trolley tour seeing the beautiful gardens. Did not have time to explore more widely as one of the party is not a good walker, but would happily come back for another visit in a different season were it",
          "Worth the time! Very pretty and well taken care of. We decided to do this instead of the zoo, and we were happy with our decision. The gift shop and cafe are nice. We walked the whole way, but there is a trolley to ride for a small price.",
          "We visited Lauritzen Gardens again this year for my son\u2019s 17th bday (he\u2019s a photography enthusiast). The beauty of the gardens is refreshing & a must see.

          "Beautiful gardens in a peaceful setting. Not far from Henry Doorly zoo and the old market. There is an informative tram ride through the property for an additional fee or you can walk the trails on your own. My husband and I walked the entire place in about two hours but you",
          "We visited on a hot morning, but were able to stay in shade much of the time. The gnomes they have hidden all around the grounds seem to be very engaging to kids and adults, alike. The huge greenhouse is also very impressive.",

          "I'll tell you right off the bat, the day we went to Lauritzen, it was super-duper hot. Could this be why there were hardly any flowers? Perhaps. But, I expected more from a place that specializes in botanical gardens. The most flowers we saw was right at the entrance.",
          "My family and I have a year pass for the Lauritzen Gardens. We love to go throughout the year to see the changes in the plants. My kids love the train garden. The staff does a great job of keeping the place looking fresh and tidy too. There are also a lot of great seasonal",

          "It was hot and humid, but there is a lot of shade, which made it tolerable. Nicely laid out, very well kept gardens. The miniature train was really neat! I do wish there were more benches around, as those with walking issues would find it difficult without being able to sit",
          "I'm a photographer who has never met the flower he didn't like. Thus for me any visit here in any season is a photo op. We do have a family membership and need only an hour to get here. Rather than try to write a lot of words I am attaching pictures that I think tell the story",

          "If you enjoy walking in nature, you have an excellent place for a stroll. So many magnificent plants, trees and more. The theme of Christmas was in full view. The poinsettias were unbelievable. I believe there are twenty eight varieties on display. The model trains put a smile",
          "Have been here at different times of the year. The most recent was over Thanksgiving. The Poinsettia Tree is breathtaking and the other touches make it a fun place to be. They bring in the trains to add to the Christmas touch. The gift shop also has a holiday touch as does",
          "I can\u2019t believe we waited so long to get down to see the conservatory. We are members, but somehow hadn\u2019t been there for a couple of years. We\u2019ve visited the gardens numerous times over the years and always enjoy it. The conservatory houses so many wonderful tropical plants,",

          "Went with my adult family, which isn't offered as a choice. We took the tram first, learned the layout and background of the gardens. Then we walked it. I'm sure this place is gorgeous in late spring and summer. Though still beautiful, the only color we saw was in the",
          "Loved the gardens and tram ride. It's not a hugh place but we felt we got our money's worth and would go again. Even at the middle to end of October there were still flowers to be seen. The Japanese gardens will be beautiful when they are finished.",
          "The mums were beautiful. The garden is truly one of the real gems of Omaha. There\u2019s something for everyone with the inside areas, the walking loops and the seasonal flowers.",
          "Since we were here in Oct there were very little flowers in bloom (basically roses only) but it was still a nice place to walk around. The Japanese garden is going to look great next year. We went on the outside woods trail and saw a bunny, a big fat red squirrel, and a snake :)",
          "We are patrons and love to visit Lauritzen Gardens. Our last list was three weeks ago and it was lovely and very peaceful. They do a great job with maintaining and improving the gardens. We love to walk and also take the tram. We thinks this is one of Omaha's best attractions.",

          "Easy to find as it is well signed on the main highways. It is close to the Zoo. It was a nice place to spend a few hours. You will be given a printed map but we paid an extra few bucks & did the tour. The tram will take you around the gardens & highlighted areas. It will stop &",

          "A beautiful garden area right in the middle to downtown off I-80.. There is a lot of variety and some flowers I haven't seen before. It is a BIG place with lots of walking so would suggest to take the free transportation thru the grounds... NOT really the place for those with",

          "If you like botanical gardens then this one won't disappoint. Be prepared to walk long distances but that's what you'd expect. The Japanese Garden is under development rather pitiful at the moment, don't bother walking to the far reaches of the property to reach it. I liked",

          "First time here. Seems like they have many activities going on during the summer. This day was corn festival, they had samples out and cute signs with jokes walking down into the garden. Being my first time, I look the 50 minute tram for $3 (+ admission) near close. Can't see",
          "What an amazing secret find! Been to Omaha several times and never known about this wonderful garden. Flowers and plants everywhere. Had some really unusual foods made out of sweet corn including peppers with the corn. Would highly recommend this wonderful Hidden Gem.",

          "Looking for the \"Big Boy\" Engine (which sits on top of the hill overlooking the Gardens) the Glass domes of Lauitzen looked too good to ignore. The \"Amazing Stinko\" was about to flower (so entry was free) when we visited so the Gardens were swamped with visitors. No problem",
          "We went in the very early spring, so there wasn't a lot outdoors on display or visible at that time of year. The indoor stuff was beautiful and the Lego statues and d ministrations were amazing!!",
          "The gardens put their best foot forward for railroad day and I would guess at least 15,000 people took advantage there were several train layouts to be seen",
          "We visited the gardens in July of 2017 , took the tram ride, and thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon walking through the gardens. If I lived in the area I would certainly become a member . This Botanical Garden has a lot to offer. I definitely recommend a visit here if you have a",

          "Still romantic after visiting multiple times. We always enjoy the garden. Our favorite Garden there is the Japanese Garden and the Tropical Garden. The only 2 down sides is that there are not many bathrooms and they do no accept reciprocal s from other gardens. Tip: the 2nd",
          "One could wander for several hours through these beautiful gardens. There also is a wooded trail that seemed to go on forever, so we turned back because we intended also to visit the Zoo which is only a short distance away. Thanks to the season in Nebraska, the roses still",

          "We were there for the Railroad Days Festival. Because of that the tram was not running. We were very disappointed about that. The gardens are all along a bluff with steep hills and spread out over 100 acres. We were also kind of disappointed in the children's garden area.",
          "I can honestly say this was the first botanical garden I have ever been too. It was absolutely amazing! We rode the tram, that took us over the 100 acres and it was about 50 mins long with a 10 mins break. I will definitely go back to this place if ever given the chance.",

        "wiki": "Heartland of America Park is a public park located at 800 Douglas Street in downtown Omaha, Nebraska. The 31-acre (130,000 m2) park is situated between Interstate 80 and the Missouri River, and is adjacent to Gene Leahy Mall and the Old Market and connects to Lewis & Clark Landing. Where the park sits has been the site of exploration, expansion and now, recreation. Lewis and Clark reportedly discovered conspicuous earthen mounds when they explored the location in 1804. Historians speculate the mounds may have been natural or the remains of an Otoe village. Opened in 1990, the park was built on  recovered after the controversial demolition of the Jobbers Canyon Historic District. The area, filled with warehouses dating to the 1870s, was integral to the growth and development of Omaha.\n\n\n== About ==\nAlong with the lake the park features a paved walking trail encircling area. There are three fountains, including a large, modern, $1.5 million computerized fountain that projects water 300 feet (91 m) into the air and features a nighttime light show. The lake has a tour boat named the General Marion, with rides available in the summertime, and resident swans named Romeo and Juliet in honor of the play. There is also a monument to the 1898 Trans-Mississippi Exposition, and the late 1800s Waterworks Fountain, once located at the Webster Station, a railroad depot in North Omaha. The park is the site of the annual Taste of Omaha event.ConAgra Foods is located on the south end of the lake, and recently, after initially cutting off access to the south end of the park, ConAgra opened the walking path all the way around the lake.If you stay on the path around the lake, and cut through underneath the structural awning on the northwest side of the lake, the total distance around is .96 miles.\n\n\n== See also ==\nParks in Omaha, Nebraska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nModern photo of the Waterworks Fountain\njpg of water fountain in the park",

          "My wife and I have always enjoyed this park. Over the last few years it's started to feel a bit sketchy, so we go here only during daylight which is too bad since the lights are worth hanging out and seeing.

        "wiki": "The Durham Museum (formerly known as the Durham Western Heritage Museum) is located at 801 South 10th Street in downtown Omaha, Nebraska. The museum is dedicated to preserving and displaying the history of the United States' western region. The museum is housed in Omaha's former Union Station.\n\n\n== History of the Museum ==\nIn 1971 after the establishment of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (now Amtrak), Union Pacific Railroad closed Union Station. The first suggestion in print that the building be used as a museum appeared in the Public Pulse of the World Herald on April 5, 1971 in a letter from John Edward Peterson. He suggested that either the City of Omaha or Joslyn purchase the building and develop it into a museum. He wrote, \"Maybe the Union Pacific would be willing to sell the station rather cheaply or even donate it.\" The station was donated to the City of Omaha in 1973 and two years later the Western Heritage Museum opened.  The museum closed from 1995 to 1996 for a $22 million renovation project largely funded by Charles and Margre Durham.  For their contributions on the project, the Western Heritage Museum was renamed the Durham Western Heritage Museum the following year.  On April 6, 2008 the Durham Western Heritage Museum became the Durham Museum.  The change was driven by recent partnerships Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress and the National Archives which have provided the museum with a larger range of exhibits and programming not limited to western heritage. The museum is an affiliate within the Smithsonian Affiliations program.\n\n\n== Byron Reed Collection ==\n\nAccording to experts, \"Byron Reed was one of the greatest collectors of the 19th century,\" with a reputation as a numismatist that is \"largely unrecognized.\" According to Larry Wilson, a historian and numismatic researcher for the Independent Coin Grading Service, \"The exhibit is an environmental museum where the visitors walk through a replication of the original Byron Reed Library. The coins are displayed in beautiful dark wooden cases that give the visitors the sense they are part of the exhibit. It gave me the feeling I was back in the 1880s sitting in Byron Reed's library examining his coins with him. The exhibit includes an abundance of historical information on Byron Reed and the times. I know visitors will be impressed with the quality of the exhibit and the magnificence of the coins displayed.\" Donated to the City of Omaha upon Reed's death, today the collection is housed at the Durham Museum.\n\n\n== Trish and Dick Davidson Gallery (Track Level) ==\nThe Trish & Dick Davidson Gallery has a variety of transportation and commerce exhibits. Bekins Moving & Storage restored 1922 Mack flatbed truck and wall displays tell the story of one of Omaha's great companies. Buffett Grocery Store replica store front of the original Buffett Grocery Store that opened in 1915. Drew's Antiques are some of the finest antiques from the Museum's collections. O Scale Model Train has layout with a depot and diorama that represents Union Pacific's double track main line from Omaha to Ogden during the 1950s.\nThe following train cars and locomotives are on display:\n\nUnion Pacific 1243 Steam Locomotive (c1890)\nUnion Pacific 25559 Caboose (1962)\nUnion Pacific 1202 Pullman Sleeper \u201cNational Command\u201d (1956)\nSouthern Pacific 2986 Lounge Car (1949)\nPullman Observation Car \u201cCornhusker Club\u201d  (1924)\nOmaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company Streetcar\nAn authentic streetcar that took people through the neighborhoods of Omaha during the 1940s.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Omaha\nUnion Station (Omaha)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDurham Museum",

          "We have loved being members for many years but will be dropping our membership. The temporary exhibits lately have had a strong politically left slant. The museum is gorgeous and does such a fine job of telling Omaha's history. Why does everyone feel compelled to make a",
          "The Pulitzer exhibit that they have there currently is worth the admission alone. This is a very powerful display of photographs that everyone should go see. The rest of the museum is very neat as well with many different train types and local history of the area.",
          "Looking Fresher Than Ever In May, I was back to Omaha, and also to the Durham Museum (nee the Western Heritage Museum), which is located in the old Union Station, in downtown Omaha, just off of 10th Street, and the Railroad viaduct. This was my third visit, since about 2014,",
          "I have been to The Durham Museum in the past but did not remember the place. I went again to take my 82 year old father since it was something he could do to keep busy. We were both enthralled with their new display of the Pulitzer Prize winning photos. It was heartbreaking but",
          "Great old and well restored art deco building. There are a few permanent exhibits and some activities for kids. My suggestion is keep an eye on the schedule and visit during one of the regularly held special exhibitions that you are interested in. Easy parking and reasonable",
          "The Durham Museum is absolutely spectacular. Housed in the former Omaha Union Station, the building itself is an architectural gem. They just don't build them like this anymore. You can just feel the history from the moment you enter the doors. It makes you wish you could travel",
          "When we have out of town guests the Durham is a must see for local history. Our family enjoyed several hours of the beauty of the art deco main floor, as well as early Omaha local cultural and history You can walk through a train, sit on a street car, stroll through",
          "We weren't sure exactly what to expect when we heard the words, \"Train Museum\", but the Durham Museum was that and a whole lot more. It was really the history of Omaha and the plains of Nebraska, and a step back in time. I loved the soda fountain, and actually sat on a stool",
          "My (also single) girlfirend and I get a joint annual memebership-$55.00 and both of us use the pass to see the exhibits we like and take new friends with us as a guest. At Christmas we have gone to see the tree for 25years with our children, who are now grown and still go with",
          "We had a group of 10 and arrived to see the Christmas tree and al the decorations. They were preparing for a wedding that evening and the staff was rolling out tables and setting up chairs and did not care that there as people trying to view the tree and take pictures. We were",
          "We took our grandson to see the train. He enjoyed going inside of them and we also saw the huge Christmas tree!! It is a great place to go during the winter months when there is not much else to do.",
          "A wonderful building beautifully preserved. A true gem for the Omaha area. The picture might be a little deceiving. There is a downstairs area where the actual train station was with awesome train cars that you can walk through. Well worth the trip if you're in the Omaha",
          "It\u2019s located in a strange area but I had a nice time here. The train cars are cool to see, the museum is interesting and large, and there\u2019s a cute soda shop inside to check out.",

          "I am so happy that this building has been so well preserved to take visitors back to the era of train travel. We went to the Durham to see a special exhibit on race and one on rock and roll, thinking that we would be in and out in a couple of hours. Wrong. The exhibits we went",
          "First impression, it\u2019s beautifully crafted. It has a small museum shop which unfortunately doesn\u2019t have much but its ok. The train station is quite big and has a lot of unique historical items. It was very nice and I would recommend it. Also now in the month of December they",

          "This is one of the better museums we have visited and we have been to all of the lower 48 states. The first floor hall really gives you a feel of what it was like to travel by train back when that was really the only efficient way to travel. The lower level has lots of cool",

          "Give yourself plenty of time to go through the museum. It will take several hours. If you have children ages 2 to 8, plan on spending time in the train area downstairs. Children just love the trains, and they can even go inside the trains, and walk all around them. They will",
          "It was a rainy day so I decided to stop here on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed walking around and the architecture is amazing. The displays are very informative and kept my attention. They also have real train cars that are a lot of fun for families.",

          "Great for the whole family very educational yet fun - You could easily spend a whole winter day there !",
          "The trains were great, the rest was nothing much to see. I feel the price was quite high for the collection on display.",

          "very interesting place to visit great displays the coin collection was extremely interesting the exhibits do change which is great",
          "To go into the Dunham is stepping back in time. Lives it. If you are a lover of classic movies 30 / 40 / early 50 you will enjoy going to the Dunham. Imagine sitting waiting for your train to take you to a trip across the county. Waiting for your soldier to come home from",
          "The museum is in a beautiful building. Very well maintained. There are nice old trains to see and walk through. Most of the exhibits mean more to the people who live in the area than the visitor. A lot about their history. But it was nice to see it. There were more things",

          "We visited the Durham Museum on free root beer float day! Yummy. The station is set up just like it was when it was at its peak operating time - World War II. There is a soda fountain where you can get delicious fountain treats. The railroad cars are in the downstairs section",
          "The beautiful upper level, the well-preserved and well-presented Union Station, is a poignant place in Omaha and national history. The main portion of the museum, however, is in the Lower Level, occupying about three times the square footage of the Upper Level. It is an eclectic",
          "The upstairs has been restored. Beautiful! The statues were fun to interact with. The dinosaur exhibit downstairs was amazing! Walking through the old trains was fun for the kids. There was a guy in the train car that was super friendly! He had lots of Omaha history information",
          "While not the most *exciting* stop in Omaha, the museum is worth the trip, if only to take a momentary step back in time. The echoed halls of the train station are your first stop, and the retro appeal extends to the ticket-booth turned gift shop and vintage soda fountain.",
          "The trolley tours are informative, educational, and fun. ALL of them are great with volunteers who are very knowledgeable. The museum itself is well maintained, excellent exhibits and many traveling exhibits that are well worth your time.",

          "We have a membership (for the last several years) and bring out-of-town visitors to this museum frequently. The train history and the full scale train alone are worth the stop in.",
          "Was not quite sure what to expect when I came to this highly rated museum but I did not expect what I found. The museum occupies an unused train station. But what a station. When you first enter the museum you are essentially entering the ground floor of the old station that",

          "This building inside and outside is lovely and the displays explain the building materials and what you might call a little eye trickery. The train cars are a big hit and many of the displays keep children in mind. Of course the dinosaurs are terrific. I learned things from all",
          "The Durham is in a classic early turn of the century pre art deco style Americana style of architecture train station. It is beautiful. There is a small gift shop which didn't appeal to me and a old fashioned style soda shop where you can get drinks, sweets and light meals.",
          "e were in Omaha having lunch & my husband surprised me with a visit to your museum which I've talked about for years. I'm a big fan of Art Deco & preservation of historic structures so I must've taken 1,000 photos! Even the air vents were pieces of art! I put myself in the shoes",

          "This is one of those typical, generic, stuffy museums with dark spaces and stale air that has so called art from before nineteenth century. It is suffocating. There was a modern art gallery and that was a breath of fresh air. The museum is free so it did not hurt too much.",
          "The museum is chock full of Omaha history, which makes it so fascinating. One of my favorite things is the railroad car that you can walk through and see what train travel used to be like.It was fun looking at the prices on the menu in the dining car - $1.25 for filet Mignon!",
          "Recently visited THE DURHAM MUSEUM and realized how magnificent this historical, art deco building is. THE MUSEUM incorporated a lot of traveling exhibits that has wide appeal to everyone. The lower level has a permanent exhibit of turn-of-the-century Omaha as well as restored",

          "Located in the Union Pacific railway station, this museum is a great place to learn about Omaha history. The varied statutes around the station personify the experience and transport visitors back in time. The restored train cars on the platform level below were excellent.",
          "This place is mind blowing. So beautifully designed. So well maintained. When I checked out places on Trip Advisor, it showed this as a place to visit and suggested buying tickets in advance. I tried buying and Trip Advisor indicated a sold out situation. I called the museum",
          "We love train stations, even the ones that don\u2019t function as train stations any longer. This former train station is beautiful inside with sculptures of people waiting for trains,buying tickets, etc. On the street level you have the former waiting area, a working soda fountain",

          "A rainy day in Omaha, and we wanted to do something inside. Several local people had highly recommended this museum for its elements of transportation. I liked that concept. But it turns out this museum is so much more. Yes, it is very cool to see the steam engine, caboose,",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Joslyn Art Museum is the principal fine arts museum in the state of Nebraska, United States of America.  Located in Omaha, it was opened in 1931 at the initiative of Sarah H. Joslyn in memory of her husband, businessman George A. Joslyn. It is the only museum in the state with a comprehensive permanent collection, and although it includes works from Paolo Veronese, El Greco,  Titian, among others, its greatest strengths are the outstanding art collections of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries of American and European artists such as Pierre-Auguste Renoir and William-Adolphe Bouguereau.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1928, Kiewit started construction of the museum. Opening on November 29, 1931, as a gift to the people of Omaha from Sarah H. Joslyn in memory of her husband, George A. Joslyn; It occupies a large and impressive Art Deco building designed by John and Alan McDonald, constructed of Georgia Pink marble, with 38 different marbles from all over the world in the interior, close to downtown Omaha.  The decorative panels on the exterior were designed by sculptor John David Brcin and refer to the peoples of the plains - the original Native American inhabitants and the later European explorers and settlers.  Inscriptions carved on the building were written by Hartley Burr Alexander. A substantial extension, designed by Lord Norman Foster, opened in 1994.In 2008, construction began on the Joslyn Sculpture Garden. The garden opened in summer 2009 featuring work from local and national artists as well as a reflecting pool and waterfall. Shortly after its opening, the garden hosted the 24th annual Jazz on the Green festival which it hosted until 2010 when Omaha Performing Arts began producing the event and moved it to the Midtown Crossing at Turner Park which could development to better accommodate the growing event.  The free eight-week festival features locally, regionally, and nationally-known jazz musicians and draws thousands of spectators who can sit on the lawn with picnic snacks to enjoy the performances.\nIn May 2013, the Museum stopped charging general admission, again providing free access to the public as it had done from its opening until the mid-1960s.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe permanent collections of the Joslyn Art Museum are:\n\nAncient, including an exceptional collection of Greek pottery\nEuropean: 16th- and 17th-century works include paintings by Veronese, Titian, Claude Lorrain, Rembrandt and El Greco.  However the strongest collections are from the 19th century, including romantic works by Delacroix and Gustave Dor\u00e9, realist works by Corot and Gustave Courbet, and an impressionist works by Degas, Monet, Pissarro, and Renoir\nAmerican: the collection includes early American portraiture by James Peale and Mather Brown; many works by painters of the Hudson River School, realist works by Winslow Homer and Thomas Eakins, and works by the American impressionists Childe Hassam and William Merritt Chase\nWestern American: including important collections of work by the Swiss artist Karl Bodmer based on his 1832-34 journey to the Missouri River frontier, and by Alfred Jacob Miller, also illustrating the West of the 1830s.\nNative American: including both traditional works and work done under the influence of, or in reaction against, European conventions and training.\nTwentieth Century: a wide range of 20th-century painting and sculpture is represented, including paintings by Henri Matisse, Stuart Davis, Theodore Roszak, John Sloan and Robert Henri, and sculpture by Deborah Butterfield, Robert Haozous, Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt and Martin Puryear.  The collection stresses  significant American artistic movements, including regionalism (with paintings by Grant Wood and Thomas Hart Benton) and Abstract Expressionism (with work by Jackson Pollock, Hans Hofmann, and Helen Frankenthaler) and Pop Art (with work by George Segal and Tom Wesselmann).Although the best known names appear in the European and American collections, it is probably the Western American and Native American collections that have the greatest importance as collections, allowing a rare opportunity to study these genres and periods of art as well as giving an important insight into the history of the western United States.\nIn addition to its permanent collections, the museum mounts regular special exhibitions. It also serves as an important regional educational and artistic resource, and its building includes an auditorium where regular concerts are held.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nJoslyn Castle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Joslyn Art Museum at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial Joslyn Art Museum website",

        "wiki": "Omaha ( OH-m\u0259-hah) is the largest city in the state of Nebraska and the county seat of Douglas County. Omaha is in the Midwestern United States on the Missouri River, about 10 miles (15 km) north of the mouth of the Platte River. The nation's 40th-largest city, Omaha's 2019 estimated population was 478,192.\nOmaha is the anchor of the eight-county, bi-state Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area. The Omaha Metropolitan Area is the 59th largest in the United States, with an estimated population of 944,316 (2018). The Omaha-Council Bluffs-Fremont, NE-IA Combined Statistical Area (CSA) encompasses the Omaha-Council Bluffs MSA as well as the separate Fremont, NE Micropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of the entirety of Dodge County, Nebraska. The total population of the CSA was 970,023 based on 2017 estimates. Approximately 1.3 million people reside within the Greater Omaha area, within a 50 mi (80 km) radius of Downtown Omaha.\nOmaha's pioneer period began in 1854, when the city was founded by speculators from neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa. The city was founded along the Missouri River, and a crossing called Lone Tree Ferry earned the city its nickname, the \"Gateway to the West\". Omaha introduced this new West to the world in 1898, when it played host to the World's Fair, dubbed the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. During the 19th century, Omaha's central location in the United States spurred the city to become an important national transportation hub. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the transportation and jobbing sectors were important in the city, along with its railroads and breweries. In the 20th century, the Omaha Stockyards, once the world's largest, and its meatpacking plants gained international prominence.\nToday, Omaha is the home to the headquarters of four Fortune 500 companies: mega-conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway; one of the world's largest construction companies, Kiewit Corporation; insurance and financial firm Mutual of Omaha; and the United States' largest railroad operator, Union Pacific Corporation. Berkshire Hathaway is headed by local investor Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world, according to a decade's worth of Forbes rankings, some of which have ranked him as high as No. 1.Omaha is also the home to five Fortune 1000 headquarters: Green Plains Renewable Energy, TD Ameritrade, Valmont Industries, Werner Enterprises, and West Corporation. Also headquartered in Omaha are the following: First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately held bank in the United States; three of the nation's ten largest architecture/engineering firms (DLR Group, HDR, Inc., and Leo A Daly; and the Gallup Organization, of Gallup Poll fame, and its riverfront Gallup University.\nNotable modern Omaha inventions include the following: the \"pink hair curler\" created at Omaha's Tip Top Products; Butter Brickle Ice Cream, and the Reuben sandwich, conceived by a chef at the then\u2013Blackstone Hotel on 36th and Farnam Streets; cake mix, developed by Duncan Hines, then a division of Omaha's Nebraska Consolidated Mills, the forerunner to today's ConAgra Foods; center-pivot irrigation by the Omaha company now known as Valmont Corporation; Raisin Bran, developed by Omaha's Skinner Macaroni Co.; the first ski lift in the U.S., in 1936, by Omaha's Union Pacific Corp.; the Top 40 radio format, pioneered by Todd Storz, scion of Omaha's Storz Brewing Co. and head of Storz Broadcasting, and first used in the U.S. at Omaha's KOWH Radio; and the TV dinner, developed by Omaha's Carl A. Swanson.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nVarious Native American tribes had lived in the land that became Omaha, including since the 17th century, the Omaha and Ponca, Dhegian-Siouan-language people who had originated in the lower Ohio River valley and migrated west by the early 17th century; Pawnee, Otoe, Missouri, and Ioway. The word Omaha (actually Umo\u207fho\u207f or Uma\u207fha\u207f) means \"Dwellers on the bluff\".In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, including Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at a point about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabann\u00e9's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the monopoly of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park in the area in 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development.Through 26 separate treaties with the United States federal government, Native American tribes in Nebraska gradually ceded the lands that now make up the state. The treaty and cession involving the Omaha area occurred in 1854 when the Omaha Tribe ceded most of east-central Nebraska. Logan Fontenelle, an interpreter for the Omaha and signatory to the 1854 treaty, played an essential role in those proceedings.\n\n\n=== Pioneer Omaha ===\n\nBefore it was legal to claim land in Indian Country, William D. Brown operated the Lone Tree Ferry that brought settlers from Council Bluffs, Iowa to the area that became Omaha. Brown is generally credited as having the first vision for a city where Omaha now sits. The passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in 1854 was presaged by the staking out of claims around the area to become Omaha by residents from neighboring Council Bluffs. On July 4, 1854, the city was informally established at a picnic on Capital Hill, current site of Omaha Central High School. Soon after, the Omaha Claim Club was formed to provide vigilante justice for claim jumpers and others who infringed on the land of many of the city's founding fathers. Some of this land, which now wraps around Downtown Omaha, was later used to entice Nebraska Territorial legislators to an area called Scriptown. The Territorial capitol was in Omaha, but when Nebraska became a state in 1867, the capital was relocated to Lincoln, 53 miles (85 km) south-west of Omaha. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled against numerous landowners whose violent actions were condemned in Baker v. Morton.Many of Omaha's founding figures stayed at the Douglas House or the Cozzens House Hotel. Dodge Street was important early in the city's early commercial history; North 24th Street and South 24th Street also developed independently as business districts. Early pioneers were buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery and Cedar Hill Cemetery. Cedar Hill closed in the 1860s and its graves were moved to Prospect Hill, where pioneers were later joined by soldiers from Fort Omaha, African Americans and early European immigrants. There are several other historical cemeteries in Omaha, historical Jewish synagogues and historical Christian churches dating from the pioneer era, as well. Two sculpture parks, Pioneer Courage and Spirit of Nebraska's Wilderness and The Transcontinental Railroad, celebrate the city's pioneering history.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe economy of Omaha boomed and busted through its early years. In 1858, the Omaha Daily Republican was founded by the Omaha Printing Company (rebranded Aradius Group, 2016), it was Nebraska's first regional newspaper\u2013founded before Nebraska claimed statehood. Omaha was a stopping point for settlers and prospectors heading west, either overland or by the Missouri River. The steamboat Bertrand sank north of Omaha on its way to the goldfields in 1865. Its massive collection of artifacts is on display at the nearby Desoto National Wildlife Refuge. The jobbing and wholesaling district brought new jobs, followed by the railroads and the stockyards. Groundbreaking for the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1863, provided an essential developmental boom for the city. In 1862, the U.S. Congress allowed the Union Pacific Railroad to begin building westward railways; in January 1866 it commenced construction out of Omaha.The Union Stockyards, another important part of the city's development, were founded in South Omaha in 1883. Within 20 years, Omaha had four of the five major meatpacking companies in the United States. By the 1950s, half the city's workforce was employed in meatpacking and processing. Meatpacking, jobbing and railroads were responsible for most of the growth in the city from the late 19th century through the early decades of the 20th century.Immigrants soon created ethnic enclaves throughout the city, including Irish in Sheelytown in South Omaha; Germans in the Near North Side, joined by the European Jews and black migrants from the South; Little Italy and Little Bohemia in South Omaha. Beginning in the late 19th century, Omaha's upper class lived in posh enclaves throughout the city, including the south and north Gold Coast neighborhoods, Bemis Park, Kountze Place, Field Club and throughout Midtown Omaha. They traveled the city's sprawling park system on boulevards designed by renowned landscape architect Horace Cleveland. The Omaha Horse Railway first carried passengers throughout the city, as did the later Omaha Cable Tramway Company and several similar companies. In 1888, the Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company built the Douglas Street Bridge, the first pedestrian and wagon bridge between Omaha and Council Bluffs.Gambling, drinking and prostitution were widespread in the 19th century, first rampant in the city's Burnt District and later in the Sporting District. Controlled by Omaha's political boss Tom Dennison by 1890, criminal elements enjoyed support from Omaha's \"perpetual\" mayor, \"Cowboy Jim\" Dahlman, nicknamed for his eight terms as mayor.Calamities such as the Great Flood of 1881 did not slow down the city's violence. In 1882, the Camp Dump Strike pitted state militia against unionized strikers, drawing national attention to Omaha's labor troubles. The Governor of Nebraska had to call in U.S. Army troops from nearby Fort Omaha to protect strikebreakers for the Burlington Railroad, bringing along Gatling guns and a cannon for defense. When the event ended, one man was dead and several were wounded. In 1891, a mob hanged Joe Coe, an African-American porter after he was accused of raping a white girl. There were also several other riots and civil unrest events in Omaha during this period.\nIn 1898, Omaha's leaders, under the guidance of Gurdon Wattles, held the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, touted as a celebration of agricultural and industrial growth throughout the Midwest. The Indian Congress, which drew more than 500 American Indians from across the country, was held simultaneously. More than 2 million visitors attended these events at Kountze Park and the Omaha Driving Park in the Kountze Place neighborhood.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nWith dramatically increasing population in the 20th century, competition and fierce labor struggles led to major civil unrest. In 1900, Omaha was the center of a national uproar over the kidnapping of Edward Cudahy, Jr., the son of a local meatpacking magnate.The city's labor and management clashed in bitter strikes, racial tension escalated as Blacks were hired as strikebreakers, and ethnic strife broke out. A major riot by earlier immigrants in South Omaha destroyed the city's Greek Town in 1909, completely driving out the Greek population.The civil rights movement in Omaha has roots that extend back to 1912, when the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People west of the Mississippi River was founded in the city.The Omaha Easter Sunday Tornado of 1913 destroyed much of the city's African-American community, in addition to much of Midtown Omaha.Six years later, in 1919, the city was caught up in the Red Summer riots when thousands of whites marched from South Omaha to the courthouse to lynch a Black worker, Willy Brown, a suspect in an alleged rape of a white woman. The mob burned the Douglas County Courthouse to get the prisoner, causing more than $1 million damage. They hanged and shot Will Brown, then burned his body. Troops were called in from Fort Omaha to quell the riot, prevent more crowds gathering in South Omaha, and to protect the Black community in North Omaha.The culture of North Omaha thrived throughout the 1920s through 1950s, with several creative figures, including Tillie Olsen, Wallace Thurman, Lloyd Hunter, and Anna Mae Winburn emerging from the vibrant Near North Side.Musicians created their own world in Omaha, and also joined national bands and groups that toured and appeared in the city.\n\nAfter the tumultuous Great Depression of the 1930s, Omaha rebounded with the development of Offutt Air Force Base just south of the city. The Glenn L. Martin Company operated a factory there in the 1940s that produced 521 B-29 Superfortresses, including the Enola Gay and Bockscar used in the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.The construction of Interstates 80, 480 and 680, along with the North Omaha Freeway, spurred development. There was also controversy, particularly in North Omaha, where new routes bisected several neighborhoods. Creighton University hosted the DePorres Club, an early civil rights group whose use of sit-in strategies for integration of public facilities predated the national movement.Following the development of the Glenn L. Martin Company bomber manufacturing plant in Bellevue at the beginning of World War II, the relocation of the Strategic Air Command to the Omaha suburb in 1948 provided a major economic boost to the area.From the 1950s through the 1960s, more than 40 insurance companies were headquartered in Omaha, including Woodmen of the World and Mutual of Omaha. By the late 1960s, the city rivaled, but never surpassed, the United States insurance centers of Hartford, Connecticut, New York City and Boston.After surpassing Chicago in meat processing by the late 1950s, Omaha suffered the loss of 10,000 jobs as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. The city struggled for decades to shift its economy as workers suffered. Poverty became more entrenched among families who remained in North Omaha.\nIn the 1960s, three major race riots along North 24th Street destroyed the Near North Side's economic base, with recovery slow for decades. In 1969, Woodmen Tower was completed and became Omaha's tallest building and first major skyscraper at 478 feet (146 m), a sign of renewal.\n\nSince the 1970s, Omaha has continued expanding and growing, mostly to available land to the west. West Omaha has become home to the majority of the city's population. North and South Omaha's populations continue to be centers of new immigrants, with economic and racial diversity. In 1975 a major tornado, along with a major blizzard, caused more than $100 million in damages in 1975 dollars.Downtown Omaha has since been rejuvenated in numerous ways, starting with the development of Gene Leahy Mall and W. Dale Clark Library in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, Omaha's fruit warehouses were converted into a shopping area called the Old Market.\nThe demolition of Jobber's Canyon in 1989 led to the creation of the ConAgra Foods campus. Several nearby buildings, including the Nash Block, have been converted into condominiums. The stockyards were taken down; the only surviving building is the Livestock Exchange Building, which was converted to multi-use and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.A historic preservation movement in Omaha has led to a number of historic structures and districts being designated Omaha Landmarks or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of the push toward preservation came after Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the largest-ever National Register historic district in the United States, a record that still stands as of 2013. The Jobbers Canyon Historic District, along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city's historic district. The Jobber's Canyon warehouses had before then been allowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless population that had come to live in the abandoned buildings. At the time, there were no plans in place for revitalizing the buildings.In the 1980s and 1990s, Omaha also saw major company headquarters leave the city, including Enron, founded in the city in 1930 and taken to Houston in 1987 by the now-notorious Kenneth Lay. First Data Corporation, a large credit-card processor, also was founded in Omaha in 1969; as of 2009, its headquarters are in Atlanta.\nInacom, founded in Omaha in 1991, was a technology company that customized computer systems for large businesses, and was on the Fortune 500 list from 1997 until 2000, when it filed for bankruptcy. Northwestern Bell, the Bell System affiliate for Northwestern states, had its headquarters in Omaha from its founding in 1896 until it moved to Denver in 1991 as US West. Level 3 Communications, a large Tier 1 network provider, was founded in Omaha in 1985 as Kiewit Diversified Group, a division of Kiewit Corporation, a Fortune 500 construction and mining company still headquartered in Omaha; Level 3 moved to Denver in 1998. World Com was founded by a merger with Omaha's MFS Communications, started as Metropolitan Fiber Systems in 1993. MFS, backed by Kiewit Corporation CEO Walter Scott and Warren Buffett, purchased UUNET, one of the largest Internet backbones in the world, for $2 billion in 1996. The now-infamous Bernie Ebbers purchased the much larger MFS for $14.3 billion in 1997 under his World Com. He moved headquarters of the merged company from Omaha to Mississippi.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nAround the start of the 21st century, several new downtown skyscrapers and cultural institutions were built. One First National Center was completed in 2002, surpassing the Woodmen Tower as the tallest building in Omaha as well as in the state at 634 feet (193 m). The creation of the city's new North Downtown included the construction of the CenturyLink Center and the Slowdown/Film Streams development at North 14th and Webster Streets. Construction of the new TD Ameritrade Park began in 2009 and was completed in 2011, also in the North Downtown area, near the CenturyLink Center. TD Ameritrade Park is now the home of the College World Series, an event tourists flock to each year.\nNew construction has occurred throughout the city since the start of the 21st century. Important retail and office developments have occurred in West Omaha such as the Village Pointe shopping center and several business parks including First National Business Park and parks for Bank of the West and C&A Industries, Inc and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and several others. Downtown and Midtown Omaha have both seen the development of a significant number of condominiums in recent years. In Midtown Omaha significant mixed-use projects are underway. The site of the former Ak-Sar-Ben arena has been redeveloped into a mixed-use development Aksarben Village. In January 2009 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska announced plans to build a new 10 story, $98 million headquarters, in the Aksarben Village, completed in Spring 2011. Gordmans is also building their new corporate headquarters in Aksarben. The other major mixed-use development is Midtown Crossing at Turner Park. Developed by Mutual of Omaha, the development includes several condominium towers and retail businesses built around Omaha's Turner Park.The Holland Performing Arts Center opened in 2005 near the Gene Leahy Mall and the Union Pacific Center opened in 2004.\n\nThere have also been several developments along the Missouri River waterfront in downtown. The Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge was opened to foot and bicycle traffic on September 28, 2008. Started in 2003, RiverFront Place Condos first phase was completed in 2006 and is fully occupied and the second phase was opened in 2011. The development along Omaha's riverfront is attributed with prompting the City of Council Bluffs to move their own riverfront development time line forward.In the summers of 2008, 2012 and 2016 the United States Olympic Team swimming trials were held in Omaha, at the Qwest/Century Link Center. The event was a highlight in the city's sports community, as well as a showcase for redevelopment in the downtown area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nOmaha is located at 41\u00b015\u2032N 96\u00b00\u2032W. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 130.58 square miles (338.20 km2), of which 127.09 square miles (329.16 km2) is land and 3.49 square miles (9.04 km2) is water. Situated in the Midwestern United States on the bank of the Missouri River in eastern Nebraska, much of Omaha is built in the Missouri River Valley. Other significant bodies of water in the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area include Lake Manawa, Papillion Creek, Carter Lake, Platte River and the Glenn Cunningham Lake. The city's land has been altered considerably with substantial land grading throughout Downtown Omaha and scattered across the city. East Omaha sits on a flood plain west of the Missouri River. The area is the location of Carter Lake, an oxbow lake. The lake was once the site of East Omaha Island and Florence Lake, which dried up in the 1920s.\nThe Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area consists of eight counties; five in Nebraska and three in Iowa. The metropolitan area now includes Harrison, Pottawattamie, and Mills Counties in Iowa and Washington, Douglas, Sarpy, Cass, and Saunders Counties in Nebraska. This area was formerly referred to only as the Omaha Metropolitan Statistical Area and consisted of only five counties: Pottawattamie in Iowa, and Washington, Douglas, Cass, and Sarpy in Nebraska. The Omaha-Council Bluffs combined statistical area comprises the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan statistical area and the Fremont Micropolitan statistical area; the CSA has a population of 858,720 (2005 Census Bureau estimate). Omaha ranks as the 42nd-largest city in the United States, and is the core city of its 60th-largest metropolitan area. There are no consolidated city-counties in the area; the City of Omaha studied the possibility extensively through 2003 and concluded, \"The City of Omaha and Douglas County should merge into a municipal county, work to commence immediately, and that functional consolidations begin immediately in as many departments as possible, including but not limited to parks, fleet management, facilities management, local planning, purchasing and personnel.\"Geographically, Omaha is considered as being in the \"Heartland\" of the United States. Important environmental impacts on the natural habitat in the area include the spread of invasive plant species, restoring prairies and bur oak savanna habitats, and managing the whitetail deer population.Omaha is home to several hospitals, mostly along Dodge St (US6). Being the county seat, it is also the location of the county courthouse.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nOmaha is generally divided into six geographic areas: Downtown, Midtown, North Omaha, South Omaha, West Omaha, and East Omaha. West Omaha includes the Miracle Hills, Boys Town, Regency, and Gateway areas. The city has a wide range of historical and new neighborhoods and suburbs that reflect its socioeconomic diversity. Early neighborhood development happened in ethnic enclaves, including Little Italy, Little Bohemia, Little Mexico and Greek Town. According to U.S. Census data, five European ethnic enclaves existed in Omaha in 1880, expanding to nine in 1900.Around the start of the 20th century. the City of Omaha annexed several surrounding communities, including Florence, Dundee and Benson. At the same time, the city annexed all of South Omaha, including the Dahlman and Burlington Road neighborhoods. From its first annexation in 1857 (of East Omaha) to its recent and controversial annexation of Elkhorn, Omaha has continually had an eye towards growth.Starting in the 1950s, development of highways and new housing led to the movement of the middle class to suburbs in West Omaha. Some of the movement was designated as white flight from racial unrest in the 1960s. Newer and poorer migrants lived in older housing close to downtown; those residents who were more established moved west into newer housing. Some suburbs are gated communities or have become edge cities. Recently, Omahans have made strides to revitalize the downtown and Midtown areas with the redevelopment of the Old Market, Turner Park, Gifford Park, and the designation of the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District.\n\n\n=== Landmark preservation ===\n\nOmaha is home to dozens of nationally, regionally and locally significant landmarks. The city has more than a dozen historic districts, including Fort Omaha Historic District, Gold Coast Historic District, Omaha Quartermaster Depot Historic District, Field Club Historic District, Bemis Park Historic District, and the South Omaha Main Street Historic District. Omaha is notorious for its 1989 demolition of 24 buildings in the Jobbers Canyon Historic District, which represents to date the largest loss of buildings on the National Register. The only original building surviving of that complex is the Nash Block.\nOmaha has almost one hundred individual properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Bank of Florence, Holy Family Church, the Christian Specht Building and the Joslyn Castle. There are also three properties designated as National Historic Landmarks.Locally designated landmarks, including residential, commercial, religious, educational, agricultural and socially significant locations across the city, honor Omaha's cultural legacy and important history. The City of Omaha Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission is the government body that works with the mayor of Omaha and the Omaha City Council to protect historic places. Important history organizations in the community include the Douglas County Historical Society.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nOmaha, due to its latitude of 41.26\u02da N and location far from moderating bodies of water or mountain ranges, displays a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa). July averages 76.7 \u00b0F (24.8 \u00b0C), with average relative humidity around 70% which then leads to relatively frequent thunderstorms. Temperatures reach 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) on 29 days and 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) on 1.7 days annually. The January daily average is 23.5 \u00b0F (\u22124.7 \u00b0C), with lows reaching 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) on 11 days annually. The lowest temperature recorded in the city was \u221232 \u00b0F (\u221236 \u00b0C) on January 5, 1884, and the highest 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on July 25, 1936. Average yearly precipitation is 30.6 inches (777 mm), falling mostly in the warmer months. Snow is the most common precipitation in winter, with average seasonal snowfall being 28.7 inches (73 cm).\nBased on 30-year averages obtained from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center for the months of December, January and February, Weather Channel ranked Omaha the 5th coldest major U.S. city as of 2014.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 408,958 people, 162,627 households, and 96,477 families residing in the city.

The city of Omaha was established by white settlers from neighboring Council Bluffs who arrived from the Northeast United States a few years earlier. While much of the early population was of Yankee stock, over the next 100 years numerous ethnic groups moved to the city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Omaha's population as 96.4% White and 3.6% Black. Irish immigrants in Omaha originally moved to an area in present-day North Omaha called \"Gophertown\", as they lived in dug-out sod houses. That population was followed by Polish immigrants in the Sheelytown neighborhood, and many immigrants were recruited for jobs in South Omaha's stockyards and meatpacking industry. The German community in Omaha was largely responsible for founding its once-thriving beer industry, including the Metz, Krug, Falstaff and the Storz breweries.\nSince its founding, ethnic groups in the city have clustered in enclaves in north, south and downtown Omaha. In its early days, the sometimes lawless nature of a new frontier city included crime, such as illicit gambling and riots.\nIn the early 20th century, Jewish immigrants set up many businesses along the North 24th Street commercial area. It suffered with the loss of industrial jobs in the 1960s and later, the shifting of population west of the city. The commercial area is now the center of the African-Americans community, concentrated in North Omaha. The African American community has maintained its social and religious base, while it is experiencing an economic revitalization.\nThe Little Italy neighborhood grew south of downtown, as many Italian immigrants came to the city to work in the Union Pacific shops. Scandinavians first came to Omaha as Mormon settlers in the Florence neighborhood. Czechs had a strong political and cultural voice in Omaha, and were involved in a variety of trades and businesses, including banks, wholesale houses, and funeral homes. The Notre Dame Academy and Convent and Czechoslovak Museum are legacies of their residence. Today the legacy of the city's early European immigrant populations is evident in many social and cultural institutions in Downtown and South Omaha.\nMexicans originally immigrated to Omaha to work in the rail yards. Today they account for most of South Omaha's Hispanic population and many have taken jobs in meat processing. Other large early ethnic populations in Omaha included Danes, Poles, and Swedes.\nA growing number of African immigrants have made their homes in Omaha in the last twenty years. There are approximately 8,500 Sudanese living in Omaha, including the largest population of Sudanese refugees in the United States. Most have immigrated since 1995 because of warfare in Sudan. They represent ten ethnic groups, including the Nuer, Dinka, Equatorians, Maubans and Nubians. Most Sudanese people in Omaha speak the Nuer language. Other Africans have immigrated to Omaha as well, with one-third from Nigeria, and large populations from Kenya, Togo, Cameroon and Ghana.With the expansion of railroad and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many immigrants and migrants. As the major city in Nebraska, it has historically been more racially and ethnically diverse than the rest of the state. At times rapid population change, overcrowded housing and job competition have aroused racial and ethnic tensions. Around the start of the 20th century, violence towards new immigrants in Omaha often erupted out of suspicion and fear.In 1909, anti-Greek sentiment flared after increased Greek immigration, and worsened their tendency to become strikebreakers. The killing of a policeman of Irish descent enraged the Irish community; an angry mob violently stormed the Greek neighborhood in Omaha in what would become known as the Greek Town Riot. That mob violence forced the Greek immigrant population to flee from the city. By 1910, 53.7% of Omaha's residents and 64.2% of South Omaha's residents were foreign born or had at least one parent born outside of America.Six years after the Greek Town Riot, in 1915, a mob killed Juan Gonzalez, a Mexican immigrant, near Scribner, a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an Omaha Police Department officer investigated a criminal operation that sold goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. Racial profiling targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the Elkhorn River, where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. It was discovered Gonzalez was unarmed, and he had a reliable alibi for the time of the murder. No one was ever indicted for his killing.In the fall of 1919, following Red Summer, postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of African Americans as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching Willy Brown and the ensuing Omaha Race Riot. Trying to defend Brown, the city's mayor, Edward Parsons Smith, was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.Like other industrial cities in the U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in all, as the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area if they could get to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems.\nDespair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.\nWhites in Omaha have followed the white flight pattern, suburbanizing to West Omaha. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, gang violence and incidents between the Omaha Police and Black residents undermined relations between groups in North and South Omaha.\n\n\n==== Latinos in Omaha ====\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAccording to USA Today, Omaha ranks eighth among the nation's 50 largest cities in both per-capita billionaires and Fortune 500 companies. With diversification in several industries, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, architecture/construction, and transportation, Omaha's economy has grown dramatically since the early 1990s. In 2001 Newsweek identified Omaha as one of the top 10 high-tech havens in the nation. Six national fiber optic networks converge in Omaha.Omaha's most prominent businessman is Warren Buffett, nicknamed the \"Oracle of Omaha\", who is regularly ranked one of the richest people in the world.

Its principal tourist attractions are the Henry Doorly Zoo and the College World Series. The Old Market in Downtown Omaha is another major attraction and is important to the city's retail economy. The city has been a tourist destination for many years. Famous early visitors included British author Rudyard Kipling and General George Crook. In 1883 Omaha hosted the first official performance of the Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show for 8,000 attendees. In 1898 the city hosted more than 1 million visitors from across the United States at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, a world's fair that lasted for more than half the year.Research on leisure and hospitality situates Omaha in the same tier for tourists as the neighboring cities of Des Moines, Iowa; Topeka, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Denver, Colorado; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A recent study found investment of $1 million in cultural tourism generated approximately $83,000 in state and local taxes, and provided support for hundreds of jobs for the metropolitan area, which in turn led to additional tax revenue for government.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nSeveral national newspapers, including the Boston Globe and The New York Times  have lauded Omaha's historical and cultural attractions.\nThe city is home to the Omaha Community Playhouse, the largest community theater in the United States. The Omaha Symphony Orchestra and its modern Holland Performing Arts Center, the Opera Omaha at the Orpheum theater, the Blue Barn Theatre, and The Rose Theater form the backbone of Omaha's performing arts community. Opened in 1931, the Joslyn Art Museum has large art collections. Since its inception in 1976, Omaha Children's Museum has been a place where children can challenge themselves, discover how the world works and learn through play. The Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts, one of the nation's premier urban artist colonies, was founded in Omaha in 1981, and the Durham Museum is accredited with the Smithsonian Institution for traveling exhibits. The city is also home to the largest singly funded mural in the nation, \"Fertile Ground\", by Meg Saligman. The annual Omaha Blues, Jazz, & Gospel Festival celebrates local music along with the Omaha Black Music Hall of Fame.\nIn 1955, Omaha's Union Stockyards overtook Chicago's stockyards as the United States' meat packing center. This legacy is reflected in the cuisine of Omaha, with renowned steakhouses such as Gorat's and the recently closed Mister C's, as well as the retail chain Omaha Steaks.\n\n\n=== Henry Doorly Zoo ===\n\nThe Henry Doorly Zoo is widely considered one of the premier zoos in the world. The zoo is home to the world's largest nocturnal exhibit and indoor swamp; the world's largest indoor rainforest, the world's largest indoor desert, and the largest geodesic dome in the world (13 stories tall). The zoo is Nebraska's number-one paid attendance attraction and has welcomed more than 25 million visitors over the past 40 years.\n\n\n=== Old Market ===\n\nThe Old Market is a major historic district in Downtown Omaha listed on the National Register of Historical Places.

Omaha hosts the only Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints temple in Nebraska along with a large Jewish community. There are 152 parishes in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Omaha, and several Orthodox Christian congregations throughout the city.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nOmaha's rich history in rhythm and blues, and jazz gave rise to a number of influential bands, including Anna Mae Winburn's Cotton Club Boys and Lloyd Hunter's Seranaders. Rock and roll pioneer Wynonie Harris, jazz great Preston Love, drummer Buddy Miles, and Luigi Waites are among the city's homegrown talent. Doug Ingle from the late 1960s band Iron Butterfly was born in Omaha, as was indie folk singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, though both were raised elsewhere.\nToday, the diverse culture of Omaha includes a variety of performance venues, museums, and musical heritage, including the historically significant jazz scene in North Omaha and the modern and influential \"Omaha Sound\".Contemporary music groups either in or originally from Omaha include Mannheim Steamroller, Bright Eyes, The Faint, Cursive, Azure Ray, Tilly and the Wall and 311.

Internationally renowned composer Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote his Ninth (\"New World\") Symphony in 1893 based on his impressions of the region after visiting Omaha's robust Czech community. In the period surrounding World War I Valentin J. Peter encouraged Germans in Omaha to celebrate their rich musical heritage, too. Frederick Metz, Gottlieb Storz and Frederick Krug were influential brewers whose beer gardens kept many German bands active.\n\n\n=== Popular culture ===\nIn 1939, Omaha hosted the world premiere of the film Union Pacific and the accompanying three-day celebration drew 250,000 people. A special train from Hollywood carried director Cecil B. DeMille and stars Barbara Stanwyck and Joel McCrea. Omaha's Boys Town was made famous by the Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney movie Boys Town. Omaha has been featured in recent years by a handful of relatively big budget motion pictures. The city's most extensive exposure can be accredited to Omaha native Alexander Payne, the Oscar-nominated director who shot parts of About Schmidt, Citizen Ruth and Election in the city and suburbs of Papillion and La Vista.\nThe Looney Tunes short Boobs in the Woods featured Porky Pig revealing that he had a license to sell hair tonic to bald eagles in Omaha, Nebraska.\nBuilt in 1962, Omaha's Cinerama was called Indian Hills Theater.

The circuit returned to Omaha in 2017 with the Pinnacle Bank Championship.\n\n\n=== Recreation ===\n\nOmaha has a thriving running community and many miles of paved running and biking trails throughout the city and surrounding communities. The Omaha Marathon involves a half-marathon and a 10-kilometer (6.2 mi) race that takes place annually in September. Omaha also has a history of curling, including multiple junior national champions.\nThe city's historic boulevards were originally designed by Horace Cleveland in 1889 to work with the parks to create a seamless flow of trees, grass and flowers throughout the city. Florence Boulevard and Fontenelle Boulevard are among the remnants of this system. Omaha boasts more than 80 miles (129 km) of trails for pedestrians, bicyclists and hikers. They include the American Discovery Trail, which traverses the entire United States, and the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail passes through Omaha as it travels 3,700 miles (5,950 km) westward from Illinois to Oregon. Trails throughout the area are included in comprehensive plans for the city of Omaha, the Omaha metropolitan area, Douglas County, and long-distance coordinated plans between the municipalities of southeast Nebraska.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nOmaha has a strong mayor form of government, along with a city council elected from seven districts across the city. The mayor is Jean Stothert, who was elected in May 2013, and re-elected May 10, 2017. The longest-serving mayor in Omaha's history was \"Cowboy\" Jim Dahlman, who served 20 years over eight terms. He was regarded as the \"wettest mayor in America\" because of the flourishing number of bars in Omaha during his tenure. Dahlman was a close associate of political boss Tom Dennison. During Dahlman's tenure, the city switched from its original strong-mayor form of government to a city commission government. In 1956, the city switched back.The city clerk is Elizabeth Butler. The City of Omaha administers twelve departments, including finance, police, human rights, libraries and planning. The Omaha City Council is the legislative branch and has seven members elected from districts across the city. The council enacts local ordinances and approves the city budget. Government priorities and activities are established in a budget ordinance approved annually. The council takes official action through the passage of ordinances and resolutions. Nebraska's constitution grants the option of home rule to cities with more than 5,000 residents, meaning they may operate under their own charters. Omaha is one of only three cities in Nebraska to use this option, out of 17 eligible. The City of Omaha is considering consolidating with Douglas County government.Although registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the 2nd congressional district, which includes Omaha, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama opened three campaign offices in the city with 15 staff members to cover the state in fall 2008. Mike Fahey, the former Democratic mayor of Omaha, said he would do whatever it took to deliver the district's electoral vote to Obama; and the Obama campaign considered the district \"in play\". Former Nebraska U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and former Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama, and in November 2008 Obama won the district's electoral vote. This was an exceptional win, because with Nebraska's split electoral vote system Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win an electoral vote in Nebraska since 1964.In 2011, Nebraska lawmakers moved Offutt Air Force Base and the town of Bellevue \u2014 an area with a large minority population \u2014 out of the Omaha-based 2nd District and shifted in the Republican-heavy Omaha suburbs in Sarpy County. The move is expected to dilute the city's urban Democratic vote.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nOmaha's rate of violent crimes per 100,000 residents has been lower than the average rates of three dozen United States cities of similar size. Unlike Omaha, those cities have experienced an increase in violent crime overall since 2003. Rates for property crime have decreased for both Omaha and its peer cities during the same time period. In 2006, Omaha was ranked for homicides as 46th out of the 72 cities in the United States of more than 250,000 in population.As a major industrial city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions that came with rapid growth and the arrival of large numbers of immigrants and migrants. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.Gambling in Omaha has been an important part of the city's history. From its founding in the 1850s through the 1930s, the city was known as a \"wide-open\" town where gambling of all sorts was openly accepted. By the 1950s, at the same time large-scale restructuring of the railroads, the meatpacking industry and other sectors caused widespread job losses and unemployment, Omaha reportedly had more illicit gambling than any other city in the nation. From the 1930s through the 1970s, an Italian criminal element controlled gambling in the city.Today, gambling in Omaha is limited to keno, lotteries, and parimutuel betting. This leaves Omahans to drive across the Missouri River to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where casinos are legal and many businesses operate. Recently, the National Indian Gaming Commission approved a controversial proposal made by the Ponca tribe of Nebraska. It will allow the tribe to build a casino in Carter Lake, Iowa, which sits on the west side of the Missouri River, adjacent to Omaha, where casinos are illegal.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nOmaha has many public and private educational institutions, including Omaha Public Schools, the largest public school district in Nebraska, that serves more than 47,750 students in more than 75 schools. After a contentious period of uncertainty, in 2007 the Nebraska Legislature approved a plan to create a learning community for Omaha-area school districts with a central administrative board.The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Omaha operates numerous private Catholic schools with 21,500 students in 32 elementary schools and nine high schools. They include St. Cecilia Grade School at 3869 Webster St. in Midtown Omaha, Holy Cross at 48th and Woolworth Street in Morton Meadows, St. Robert Bellarmine School at 120th and Pacific Street and St. Stephen the Martyr School at 168th and Q Street, all of which have received the U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School award.\nThe Westside Community Schools, also known as District 66, is an award-winning district in the heart of Omaha. It serves students in pre-kindergarten through the 12th grade and recorded a district enrollment of 6,123 students K-12 for the 2015\u201316 school year.\nThrough annexations Omaha also has the Millard Public Schools and Elkhorn Public Schools.

By the middle of the 20th century, nearly every major railroad served Omaha.\nToday, the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District celebrates this connection, along with the listing of the Burlington Train Station and the Union Station on the National Register of Historic Places. First housed in the former Herndon House, the Union Pacific Railroad's corporate headquarters have been in Omaha since the company began. Their new headquarters, the Union Pacific Center, opened in Downtown Omaha in 2004.\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service through Omaha. The Greyhound Lines terminal is at 1601 Jackson St. in downtown Omaha. Megabus has a stop at Crossroads Mall \u2013 N 72nd St. between Dodge St. and Cass St. \u2013 and provides service to Des Moines, Iowa City, and Chicago. Metro Transit, previously known as Metro Area Transit, is the local bus system.\n\nOmaha's position as a transportation center was finalized with the 1872 opening of the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge that linked the transcontinental railroad to the railroads terminating in Council Bluffs. In 1888, the first road bridge, the Douglas Street Bridge, opened. In the 1890s, the Illinois Central drawbridge opened as the largest bridge of its type in the world. Omaha's Missouri River road bridges are now entering their second generation, including the Works Progress Administration-financed South Omaha Bridge, now called Veteran's Memorial Bridge, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2006, Omaha and Council Bluffs announced joint plans to build the Missouri River Pedestrian Bridge, which opened in 2008.\n\nToday, the primary mode of transportation in Omaha is by automobile, with I-80, I-480, I-680, I-29, and U.S. Route 75 (JFK Freeway and North Freeway) providing freeway service across the metropolitan area. The expressway along West Dodge Road (U.S. Route 6 and Nebraska Link 28B) and U.S. Route 275 has been upgraded to freeway standards from I-680 to Fremont. City owned Metro Transit, formerly as MAT Metro Area Transit, provides public bus service to hundreds of locations throughout the Metro.\nA 2017 study by Walk Score ranked Omaha 26th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities. Of the top 50 most walkable cities only one, Omaha, Nebraska, saw its Walk Score decline, and it only decreased 0.3 points from last year. There is an extensive trail system throughout the city for walkers, runners, bicyclists, and other pedestrian modes of transportation.\n\nOmaha is laid out on a grid plan, with 12 blocks to the mile with a north-to-south house numbering system. Omaha is the location of a historic boulevard system designed by H.W.S. Cleveland who sought to combine the beauty of parks with the pleasure of driving cars.

          "This place is a lot of fun for young kids and parents. So many different things to do and play with. I would recommend this place for anyone with kids ages 3 to 9. My 11 year old was a bit too old for most of the exhibits.",
          "Spent several hours here while in town. Kids ages 4, 6 & 8 and everyone had plenty to do. Very spacious and great staff! The exhibits were all very clean and they have nice bathrooms as well. If you have a membership to another science museum check and see if there is a",

          "I don't know if my expectations are too high, but I thought the museum was a step above a Chuckie Cheese. The place was completely chaotic and didn't feel clean, it looked like they just threw the place together without rhyme or reason. Besides the front desk employees, I only",
          "Excellent trip to the Omaha Children's Museum with my family. Tons of stuff to do for my 7 and 4 year olds. Highlights were the ball room and the mirror maze. We expected to spend a couple hours there and wound up staying the entire afternoon.",

          "Our out of town 10 & 12 year old grandchildren consider a trip to the children's musrum a must stop every summer. We are generally the 1st in and the last out 8 hours later! They LOVE the cooking, store area. However, we explore the entire museum. Upstairs is a fun unicorn",
          "Omaha Children Museum was simply good for the kiddo as he had lots of fun with all the hands-on exhibits that were featured such as the \u201cdragon\u201d story time, the carousel, and platte river water exhibit",
          "My three-and-a-half y.o. son really enjoyed the children's museum in Omaha. We spent close to 4 hours there and he would have kept going had we not had to hit the road. Lots of things to see and interact with. I'd say the magic age seems to be about 3-6 to fully enjoy the",
          "We have taken grandkids multiple times. Always have different ehibits to check out. From heavy machines to dinosaurs. Standard displays good fun too.",
          "We have a membership as we take our granddaughter there every other month or so and she delights in this place. There are usually new layouts and exhibits each time we visit. We often join other family members there with their own grandkids and we can enjoy a good visit while",
          "My 3 and 6 year old grandsons visited us for a week. The water table, garage, and dancing areas were favorites. We stayed until closing. It was pricey but this was their favorite activity from the entire week. They asked, repeatedly, if we could go back.",
          "Of course it is geared toward younger kids, but if you let your inner child out you will have a good time too. I enjoyed the ball room more than anyone else.",
          "Our favorite part of the Children's Museum is the building room. You get to go in as families and they have power tools, hand tools, crafting supplies and all types of creative ideas to help you build whatever your child's heart desires. My child would go back every day if I",
          "The kids had fun but for parents not much to do. (IT IS FOR CHILDREN) I get that however wish more for parents to do w/ kids.",
          "Enjoyed our time at the museum. Love the outside sitting area to have lunch. Many hands on activities as well as permanent displays. Price is very reasonable.",

          "This was the 2nd time we have taken our grandchildren to the museum and just wanted to review to say how wonderful it is for the children--they can run and play and use their imagination. The second time we went it was packed with kids and parents but still felt like you",
          "My 6 year old daughter had a blast! It was so hard to get her to leave! :) For $26 and 5 hours I would say it was a steal!! The carousel was our favorite and they had a perfect little snack bar to take a little breather! We stopped for the day on our way to Colorado and I'm so",
          "We really didn't know where to go first when we got there. There is so much to do and so much to see. There are lots of lights and sound and bright colors so if you have a child who is over stimulated by those things this may be overwhelming for them. My kids are 8 and 12 and",
          "Our grandkids always request a trip here when in town. It\u2019s nice they change some of the attractions but keeep the imaginative activities, like shopping, banking, cooking etc. grandparents be prepared for chaos. Lots of kids with sniffles......",
          "I have been going there for years and the improvements are amazing. My kids use to have so much fun and now my grandchildren can spend hours there. summer mornings are usually crowed, but otherwise well worth the money",
          "Had so much to do for all of my grandkids!! Very hands on stuff with lots of imagination! Kids loved the carousel.",
          "I take my granddaughter the every time there is a new exhibit. She loves to go and we have a great time it\u2019s so much fun for kids they get to do a lot of pretending and it\u2019s so cute to watch how they relate to what they are learning in life it\u2019s best to get a yearly pass if you",
          "We visited with our 18 month old. She had a blast in the area with the balls and in the area with the separate play spaces. Great for a hot or rainy day. Make sure if you are a member of your local science or children\u2019s museum you check to see if they are a partner (we got in",

          "We live in Des Moines IA but will drive over to Omaha several times a year so that our 3 year old son and 4 year old daughter can play at the children's museum. They find something new every time we go there. We have also noticed the museum does a great job of mixing up or",
          "Great place to take your kids where they can be free to be kids: touch, learn, and manipulate their environment. I didnt know we could have gotten free since we already belong to our local children's museum. So ask them before paying if they are part of reciprocity museum",
          "My kids absolutely loved the Children's Museum! There is so much to do here! They loved the dinosaurs and digging for fossils!",
          "My kids enjoy this but get pretty bored pretty quick. I have been to a lot of children's museums and I would have to say this lay out seems the one where it would be easiest to lose a kid. In fact I found a lost kid and brought her to museum staff this trip. The spaces are",
          "A must for kids to visit. They always change venues upstairs. Very impressive and entertaining for children. Highly recommended if in the Omaha area. Worth the trip if you have kids.",
          "This museum is excellent as an active learning experience. Activities change with the season. When we visited we participated in Chinese Dragon Parade! Kids of all ages loved this well supervised museum.",
          "Nice place. It\u2019s big but way to busy. When we went it was so busy you could not even walk or attempt to play. They had some cute stuff but we would have liked it better if it wasn\u2019t so busy. Maybe we just went at a bad time",
          "The Omaha Children's Museum has lots of engaging activities, plus make-believe stations. We went with our 19 month old grandchild and he was contendly busy the whole time (2 and 1/2 hours). If we lived closer, we'd definitely look into getting a year long pass as this would be",
          "Lots of great activities for our kids. They loved it. It was just very crowded over the weekend! We brought a stroller for our toddler, but it ended up being more in the way with all the people since she didn't sit in it much.",
          "I brought my family here with 2 younger children (2yr and 9yr). The kids had a great time as well as me and my wife. I would allow 3 hours at least. We would come here again if we were in the area. Tip, look into the year pass, they can be used at a lot of similar places around",

          "I used to take my kids here all the time. So many things to see and let a childs imagination run wild. If you have little ones, this is a must-do activity!",
          "This is my 2nd visit here with my young kids (aged 3 and 5) on our trip to Omaha. Overall, they loved it so much and we spend around 3 hours here. The museum has plenty of interesting exhibits and on upstairs, they currently have a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles exhibit.",
          "We don't go to the Children's Museum often, but regardless of the day we go or the time of year, it's always busy. It's so busy that it isn't fun to go. I think the entire place needs to be renovated. For the price, it should be nicer.",
          "This is the best children's museum we have been too. Everything is in great shape, and there is always something new going on. The kids beg us to bring them here!",
          "I would rate higher if the adult ticket was lower than the 2-16 yr old. Adults mostly watch their kids but still have to pay the $13 admission. Plan for $13 a head. I highly recommend 1 adult per kid if younger than 8. There were so many kids, but it was Friday and there were",
          "This is a great place for families. There are hands on activities and it's geared for elementary age children.",
          "We were in Omaha for my son\u2019s baseball tournament, but I brought my 7 year-old daughter here for a break from baseball. She loved everything there. We came right after lunch and ended up staying until it closed at 5:00. The special China exhibit was by far her favorite. We",
          "I didn't find much about this place to be a museum, more like a very busy mall play area. Don't get me wrong, my 4 year old had a lot of fun! But it was a lot to take in. So much going on and a lot of kids!",
          "This was the first time going to the museum and I was so impressed! There are so many things for the kids to do! There are activities for all ages of children! I would recommend this place to anyone with kids!",
          "we visited with my 9 year old and she had a good time. I think the museum would be great for toddlers to about 6 or so. Lots of hands on activities. Would recommend to families with younger kids. Face painting, lots of play areas, and the food was reasonable",
          "This place is so much fun for young children! Tons of different things to do and see! My kids ask to come back any time we are in Omaha!",
          "The only drawback is that it would be nice if the facility could hold more people, but I didn\u2019t feel cramped while I was there. Otherwise it was reasonably priced and there was plenty to do. I\u2019ve been to smaller children\u2019s museums that cost much more. Parking will be an issue",
          "We visited with family on a busy Saturday. It was a busy place, but with plenty of hands, we tracked our littles and had a blast. The staff was very helpful and the water was a favorite. It was clean and fun.",
          "Cold and wet outside but lots of activity going on inside the children\u2019s museum. So many things to see and do for the little ones that they can run and get lost in a jiffy. It was pretty busy there today because of the weather and that added to the fun. In addition to the",
          "This children's museum is great! There is a lot for the kids to learn. It would keep them busy for a while. I would recommend.",
          "I have so much fun at this museum everytime I go to this museum. They always have activities that are good not only for children but for adults too. Always learning. Love this museum!",
          "While some of this is just part and parcel of a typical children's museum this one could use some cleaning and some better supervision. When parents do not supervise their children it is incumbent on the management to take over. Too many running/screaming kids, not enough",
          "This two-story children's museum and play place has something for every age child. We stayed two and a half hours and there was plenty of engaging things for the kids to do. Note - The train ride and carousel rides are $2 each extra. Note 2 - Do ask for a discount if you are",
          "As a classroom teacher, we receive a grant to visit the OCM and kids love it very year! So many different activities and areas that encompass the whole child-art, music, acting, science, physical play, thematic exhibits-there is something for all kids. My son is too old to go",
          "Too many screaming kids, not enough adult supervision. They need to implement a rule about letting kids just run wild.",
          "Im a native Omahan, I remember when this place first opened. What a waste of time and money! What a GRAND surprise it is now. My grandkids could spend all day here! Interactive fun and games/crafts galore! JOIN up, you'll be back again and again!",
          "My daughter loves this place. There's a little supermarket & bank area that is really fun for them to shop around in. There's an area for the littlest kids to crawl around. They have a pneumatic balls area that shoots baseball sized plastic balls all over the place and is really",
          "Visiting Omaha for the first time we went to the Children\u2019s museum. This is a great place for children to learn and play at the same time. We really enjoyed our visit.",

          "It is nicely maintained with activities for most ages of kids. They have some Science shows, craft, panting, dancing activities going on throughout the day to keep children busy. It is conveniently located in downtown. There is one lunch place on second floor and some",
          "Lot's of things for young children to experience and enjoy. The kids will have lots of fun and adults cn enjoy it too.",
          "Ive been here twice and both times Ive seen kids in the water attractions put community water into their mouths and spit it right back into the area where kids were playing. Its nasty. Need more staff watching some of these areas to make sure they stay as hygenic as possible",
          "Both my kids, 4 and 8, enjoy spending the afternoon here. They probably would stay longer if we'd let them. There are several areas of play for different ages and generally everything is pretty clean. I wish they changed out some exhibits a bit more and introduced more",
          "My husband and I attended the Escape from Azkaban and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It's a dynamic museum, but just a bit pricey.",
          "My niece was in town to visit and we took her there, she was busy for hours. Lot's of interactive fun.",
          "Both of my kids (2 & 4 yrs old) really enjoy the visit. Plenty of learning and activity to try. Staff are very friendly and they do have a mini indoor train ride & carousel on Level 2. Restaurants also available indoor. Will visit again on next trip to Omaha.",
          "Wondefull place to take kids to play and learn. Price is nice for what you get. I stayed with my kid about 5 hours inside Children's Museum and was very nice. Parking is free and staff are very cordial and nice. There is a small cafeteria inside so you can get food with decent",
          "If you're looking at this review, you're probably looking for a place to bring your kids. Well, look no further because this is the place to go. There's plenty of interactive activities for the kids, as well as an indoor train ride and carousel. This is one of the rare times",
          "They had a lot of interactive things. My grandson (3) LOVED the barn with the corn shoot. My granddaughter (6) loved the disco area, face painting and \"ball room.\" They both enjoyed digging in the upstairs area. My biggest concern was security. You really had to keep an",
          "Fun to watch the kids just explore this place. Lots of interactive things, really gets the imagination going. Even things that will interest an adult, but more fun watching the kids minds work out the stuff.",
          "We went with our 4 kids. Ages 1-9. Wasn't much to do for 9 year old. However, the other kids had a great time! Awesome hands on activities.",
          "Our kids loved the museum. From painting on the window, the science show, the tinker lab, ball area, the grocery store, car shop and bank, there was something for them to explore at every turn! Our kids are 2, 7 and 9, and they were all able to play and have fun together!",
          "I took my kids there a couple of times just real boring won't go back there too expensive not interested",
          "I attended the Escape from Askaban event and it was exceptionally disappointing. I went to the Harry Potter event last year and it was a lot of fun. I was expecting it to be as fun, if not improved, this year. Instead the staff decided to create less activities which equaled",
          "I visited this place a few times when I was a kid. On a trip to Des Moines. My wife and I thought we would take our daughter there today. We received a discount because we have a membership to the Denver children\u2019s museum. That was a huge plus. The museum itself is very",
          "Lot of activities and children will love them. The ball area, face painting, car repair/work shop, a stage set up, a grocery store, children's hospital, arts center - all these help children to develop their imagination and skills. This place is clean, well maintained. The",
          "They are always coming up with new exhibits to show and the staples are always fun. The ball room is a favorite and the arts and craft center is great-the kids love face painting. The staff is always great with the kids and seem to really like their jobs.",
          "The museum was very good for interactivity for my 8 year old grandson. Lot's of different activities, all learning opportunities and he enjoyed them all. It was smaller than I expected. It was very loud inside so if you have little ones with sensitive ears be cautious.",
          "I love going there with family, friends, or school trips. I've been going there since they were in the old building. I had the pleasure of going twice recently, boy do they have a lot of activities!",
          "The museum is filled with fun for the young. My 10 year old became completely engaged in all the activities. She chased balls to put into tubes for hours. We went to a presentation about bubbles and played with puzzles. Her favorite activity was painting unicorns on a clear",
          "We stopped here and had a great time with all the learning opportunities the museum had to offer. My grandson especially enjoyed the balls and putting them in so many of the tubes. He also enjoyed the shopping excursion and helped him to learn about the grocery store and the",
          "Great children's museum with many activities and exibits. Filled with fun and is great for families with young kids. Very nice, but can get VERY crowded on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Right before it opens on any day though, there will be a long line out the door.",
          "You could spent all day at this attraction. no literally, if you wanted to leave and go eat and come back they they let you back in no problems, they have different areas for all ages. baby all the way to teen! we will totally be going back again",
          "I recently went with my grandchildren to the Omaha Children's Museum. Awesome place to visit and so much for the young children to do and experience. My granddaughters had so much fun playing the farm area, mowing the lawn, picking corn and stuff. They also liked the dinosaurs",
          "Loved the children's museum itself but we will not go back on the weekend again. YIKES. It was near impossible to keep track of my two kids with all the people there.",

          "We LOVED the Children's Museum. It was our 4th trip to Omaha but our first time at the museum. Brought our 1 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old and both had PLENTY to do. It was pretty busy on a Sunday, but we never had to wait and felt like we could run and play freely. The mechanical",
          "Our children had a great time on a rainy afternoon. They loved the play town, especially the grocery store, restaurant and bakery areas. The baby had fun in the baby and toddler area. The air play area with various air powered activities, many including balls was a big hit. The",
          "This place is fun for the adults too but you will look a little out of place if you don't have a kid with you! I love the museum and it is always changing so there are new exhibits all the time.",
          "I highly recommend taking the kids to Omaha Children's Museum while in the area! They have so much fun, a great learning environment and you will love watching them!",
          "My three young granddaughters greatly enjoyed the afternoon at the museum. The bubble show and the water experience were their favorite. They also liked the science area with balls and tubes of air and meeting the princess in the fairy tale area. The problems was that it",
          "We took our 5 year old grand son to the museum and he just had a whole days worth of fun in just a short amount of time. We spent 4 hours there. Its easy to get to and parking was no problem. The food at the caf\u00e9 was very questionable. That was the only downfall. Be aware that",
          "This was so nice to go too with my 2 year old she loved it!! The staff was friendly and the interactive play was awesome!!! She didn't want to leave!!!",
          "Traveling through Omaha to Denver we wanted to stop at the Omaha Children's Museum for the Dinosaur exhibit, we didn't realize that this place was amaaaazing! The staff there were ridiculously nice and accommodating, they truly wanted to make sure every kid had a great time. My",
          "This location has a great setup to allow kids to explore tons of different fun activities. It even houses a carousel and a mini train for kids to ride on ($2 per kid cost). This time we went they had a special dinosaur exhibit and our kids loved it. I would say, if the",
          "In our group we had 5 adults a a 4 year old and a 1 year old. This got a thumbs up from all of us. There is much interaction for all. This is well work the money and time if you want to spend 3 hours or possibly more letting your child have a great time no matter what their",
          "Plenty to do, see, & experience for kids infant up to about 12 years old. Photo opportunities for camera happy moms and dads. Just try to keep yourself from playing right beside your child(ren). I could not.",
          "I have taken my son to the Omaha Children's Museum at least 30 times. We went for the Christmas specials, the Halloween trick or treat nights, and just to hang around & have fun. I think his favorite was when they had the dinosaur exhibit. He's 14 now, and not much interested",
          "We have taken our son to many children's museums. I would say this is one of the better ones we have been too. It's layout is relatively simple and easy to follow your kid. The staff was amazingly attentive. I have never seen staff so engaged and taking care of things. And there",
          "My son loved it here and we were both amazed at the amount of stuff for him to do. Brilliant place for children - keeps them occupied for hours! Will be returning before we fly home. Only thing that let it down for me was that I wasn't allowed to use to wifi when it was time to",
          "It's all about hands on fun! My granddaughter who is only 2 loves this place. She is always climbing and learning. It's great fun.",
          "I love taking my grandchildren here. It is always changing so it never gets old. They love it and we are all tired by the time we leave! from all the fun activities that we can do together.",
          "This is the place like no other. Lots of activities including building, construction, water play, food store, hospital, bank and many more",
          "I stayed close by and wanted to check out the children.s museum. This was a fun afternoon for all ages with creative and educational exhibits and activities they offer. Everyone was friendly and others were all having a good time. I ended up going back to the hotel and telling",
          "My husband and I took our three year old son to explore and he loved it. There was a bit of construction going on but it didn't affect our experience. We are already planning a trip back since it's all our son can talk about! We spent over 2 hours exploring and I still feel like",
          "We spent 3 hours here and could have easily spent more. 2 floors full of activities for all ages. It was packed, but my son was still able to do almost everything he wanted to. I would definitely stop here.",
          "Great space especially for the price of a season family pass. Friendly staff and many opportunities for learning. We also do the summer classes and our kids have enjoyed everyone.",
          "There were many centers of learning/fun for the children to explore & enjoy. Time just seemed to fly!",
          "We took my 1yo and had so much fun. There is a wide variety of things to do here. My old complain is I wish that there were more staff members around. A little boy got lost and it took us a few minutes to find a staff member.",
          "I took a friend's children to it and they thoroughly enjoyed it. They enjoyed the things they could do with their hands.",
          "Was on a visit to Omaha and was recommended this by our hotel staff. With the forecast cold and wet we decided to go for it. First it is a-little expensive, but there is a lot to do when you get inside. Lots of art work and crafty things for kids to partake in. There are science",
          "Great place for kids. There are several learning/playing stations spread through two stories. Carousel and a mini train ride are extra but everything else is included with a price of admission.",
          "Went with two grandchildren, ages 2.5 and 1 years. We went on member's visiting hours. I would highly recommend going earliest you can on the day. The parking was very easy at this time too. It only gets busier. The kids enjoyed many of the activities but did't do all of them. I",
          "Took my four grandchildren there for an afternoon, and they had a great time. Ages 5,5,7, 11. There is enough \"diversity\" in the attractions to keep kids from preschool to \"tweeners\" to have a good time. Most importantly, there is plenty of bench space for Grandpa to rest his",
          "I can get into this museum because I am a member of a Science Center in another city. This is a wonderful venue for children of all ages.",
          "On our trip to see the high school state wrestling tournament we were able to spend a couple hours at the museum with our toddler. She loved all the activities and we could have easily stayed there much longer. If we lived in the area we would purchase a membership",
          "We enjoy seeing our grandson's face light up with joy and imagination at all the different areas! Go when well-rested because it's high energy when you step in the door.",
          "Have taken the Grand Kids several times over the past years. They enjoy it as I let them run loose. However, I find it very expensive. Senior rate is high and about all I do is try to find a place to sit do to medical problems. I believe the areas have gotten better as far",
          "This definitely caters more to kids 12 and under. They have special engagements that are often geared towards old crowds. You can spend as little or as much time as you want here. For younger families I'd definitely recommend a yearly pass. If there is a downside, it's parking.",
          "We enjoy this museum with our three-year-old granddaughter. She loves the hands-on crafts. They have lots of fun activities. If we lived there, we would become members.",
          "Kids love this place and all of the activity going on all around the adults will entertain you! Plan on a couple of hours for this attraction, there are picnic tables outside if you want to bring a sack lunch for the nicer days!",
          "We brought our 4 kids here ages 3 - 14 and all of them loved it! They had a great time and it was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Parking was a little difficult as all the spots in their lot were full, but we found parking across the street from their parking lot.",
          "You know i thought there would be cool technology here but it's all kinda crappy wood, plastic and paint.",
          "The Omaha Children's Museum is a great place to take children. Hands on exhibits and a large building to roam around.",
          "Great place to go with small children. I took children ranging in ages 20 months - 11 years old. The 10 and 11 year old were bored but the 20 month old, 3 year old and 5 year old had a great time. Lots of different play areas. Loved the HyVee experience, the water play area and",
          "Great place for young kiddos to have fun and let some energy out! Love there shows too. Lots of activitis to keep the kiddos busy and interested all day long. I also love there baby room for little ones that arnt quite walking yet.",
          "My grandkids love it here, as did my kids, but the hours are lousy. Unless you are a stay at home parent, or retired, the hours are very inconvenient. If the hours were more convenient, I would rate this MUCH higher. Sadly, as it is, definitely NOT worth the money.",
          "This is a great children's museum with lots of hands-on stuff to do. Very educational and fun. Kids love trying the various exhibits.",
          "We come here when visiting Grandma in Omaha. Each time, the kids favorite things have been the art and craft projects. Sometimes they have bird house and other wood crafts, other time the kids are just banging nails, wood, and wires together. The kids have a ton of freedom to do",
          "I took my son here due to the weather was chilly and needed to get him out of the house. It was the perfect place for a little kid to run, play, and learn all while meeting other kids. My son is almost two but everything there seemed safe for all ages. I would recommend this",
          "We went there for our granddaughter's 3rd birthday. Room was spacious, staff very friendly and the museum is one of the best we had been to. They have a lot for children of all ages to do. So many things were hands on! Loved it.",
          "Great place to take the kids. I remember going here as a kid and still a great place. They do a great job changing the attractions around. Kids are able to get tons of exercise.",
          "Great children's activity. Good educational exhibits. Growing exhibits each time we visit. Perfect of 4-10 year olds.",
          "Our family loves the omaha children's museum. It is pricey, as adults have to pay to be there too, but it's worth it. It's all interactive and quite fun. It tires out the kids, (and husbands), too!",
          "We took or two grandchildren, ages 5 & 9, to the Children's Museum on a midweek day when there was no school. They have been there several times and it never gets old. The themes are always excellent, directed at activities or creativity. It is always hard to pull them away and",
          "Great rainy day activity after long day at zoo previous day. Sensory, involvement, creative play, kids able to be loud, enjoy self, little wait even on busy day.",
          "The exhibits rotate regularly but stay long enough to enjoy a few times. My kids have been visiting there for the last 15 years and it is still a family favorite!",
          "It was spendy... Check your local area museums to get a membership to save money but read the fine print. Needs to be further then 90 miles from your home address and from where you bought the membership. Lots to do, bring lunch and spend all day, kids will nap great! Good",
          "Great place to allow the kids to work off some energy and learn at the same time. Themes change every few months. Many interactive play and learning experiences offered.",
          "This is a great location for all Children to enjoy! We have a 10 and 1 year old, both were able to have fun at the stations! The educational side is simply amazing as well! I loved all the hands on activities available, so fun to be had! Make this a stop if your ever in the",
          "Museum is very small and dated. It was crowded and less activities than most children's museum. Staff was not keeping arts area stocked, seemed too busy chatting with coworkers. No fresh paint or water, out of paper. No special exhibit upstairs. Just a big empty space.",
          "This place is really need for children. We made paper cones to shoot and there are all kind of crafts to make. The air tubes that you put balls in all fun for all ages especially young children.",
          "So full disclosure here- I did not personally go and experience the fun as I was in a conference. But my wife took my little girls (ages 1 & 3) there and was able to make a day out of it. They had a blast- maybe more than the Zoo!",
          "This place has a lot to do, but I wish there was more than one in Omaha as this becomes a go to place and it's a mad house. Also, the price is a little high in comparison to other things you could do with your kids but I guess I don't know what their overhead looks like. Overall",
          "All children below the age of 8 will love this. There are outside activities which my granddaughter enjoyed before they opened.",
          "This children's museum is very cool. I have been multiple times when my children were toddlers and when they were preschool/school age. I have to say it is hard to keep them in one area by yourself. There are multiple levels and ways to get around. We enjoyed it so much more",
          "My 2.5 year old could probably go here everyday. She often asks to go to the 'seum! She LOVES the Hy-vee grocery store and play house. The bubble show in the theater is another favorite!",
          "this is a great place for younger kids. lots of different area to choose from. a few times a year, they change the upstairs attraction. my children love to come here.",
          "If you have small children then the Omaha Children's Museum is a must. All of the classic children's museum features (Art, science, play...) but done exceptional. The staff works hard to have fresh experiences each and every visit.",
          "Took our 23 month old grandson to children's museum on the Sunday before Labor Day. We arrived at 1:30 pm and there was a long line to get in so we waited about 20 minutes. They really need more cashiers at the check-in counter. When we got inside my grandson loved the area",
          "It changes so it is never boring. It is loud but who could not put up with a little loud to see all the smiles.",
          "We visit about 5 times per year-always enjoy it! As much fun for grandmas and grandpas, as for the kids to activate their creativity! Especially love the changing exhibits-we have a little guy who loved the superhero exhibit when there--and was not happy that the superhero's",
          "I love taking all the kids. They love. It is not only fun but educational. This is a wonderful activity for kids and adults. Fun.",
          "The grandchildren love the variety of activities. Special seasonal areas are also very special. I appreciate the number of volunteers, as well as how easy it is to keep track of the children.",
          "The children's museum has something for everyone. Even adults as long as you still have some kid in your heart. Not the cheapest activity with your kids, but definitely something you can make a day of.",
          "Two year old and four year old loved it! There is too much content to cover the whole museum before nap time. The special exhibits were as detailed as the year-round exhibits. Interactive exhibits empower children to define their experience. Two year old loved being able to do",
          "Fun for kids of all ages, just make sure to lock your car doors. Kind of a rough neighborhood with low income housing and the Omaha jail very near by.",
          "Were from Topeka, Kansas and had originally not planned to come here but we're very happy it rained & changed our plans! Very nice! A little more than what we're used to spending but obviously worth it for a special occasion or not an every weekend visit type of place. We have",
          "Kids will love it, but if you don't like being inundated with screaming and running kids whose parents let them run wild, it may get on your nerves.",
          "Plenty to do for young ladies at ages 3-5, including the glitter tattoos, the carousel, the train, the grocery store, and the pneumatic ball drop.",
          "Went here with 2 year old granddaughter she was thrilled, they had a program with Elsa character and she was elated, hours of fun they do charge a fee but it is well worth it",
          "This place will probably set you back about $20 if you have two kids. Its well worth it. Lots of educational play for kids without any overt controversial subject matter. I enjoy this place because there are complicated Rube Goldberg ball drops, play shopping areas, pedal",
          "This is a wonderful place to take your kids or grandkids. It's a great learning experience for the kids and they change their exhibits periodcally so you see something new all the time. Great time, well worth it.",
          "We went there for the first time and took our six year old granddaughter. I think parts of it were a little overwhelming for her at first but she enjoyed everything once she started experiencing it.",
          "Loved the traveling exhibit this year. Pirates and mermaids. The .use um looked amazing. Noticed a few upgrades. The big cow was removed and replaced with Omaha Steaks. Still a great place to visit. Almost missed it this year. Arrived 30 minutes before closing and still had to",
          "My daughter had an absolute blast at this museum. While my daughter was scared of the underwater exhibit, I thought it was great. She did get over her fears enough to search for fossils/gems in the Big Dig (there is an extra fee for this). Loved the \"city\" where she could go",
          "Great place to spend inside time at for kids. They have some consistent displays and some that change. Check the website. If you are a member of your museum at home, you may get discounts here or admission for free. They have a room to make art projects and it is always",
          "The kids, boys aged 6 and 4, really enjoyed the day we spent at the children's museum. Best for young children. Small but plenty of hands on learning. It was small enough that we spent 2 hours then left to go to a local restaurant and then came back to spend another hour or two.",
          "Kids were happy.. Lots of fun watching them explore the whole place.. If you are a family with young kids don't skip this place...",
          "There were supposed to be two lines, one for members and one for non-members. This was not communicated to anyone and there were no signs posted to let us know. There were many people in the wrong line so many had to go to the end of the line if others weren't nice enough to let",
          "I took my 6 yr old granddaughter there. There was so much for her to do there. We arrived at 10:00 and left at 4:30. She really had a great time.",
          "This was our first time visiting the Children's Museum, and it was worth every penny ($12/adult, under 2 y.o. free). If I lived in Omaha, the annual family pass for around $100 would be a NO BRAINER. There are several different play areas in the museum, many with an educational",
          "My first visit was as a school field trip chaperone. It was fun for adults and the children. Lots to do and the kids learn while they play. So much to do, I'm buying a membership for my grandson to go often!",
          "My family visited this based on the reviews. Talk about a mad house. The kids running around were so thick we felt we couldn't hardly take a step without getting ran over. It had a very strange smell all through the building. Way over priced for what it is. We visited a similar",
          "We've been to many Children's museums across the country and this is one of the better ones. There's two levels that are packed with activities and kids play. Some of the popular areas for the kids are the grocery store that allows the kids to shop, make and serve pizza, bake",
          "This is not a museum so don't let the name fool you. This is a play area for children. They have some cool stuff like a fake grocery store, hospital and bank. There is also a water feature that the kids can play in. On the top floor there was an area where the kids can climb",
          "Awesome place but packed so full of kids and parents we couldn't really enjoy being there! It was a Saturday morning so maybe that's why it was so busy. Was lots for kids to do tho. Also has a nice place with toys for babies.",
          "This was our second visit, we haven't been in about 3 years. They've done some updates since then and both of our kids had a great time. It is also a nursing friendly establishment. I do wish there were more safety procedures in place such as maybe wrist bands for parents and",
          "3 yr old a bit overwhelmed, especially when field trip groups flooded an activity. Princess dance party was fun (2\u00d7). She loved the mermaid stories and princess . 6 yr old son loves the crane in the ball section, and the gears and cranks. Glad they have a classroomlike area",
          "I went with my 4 year old son after seeing commercials for their Pirates exhibit. We live in Lincoln, and love our Children's Museum and thought the drive would be worth it. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. There was nothing wrong per say, but it wasn't nearly as big as the",
          "Noisy and exciting and crowded and chaotic. In short: everything a good kids' museum should be. My 4-year-old spent a good 45 minutes in the pint-sized grocery store and pizza parlor. My 5-year-old loved the water cycle exhibit and spent about 30 minutes building and breaking",
          "We took our 1-year old son here for an afternoon of playing and discovery and he had a wonderful time! He especially loved the water table area, the ball zone and the grocery store where he sorted the fruits and veggies for a good 30-minutes! The museum was really the highlight",
          "Super fun children's museum. A most stop and a sure hit with the kids. It is one of the best we have been too. Parents can enjoy playing with the kids too.",
          "This is a great place for exploring and learning! The upstairs changes themes throughout the year! My son loves the pirates and mermaids going on right now! The touch tank is his favorite part! I love the special nights to celebrate different events too! This is a great",
          "I only gave this Museum a 4/5 because it is always so packed that my kids can't barely move in there, I think there should be a limit on how many people can be in there at one time. Also, the Fairytale Land sing-alongs and other shows were the exact same as they were two years",
          "We were on our way home from vacationing out west and decided to visit this museum as a way to let the kids burn off some energy after a few long days on the car. We had been to the museum with our oldest 3 years ago. We remembered that he'd had a blast. I was worried that",
          "We came to Omaha for the zoo and decided to visit the children's museum for a few hours on the way into town. It was a HUGE hit with our 5 year old. In fact, she liked it better than the zoo! There was art, science, princesses, and climbing equipment. It's so well done. If this",
          "This museum was awesome!! We spent 2 hours playing. Our favorite thing was the ball area. It was very creative and children can be children in here. Well worth the money. Plus he staff was all around and very friendly.",
          "Our grandchildren 6& 9 visit from Colorado this is always #1 on their to do list. This year we spent 7 hrs.! They both loved the store, bank, house, dr. Office. The 9 year old enjoyed the gear room. 2nd floor was equally interesting. A pirates theme. It is a clean well",
          "Fun for children 8 and under, majority of the activities are geared to the younger kids. Nothing for the tweens.",
          "We stopped in to kill a few hours and were very glad we did! We parked in metered parking on the side and it gave us pause. From the exterior, it looks a bit run down. Inside, it was a kids dreamland. The pneumatic area was by far the overall kid favorite. The underwater",
          "Great place to take you children, and grand--children.They have a great variety of things for the children to do. You could spend a whole day there.",

          "Our family has been here before, but they have added so much so fast! They have a kid's town\" where kids can work in different stores; a bank, a doctor's office, an auto garage, Hy-vee etc. They have added more interactive features to each of the shops and our kids had a blast",
          "I took my 4 year old nephew here and he absolutely loved it! Plan on staying for at least 3-4 hours because there is so much to see and do. There are 2 levels and some unique exhibits. They also offer small train rides and a carousel but they both require a ticket purchase.",
          "As the principal of an elementary school, we always look forward to the children's museum. There is always so much to do, and there are the old standbys but then something new and exciting every time we go. This is an engaging, brain building, creative, and friendly place to go!",
          "The museum is good for young children. There are many activities. It is similar to other children's museums we've visited. We stayed two hours and saw everything. Our children enjoyed the End of the Day parade.",
          "The children's museum is absolutely amazing. We were there for the Pirates and Mermaids event. They have tons to do there and also have little shows that are announced. You could easily spend an entire day there. It is all indoor so you can enjoy it in any weather. The staff is",
          "Excellent place for children. There are lots of things to engage children of all ages. Right now, the main exhibit is Pirates and Mermaids. There are lots of other fun things to do: water station, grocery store, face painting,crafts, automotive, bank and other activities.",
          "We went with a 7,8, and 11 year old - the 11 year old can be the challenge in anything with the \"children\" label. It's fairly pricey for admission, but ultimately, well worth the visit! The first areas you see are fun for younger children (my 7 year old was happy but the other",
          "Bought a Grandparents pass which covers the 2 adults and your grandchildren for the year. There is so much to do here for all ages, even my 13 year old granddaughter enjoyed playing around with things and the smaller children. We spent two hours there and could have spent much",
          "By far the best Children's Museum I have been to! Lots of room to stretch and explore, lots of interactive stations, bathrooms around every corner (very important when you have toddlers). I can't say enough good things about this place. We loved it so much that we bought a",
          "I took my 22 month old daughter there during our vacation. There were several learning stations throughout the building - a bank, a grocery store, hospital, water way and ball zone. There was a 0-3 zone that she loved the most. The upstairs had a train ride, carousel and ball",
          "We rent the museum for a private party family reunion each year. It's a great place for adults to have fun with the kids while mingling. The event staff are alway superb. Its fun to have appetizers & cocktails with the adults, yet have fun with the kids. The meals and atmosphere",
          "Oh, we absolutely loved loved loved this place! Words cannot describe how much fun my 3 year old (and the parents) had in there. So educational,and so many different activities and exhibits. We wish the exhibits were a bit more separated from each other however, it seemed a bit",
          "This was a great place to take our children ages 2 and 4. It was incredibly busy during our visit, but we went over Memorial Day weekend so I'm sure on a regular weekend it would be much more enjoyable. I appreciated the hand sanitizer everywhere!! One problem I had with with",
          "The new exhibit is awesome! There is a giant pirate ship the kids can run through and climb the mast's as well as a ball pit ocean. Loved the lights and atmosphere, as well as the mermaid shows!",
          "We took our 15 month old and he did have a good time and they have some beat things to play with but not a ton for kids that small. We did have a good time though.",
          "We took our three-year-old granddaughter to the children's museum for her birthday. She was so excited to be there exclamation point I would recommend this two families with young children. I saw quite a few older children there as well. There's plenty to do for every child. I",
          "Many diverse activities available; and many sure to interest your children. Drawing, art projects, grocery shopping, engineering with plastic balls; and even a small caf\u00e9 to have a bite to eat; or just a break time snack. Was a small '50's travel trailer to explore and bring",
          "This is a great place for hand- on-fun for children, and for adults watching them. Many interaction activities to entertain and teach children, as in shopping for food, working on cars, catching balls and hitting targets in a safe and colorful environment.",
          "It's been rainy for the past couple of days and we needed to kill a few hours for our kids. Reciprocity with another museum membership made this affordable and a great stop! We've been on one floor and so far have seen our kids (ages 2-9) have a great time. 1.5 hours down and",

          "A must visit with children -!!! So much for them to explore and learn with !! My boys are 6 and it kept them entertained for 3 hours ... We could have stayed longer too ! A pure joy watching them have so much fun",
          "We were on vacation from Kanas City and brought our 7 year old twin boys and we thought they would love the zoo the most and although they loved the zoo they thought the Children's Museum was the best. So many things to do with your kids its kind of hard to explain but it",
          "Although a children's museum is a wonderful thing I feel this one is very cluttered and. I also don't think it is very clean. They have added a few things since I was there last which is very nice. For the same price as a family zoo pass, I would take the zoo or the Children's",
          "My son enjoyed the Super Heroes themed exhibit. He is 9 and I think the museum is more fitting for kids 8 or younger.",
          "This was our first trip to the Children's Museum. Our two kids(4 & 5) were absolutely exhausted after about 2 hours of being there. I liked all the different activities and 'stations' that were set up for them to explore. My only complaint would be the lack of structure. What I",
          "My husband and I took our 5 year old and 10-month old daughters here on a busy Saturday afternoon and had a lot of fun. We loved the separate areas designated for 0-3 years of age; this allowed us to split up and play with our girls based on age.",
          "Our children, ages 5 & 7, had a blast. They ran from one exhibit to the next in rapid fire for the first hour. It is sensory overload and they didn't know what to do! Once they saw everything there, they did settle in and had a great time. Mom and Dad loved the free parking.",
          "Big museum and great exhibits. Child friendly. Just be sure to wash our childrens hands as soon as they are done as my children alway got sick after being there.",
          "Always something new. we get a membership about every other year as it is a tad expensive! The kids always have a great time though!",
          "My family and I visit Omaha every year and we always go to the Children's Museum, there's nothing like it!",
          "We've come here a couple of times now when visiting Omaha. My girls (ages 9 and 8) love this place. It's really a great environment full of activities and play/learn areas. We've went to the dinosaur exhibit (which was amazing - life sized moving replicas!) And the Lego",
          "Wow! This place has changed so much from when I was a child and went there with my family. Everything is bright and new. I love the different areas they have for children to climb. The one in the superhero area was particularly fun for our toddler. I also like the different",
          "This place was awesome and super family friendly that we as parents even had a great time here. Recommended",
          "My 3 year old had a good time but I honestly didn't feel the price of admission was worth it...within an hour he was bored and ready to go. This is good if you need a place for the kids to run off some energy or if they have an attraction that you haven't seen or have access",
          "The foam ball exhibit is a blast (literally) and great for kids to learn scientific principles through play. My kids really enjoyed this museum. We were visiting from out of town, so we appreciated that Omaha Children's Museum is part of the ASTC Travel Passport program.",
          "i loved how are various activities are planned n laid out for children to experience the real life grocery, garage, hospital, hotel etc experience. Truly wonderful.",
          "My 4 year old loved the Children's Museum, but he was almost bored at some points. There are quite a few activities, but maybe having a friend with us would have been more entertaining for him.",
          "The zoo was nice, all the animals were out and playful. The only issue I have is that the price is way to much compared to the size of the zoo.",
          "We took my grandchild to the Omaha Children's Museum several years ago and had a great time. However on this trip we were sorely disappointed. The whole place smelled like urine, and though there were some fun things to do for the kids, alot of the stuff they wanted to do was",
          "The only reason it does not get all stars is that I think the Lincoln Childrens museum is better. I miss that you can not do both museums for one price, but we do try to go often. It is great for the younger children, but my older kids don't find as much fun here anymore. I was",
          "Lovely little museum with interactive exhibits for kids to play in. Great for rainy days and days that are too hot to be outside (or two cold).",
          "Great place for kids of all ages. Have visited many times and the kids never get tired of the so many things to do.",
          "There is a LOT of kid-friendly, hands-on activities. My daughter and our grandchildren were planning on a couple of hours but it stretched into nearly five. That speaks volumes.....",
          "We went with two children under the age of two so they were free and adults $10. I wasn't sure if there would be much to do for such young children, but there was! The 8 month old spent a lot of time in the wiggle room with mats to crawl on and soft blocks. There is wall length",
          "This is an awesome childrens museum with lots of different activities and things for the kids to do.",
          "It's a great way to get the kiddos out during the winter - Lots to do and see, but the price is quite a gouge - $11 a person, plus very expensive snacks and drinks - It's not worth it to go very often. I don't feel that a pass would be worth it - Not enough to see to come",
          "Our 10 year old and an 8 year old friend had fun for about 2 hours. Our science center pass got us in for free, or I would not have gone. Good exhibits, mad science show was funny, ball room was great. Overall, I'd say good up to age 10 but not much past that.",
          "They have a wide variety of things for kids to do. The grocery store, bakery and grill were the kids' favorite. I took my 6 and 9 year old sons and a friend and all had a good time and didn't want to leave. A must see if you're in Omaha!",
          "My kids love this place and have for years. The ever changing exhibit upstairs allows us to experience something new each time but the downstairs area provides their old favorites they love to play with again and again. Google coupon codes (or check out things to do in omaha's",
          "My family and I have been visiting the museum at least for the last 5 to 6 years and have enjoyed each visit. Last year there was a black out so we were unable to visit but was given a family free pass. Well we were able to use it this year for our family vacation and it was",
          "This childrens museum is small compared to the one in Lincoln. It is still fun though, with lots to do for younger children. The upper floor has a carousel and train, but you have to pay $2 per ride. There is a really cool Lego exhibit there right now, which my kids loved,",
          "I took 4 of my grandchildren, ages 4 months to 10 years, to the Omaha Children's Museum in mid-August. It was a wonderful day, they loved the new HyVee grocery store. They participated in one of the science events / experiments. It was very clean, very safe, the staff were very",
          "I like how everything is structured you have your choice of free play or structured activities. I did not go upstairs due to it being an additional charge. However, my children between the ages of 6 and 14 all enjoyed themselves.",
          "We attended while a Lego exhibit was set up on the second floor and we brought our two children: a girl age 2 and a boy age 5. Our son loved building Lego racing vehicles and testing them on the racing ramps just like at Legoland. That was not the best part though. The kids",
          "We get yearly passes here for the family (4 young kids). They change the upstairs every few months and the kids get super excited to see what they have. My kids ranging in age 2 to 13 LOVE the museum!",
          "We've been to a few other children's museums so expected to see a lot of the same things, and boy were we pleasantly surprised! Of course the standards were there: grocery store, doctor office, theater play and such. But in addition there were makers spaces, a huge room of ball",
          "My granddaughter really enjoyed the museum. At five years old, there was lots for her to do. We really enjoyed the science demonstration and going up and down the musical stairs.",
          "My 3 year old had a blast here! I think her favorite parts, were all the buildings you could pretend in - a house, a hospital with nursery, bank, auto shop, grocery store complete with carts to shop and checkers to scan the groceries, grilling area, and pizza making station.",
          "Our kids had a great time at the museum. We spent close to 3 hours and could have spent more. My kids are 3 years apart and both found plenty of activities they liked. My only complaint is that there are activities inside the museum you had to pay extra for (train, carousel,",
          "There are many activities for Kids, the space is a little bit cramped. Parking is free, and the location is convenient for downtown. the price is reasonable.",
          "We stayed a lot longer than we thought we would due to all the wonderful exhibits. It's the perfect place to take kids while on the road.",
          "Our kiddos LOVED this place. We have a children's museum at home, but we stayed here for several hours. Favorites were the princess-led shows and sing-alongs, the creative art area and the balls. Definitely a place to let the kids run free, though it was more fun to play right",
          "My daughter loves this place. They have a ton of stuff to do for kids and we went during Halloween and they had a fun little kids haunted house thing set up. Lots of kids running around but well worth the visit.",
          "Our kids had a good time (3 & 5), but I expected it to be a little more substantial/science centerish. Its basically just like a big play ground, not educational at all but the kids did seem to enjoy it. They have an art area where kids can paint, numerous play areas, and a ball",
          "I have two boys, 7 and 5, they loved the museum!! There is so much to do! We got there just 15 minutes after they opened and it was very busy! There is so much for the kids to do, you could easily spend a whole day there. The one downside is you also have to pay the same price",
          "This place has something for every age! Our daughter is 2 and she loved the main level of the museum. Specifically, they have a replica Hy-Vee grocery store that she absolutely loved. They also have a 2 story play house and she could've spent hours putting the baby dolls to",
          "A must visit with kids!! There are always fun new exhibits and the regular exhibits are fun and entertaining. Great way to spend a day and get the kids worn out. When my nephew was visiting we were able to go two days in a row and all the kids were still enjoying themselves.",
          "Love this place, took niece and nephew this past spring....most amazing experience to let them run and explore.",
          "I took my 5 & 8 year old grand kids. 5.5 HRS. later we left! They loved it all especially the Hy Vee, Omaha steaks bakery area. There is enough on 2 floors to keep a wide age range busy, involved & interested. The house was fun for the 5 year old. The 8 LOVED Dr. Area. I",
          "I went to Omaha's Children's Museum with my husband and our two year old daughter. There was something to do everywhere you looked; however, the crowds of parents and children made it difficult to navigate. For an extra charge you could experience the changeable events (for us",
          "Hands on, educational fun. This is a great place for the littles. I'd say 2nd grade and younger. It can get overstimulating for all. I highly recommend bringing something for the headache that all the noise will give you but it is worth it. Kiddos love this stuff.",
          "This is a hands on museum for kids. They can drive a train, dress up, let buckets of balls go through tubes and when they are watching them go it fills a bucket and they can go over and they will all fall on their head. It is raining ping pong balls and the kids love it. I hear",
          "My little sister asked to go to the Children's Museum for her birthday. I was resigned to a long day of sitting out and watching her run around. I was wrong! I loved the museum! The interactive exhibits are great for both the children and chaperones. We spent forever learning",
          "Two Levels and many rooms of fun for the kids. Painting, drawing, science, making things, throwing things, jumping, climbing,merry go round and always changing exhibits!",
          "I had several great times with the Grandkids and then my new daughter there... the bubbles wall.. the Star Wars the train.... We painted faces, checked out where our food comes from with the farm then shopped in the store then checked out the hospital and played patiences,",
          "The permanent exhibits are a good for kids from 2--4 or 5. Not much for the older ones. Occasionally, there are some science based \"shows\" that are appealing to the older ones. For me, there needs to be more hand sanitizer stations, sanitizing wipes, and really, the face paint",
          "took our 3 year old there, allot of hands on activities, in fact all hands on activities. He had a blast, called it his fun day. Highly recommend. ages 3 - 8...",
          "I wasn't sure if this was going to be fun for my 11 year old niece. She had a blast and didn't want to leave. There are all kinds of things for a child to learn and play with.",
          "Rainy day so we decided to go here. I Have been to some other children museums but this one ranks as one of the best. Thought we might stay for a couple of hours and ended up staying over 6 hours. Lots for our 4-7 year olds to do.",
          "Typical place for kids to explore and play. We've been to others that were bigger and better than this particular one. It kept my kids busy for a few hours, but it won't be on the must see/do list next time we are in the area.",
          "Disappointing experience at this museum. The displays and education programs have deteriorated significantly over the last 3 years. Omaha deserves better. I think the board needs to re-evaluate management decisions. The Lincoln Children's Museum is far superior, and in",
          "We went part of the exchange program with other memberships. The Lego traveling exhibit was a little disappointing and so was the fact they charged for the carousel and train rides. The bubble show and knight training was fun. My kids loved the little village where they could",
          "We were on a road trip from Minneapolis to Phoenix, and we planned out specific stops. This museum was one of them. We had never been here before but heard good things. It was a lot of fun. Cannot recommend this place enough. We stayed for only a couple of hours, but could have",
          "My wife took our daughter there and had a blast we ended up getting a annual membership strongly recommend taking your kids there if there's nothing to do at the house",
          "It is a really nice place for kids to run around and have fun. They have a large number of different activities and it would easily be a half day event. The staff were very helpful in answering questions and the little train was a blast. Would not recommend the carousel",
          "There is a lot of stuff to keep your kids busy! My daughter loved the grocery store and bakery. And my son loved the area with balls! During our visit was Fairytale Land, and there were daily times to meet the princesses, my daughter loved seeing the princesses dressed up and",
          "This was one of the most fun days of my life. I took my step grandchildren and we had the time of our lives. They played store clerks, house, made pizza's and served me, played like they were farmers, firemen, vets and dressed up in fun clothes. We all got to learn new things",
          "Even as an adult I love to visit this place. So many of the exhibits are interactive and you can take a small child to this museum and they will stay happily occupied. Half the fun is watching the children enjoy themselves. I am very impressed with the time and thought the staff",
          "\"Museum\" is a huge understatement. There are enough things to do here, it could keep children entertained for days. Plenty of things to climb on, slide down, crawl through, a padded play area just for younger toddlers, even seats for babies to sit up and play. Tons of things",
          "Overall, the museum is a little small - but fun place. Friendly staff. The itty bitty city display they have right now is pretty awesome. Great location in downtown Omaha.",
          "We visit the Children's Museum every week and my five year old son never gets tired of it. We just love the staff. The ball area is especially unique, I have seen many adults who are also playing there. :)",
          "My children, ages 2 and 4, love the Children's Museum. It never gets old to them. There is always so much to do. They love playing dress up and pretending to shop at the store. Only complaint is the price - I wish they had a less expensive admission price for kids.",
          "Stuff was nice. It was clean and very interesting . My kids did not want to leave. We had so much fun",
          "Lots of fun for kids of all ages!! Gets kids into role playing like a supermarket to go shopping in, a place where u can make your own pretend pizzas. A really fun area there that has lots of tubes/pipes for plastic balls to shoot out of, really is lots of fun. Even has a",
          "For the size that Omaha is this Children\"s museum is really fun. Our family went with my cousins (ages infant to 9 years old). All the kids enjoyed themselves and so did the adults. It was a nice day attraction to go to especially when the college world series was playing.",
          "We had a three year old and an eight year old..lots to do for both. Creative and fun. Not a spot to miss!",
          "My kids had a good time exploring the what the museum had to offer. We've gone on several occasions and my kids had a good time with each visit.",
          "We visited the OCM on a spur of the moment \"lets do something different today\" idea. It was a little hard to find and the parking was sketchy but once we were in we were impressed. I don't think we will rush right back as we kind of had the \"been there done that\" feeling when",
          "I feel very privileged to have such a great place for my family - fun, educational, and always interesting! It is WELL worth getting a membership, and we visit several times per month.",
          "Nebraska is a class act when it comes to children's entertainment. Both the Lincoln and Omaha Children's museums are amazing. You could stay all day (if you had child like energy) and probably still not get to fully enjoy each activity and play area - there are soooo many! The",
          "We were introduced to the Children's Museum when we took our grandchildren for a visit. I was pleasantly surprissed and the children had a great learning time. Grade school children will love this experience.",
          "It kept 2 4-year old boys engrossed in the pneumatic tubing interactive ball area for 2 hours. We have 2 little future engineers!",
          "This is by far one of the best childrens museums we have been to. They have tons of activities for kids of all ages. Great for kids age 7 and under.",
          "A great place to spend a few hours with your child(ren). Well maintained with friendly staff. Plenty of interactive activities that teach and entertain youngsters. Highly recommend.",
          "I took my three grils here for an afternoon. Would have been great if the middle daughter didn't get sick. At least the staff was helpful. They were there in an instant to help clean up the mess.",
          "Fabulous Children's museum. Great exhibits where children can play make believe..and benches for parents. Wonderful traveling exhibits. Great gift shop.",
          "It's educational, yet entertaining for both children & adults. Kids will love exploring how things work, while learning how to use their motor skills & brain at the same time. They'll even have a chance to make a take home art project, put on a play in the children's theatre &",
          "We took our daughter (1.5 yo) and our niece (4 yo) here. Our niece truly loved the place and playing around with all the gadgets but our 1.5 yo really didn't \"get it\" and didn't engage well with the museum. We're excited to purchase a year pass but when our daughter will enjoy",
          "I loved this place! We brought 6 kids between the ages of 7 months and 7 years and they were all entertained the entire time and there were so many things to do there we could have stayed all day! There were lots of kids there but thats what you have to expect at a place as cool",
          "This place has four distinct areas to play on the main floor and a carousel and small play area in the second floor. On the main floor there is grocery, water play area, play ball and activity center. My. 5 year old spend five hours here but it is typically 2 - 3 hr visit. The",
          "The children's museum is a great place to take kids to help explore and use their imagination. I took 2 grandkids. The 7 yr could stay there all day. She loves all the different things to do and play. The 10 yr old boy was bored after a couple hrs. We'e been to childrens museum",
          "Kids have fun, but needs to be cleaned up a bit. Seems to be getting dated and needs some upkeep done",
          "This facility could easily be a 4 star even with the high price if it wasn't for the utterly uninterested staff. The facility was nice with numerous fun areas that my 3-yr old daughter could have spent the entire day at. We even enjoyed a short presentation by one of the adult",
          "A group of us went, just to look. We didn't even have kids, and we were entertained for hours. I thought it was so amazing. The science projects were cool, and interactive. I love the giant piano.",
          "The pictures and the information on the website are very misleading. None of the workers knew any answers to any of my questions and had to keep getting the manager.",
          "After spending time in museums where no one could touch anything, we all enjoyed playing with the ball tracks, water features, climbing toys, coloring, and tons of other things. We got to see the last weekend for the Wizard of Oz display on the second floor.",
          "Great for kids and adults with ever changing displays and plenty of things to keep the kids busy. Plenty of parking and reasonable admission prices.",
          "This one has it all. There are science shows, special exhibits (Titanic, Wizard of Oz, Dinosaurs), a bit of the old (Historic exhibits featuring a playground from Omaha's past), a bit of the new (A mini splash pad), art, theater and just fun (ball room with lots of equipment,",
          "The Children's Museum is wonderful. There is so much to do and keep the little ones busy. The parents end of very tired!",
          "What a place for a child to find science! There's plenty of interactive sites throughout the museum. Each visit can include a special exhibit that makes the experience even better. My kids saw the moving dinosaurs at the museum.",
          "We visit Omaha every summer since my first child was born and they have not tired of it. It seems like as my children grow their attractions to the different areas changes. When my son was a baby he had a blast in the baby area holding onto the bars and crawling over the soft",
          "4 year old and 22 month old. We have pass so we visit often, they are never bored. Everything is always clean. The carosuel is always a huge hit. The current princess /knight play is a blast. Wizard of Oz exhibit not too exciting for younger crowd. Water play is great for kids.",
          "I took two girls, 7 and 10. They both had a great time with the various activities to keep them busy. Admittedly, it was harder to get the 7 year old to leave than the 10 year old so I would caution against bringing someone above the age of 10 as they may get bored. The",
          "If you are here from out of town and you have kids and you want to make them tired. TAKE THEM HERE! You will love this place. Lot's of things to do here. We go here some times two or three times a month.",
          "Good place for kids to experience hands on play! Great for kids ages 2 to 10. Older kids might get bored. Also, can be very busy on the weekends and gets over-crowded. If you can, go on a weekday.",
          "This is a great place to bring younger kids around 8 and below. They change all of the attractions on a regular basis and is pretty cheap. So, if you are in Omaha with young children, this would be a perfect place on a rainny day to visit. My kids loved the place",
          "Great activities for kids in a wide range of ages. They will find things to entertain them for hours. The regular exhibits are always appealing, especially for the younger set, and they almost always have a really great temporary special exhibit open. More fun than educational,",
          "We spent about two hours here with our five year old on a Sunday afternoon in July. Good: The art area was excellent! Our daughter loved having creative time with many possible materials to use. The staff was friendly and didn't seem to mind cleaning up around the kids being",
          "We did not plan on a trip to the Omaha Children's Museum. Our young son saw a billboard for a Wizard of Oz exhibit and he wanted to go. So he chose the museum over the zoo. It was so fun from the second we walked in. Tons of things for kids to do and he loved every second we",
          "I live in Omaha and have had an annual pass for the last 6 years. Great for younger kids(under 10-12) and well worth the annual pass for locals. Plan to spend a couple hours on your visit. GREAT at the winter holidays with the light shows and Halloween haunted house :)",
          "I enjoyed the museum, but it's not very big and there isn't A LOT to do. I have visited other Children's Museums around the country and find this one to be the smallest of them all. It also seems to be 'odd' upstairs with the themes. I went during the Wizard of Oz theme and",
          "Spent the morning with our grandson at the museum and there was so much to do it kept him busy engaging in all the displays they had. It is well worth the cost and is very well staffed with special things to do. He ended up spending the rest of the day with his other grandmother",
          "Face painting could have been better and the dinosaur exhibit looked like it was put together by kids I expected more from that but other than that it was okay. Not what I remembered from when I was a kid. My 5 year old seemed bored.",
          "This museum says it has an area for 3 and under but it's a lie. The area in question not only has multiple doorways into it which swing on a hinge but the doors are not secure whatsoever at all. If you have more than one kid playing in this area they will very likely slip away",
          "They have differnet exhibits. Many things for children to do. Children can spend hours here entertained and using their energy, plus helpful volunteers and staff.",
          "We visited the children's museum in Omaha during our visit but also recently have been at the childrens museum in St. Paul and Brookings, SD. The South Dakota Childrens Museum is by far the best.",
          "I visited with my two-year old grandson, not knowing what to expect for such a young child. I needn't have worried. He had a blast! There are multiple levels holding different types of exhibits - all of which children can touch and play with. There is a little \"market\"",
          "Our 4 and 9 year old grandkids love this place...from the art area, special exhibit area, interactive play area....fun for all.",
          "Fun safe place with lots of things for little kids (and adults) to do. The Lincoln Children's Museum is super fun as well. Cool in the summer when it's hot outside.",
          "it's three hours of parental hell. you walk in, and immediately there are kids with paint in their hands waiving brushes around like samurai swords. in the next room there is some sort of weird hydraulic metal tubing contraption that spits out millions of plastic balls",
          "Very fun for kids ages 2-6, bring your phone or something to read while your child is entertained for hours. Only negative is the lack of parent amenities. There is an attempt at a concession stand upstairs but it is understaffed and offers very little.",
          "I have taken our son, since he was 3 to the children's museum(he's 5 now) and he always has a great time. We love the traveling exhibit upstairs because it means there is always something different to see, however you do have to pay extra to do it. Fun things for kids 2-8.",
          "Our granddaughter loves to visit the Children's museum - she especially liked the saber tooth tigers but is also enjoying the new construction display.",
          "Our child had just turned two and he could have stayed there all day. The children's museum is quite large with many different areas. There is a playground area, a pretend grocery store, a mechanical area with play balls, a carousel and more. Plus it has a seasonal exhibit,",
          "It's a tad expensive for the adults who don't actually do anything. Also it's not a museum but more of a Fun & Play for toddlers to about 5 or 6. Lots of stuff for them to do and interact with.",

        "wiki": "Lewis and Clark Landing is a public park located at 515 North Riverfront Drive in Downtown Omaha, Nebraska. The 23-acre (9.3 ha) park is situated along the eight-foot-tall (2.4 m) river walk of the Missouri River just north of U.S. Interstate 480.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lewis and Clark Expedition took place from 1804 to 1806. The purpose of the expedition was to explore the land which the United States had purchased from France through the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Lewis and Clark Landing is the original landing site of the expedition on the west bank of the Missouri River. Lewis and Clark Landing now sits on property formerly owned by ASARCO, which maintained a lead refinery there that closed in 1997. HDR Inc. won an award from the United States Environmental Protection Agency for their work on remediation of the Lewis and Clark Landing.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe park has a number of distinct features including as a walking trail which follows the riverfront and a bike trail which takes riders west to Miller's Landing and another trail which leads to the Heartland of America Park. The Martin Luther King Jr. Pedestrian Bridge, with interpretive exhibits, connects to CenturyLink Center Omaha. The park also includes the Omaha Firefighter's Memorial Monument and the second largest labor monument in the United States. The park contains a walking trail which follows the riverfront and sections of a bike trail that connect to Omaha's bike trail system.  The walking trail also connects to the Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge that spans the river and joins Omaha with Council Bluffs, Iowa. There is expansive area for festivals and events and there are a number of tables with umbrellas and chairs that offer a chance to relax and take in the riverfront experience.  Additional attractions include a \"Monument to Labor\" sculpture, Lewis and Clark interpretive exhibits, jumping fountains where children can play, and a historical marker on site.The park is immediately down the trail from Omaha's new National Park Service Regional Headquarters. The office houses the superintendent of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.\n\n\n== Entertainment ==\nEvery summer the Landing and Heartland of America Park host a free concert series. The Annual Playing with Fire concerts began in 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\nParks in Omaha, Nebraska\nHistory of Omaha, Nebraska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOmaha Riverfront news",

        "wiki": "The Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge is a 3,000-foot (910 m) footbridge across the Missouri River between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Omaha, Nebraska. It opened on September 28, 2008.Interest in a landmark bridge across the Missouri River arose after Omaha and Council Bluffs began replacing their older crossings with girder bridges which do not have towers (most notably the Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge). The bridge is named after former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, who secured $18 million of federal funding for the bridge in 2000.The bridge was redesigned in 2004 after the lowest bid for the project was $44 million.  In May 2006, a final cable-stayed bridge design by Kansas City engineering and architectural firm HNTB was selected for the bridge. The $22 million bid included two 200-foot (61 m) towers and a clearance of 52 feet (16 m) above the river. Groundbreaking for construction of the bridge occurred on October 26, 2006.The bridge is north of the Interstate 480 (I-480) girder bridge and connects the Port of Omaha's Miller Landing to One Renaissance Center in the former Dodge Park Playland in Council Bluffs.\nThe lights on the bridge were donated by Gallup, which has their corporate headquarters and Gallup University located on the Missouri River adjacent the Omaha landing of the bridge. The bridge lights include programmable controls that can display multiple colors in the large lights at the top of the towers and alter brightness and timing of the lights that run the entire length of the bridge. The lights were officially unveiled in a ceremony on September 13, 2008. The bridge lights were turned on while the Phil Collins song \"In The Air Tonight\"  was played over a PA system. The event was accompanied by fireworks.\nDue to safety concerns prompted by the 2011 Missouri River floods, the entrance on the Iowa side was closed on July 2 of that year. It reopened September 3, 2011.In 2015, the bridge joined Twitter as @BobTBridge, an effort by the Omaha Convention & Visitors Bureau.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nTrails in Omaha\nList of crossings of the Missouri River\nParks in Omaha\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge at Wikimedia Commons\nVideo walking tour of bridge",

          "Walked this bridge with my kiddos in the mid-evening hours around 8/8:30. Foot traffic was actually pretty steady, though people were still trying to keep decent distance from each other. The views were fantastic, from each side of the river and a great open air theater",

          "We are locals and like to go walk the bridge in the evenings. We can take our dog and it\u2019s plenty wide that people walking and bicyclists can comfortably enjoy at the same time. The people on the bridge are friendly and we have met people from all over the world.",

          "Parking was free. We rented the electric bikes, which was fun. One of the bikes didn't have the electric battery, wish she would have checked for the battery before renting the bike. Not something we were thinking about, I would suggest just checking for the battery before",
          "This pedestrian bridge was built with walking in mind. The bridge is feed by walking trails from both the Neb and Iowa sides of the Missouri River that it spans. The bridge has lots of attractive signage and a line in the middle of the bridge that marks the border between the",
          "Pretty nice. But it's length is deceptive. It takes quite a while to actually cross all the way over. Since there are now scooters nearby. We wondered if it was allowable to use a scooter on it. We did see people biking across so I suppose that's ok. But better check",
          "Fun sights as you and family walk across the Missouri river. Enjoyable for all ages. If you are short of time just go halfway to the \"state line\".",
          "I had never been to Iowa so I was able to check another state off my list! The bridge is an easy walk, with plenty of benches (if needed) an information signs posted throughout. There is a water fountain and bathroom on the Iowa side for a quick pit stop before returning to",
          "Because there are some things that you can't not do! We had to walk it and take the pictures. While doing that, we saw the Lewis and Clark Landing and visited the National Park Service office. It's a cool bridge! What's up, Bob?",
          "We walked over the bridge while in town for the college world series. The views were wonderful. The water was high so we couldn't go explore as much on the Iowa side. Great change of pace and outdoor time.",

          "We walked over the bridge and honestly I thought there be more to the bridge than there was. Don\u2019t get me wrong it is worth seeing. In the middle it has a sign about the river and stuff. We didn\u2019t go at night when it is lit up.",
          "Stopped with our yound children, was hard to get to, we went on the Iowa side, even with GPS we had to stop and ask. Quite a walk to get to the bridge its self, was a little flooded, saw groundhogs, deer, turtles, fish, lots of ducks and geese. People were riding electric",
          "One of the workers at my motel recommended a trip to the bridge for site seeing and for walking. The bridge is a unique design that is interesting and as you walk across the river there is a spot where you can stand with one foot in Iowa and one foot in Nebraska. There are",

          "We stopped off here driving between Aberdeen, SD and St. Louis, MO. It was great to stretch our legs and super fun to say we were standing in two states at the same time. We enjoyed exploring the park on the Iowa side and also spent some time browsing the Trail Center on the",

          "Yep, it's a walking bridge. Try to contain your excitement. Nice place to relax if you are feeling mellow and just want to watch the water go by. Not much near or around the bridge like restaurants or bars any more. I say go to the Old Market and skip the bridge.",

          "The pedestrian bridge is a nice free activity to do in Omaha/ Council Bluffs. It\u2019s a nice area to walk and is connected to downtown Omaha if you are interested in a longer walk or jog. I would not recommend visiting this area later at night.",
          "What a beautiful and pleasant way to get from Omaha/Council Bluffs to the other side! This makes walking/biking around the two cities truly enjoyable, and what a great area to live if you're lucky enough to be in one of the newer, modern apartments on the Omaha side right next",
          "Our family loved this bridge to Iowa! They especially liked taking a picture with one foot in Nebraska and one foot in Iowa. It is right next to a small splash fountain and the Lewis and Clark Museum. There is a very nice park next to it too!",

          "I especially enjoyed the animal imprints and descriptions on the bridge. They were interesting and gave me a chance to rest since I am not in shape. There were many people walking on the bridge, though it did not seem crowded at all.",
          "We were in the park for a race/walk benefit and the 5k course took us across the bridge. The approach is somewhat steep when pushing a twin baby stroller. It was also a windy day. However once we got on the bridge, the river view was spectacular. We continued to the Iowa",

          "We went through the Lewis and Clark exhibit, very cool, hands on items. Short walk to the bridge. Very pleasant walk over the river, beautiful views. Personally I could have done without the \"vegan\" graffiti (it is OMAHA), but that wasn't done by the park service! The splash",
          "Very nice bridge that allows you to see the Missouri River and also have one foot in Iowa and the other in Nebraska. It is a wide bridge, so plenty of room for bikes, groups, kids, etc. The sides are high so no worries of a child falling off. It is very windy on the bridge,",
          "During the recent Berkshire Hathaway meetings, I had the pleasure of enjoying the many walking paths around Omaha. This bridge is a must see. It provides the size & structure of a vehicle bridge with the comfort of a safe, walk-only area. Plus, you can visit Iowa simply by",

          "We parked in the parking lot on the east side of the bridge. It was a beautiful walk over the bridge and down the river. The area was very clean. Turn left after you reach the end of the bridge. There are several neat things to see.",
          "The \u201cBob\u201d is a fun activity for all. Families with young children, strollers, bikers, and lovers, I\u2019ve seen them all. I witnessed a proposal once.

          "This bridge was an inspired idea. Connecting the waterfronts of Omaha and Council Bluffs has prompted attention and development on both sides of the river. I've been on the bridge a few times, both as a pedestrian and riding bicycles. It's a fun stroll if you just want to take",

          "The bridge literally leads nowhere, although it provides for some decent views of the river. Other than that there isn't much point to it. Also unless you want to be shot or stabbed the area should be avoided at night.",

          "Well it is a short maybe half mile stroll to the state lines. Take a few pictures, take in the views and walk back. Quick 30 minutes is all it takes.",
          "This is a really beautiful bridge for walkers and bikers. It is only about 1 mile to walk over the bridge and back. It thought it seemed like a shorter walk than it looked from the base of the bridge. The bridge curves as it crosses the river. There are interesting",

          "This is something cool to do if you have time. You can just walk there from downtown. It's fun on a nice day to stand up there and watch the boats go by. Of course there's the Nebraska / Iowa picture that you must take if you go up there!",
          "Not a lot to see and I would avoid unless there is a decent crowd walking with you. It does provide a different perspective. If developers do a good job this could be much different in a few years.",

          "We had family in town for their first visit. We walked across the bridge on a sunny afternoon. Views of downtown Omaha couldn't have been more besuited. They were impressed.",
          "Nice wide walkway and great views of the river and Omaha skyline. Good picture location. Lots of people enjoying themselves. There is parking nearby so not far to walk to get there.",
          "Had a great day with my sister. We rented bikes downtown and road across the bridge. We were told it was a rough hill to get up on the bridge. We had no problems and loved the view.",
          "As we attended the family wedding in Hilton we got a chance to see this beautiful bridge med Bob Kerry Pedestrian bridge which is 3,000 ft long on the Missouri River.",

          "My husband & I visited the Pedestrian Bridge today to take our dogs on a scenic walk. The entire river walk area is a great free destination. Great for tourists & locals alike. The grounds are very dog friendly with doggy waist stations & rubbish bins all around the grounds. The",
          "Nice spot to take a walk with the family or a date. Very relaxing to stand on the bridge and watch the boats go by and the Missouri. Every now and then I even seen ice cream cart. If you go you have to get a picture of yourself half in Iowa and half in Nebraska.",
          "A very nice bridge to walk and view the river , the surroundings and be in between 2 states at the same time. They have bike's you can rent if you want.",
          "Pretty 3000 foot bridge overlooking Omaha. Easy walk from Nebraska into Iowa and back. Fun to stand in middle with each foot in a different state ... National Park exhibit center nearby too..",
          "It's just a nice casual walk! Not too long and not too short. But you'll get a great view of the river and surrounding areas. I wish there was more benches along the way so you can sit and enjoy the view but I guess that's not what the designer intended. It's a walk, a namesake",
          "In the middle of the bridge there is a line dividing Iowa and Nebraska. The kids got there pictures taken \"bobbing\" with one foot on each side. The bridge was a magnificent end after walking the Omaha park trails from Old Market to the Lewis and Clark Landing. The kids enjoyed",
          "This is a nice place to get away from the touristy, urban scene of Omaha, relax and watch the Missouri River flow beneath. Never got tired of it, caught the sunset once and also went in the late evening.",
          "This is a nice way to get some exercise and learn a little about the Lewis and Clark expedition. The shape of the bridge is like the course of the river expedition. At one point you can stand in Nebraska and Iowa at the same time.",
          "If you're in the Omaha, Nebraska area be sure to check out the Bob Kerry Pedestrian Bridge which is a walking bridge between Iowa and Nebraska States.",
          "When in Omaha find time to cross this pedestrian bridge. A simple stroll and take a selfie with one foot in each state. Great social media campaign",
          "What an unexpected jewel not too far from home! We drove out here on a Sunday in the morning and it was great! The bridge itself is well maintained and I felt safe enough with little ones to be out there. However, the best part of this visit was running into the national park",
          "Another must see and do while in Omaha for the zoo. We ended up in downtown the bridge is close to where they hold the CWS. You can walk or even rent one of the community bikes they have. Great views!",
          "It's neat but it never gets used. A whole lot of nothing on both sides of the river. It's a good drive by bridge.",
          "The bridge is lovely and nicely lit at night. It is clearly a destination for people to just walk across, but it doesn't connect to anything in particular--too bad!",
          "Take a half mile walk across the Missouri river. It's a nice pedestrian bridge. great architecture. A very nice way to cross over the river",
          "This pedestrian bridge is so amazing! If I remember correctly it's about 3,000 feet long or equal to a 9K. It's a suspension bridge, approachable from a bike/walking path that we accessed from the Harrah's Casino property. The path goes along the river and is extremely nice and",
          "It is a pedestrian bridge across the Missouri River, let's not pretend it is anything else. You should do it though! start on one end, walk to the other. Take a picture straddling the Iowa-Nebraska state line, just do it, you know you want to!",
          "AN evening walk over to Iowa is a must while visiting Omaha. Lot's of people on the bridge, nice view of the city with all the light.",
          "It is a cool attraction but I wish they would repaint the state line at the mid way point. The line and the Nebraska/Iowa is faded, so no good for photos. But it is very pretty area and a fun thing to do when in the area.",
          "This is a nice bridge for walking or biking, and a convenient way to get across the river on foot. At the time we were there, the visitor center on the Iowa side was still under construction, but it looks like it's going to be very nice. We were there in daytime. My",
          "This serpentine suspension bridge joins Nebraska and Iowa across the Missouri River. The walk is interesting and there are activities on either side of the river. Don't miss going into the National Park Service building and viewing the Lewis & Clark exhibit on the Omaha side.",
          "A great find while in Omaha for the zoo. The Omaha side was a bit of a challenge to drive to and there is limited parking. It is next to downtown Omaha. Walk, or rent bicycles, along the renovated river walk to reach the start of the bridge which spans 3,000 feet to Council",
          "The bridge and surrounding area was nice and clean. The visitor center was informative and had a small store for souvenirs. Everyone was taking photos of the split in state lines. There was a festival set up on the grounds on the Iowa side. Watch out for the bicyclists, a few go",
          "It's a pretty pedestrian bridge, and we always get a kick out of the \"two states at once\" photo op. There's great info about the river habitat and history, and sits next to a National Parks Service Department of the Interior office building. There's a small exhibit on the first",
          "We came to Omaha for a birthday celebration from Phoenix, AZ. While there we did the touristy stuff and this had to be one of them. It is a neat thing to do, a must.",
          "Loved this scenic area. The pedestrian bridge spans the Missouri River from Nebraska to Iowa. The view from there is gorgeous. Be sure to post on the state line. This is called \"bobbing\". It is located of course on the banks of The Missouri River in a beautiful park. On the",
          "The bridge itself was nice, but more than anything, the reason to go on this bridge is the unique opportunity to stand in two states at one time. Great photo opportunity! We were not there in the evening, but it looks like there is a great light show on the Iowa side.",
          "The bridge is a fun way to introduce yourself to the city of Omaha. You can see quite a bit from the bridge; it is so high that someone with fear of heights will have a problem. We really enjoyed being over the river and standing in both Nebraska and Iowa at the same time.",
          "This is an excellent activity if you get a kick out of putting one foot in one state and one in the another. It was an easy walk from the Old Market area. Very clean on an early Saturday morning. Good place for jogging also.",
          "the area is nice, but once you walk over it, there isn't all too much to do? i was a little confused by the whole ordeal. There aren't really many pretty views outside of the bridge itself",
          "Went for a run on this bridge and the surrounding area and was very pleased with trails and scenery. It's a very family friendly area with plenty of parking and walking distance from downtown and the casino.",
          "We went on a nice spring day. It is not that hard to do. Great views. You could have a picnic on either side of the river.",
          "This beautiful bridge curves over the Missouri River and is a popular walk for families. At the halfway point is the border between Nebraska and Iowa which is marked, making it a hot spot for selfies. I walked over one day and rode my bike on another day. There are bikes for",
          "So enjoyable and get your scenery fix here. Pictures to take. Sit around walk around, enjoy the outdoorwith or without someone on your side.",
          "This is a great way to get some exercise and get outside. Great view of the river. I recommend going at sunset/sunrise for the best view.",
          "Working in the area and looking for something to do. Turned out to be a nice trip across to River. Don't forget to get your pic on the state line.",
          "It was fun to walk over and stand right in the middle of Iowa and Nebraska. If you continue over the bridge there is a splash pad the kids can run through. Fun to look at the birds and some wildlife that you can see crossing over.",
          "We had a nice time walking across the river. It was longer than we thought it would be-bring water and sunscreen. It's a beautiful bridge, and the nearby visitor center was interesting too. From there we walked to a nearby pub, LOCAL, which had a large selection of local beers",
          "My dogs love walking the bridge! On the Omaha side of the bridge there are doggy poo stations and water fountains. The Iowa side is a bit crazy right now as they are building an apartment complex right off the trail. I recommend spending most of you time on the Omaha side where",
          "We enjoy the trip to the bridge regardless of the weather. Some people ride across on bikes others like us will stop in the middle for photos. In the summer under the bridge is a water play ground where the family can play in the water and keep cool. On the iowa side there is",
          "Beautiful view of the river and a great way to get out and take a walk ! Free and a fun way to enjoy the outdoors! Highly encourage you to bring the kids or incite a date and be sure and snsp a photo of where Nebraska and Iowa meet!",
          "I had a great time reading the history of the river along the walk across the bridge. It appeared well used by both bikes and walkers. Liked the state line for a photo opportunity.",
          "This bridge is a fun little walk over the Missouri River. They have good signage and nice history on it. The state line is marked and easily noticeable! They don't have parking marked well and we ended up walking farther than the length of the bridge in blistering heat just to",
          "One could easily imagine a hundred other worth Nebraskans after whom to name this very picturesque and memorable structure.",
          "Great walking Bridge where half way through your on Neb side , one step Iowa side nice view of Downtown Omaha.",
          "The Bob Kerry Bridge is a fun spot to visit if: 1) you're up for a good walk....it spans the Missouri River as well as the land leading up to it on both the Iowa and Nebraska side 2) you want to impart history of the Lewis and Clark Expedition to kids or imagine the journey",
          "A must see if you are in Omaha. It's a nice stop as you get to be in two states at the same time. If you rent a bike you can bike ride across the bridge.",
          "Even though some call this the bridge to nowhere, it is still something fun to do when the weather is nice. Recommend starting on the Omaha side.",
          "I read before going, that this is the only pedestrian bridge in America that connects two states together. The Nebraska side is beautiful. They have a visitor center and park with fountains. The distance is about a half mile one way. The Iowa side just in feeling. It was a fun",
          "For those of you who enjoy walking while you are traveling, this is a great spot. It gives you a great outside view of Omaha. We even walked from the Gene Leahy Mall, which is a couple of miles, but definitely worth the walk.",
          "Very cool bridge, fun to walk across with your family, nice park areas on both side of river. You can slightly feel the bridge sway when you are standing in the middle.",
          "This is a newer foot bridge with a unique curved design and lighting. It's about 1/2 mile across and crosses the border between Nebraska and Iowa. We walked across and back around sunset, starting on the Nebraska side. There's a line in the middle where you can get a photo",
          "Our two grand children 7 and 8 loved walking to the middle and getting their picture taken half in Iowa and half in Nebraska.",
          "We enjoyed the evening concert as we walked to \" Bob\". The bridge sways slightly in the wind but not in a scary way. We enjoyed the signs along the way that explained the ecology and history of the area.",
          "I've walked the bridge multiple times. Always fun to get a two places at once photo but if you're in for a challenge, bike the bridge!",
          "We rented bikes near the Old Market and rode to the pedestrian bridge. Had to walk the bikes up at the start because of the incline. Neat view of the river and Omaha city. Also did paved trails on either side of the bridge. A fun and different thing to do",
          "The Bob Kerry Bridge connects Omaha & Council Bluffs. AKA as \"The Bob\"! It's a great place to walk from Nebraska to Iowa. You stroll over the Mo, river. Great photo ops. You can also stand with 1 foot in Nebraska & 1 foot in Iowa!! Both sies of the river have events. We enjoy",
          "You can start at either the NE or Iowa side, walk across the MO River, straddle the line depicting both states, and view some beautiful scenery of DT Omaha; along with the experience of doing so. Great adventure for the whole family! You can also ride a bike across! It's pretty",
          "There are some decent views for pictures, but not much water in the river. But it is an ideal place for morning walks or joggings. I wouldn't recommend this place very much in the afternoon time especially in summer, since it can be very hot throughout the bridge.",
          "We had a great time walking over the bridge, my kids thought it was great to stand in Nebraska and Iowa at the same time :) Good exercise too! It looks like they are building some more on the Iowa side to maybe be able to grab a bite to eat or drink too as that was the only",
          "I don't think this is a must see but it's fun to walk across with your kids or spouse. There is a line on the bridge where you can cross the Nebraska - Iowa line for a nice photo. You can rent a bike and cross the bridge as well. Admission is free and there is a National Park",
          "Kids loved that they could stand in Iowas and Nebraska at the same time! Great way to run off some energy!! Splash pad is fun for the kids too!!",
          "I read most of the reviews and some stated that I was a waste of time...agree! Unless you are a local, this place isn't worth the 20 minutes it will take you to cross the small bridge. The bridge doesn't even have a nice view. The river is muddy and erosion makes it look in a",
          "Definitely worth the walk over the river to stand in two states at the same time. Have done this trip a few times, even in Many ch when it was really cold.",
          "Very beautiful to look at but nicer to walk over. It connects the Old Market area in Omaha to a nice river edge park in Iowa.",
          "A nice place for either biking or walking; ample parking space provided. Beautifully designed bridge, and the trail is concrete paved. Lewis & Clark Trail museum underneath the bridge is another nice attraction.",
          "This bridge offers some great views, as well as the ability to stand in Nebraska and Iowa at the same time. Try it, and take photos! It was a little bit of a challenge for our mapping app to navigate us to the closest parking area. but after cutting through/around another",
          "The bridge is a fun place to go to if your downtown. It gives a great pic opp of being in two places at once (center of bridge has a line with both states dividing them). It is also nice to enjoy a stroll while visiting the hustle busy downtown area.",
          "What a cool walk! So glad we took time to do this, next time I'd like to bike across. On the Iowa side, they are building a water attraction. Should be really nice when it's finished.",
          "Fourth of July spent a delightful evening on the bridge , people watching, enjoying the Missouri River and the view of Nebraska and Iowa. They look very similar (LOL). Good area for children to work off some energy!",
          "Honestly, this is nothing to make a multi-state trip to see, but if you're in the area, it's certainly worth taking a walk across. Good vantage points for pictures, especially kissing-across-state-line pictures. We actually discovered it by accident when visiting the adjacent",
          "Being new to the area, my husband and I took the opportunity, today, to check out the pedestrian bridge. While it, and the NPS Louis & Clark welcome center are both nice, it is the immense trail system that interests me. So many place to walk, run, and rid our bikes. I can't",
          "Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge is an impressive bridge over the Missouri River. The Missouri River is the second biggest river in America (second to the Mississippi). Midway across the bridge, you cross from Nebraska into Iowa. It is a neat to take a picture while standing in",
          "At it's core it's just a state line, but a very unique one considering the bridge. It reminded me of four corners. And the bridge is very cool, good architecture. Take a stroll and visit the line.",
          "We have crossed this bridge a number of times. Our most recent walk was a beautiful evening, sun just going down, some city lights already on....very relaxing walk and so much to see.",
          "If you want to walk, run or bike this is a great bridge that connects paths in both NE & IA. It is also a fun selfie spot to stand in two states at one time. It's an easy walk from most of the downtown hotels and offer some great views of the city.",

          "Omaha has a graceful pedestrian bridge over the Missouri. On the Iowa side, there is a park where you can play tag with computer controlled lights. Even if you don't play is seems fun to watch. Too many cities ignore their rivers and it is good to see Omaha make the most of",
          "Beautiful views, it will be even more people friendly as they build more on each side of the bridge.",
          "What's so cool about this walking bridge is that you can literally stand in two states at once in the middle. The lighting is very poor, however, and they get some riff-raff down on the river (and the parking is very limited), so I would NOT recommend walking this at night, but",
          "This bridge connects Omaha and Iowa and is .9km long. Runners ,walkers, tourists, bicyclists .use this bridge that spans the Missouri River. The Omaha side has a lot of historical memorabilia, the Iowa side was still under construction",
          "The bridge is nice but it leads to nowhere. There is nothing on the Iowa side but on the Nebraska side there is a small splash pool for the kids to enjoy. My nieces liked splashing around. This is a fun walk and free activity.",
          "The pedestrian bridge is a nice leisurely stroll across the river. Council Bluffs is in the process of making your trip worthwhile but it is a nice place to cool off and see the scenery. Lots of available parking now that Rick's boatyard Cafe is gone. Also take the river walk",
          "The Bob Kerrey bridge connects Iowa and Nebraska it is the perfect place for a bike ride, run, or picnic. If your nearby you should definitely stop by. It's not a place you wanna miss!",
          "I live in the Old Market District and one of my favorite things to do is walk to and across the Pedestrian Bridge and just marvel at how beautiful Omaha looks from the Eastern side of the Missouri River. Walking across is great exercise and there are plenty of rental bikes",
          "We have enjoyed the bridge. We have wandered over to concerts. We have been on different benefit walks that take us over and back. We have seen some pretty cool things from up there.",
          "We saw this from the CWS stadium and had to at least drive by. This bridge is beautiful. You can get a great, one-of-a-kind shot stepping half in Nebraska, half in Iowa, which I thought was pretty neat too. It was very clean and well taken care of, the area felt safe to get out",
          "Lovely park to take a stroll, and be in two states at once. Great views of the city. Interesting facts to read on the bridge itself. Fun for the kids.",

          "This is something you should defiantly do. It's free, a great walk and an amazing view. You can actually stand in two different states at the same time. If you are afraid of heights this may not be your thing.",
          "If you are in Omaha definitely this is a place to visit and enjoy it riding a bike with the children.",
          "Fun to hover over two states at once! The view is lovely and the history in the National Park site is fantastic!",
          "Visited the \"Bob\" with my fiance and our three children. They enjoyed trekking across the bridge and taking touristy photos along the way. It's proximity to the riverside park area and national park museum makes it a great way to spend part of an afternoon. The kids especially",
          "How many times can you say that you were in two states at one time? Well when you're in Omaha on the Bob Kerry Pedestrian Bridge you can be in Nebraska and Iowa about halfway down the bridge. We went right after dinner and it was a pleasant walk to the bridge. It is overlooking",
          "We walked this bridge as a family! We loved it. Next time I would rent a bike. This bridge is good for everyone, take a little picture on Bob considering Iowa is just next door. I also felt the bridge move, my husband and little one thought I was crazy until minutes late they",

        "wiki": "The George and Sarah Joslyn Home (officially named \"Lynhurst,\" yet known locally as Joslyn Castle), is a mansion located at 3902 Davenport Street in the Gold Coast Historic District of Omaha, Nebraska, United States. Built in the Scottish Baronial style in 1903, the Castle was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It was designated as an Omaha landmark in 1979.\n\n\n== History ==\nGeorge Joslyn made his fortune in the ready-print news business and owned the Western Newspaper Union. The Joslyns contributed to many Omaha-area organizations, including Sarah Joslyn's donation which made Omaha's Joslyn Art Museum possible.\nJoslyn Castle was designed by John McDonald, an important local architect. Shortly after George Joslyn bought a farm outside of Omaha in 1893, he began landscaping it. Landscape architect Jens Jensen designed the grounds, as well as the rock work and pools for the conservatory inside the house.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe 35-room mansion has four stories, as well as a carriage house tower, built before the Castle in 1901, and 5 acres (20,000 m2) of formal gardens and landscaping, including greenhouses, which were completed in 1899. George Joslyn spared little expense planting mature trees on the 5.5-acre (22,000 m2) grounds, and Sarah collected rare botanicals from around the world, especially orchids.  According to The Friends of Joslyn Castle, the home was built in just eleven months at a cost of $250,000.The Castle includes a reception hall, music room, ballroom, a library and gold drawing room. The basement at one time had a bowling alley. With the addition of a music room in 1906, the house totaled 19,360 square feet (1,799 m2).The Castle and the carriage house were built of Kansas silverdale limestone. There is a wrought iron door on the Castle that weighs over a ton.\n\n\n== 1913 tornado ==\nOn March 23, 1913, a tornado demolished much of the central and north parts of Omaha. While the home was slightly damaged, inside some furniture, artwork, etchings, and statuary were ruined.  A distraught George Joslyn stated that it would take fifteen years to restore the estate grounds to their previous state. The greenhouses were partially destroyed. The Joslyns decided not to rebuild, so they donated the frame to Hanscom Park, where it was used as a greenhouse for fifty years. In the conservatory, many of Sarah Joslyn's orchids and other tropical plants were killed by the cold and snow which followed the tornado.    The storm also destroyed a small lake and bridge to the west of the Castle. Today the bridge remains, and an outline of the small lake is visible.  The home was repaired and that fall, the Castle hosted a gala event for the wedding of their daughter, Violet.\n\n\n== Recent history ==\nIn 1944, the Castle became the headquarters of the Omaha Public Schools district. In 1958, the district incorporated some of the walls of the original greenhouses into an office annex.\nIn 1989, the school system moved to a larger facility in the former Tech High School building. The Castle then became the property of the State of Nebraska. In 1996, the Joslyn Castle became home of the Joslyn Castle Institute for Sustainable Communities. The Institute was charged by the State of Nebraska with managing and preserving the estate. In December 2010, Joslyn Castle was sold by the State of Nebraska to the Joslyn Castle Trust, a private concern created for the purpose of maintaining the historic property.Today, the Castle is the namesake of the surrounding Joslyn Castle neighborhood, and is a site in the Nebraska Statewide Arboretum.\nThe Castle and its grounds are open to the public for tours, events, and private rental.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJoslyn Castle - official site\nPeriod photo of the aftermath of the 1913 tornado damage to the Castle.\nJoslyn Castle Institute for Sustainable Communities website.\nHistorical images - Nebraska Memories",

          "Go to this park!! This free park is worth at least $10! We spent a couple hours here. You can tour a destroyer and a small training submarine. You can get up close and see everything. In the yard you can step in a coast guard helicopter, see a war plane, and other various",
          "The other reviews will tell you what a cool, interesting and amazing little museum this is. I'm going to tell you about its' problems. The city of Omaha has sadly neglected this park and has set it up for failure. The problems began when the road that connects the New",

          "Whether you are visiting Omaha or a native, Freedom Park is a must-see. The USS Hazard is a living memorial to our nation's war veterans and servicemen, and the park is unlike anything that you will see in this region. It truly is a gem right in our own backyard.",
          "We Love Freedom Park!! We discovered Freedom Park while my son was working on an Eagle Scout project for a fellow scout. My son was given the opportunity to paint some of the big guns on display. While he was there the tour guides (navy veterans) gave the scouts a complete tour",
          "The ship and sub are outstanding pieces of military history. There are so many artifacts around the park and it's so well kept, HOWEVER Freedom Park is closed right now (July 2011) due to the fact that most of the park is under water. It is not at all accessible. Please",
          "My family and I visited Freedom Park this weekend. The main purpose of our visit was to see the sister ship to the one my grandpa had served on in WWII to get an idea of what his experience was like. It was snowing and as it turns out the park was not officially opened for tours",

          "This sculpture is absolutely amazing. It's a wagon train of four wagons in dozens of detailed pieces. The wagons frighten some buffalo who then scare a flock of geese. One buffalo is actually imbedded in a building and the frightened geese take flight out of a pond in front",

          "The statues are incredibly detailed. Unfortunately we didn't see them until twilight. We had a good look at the wagons but it got darker as we came upon the bison and then the geese. Would definitely recommend visiting them during the daylight hours if you have any interest in",

        "wiki": "The Mormon Trail Center at Historic Winter Quarters is a museum and visitors' center of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints located in the Florence neighborhood of Omaha, Nebraska, United States. The museum interprets the story of the Mormon Trail along with the history of a temporary Mormon settlement known as Winter Quarters, which was located in the Florence area between 1846\u20131848.\nThe museum is located on a bluff above and to the west of the Winter Quarters settlement site and is directly across the street from the historic Mormon Pioneer Cemetery and the Winter Quarters Nebraska Temple.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early Visitors' Center ===\nPrior to the construction of the current center, a small remodeled house had served as a visitors' center for tourists coming to see Florence and the Mormon Pioneer Cemetery. This center was closed on August 1, 1995 in preparation for the construction of the new museum, and trailers served as a temporary center for visitors during the building process.\n\n\n=== Current Museum ===\nThe new museum, constructed of red brick, has 11,000 square feet of display space and a large lower level. It opened at the end of 1996 with a preview of partially completed exhibits and that year's gingerbread house display.The museum was dedicated by Church President Gordon B. Hinckley on April 18, 1997. The dedication was part of that year's sesquicentennial celebration of Brigham Young's Vanguard Company leaving Winter Quarters, trekking across the United States, and arriving in Mexico's Salt Lake Valley in 1847.\nIn 1998 a life-sized statue of a Mormon handcart family was placed on a round, concrete pedestal in front of the museum. The statue was created by Latter-day Saint sculptor Franz M. Johansen.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\n\n=== Christmas Gingerbread Houses ===\nIn 1985 an annual Christmas gingerbread house display was established in the old visitors' center. The annual event continued following the construction of the new museum and has become a popular local tradition, with nearly 300 gingerbread houses on display during the 2018 Christmas season (additional gingerbread houses are also put on display at the nearby Kanesville Tabernacle).\n\n\n=== Zion in the Wilderness ===\nThe museum opened with an exhibit titled \"Zion in the Wilderness - from Temple City to Temple City.\" The exhibit contains three phases, the first, titled \"An American Exodus,\" interprets the Mormon Exodus from Navuoo, Illinois, along with the story of the Mormon Trail (and its many refugee camps) across Iowa. The second phase, titled \"At the Bluff,\" tells the history of Winter Quarters and surrounding settlements, and the final phase \"Gathering to Zion\" shares the story of the Mormon Trail from Winter Quarters to the Salt Lake Valley.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKanesville Tabernacle\nMormon Pioneer Cemetery\nNational Historic Trails Interpretive Center\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMormon Trail Center at Historic Winter Quarters - churchofjesuschrist.org - Historic Sites",

          "If you're a railroad buff - or not - you should see these two fine specimens of railroad power in the US. While UP is not the only railroad in the land, these two locos are tremendous reminders of how the US was settled and still moves many goods yet today.",

          "Free parking, free admission, great history. How did they get those engines into place? There are few remaining Big Boys, and this is very well displayed! And very well preserved! Make sure you drive to the Lauritzen Gardens to park. From there, it is just a short climb up",

        "wiki": "The Gerald R. Ford Birthsite and Gardens in Omaha, Nebraska marks the location of the house at 3202 Woolworth Avenue where U.S. President Gerald R. Ford lived for a couple of weeks after his birth in July 1913.  It was the home of his paternal grandparents, Charles Henry and Martha King.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe King house at 3202 Woolworth Avenue was located on the border of the Hanscom Park and Field Club neighborhoods of Midtown Omaha. A three-story, fourteen-room Victorian mansion, it was razed after a 1971 fire caused substantial damage.  \nOmaha businessman James M. Paxson, who lived in the neighborhood, purchased the vacant lot for $17,250 after Ford became president in 1974, and planned for it to be used as a memorial.  Although Paxson donated the site to the city, officials said they couldn't afford to build a memorial. Paxson then set up the Paxson Foundation to fund the memorial and associated gardens. The site includes a portico evoking the north side of the White House and a pagoda resembling a portion of the original home.\n\n\n== Memorial and conservation center ==\n\nThe memorial was dedicated in 1977. Ford partnered with Paxson on some fundraising. The former president returned in 1980 for the dedication of a rose garden in honor of Betty Ford. An exhibit kiosk contains information about Ford.\nAdjoining the site is the Gerald R. Ford Conservation Center, a regional center of the Nebraska State Historical Society founded in 1995. It provides conservation services for historic and artistic works. The Center also contains a small exhibit of Ford memorabilia. Both conservation and exhibit are available by appointment only. https://history.nebraska.gov/conservation-center\nThe two sites are just to the northwest of Hanscom Park, one of Omaha's oldest public parks. The house site is four blocks west of the Gerald R. Ford Expressway.\n\n\n== Family history ==\nThe house was owned by the future president's paternal grandparents, Charles Henry King, a prominent banker, and his wife, the former Martha Alicia Porter. After their son Leslie Lynch King married Dorothy Ayer Gardner on September 7, 1912, the young couple moved into the house with his parents, as was typical of the times. Their first son, named Leslie Lynch King, Jr. was born July 14, 1913.\nDue to domestic abuse, Dorothy Gardner separated from Leslie King when Leslie, Jr. was only 16 days old. After staying briefly with a sister in Illinois, Dorothy took her son with her to her parents and moved in with them in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where the future president grew up. By the end of 1913 Dorothy's divorce from Leslie King was final. In 1916, Dorothy married Gerald Rudolff Ford.  They renamed Leslie, Jr. after him, as Gerald Rudolff Ford, Jr. The future president was never formally adopted, however, and he did not legally change his name until 1935; he also used a more conventional spelling of his middle name (Rudolph).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGerald R.

        "wiki": "Memorial Park is a park located at 6005 Underwood Avenue near the Dundee neighborhood of Omaha, Nebraska. The park was created as a memorial for all of the men and women from Douglas County who have served in the armed forces.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally proposed by a local citizen in an editorial to the Omaha World-Herald, a group of businessmen and leaders, including Storz Brewery owner Robert H. Storz and the Omaha Zoo namesake Henry Doorly met to discuss a memorial. A site was chosen near Omaha University, where Happy Hollow Club and the Dundee Golf Course were located. The Memorial Park Association was created, and in 1948 it raised funds to create a monument in the park. \nOn June 5, 1948 President Harry S. Truman dedicated the site. In 1959 the Omaha Rose Society added a rose garden, and in 1990 Woodmen of the World added flagpoles and flags along the driveway coming into memorial park. A pedestrian bridge over Dodge Street called the Memorial Park Pedestrian Bridge was completed in 1968. The park was the site of several anti-Vietnam War protests by youth activists in the late 1960s and early 1970s.At Memorial Park, there are over 1,000 rose bushes.\n\n\n== Events ==\nOn the last Friday in June, Bank of the West hosts the \"Bank of the West Celebrates America\" concert in the park, which always ends with a fireworks show in commemoration of the Independence Day (United States) holiday. The concert attracts over 50,000 people each year. \n1987 - The Lettermen\n1988 - Bobby Vinton\n1993 - Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, The Drifters\n1994 - Bobby Vee, Martha Reevs and the Vandellas\n1995 - Frankie Avalon, Sha Na Na\n1996 - The Temptations\n1997 - The Four Tops, America\n1998 - Neil Sedaka, The Shirelles\n1999 - Blood, Sweat & Tears; The Drifters\n2000 - The Righteous Brothers, The Supremes\n2001 - The Beach Boys, Gary Puckett\n2002 - Creedence Clearwater Revisited, The Spinners\n2003 - The Village People, The Pointers\n2004 - (rained out)The Doobie Brothers, Three Dog Night\nAlso in 2004, 311 played at Memorial Park for free in celebration of Omaha's 150th Anniversary.

        "wiki": "Florence Mill, also known as the Weber Mill, is a historic mill located at 9102 North 30th Street near the 30th Street exit on I-680 in the Florence community in North Omaha, Nebraska. It was built in 1846 and operated into the 1960s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Weber Mill in 1998.  The mill is also known as the Mormon Mill, Grist Mill, and Old Pink Mill.  It is now operated as the Winter Quarters Mill Museum and ArtLoft Gallery.\n\n\n== History ==\nBrigham Young supervised construction by the Mormon pioneers of Winter Quarters in 1846. The Florence Mill is the only surviving building to have been built by the Mormons. The settlers needed a mill to grind corn, wheat, and rye to create cornmeal and flour products. Constructed next to Turkey Creek, later called Mill Creek, which flowed into the Missouri River, the original structure was deserted in 1846. A new mill was built in 1847 at the cost of $3000. Brigham Young sold this mill to John Neff, who deserted it when he moved to Salt Lake City.Alexander Hunter began operating the Mill in 1856, helping to fill the demands of the new town of Florence, founded in 1854 on the old site of Winter Quarters. He tore down the original mill, reusing some of the good timbers to build a new mill.\n\n\n== Weber family ==\nJacob Weber acquired the Mill around 1860, replacing water-powered machinery with new steam-powered equipment. The Weber family operated the Florence Mill continuously for over 104 years, contributing to the development of the milling industry between the last half of the nineteenth century into the twentieth century. The Weber's business was long considered to be the longest operating business in Nebraska.\n\n\n== Winter Quarters Mill Museum and ArtLoft Gallery ==\nThe mill is now operated as the Winter Quarters Mill Museum and ArtLoft Gallery. The museum features pioneer-era historic photos, 1854 newspaper clippings and agricultural artifacts.  The mill also hosts a farmers market from June through the end of September.\nContrary to previously published reports, Omaha billionaire Warren Buffett has not been actively involved in a drive to renovate the structure.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of North Omaha\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFlorence Mill - official site, includes museum information\n1920s picture of the Florence Mill.\nFlorence Mill Chronology.

        "wiki": "Robert George Seale (born October 22, 1936) is an American political activist. He and fellow activist Huey P. Newton co-founded the Black Panther Party.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSeale is the eldest of three children. He has a younger brother, Jon, and a younger sister, Betty. He was born in Liberty, Texas to George Seale, a carpenter, and Thelma Seale (n\u00e9e Traylor), a homemaker. The Seale family lived in poverty during most of Bobby Seale's early life. After moving around Texas, first to Dallas, then to San Antonio, and Port Arthur, his family relocated to Oakland, California when he was eight years old. Seale attended Berkeley High School, then dropped out and joined the United States Air Force in 1955. Three years later, a court martial convicted him of fighting with a commanding officer at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, resulting in a bad conduct discharge.Seale subsequently worked as a sheet metal mechanic for various aerospace plants while studying for his high school diploma at night. \"I worked in every major aircraft plant and aircraft corporation, even those with government contracts. I was a top-flight sheet-metal mechanic\". After earning his high school diploma, Seale attended Merritt Community College where he studied engineering and politics until 1962.While at college, Bobby Seale joined the Afro-American Association (AAA), a group on the campus devoted to advocating black separatism. \"I wanted to be an engineer when I went to college, but I got shifted right away since I became interested in American Black History and trying to solve some of the problems.\"  Through the AAA group, Seale met Huey P. Newton. In June 1966, Seale began working at the North Oakland Neighborhood Anti-Poverty Center in their summer youth program. Seale's objective was to teach the youth in the program Black American History and teach them a degree of responsibility towards the people living in their communities. While working in the program, Seale met Bobby Hutton, the first member of the Black Panther Party.He married Artie Seale, and had a son, Malik Nkrumah Stagolee Seale.\n\n\n== Black Panthers ==\nBobby Seale and Huey P. Newton were heavily inspired by the teachings of activist Malcolm X, who was assassinated in 1965. The two joined together in October 1966 to create the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, which adopted the late activist's slogan \"freedom by any means necessary\" as their own. Before the Black Panther Party, Seale and Newton created a group known as the Soul Students Advisory Council. The group was organized so to allow it to function through \"ultra-democracy,\" defined as individualism manifesting itself as an aversion to discipline. \"The goal was to develop a college campus group that would help develop leadership; to go back to the black community and serve the black community in a revolutionary fashion\". Seale and Newton then created the Black Panther Party to organize the black community and express their desires and needs in order to resist the racism and classism perpetuated by the system. Seale described the Panthers as \"an organization that represents black people and many white radicals relate to this and understand that the Black Panther Party is a righteous revolutionary front against this racist decadent, capitalistic system.\"Seale and Newton together wrote the doctrines \"What We Want Now!\" which Seale said were intended to be \"the practical, specific things we need and that should exist\" and \"What We Believe,\" which outlines the philosophical principles of the Black Panther Party in order to educate the people and disseminate information about the specifics of the party's platform. These writings were part of the party's Ten-Point Program, also known as \"The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense Ten-Point Platform and Program,\" a set of guidelines to the Black Panther Party's ideals and ways of operation. Seale and Newton decided to name Newton Minister of Defense and Seale became the Chairman of the party. During his time with the Panthers, he underwent surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as part of its COINTELPRO program.In 1968, Seale wrote Seize the Time: The Story of the Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton, published in 1970.\n\nBobby Seale was one of the original \"Chicago Eight\" defendants charged with conspiracy and inciting a riot in the wake of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Bobby Seale, while in prison, stated, \"To be a Revolutionary is to be an Enemy of the state. To be arrested for this struggle is to be a Political Prisoner.\" The evidence against Seale was slim, as he was not a participant in the planning for the convention's protest activity and had gone to Chicago as a last-minute replacement for activist Eldridge Cleaver. He had also been in Chicago for only two days of the convention. During the trial, one of Seale's many vociferous protests led Judge Julius Hoffman to have him bound and gagged, as commemorated in the song \"Chicago\"  written by Graham Nash and mentioned in the poem and song \"H2Ogate Blues\" by Gil Scott-Heron. On November 5, 1969, Judge Hoffman sentenced him to four years in prison for 16 counts of contempt, each count for three months of his imprisonment because of his outbursts during the trial, and eventually ordered Seale severed from the case, leading to the proceedings against the remaining defendants being renamed the \"Chicago Seven\". The trial of the \"Chicago Eight\" was depicted in the 1987 HBO television movie Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8, whose script relied heavily upon transcripts from the court proceedings. Seale was portrayed by actor Carl Lumbly.\n\nWhile serving his four-year sentence, Seale was put on trial again in 1970 in the New Haven Black Panther trials. Several officers of the Panther organization had murdered a fellow Panther, Alex Rackley, who had confessed under torture to being a police informant.  The leader of the murder plan, George Sams, Jr., turned state's evidence and testified that Seale, who had visited New Haven only hours before the murder, had ordered him to kill Rackley. The trials were accompanied by a large demonstration in New Haven on May Day, 1970, which coincided with the beginning of the American college student strike of 1970. The jury was unable to reach a verdict in Seale's trial, and the charges were eventually dropped. The government suspended his convictions and Seale was released from prison in 1972. While Seale was in prison, his wife, Artie, became pregnant, allegedly by fellow Panther Fred Bennett. Bennett's mutilated remains were found in a suspected Panther hideout in April 1971. Seale was implicated in the murder, with police suspecting he had ordered it in retaliation for the affair, but no charges were pressed. Seale wrote an article titled \"One Less Oppressor\" that shows appreciation of the murder of Bennett and stated, \"The people have now come to realize that the only way to deal with the oppressor is to deal on our own terms and this was done.\"Seale ran for Mayor of Oakland, California in 1973. He received the second-most votes in a field of nine candidates but ultimately lost in a run-off with incumbent Mayor John Reading. In 1974, Seale and Huey Newton argued over a proposed movie about the Panthers that Newton wanted Bert Schneider to produce. According to several accounts, the argument escalated to a fight in which Newton, backed by his armed bodyguards, allegedly beat Seale with a bullwhip so badly that Seale required extensive medical treatment for his injuries. Afterwards, he went into hiding for nearly a year, and ended his affiliation with the Party in 1974. Seale denied any such physical altercation took place, dismissing rumors that he and Newton were ever less than friends.\n\n\n== The Ten Point Platform ==\n\nSeale worked with Huey Newton to create the Ten Point platform. The platform was a political and social demand for the survival of the Black population in the United States. The two men formulated the Ten Point Platform in the late 60s, and these ideologies grew into the Black Panther Party. The document encapsulated the economic exploitation of the black body, and addressed the mistreatment of the black race. This document was attractive to those suffering under the oppressive nature of white power. The document takes the position that combination of racism and capitalism resulted in fascism in the United States. The Ten Point Platform lays out the need for full employment of blacks, the need for their shelter, and decent education; decent education meaning the real history of the United States, the history including the murder of Native Americans and the enslavement of Africans. The platform calls for the release of political prisoners.\nThe points are as follows:\nWe Want Freedom. We Want Power To Determine The Destiny Of Our Black Community.\nWe Want Full Employment For Our People.\nWe Want An End To The Robbery By The Capitalists Of Our Black Community.\nWe Want Decent Housing Fit For The Shelter Of Human Beings.\nWe Want Education For Our People That Exposes The True Nature Of This Decadent American Society. We Want Education That Teaches Us Our True History And Our Role In The Present-Day Society.\nWe Want All Black Men To Be Exempt From Military Service.\nWe Want An Immediate End To Police Brutality And Murder Of Black People.\nWe Want Freedom For All Black Men Held In Federal, State, County And City Prisons And Jails.\nWe Want All Black People When Brought To Trial To Be Tried In Court By A Jury Of Their Peer Group Or People From Their Black Communities, As Defined By The Constitution Of The United States.\nWe Want Land, Bread, Housing, Education, Clothing, Justice And Peace.\n\n\n== Life after the Black Panthers ==\nIn 1988, Bobby Seale wrote an autobiography titled A Lonely Rage. Also, in 1987, he wrote a cookbook called Barbeque'n with Bobby Seale: Hickory & Mesquite Recipes, the proceeds going to various non-profit social organizations. Seale also advertised Ben & Jerry's ice cream.In 1998, Seale appeared on the television documentary series Cold War, discussing the events of the 1960s. Bobby Seale was the central protagonist alongside Kathleen Cleaver, Jamal Joseph and Nile Rodgers in the 1999 theatrical documentary 'Public Enemy' by Jens Meurer, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. In 2002, Seale began dedicating his time to Reach!, a group focused on youth education programs. He has also taught black studies at Temple University in Philadelphia.  Seale appears in Roberto Bola\u00f1o's last novel, 2666, renamed as Barry Seaman. Also in 2002, Seale moved back to Oakland, working with young political advocates to influence social change. In 2006, he appeared in the documentary The U.S. vs. John Lennon to discuss his friendship with John Lennon. Seale has also visited over 500 colleges to share his personal experiences as a Black Panther and to give advice to students interested in community organizing and social justice.Since 2013, Seale has been seeking to produce a screenplay he wrote based on his autobiography, Seize the Time: The Eighth Defendant.Seale co-authored Power to the People: The World of the Black Panthers, a 2016 book with photographer Stephen Shames.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nSeale, Bobby; Shames,  Stephen.

          "It's a decent place with plenty of birds to view at certain times of the year.  Be careful if going during wet seasons, the wood on those little bridges get slick; we both nearly fell on our hineys a couple times. Otherwise, a decent place for a quick nature getaway.",
          "Beautiful place! Always free. Butterfly garden and walking trails. We typically spend 45-60 minutes here.",

          "Very nice place to walk if you have a disability. It's fairly flat. Not concrete, but well-maintained. Has many benches to sit down there on the way. Very peaceful. Get to the end of the trail there's a Duck Blind that you can sit in and watch the waterfowl in the pond.",
          "Been going here for years, great place for a walk.",

          "Beautiful place to hike!",

          "Saw a fox our first trip there !!! And to all the people saying off the trails was \"unkept\", it's not a zoo,its a nature preseve. If you expect a fish to climb a tree, you'll always be disappointed",

          "An amazing hidden gem in Omaha. Nice short little hike with great wildlife viewing.",
          "This is truly an oasis in the middle of Omaha. Just a few steps in, and you would forget you were in the city if not for the sound of traffic. My last visit here I saw a Heron fly away, geese, turtles and a wide variety of colorful insects \u2026",

          "Driven by this place for years and finally decided to stop in. Very pleased I did, it's as if it was transplanted from outside it's location. A very special and unique habitat in the middle of suburbia, Wow.",
          "Nice trails and a great bird blind for photographers.",
          "This seemed like it could have been really incredible, but for whatever reason it was overgrown and felt extremely unkempt. The wildlife did not disappoint.",
          "Beautiful scenery. Great place for a quick afternoon walk with kids.",

          "This place has a lot to offer the younger crowd that isn't looking at all of the details. The mini golf course is in dire need of replacement as it's one of the blandest I've ever experienced, not to mention falling apart. The go carts looked beat up and good use a simple coat",
          "Instead of the traditional family reunion picnic, we opted for a fun day at Fun Plex to entertain family from all over. There were over 3 generation in attendance and we all went to the park. We all had fun. Adults and kids rode the go carts, roller coasters, and all. The kids",

          "I have lived in Omaha for over 10 years and Labor Day 2016 was my first time coming to the park because they were offering half priced admission. I brought my 5 year old daughter and her friend and we ALL had a blast! I felt like a little kid again and the best thing about being",
          "We went as a large group, over 200 and the process to get inside took way too long. The food selection for the price wasn't great and many of our kids didn't enjoy it. Also, with a large group, don't get funnel cake as an option, it took way too long to make. There is a place",
          "Overall it's a great place. The pricing needs to be adjusted for non swimmers though. Also this time some of the rides weren't operational. Our 9 yr old had a ball on the newer attraction. Perfect playtime.",
          "We visited Fun Plex on a Thursday evening after 4:00, admission was only around $10.00. There was enough options for the money spent. I think my 2 - 15 year old boys would have grown tired of it had we planned to be there much more than 4 hours. Our visit was cut short by a",

          "We visited on a Monday (children ages 13, 12, 9 and 6) and had great fun. We started with the rides which had no lines and appropriate for the different ages of my kids. The attendants were quite nice and many asked if we enjoyed the ride or told us to have a good time. It",

          "I recently took my family on a trip to Fun-Plex. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of friendly staff members working. Every employee was extremely helpful with any question I had and seemed like they all very much enjoyed their job. It was so refreshing to see a business",

          "I would not pay full price to go here but for the after 4:00 or Monday special price it is worth it. Staff is nice. Water is wave pool had some leaves.",
          "I think this is a good place for Omaha to have, but I think it might be lacking pride of ownership. The place looks pretty beat down. The costs are high as its similar to the cost of Worlds of Fun or Adventure Land but not nearly as big.",
          "Biggest Water Park in Omaha. Lots of slides, lazy river, and a wave pool. In addition, they also have other rides, like race cars, bumper boats, and mini golf. Fun day to spend the day in the summer time, I took my kids and their cousins out for the day.",
          "My dad use to take me here all the time when I was little then when I hit a teenager we stopped going all the time because it started getting expensive for what you where getting. I took my daughter here around her 4th birthday and it was still a little pricey but not terrible.",
          "We had LOTS of fun here, the Ferris wheel was a thrill, and not calm like many other boring ones (although there was one boring one, and the veiw is a AMAZING) I wish Fun Plex has more attractions, it has just a little. If it had more, it would have received more than 4 stars!",
          "Fun park in the middle of the city. Not a sea world but worth the visit especially for smaller kids. Food and drinks available at reasonable prices.",
          "The go carts were slow and really just was not fun cuz they make you go one at a time so you coukld not even race one another. the lazy river although was relaxing.",
          "Me personally had a really great time but my little sister is not a ride person. So that being said the only ride she wanted to ride was the go carts. We were also with 7 kids and three adults so there were a lot of kids that wanted to do a lot of different things. So we went to",
          "My 6 year old daughter had a great time here. It's not a big amusement park by any means, but we had a good time and the price was reasonable.",
          "Fun Plex is certainly no Worlds of Fun or anything like that, but for what it is it's worth it. There's only a few rides, but the water park makes up for that. The wave pool is excellent, and the water slides are seemingly more intense every time.",
          "The lazy river here is awesome! The pools are nice and there is even a separate pool for the babbies and toddlers. There are lots of fun rides for the teenagers to go on also. Food and drink are what you would expect for this type of attraction. There are lockers and tube",
          "Wife n i took kids to water park as something to finalize our vacation with....for the money was not a bad deal...was not crazy crowded and rides were pretty good considering. ...definitely a great place for younger kids but older teenagers. Not so much..got bored pretty quick.",
          "We visited Fun-Plex yesterday. We had a good time. I would agree with others who say that you should go on discount days. Normal admission price for both rides and water park is $24.95 plus tax. On discount days, it's $16.95 plus tax. My child enjoyed the go-karts, slick",
          "My husband and I took our son there today for the first time and quite frankly just might have be the last time. Right when we got there we were sort of confused as to where to go, while we were standing there figuring it out 3 employees walked past us and never once told us",
          "I always enjoy my time here and especially like the 21 and over on summer nights. It always has drinks for sell but its nice to relax kidless at night. The park itself has plenty to offer for a days entertainment.",
          "Special deals on Tuesdays. That is what we did. Rides and water park all day. Good deal for what you get. We enjoyed our time and will come back again.",
          "It is not a large theme park, but it is a good escape for a family. There is both a water park and theme park attached together. Bumper boats, slick track and go karts top the list of the theme park, while the lazy river and 5-story water slides top the list for the water park.",
          "Spent a Thursday afternoon here recently. We went on Thursday because its a discounted day. We paid $15 pp to get in. It had about 5 rides for little kids and 5 rides for adults. Things like a bumper boats and cars. A little facing track. A small roller coaster ect.... The",
          "What a great time for the family. Water park is awesome. Daughter could have spent the whole day just there. Lines to rides are long but worth the wait. Go-Carts are a blast. We will be making this one of our yearly family trips for fun.",
          "I noticed that \"cleanliness\" is not an option on this review site.... got here right when the doors opened and the wave pool is filthy... tons of debris and nasty clumps of hair everywhere! I guess I could understand late in the day.....sick....keep your mouths closed if you",
          "water slides, motion ocean for relaxing and a beach type pool. Also has some rides and minature golf plus concessions. Great for company picnics.",
          "Fun Plex is a good place for some family fun. The go cart track and water slides were enjoyable. The batting cages and video arcade provided some fun after taking a break from the water activiites. The prices are higher than one would expect for the rides and food so be advised.",
          "This 'local' place has always provided a great time for kids, teens and families in Omaha. It is always expanding and keeping things fresh and new!!",
          "Frankly this is the only outdoor waterpark in Omaha. It is nice, I guess. The water can get very warm and this year they were putting blocks of ice in it to cool it off. My niece loves the slides here, and although the lines are sometimes long, people get through quickly.",
          "Go on a day that they offer discounts (I think Tuesday and Thursdays). They have enough to do to keep the kids entertained and the swimming area is nice and clean. They have adult beverages, which is nice. There are rides available for younger kids, which is really nice.",
          "A small park but a fun time for all ages. Kiddie rides, go carts, and a small coaster. The water park is small but very nice too, Food is ok.",
          "The entrance wasn't enthralling. It was dark, with no help in sight, but a few minutes in everything changed. Once walking outside of the entrance, it is a blue of motion and sounds of guests having fun. We walked into the greeting area and ordered tickets and we were greeted",
          "Fun plex is loads of fun. The wave pool is AWESOME. Lazy river is GREAT. Rides are decent, lines get a little long. My BIGGEST complaint about fun plex is the life guards. They dont pay attention to their job. I have been here since 1pm and I cant believe how they just walk",
          "We went to Fun Plex in Omaha, Nebraska.Tuesdays and Thursdays in the summer it is only $14.95 to ride all the rides and go to the water park all day. I finally found something my teenagers wanted to do this summer with us. It was a great time!",
          "I have been to Fun Plex so many times I have lost count. I love it, There is a part of my childhood rests right on the waterslides. It has been several years since I have been there, but I never stop thinking about it. Anyone who is traveling through the area should take the"

It\u2019s 30 dollars just for one kid, not to mention the food. The lifeguards are trustworthy, you should definitely try it out despite the price",

Your slides are  amazing my grandsons  has so much .Good food ,We be back it was a great staycation 2020. Wish you still had the roller coaster.",

          "It was a very fun water park, great for a family outing. The water was nice and cool to get in. I will say though that the water was dirty in some places. The cement was very hot making it nearly impossible to walk barefoot. The water slides were well kept. The food was good but it was a little overpriced.",
          "Very good fun place recommended.  There is a special place for everyone, be it children, to relax or to have fun.",
          "Very friendly and fun ... have drinks by the water..",
          "This place is so much fun!!! The wave pool reminds me of the ocean in Texas. Really the only problems are the food price is a little high, and it's hard for some people getting up those giant stairs for the slides.",
          "Fun plex is a great place to enjoy an afternoon with the family.  Is it six flags, no but for a small park, we always have a good time.  Funplex sells season passes at a discount online as a black Friday deal.",
          "It was crowded but fun. The water was nice and warm. The lifeguards were paying attention to the people in the pool and doing an excellent job.",
          "A great place to take the smaller children. Other than the go cart track and water features there's not many rides for the kids older than 13. My grandchildren always have fun. But my 15 yr old grandson gets bored quickly.",
          "Best family fun day I've ever had, something for everyone!",
          "We had a blast on July 4! Riding go karts and water slides was great!! It is a safe place to have some outdoor without losing track of your group. Got here at 11am & had very short waits.",

          "Great staff. Wonderful environment!",
          "Kids love it here! Some times when we go, it seems like staff aren't able to keep things cleaned up as well and people are more chaotic, but not always. That's typically when it is insanely busy though, so it's understandable.",
          "Not as expensive as most water parks and amusement parks, once you pay the entrance fee there are no other fees. Cost of food was higher than average though. In order to do everything depending on how busy the park is you may need the whole \u2026",
          "Beautiful time with the kids. Perfect for younger kids but things for the older ones as well.",
          "As a manager at my job I have to make a comment on how Alexis the manager on duty on Friday 07/10 handled her customers . I came at 6pm spoke to an employee that stated we can come in as long as we do so before close. I went home to grab \u2026",

          "Great place to go an spend a day relaxing and having fun with the family!! Amusement rides were great, staff very friendly, wasn't overcrowded, something for everyone. Cant wait to go back!",
          "Went here for their annual Pooloza event. The water park areas were fun (although I will have to go back to try the water slides), and I enjoyed just floating around the lazy river or sitting in a tube in the wave pool. The music from Pooloza created a great atmosphere and a fun night.",
          "Pretty cool, but I would like if they add more attractions to the park",
          "Great staff fun rides cool water what more do you want",
          "Fun place to take the hole family...beer is cold and food is top of the line",
          "My kids love it here when we visit Omaha. Just a bit pricey. Clean and fun.",
          "Lots of fun, earlier in the day before it gets too busy. Great fun in the Lazzy River, the slides were excellent, and good food from the snack shack.",
          "Tons of fun for the kids! We will definitely be coming to Omaha again!",
          "Family friendly very fun definitely coming back soon",
          "The kids and myself loved the wave pool and the racing go karts",
          "We went here last weekend and my family loved it. The water attractions are beautiful and we tried them all. Food is also great and parking is not a problem. We will definitely go back.",
          "My daughter and I had a blast here. We had a groupon for the tickets- saved us $8/person. My favorite part was the playground looking structure full of water spouts, slides, and a giant bucket that dump hundreds of gallons of water every \u2026",
          "Pretty much enjoyed my evening w my Little. The staff was helpful. Except for one girl at the tubes/locker rentals that gave me a look like I was stupid for asking if I could leave the tube w her and I'll come back later as I didn't wanna \u2026",
          "We had a great experience with our whole family. 2 adults and 2 kids ages 4 and 7. Service was great from all employees and there was a wide variety of rides, slides and pools for all ages.",
          "Always a fun time,=&",
          "fun for kids and adults. there's more kid rides than adult rides and more adult water slides than kids slides.  I thought there was a rollercoaster but apparently not",
          "So fun!!!! The kids LOVED it, and so did I. All day awesomeness, something I would recommend is packing a cooler, you can't take outside food or drinks in but you get a stamp and can go in and out. The wave pool was fun and the tilt a whirl was the best!",
          "It closed we were going to do a 4 hour drive on October 1 but they close it on July 28 short notise much",
          "Great. Family place.",
          "Great place to chill and get a little sun!",
          "Fun Plex on September 1st for my kiddos 11th birthday. I was disappointed to say the least. I wish I would have known I would have to pay park entrance fees for Grandparents just coming to bring presents. \ud83d\ude44 The initial room and 2 pizza \u2026",
          "I can only afford to go with my kids when they have really good deals or the twilight specials, I feel like it's pretty pricey for what they have. I personally don't feel like pricing by height for kids is very fair either. Some kids are \u2026",
          "Was a bit crowded but super fun",
          "Expensive entry fee. We went with small children from ages 5yo and below. The water park rides were all open with lifeguards. The ameusment rides were only a few open and some looked broken. They don't let you take food in, which is good in a way because the park itself is clean... Very clean.",
          "The slides are awesome! The wave pool was fun and for the whole Park the Monday price was a bargain. Worth a visit for sure."

        "wiki": "El Museo Latino is a museum featuring Latino and Hispanic art and history that is located at 4701 South 25th Street in South Omaha, Nebraska. Established in 1993, by Magdalena Garc\u00eda, it is the first Latino art and history museum and cultural center in the Midwest.\n\n\n== History ==\nEl Museo Latino was established by Magdalena Garcia, a Mexico City native who had moved to Omaha at the age of nine.  After working in industry for some years, Garcia had changed her focus to art and museums.  In 1988, she obtained a degree in fine arts from the University of Nebraska Omaha; in 1992, a master's degree in museum management from Syracuse University.  She returned to Omaha and, in 1993, opened El Museo Latino in the Livestock Exchange Building.In 1997, the museum moved to the former Polish Home, at 4701 S. 25th Street.  The site had originally been occupied by the South Central School, built in 1887.  In 1916, the school was essentially rebuilt, as a single-story U-shaped Romanesque Revival-style building.  In 1930, following the school's closing, the building was acquired by the American Legion.  The Legion found themselves unable to keep up with the mortgage payments, and in 1936 sold the building to the Polish Home, a social organization serving the large Polish immigrant community in South Omaha.  As the Polish Home, the building housed a library and served as a venue for Polish-language classes and for events such as dances, wedding receptions, and political rallies.  The Polish Home owned the building until 1998, when it was sold to El Museo Latino.\n\n\n== About ==\nEl Museo Latino features exhibits about Latino and Hispanic art and history. Educational programs for kindergarten through twelfth grade, post-secondary, and adult audiences at the museum include lectures, slide presentations, films, art classes, workshops, demonstrations, art history classes, gallery talks, guided visits, and dance classes. Additionally, El Museo Latino is a resource center for Latino studies in the Midwest. Museum highlights have included an exhibit from the Smithsonian Institution organized by actor Edward James Olmos\n, along with works by Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. Photographer David Bacon and painter Terry Rosenberg have also been featured.\nEl Museo Latino organizes special events highlighting Cinco de Mayo, including an annual almuerzo, or brunch. Hispanic Heritage Month in September features a banquet. During the year, Family Day celebrations are also scheduled as well as special dance performances by the museum's dance company, \"CHOMARI\" Ballet Folklorico Mexicano, and by visiting artists. The museum also coordinates an annual celebration for El D\u00eda de Muertos, including a festival, special exhibits and cultural celebrations.In 2015, the museum's building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, under the name \"Polish Home\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nMexicans in Omaha, Nebraska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEl Museo Latino",

It is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Its mission is conservation, research, recreation, and education. In August 2014, TripAdvisor proclaimed Henry Doorly Zoo the \"world's best zoo\", leading San Diego Zoo and Loro Parque, based on an algorithmic assimilation of millions of reviews for 275 major zoos worldwide.Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is nationally renowned for its leadership in animal conservation and research. Evolving from the public Riverview Park Zoo established in 1894, today the zoo includes several notable exhibits. It features the largest cat complex in North America; \"Kingdoms of the Night\" is the world's largest nocturnal exhibit and indoor swamp; the Lied Jungle is one of the world's largest indoor rainforests, and the \"Desert Dome\" is one of the world's largest indoor deserts, as well as the largest glazed geodesic dome in the world. The zoo is Nebraska's top paid attendance attraction and has welcomed more than 25 million visitors over the past 40 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe zoo originally began in 1894 as Riverview Park Zoo. Four years later, it had over 120 animals. In 1952, the Omaha Zoological Society was created with aims to improve the zoo. In 1963, Margaret Hitchcock Doorly donated $750,000. In doing so, she stipulated that the zoo be renamed in memory of her late husband, Henry Doorly, chairman of the World Publishing Company. Union Pacific helped the zoo lay down 2.5 mi (4.0 km) of track in 1968 with the inaugural run of the Omaha Zoo Railroad made on July 22, 1968.Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium has two rides that circumnavigate the zoo (tram and train), a carousel and the Skyfari, an aerial tram which opened in 2009 and which takes visitors from the Butterfly and Insect Pavilion to the new lion viewing exhibit.\nThe zoo is adjacent to the former site of Rosenblatt Stadium. In 2011, the zoo began developing the land at former Rosenblatt Stadium to become the new parking area and visitor center, leaving a small memorial at the location of home plate.

The Pavillion is a 14,000-square-foot (1,300 m2) total-immersion exhibit located between the Scott Aquarium and the Giraffe Complex. Viewed from the sky, the exhibit resembles a winged insect. The building features several different exhibits inside:\n\nButterfly Conservatory: The 2,450-square-foot (228 m2) area features 10-foot (3.0 m)-high glass sidewalls to allow the maximum amount of light inside the exhibit. Natural light, large trees, rocks, and water elements are all critical components needed to simulate a natural habitat and important to stimulate natural butterfly behaviors.\nConservation Promenade: Located in the Butterfly Conservatory, the promenade winds past numerous waterfalls and over streams, through lush vegetation, and loops around the giant Amazon water lily pool. The pool features a stilt root tree supporting a floating walkway for visitors to travel through the roots and get an up-close view of the giant South American water lilies. Many species of exquisite butterflies and moths including the beautiful blue morpho, zebra longwing, and painted ladies fly among visitors. Microhabitats will be displayed along the Conservation Promenade featuring many endangered amphibians the Zoo is currently working with in response to the global amphibian crisis. Upon leaving this area, visitors will find a mirrored room to carefully check for hitch-hiking butterflies before exiting.\nChrysalis Hatching Room: A 220-square-foot (20 m2) area where butterflies and moths in their chrysalis or cocoon stage will be brought in from all over the world. Once inside, they will be carefully hung in hatching chambers where visitors can watch them complete their metamorphosis into flying insects. The 510-square-foot (47 m2) entry hallway leading into the insect wing will contain several displays, such as a locust colony and bee hive, along with interactive learning opportunities.\nInsect Zoo: This 2,413-square-foot (224.2 m2) area will have a 5-foot (1.5 m) high glass sidewall on top of a 7-foot (2.1 m) solid wall to allow more intensive exhibit work. Individual micro-habitats will be home to ants, spiders, scorpions, walking sticks, mantids, centipedes, roaches, beetles and other creatures. In the center of this experience, two bird cages will house other exotic species such as tropical hummingbirds.\nLower Level: Features two rooms, approximately 1,085-square-foot (100.8 m2) total, to be used for rearing butterflies and culturing insect colonies. A 542-square-foot (50.4 m2) room will be used to maintain plants that are being rotated through the butterfly display. A frog breeding and rearing facility occupying 1,161-square-foot (107.9 m2) of space, will house the most threatened amphibians. The rooms will be viewed through windows from the Giraffe Observation Walk that circles the building and will allow Zoo visitors a real look at what goes on behind the scenes. This same path will have numerous native butterfly gardens and offer visitors the opportunity to be eye to eye and nose to nose with the giraffe herd. -->\n\n\n=== Desert Dome ===\n\nThe Desert Dome opened in April 2002 at a cost of $31.5 million (includes Kingdoms of the Night).

The complex had 11 indoor enclosures and 10 outdoor enclosures with a claimed capacity of up to 100 cats.\nThe building was the largest cat-breeding and management facility in North America.\nThe Cat Complex was awarded the \"Edward H. Bean Award\" (1994) for tiger husbandry by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\nOmaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is known worldwide for its work in the field of artificial insemination of large cats. The exhibit was closed permanently and demolished in 2019 as the cats located in the Cat Complex were relocated to new exhibits in the African Grasslands and Asian Highlands, or at other zoos and sanctuaries.\nThe complex contained nine species from the family Felidae:\n\nAmur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis)\nCougar (Puma concolor)\nFishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus)\nJaguar (Panthera onca)\nSnow leopard (Panthera uncia)\nAfrican lion (Panthera leo)\nBengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris)\nIndochinese tiger (P. t. corbetti)\nSiberian tiger (P. t. altaica)The zoo's 15-year master plan, composed in 2010, called for the elimination of the Cat Complex along with the overhauling of several other exhibits. Going forward, animals at the zoo will be grouped not by their genetic relatives, but by regions of the world.\n\n\n=== Durham Family Bear Canyon ===\n\nThe Durham Family Bear Canyon opened in 1989 at a cost of $1.4 million. The canyon had a large 30,000-U.S.-gallon (25,000 imp gal; 110,000 L) tank for polar bears. Having previously housed four bear species - the Polar bear, the American black bear, the Sun bear and the Spectacled bear, it was closed and demolished in 2018 to make room for Owen Coastal Shores.\n\n\n=== Red Barn Park ===\nThe Red Barn Park was a petting zoo that opened in 1966. It included numerous domesticated animals including goats and cattle and was particularly noteworthy because of the large red barn that could be found in the area. It was demolished in 2018 and replaced with the Glacier Bay Landing area which opened in the spring of 2019. Many of the animals found in the exhibit were transferred to the Children's Adventure Trails.\n\n\n== Research ==\nThe Bill and Berniece Grewcock Center for Conservation and Research is a world-class research center at the zoo. The center has discovered several new species. The world's first in vitro-fertilized (\"test-tube\") gorilla resides at the zoo. The world's first artificially inseminated tiger was born in Omaha in 1991, followed by the world's first artificially inseminated gaur. The original 16,448-square-foot (1,528.1 m2) facility was constructed in 1996.\nIn 2006, it underwent a $6 million expansion which brings the total space to 32,000 sq ft (3,000 m2).The research center focuses on six areas:\n\nEducation and technology transfer\nConservation medicine\nMolecular genetics\nReproductive physiology\nHorticulture\nNutrition\n\n\n=== Mouse lemurs ===\nA study led by Edward Louis, a conservation geneticist at the zoo, identified three new mouse lemurs (Simmons' mouse lemur, Mittermeier's mouse lemur, and Jolly's mouse lemur) with the first named after Lee Simmons, the zoo's director.\n\n\n== Rides and transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railroad ===\n\nThe Omaha Zoo Railroad is a 2.5-mile (4.0 km), 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) narrow gauge train that loops through the zoo.\nThe railroad began operations on July 22, 1968, after the track was laid down by the Union Pacific railroad. The train operates with one of two oil-powered steam locomotives. Riva is about twice as powerful (although is almost 80 years older) as the #119 and is regularly used on weekends when more visitors are present. The #119 is the original locomotive for the zoo. A new diesel locomotive arrived in September 2008. This diesel is a 2-axle Plymouth locomotive and is used for switching operations of the passenger cars and other railroad-related projects.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe tram is a trackless tram that drives on the walkway paths around the zoo.\nIt has four stops:\n\nBy the Desert Dome (top of the hill)\nBetween the elephant/zebra yard and pygmy goat kraal\nBy the playground near the sea lions\nBetween the carousel and Alaskan Adventure splashpad\n\n\n=== Skyfari ===\nOmaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium opened the Skyfari in 2009. It is an aerial tram that runs from one stop at the Butterfly and Insect Pavilion to the lion platform. It goes over the African veldt (ostriches and giraffes), cheetahs, the railroad tracks, the Garden of the Senses, the koi lagoon, and the lions.\n\n\n=== Carousel ===\nA carousel is available on which visitors can ride handcrafted recreations of wild animals.\n\n\n== Educational programs ==\nThe zoo offers many educational programs. The activities include school-involved programs, special \"edzoocational\" programs, zoo internships, animal-adoption, and volunteer work. Several programs include field trips, guided tours, educator workshops, Little Lion's Preschool, and two-way internet video conferencing to bring the zoo to the classroom. The edzoocational programs are educational programs that are taught in a nontraditional way. These programs include overnight camp-outs at the zoo, scouting programs, summer camps, birthday parties, and on-site speakers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nThe Essential Henry Doorly Zoo Guide and iPhone App\nGorilla breaks window",

Obviously, guests should stay on the walking paths but be sure to take a good look at the plants and faux rock formations! Architectural and natural beauty combined.",
          "Interesting set-up. Not really sure if having a huge mountain take up the center of the dome is really a good idea; the space could have been better used by including more species or give more space to the animals already present. The \u2026",
          "Always one of the most popular buildings with my kids. Good mix of animals you might encounter in your state (turtles, frogs, and beavers) with some that most people might not (alligators and caymans). The desert dome can be pretty hot in the Summer but \"it's a dry heat\".  ;o)",

        "wiki": "Chalco Hills Recreation Area is located in northwestern Sarpy County, Nebraska, and approximately 12 miles (19 km) west of downtown Omaha. Chalco Hills consists of 1,186 acres (4.80 km2) of which 246 acres (1.00 km2) is covered by Wehrspann Lake, an artificial reservoir. The recreation area was opened in 1988 as part of Papio-Missouri River Natural Resources District efforts to provide flood control and improve recreation opportunities. The Dam was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the recreation area is managed by the Natural Resources District.\n\n\n== Recreation ==\n\nThere are seven picnic areas and several have covered pavilions, the largest of which can accommodate up to 100 people and can be reserved. Seven miles (11 km) of walking trails encircle Wehrspann Lake. Several soccer fields and one baseball field, along with two playgrounds adjacent to picnic areas are easily reached from nearby parking areas. The soccer fields are also used as launch sites for hot-air balloons and radio controlled airplanes. The area is used for cross-country running events during the fall, and cross-country skiing and ice fishing are popular in the winter. Fishing is more popular in the warmer seasons, and there is parking for 30 trailers. Motorized boats must comply with the no-wake regulation by maintaining speeds under 5 miles (8 km) per hour.\n\n\n== Wehrspann Lake ==\nWehrspann Lake is a man-made reservoir that covers 246 acres (1.00 km2) and is up to 30 feet (9.1 m) deep. It is located on tributary streams that flow into Papillion Creek. A \"universally accessible\" fishing pier and boat launch provide fishing access to Wehrspann Lake. On the southeast side of the lake, a waterfowl viewing platform permits closer observation of the numerous species of birds that frequent the area. The lake is stocked with a variety of fish species including bluegill, channel and blue catfish, crappie, largemouth bass, walleye, and carp.\n\n\n== Natural resources ==\nChalco Hills also has an arboretum of native plants of the region including prairie grasses, trees and flowers. Much of the recreation area has been replanted with native species of trees and grasses. The recreation area is popular for bird watching and is frequented by a number of species throughout the year. A small herd of white-tailed deer also reside in the area.\n\n\n== External links ==\nChalco Hills Recreation Area - Papio-Missouri River Natural Resources District\nU.S Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Fontenelle Forest is a 1,400-acre (6 km2) forest, located near Bellevue, Nebraska. Its visitor features include hiking trails, a nature center, children's camps, a gift shop, and picnic facilities. The forest is listed as a National Natural Landmark and a National Historic District. The forest includes hardwood deciduous forest, extensive floodplain, loess hills, and marshlands.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter settlement by Woodland culture Indians for a thousand years prior to the arrival of whites, the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped near or at the location of the forest on July 27, 1804.\nJoshua Pilcher founded a trading post near Fontenelle Forest's great marsh for the Missouri Fur Company in 1812. This was at the edge of territory of the Omaha and Otoe peoples. The French-American trader Lucien Fontenelle, from New Orleans, later bought the post from Pilcher, and it became known as Fontenelle's Post.\nWith the declining fur trade, he sold the post to the federal government in 1832, which used it to house the Bellevue Indian Agency.  After Fontenelle's death in 1840, his oldest son Logan Fontenelle returned to Nebraska from school in St. Louis. Tri-lingual and of mixed race, the younger Fontenelle started working at age 15 as an interpreter for the US Indian agent at the Agency. His mother was the daughter of the Omaha principal chief, Big Elk; and he spoke Omaha, English and French.\nThe younger Fontenelle participated as interpreter in negotiations for the Omaha cession of land in its 1854 treaty with the United States, and many European Americans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries thought he was a chief. In 1919 the historian Melvin R. Gilmore wrote an article explaining the Omaha patrilineal gente system, which he believed prohibited Fontenelle as a chief because of his American father, as he was never adopted into the tribe. Because Fontenelle's father was a white man, the Omaha classified him as also white. Both father and son are buried in the forest, although the exact location is unknown.\nDr. A.A. Tyler and Dr. Harold Gifford, Sr. founded the Fontenelle Forest Association in 1913 with a mission to preserve the woodlands south of Omaha, Nebraska along the Missouri River. They bought their first preservation land in 1920. The association named the forest after Logan Fontenelle.\nA small nature center was opened in 1966 for the popular educational hikes led by volunteers. In 2000, the Fontenelle Forest Association officially changed its name to Fontenelle Nature Association. In 2012, Fontenelle Nature Association changed its name back to Fontenelle Forest. Today, Fontenelle Forest keeps more than 2,000 acres of riparian forest, prairies, swamps, and other lands in preservation. The lands encompass one of the largest natural deciduous forests in Nebraska.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nFontenelle Forest includes several facilities. The Katherine and Fred Buffett Forest Learning Center is the main building in the forest. Built in 2000, it has space for school programs, public education events and private events. Two miles from the Learning Center is the Gilbert and Martha Hitchcock Wetlands Learning Center. It offers educational spaces adjacent to the Gifford Memorial Boardwalk, a 3/8-mile path that leads to a two-story observation tower overlooking the Great Marsh, and was opened in 1999.\nFontenelle Forest also owns and operates Neale Woods, located north of Omaha.\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\nSituated along the Missouri River Valley flyway, Fontenelle Forest, the Audubon Society reports that \"246 species [of birds] have been recorded, among them 35 species of warblers.\" Birder\u2019s World named the forest one of the top ten warbler viewing spots in the United States. Bird Watching magazine wrote that Fontenelle Forest is, \"the single best place to see eastern birds near the western edge of their ranges and western birds near their eastern borders.\" It is the only place in Nebraska where red-shouldered hawks have nested, and one of the few known places in the state that support pileated woodpeckers. Other species of note seen in the forest include Kentucky, prothonotary, and cerulean warbler; wood thrush; grasshopper sparrow; and whip-poor-will.\n\n\n== Fontenelle Forest bibliography ==\nGarabrandt, G.W.

The building features several different exhibits inside:\n\nButterfly Conservatory: The 2,450-square-foot (228 m2) area features 10-foot (3.0 m)-high glass sidewalls to allow the maximum amount of light inside the exhibit. Natural light, large trees, rocks, and water elements are all critical components needed to simulate a natural habitat and important to stimulate natural butterfly behaviors.\nConservation Promenade: Located in the Butterfly Conservatory, the promenade winds past numerous waterfalls and over streams, through lush vegetation, and loops around the giant Amazon water lily pool. The pool features a stilt root tree supporting a floating walkway for visitors to travel through the roots and get an up-close view of the giant South American water lilies. Many species of exquisite butterflies and moths including the beautiful blue morpho, zebra longwing, and painted ladies fly among visitors. Microhabitats will be displayed along the Conservation Promenade featuring many endangered amphibians the Zoo is currently working with in response to the global amphibian crisis. Upon leaving this area, visitors will find a mirrored room to carefully check for hitch-hiking butterflies before exiting.\nChrysalis Hatching Room: A 220-square-foot (20 m2) area where butterflies and moths in their chrysalis or cocoon stage will be brought in from all over the world. Once inside, they will be carefully hung in hatching chambers where visitors can watch them complete their metamorphosis into flying insects. The 510-square-foot (47 m2) entry hallway leading into the insect wing will contain several displays, such as a locust colony and bee hive, along with interactive learning opportunities.\nInsect Zoo: This 2,413-square-foot (224.2 m2) area will have a 5-foot (1.5 m) high glass sidewall on top of a 7-foot (2.1 m) solid wall to allow more intensive exhibit work. Individual micro-habitats will be home to ants, spiders, scorpions, walking sticks, mantids, centipedes, roaches, beetles and other creatures. In the center of this experience, two bird cages will house other exotic species such as tropical hummingbirds.\nLower Level: Features two rooms, approximately 1,085-square-foot (100.8 m2) total, to be used for rearing butterflies and culturing insect colonies. A 542-square-foot (50.4 m2) room will be used to maintain plants that are being rotated through the butterfly display. A frog breeding and rearing facility occupying 1,161-square-foot (107.9 m2) of space, will house the most threatened amphibians. The rooms will be viewed through windows from the Giraffe Observation Walk that circles the building and will allow Zoo visitors a real look at what goes on behind the scenes. This same path will have numerous native butterfly gardens and offer visitors the opportunity to be eye to eye and nose to nose with the giraffe herd. -->\n\n\n=== Desert Dome ===\n\nThe Desert Dome opened in April 2002 at a cost of $31.5 million (includes Kingdoms of the Night). It is one of the world's largest indoor deserts at around 42,000 ft2 (0.96 acres; 3,900 m2).\nBeneath the Desert Dome is the Kingdoms of the Night, and both levels make up a combined total of 84,000 sq ft (1.9 acres; 7,800 m2). The Desert Dome has geologic features from deserts around the world: Namib Desert of southern Africa, Red Center of Australia, and the Sonoran Desert of the southwest United States.\nAnimals include:\n\nCentral bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps)\nCollared peccary (Tayassu tajacu)\nGreater roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus)\nDesert cottontail\nSwift fox (Vulpes velox)\nCape thick-knee (Burhinus capensus)\nVenomous snakes\nWallaby\nMeerkat\nCoatimundi\nHummingbirds\nOcelot\nBat-eared fox\nKlipspringerIn addition to being one of the world's largest indoor deserts, the Desert Dome's geodesic dome is also the world's largest 'glazed' geodesic dome. The dome is 137 ft (42 m) above the main level and 230 ft (70 m) in diameter. The 1,760 acrylic windows with four shades (some clear) were placed to allow maximum shade in the summer and maximum light in the winter to reduce energy costs.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Expedition Madagascar ===\nExpedition Madagascar opened May 7, 2010, and has many animals including lemurs, straw-coloured fruit bats, and giant jumping rats. The building of Madagascar gives the visitors a chance to learn more about an area of the world considered one of the top hotspots for biodiversity because it is home to the largest number of endemic, native only to this country, plant and animal species. Throughout the building, each exhibit is linked to ongoing projects in Madagascar.  \n\nRing-tailed lemur\nRed ruffed lemur\nBlack-and-white ruffed lemur\nBlack lemur\nMongoose lemur\nAye-aye\nCollared lemur\nBrown lemur\nFossa\n\n\n=== Garden of the Senses ===\n\nThe Garden of the Senses opened in spring 1998 at a cost of $1.8 million.\nThe garden is filled with plants, fountains, birds, a giant sundial, and more.\nOver 250 different species of herbs, perennials, and trees, as well as roses and other flowers, butterfly-friendly plants, and trellises. The birds include macaws, South American parrots, and Australian cockatoos.\n\n\n=== Hubbard Gorilla Valley ===\nThe Hubbard Gorilla Valley is a gorilla exhibit named after Dr. Theodore Hubbard (a cardiologist from Omaha). It opened on April 8, 2004, at a cost of $14 million. Prior to being expanded and rebuilt, the Hubbard Gorilla Valley was the Owen Gorilla House.\nSome of the animals included are:\n\nMantled guereza (Colobus guereza)\nWestern lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla)\nWolf's mona monkey (Cercopithecus wolfi)\nDiana monkey (Cercopithecus diana)\nAbyssinian ground hornbill (Bucorvus abyssinicus)\nYellow-backed duiker (Cephalophus silvicultor)\nBlack crowned crane (Balearica pavonina)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Hubbard Orangutan Forest ===\nThe Hubbard Orangutan Forest opened in two phases during 2005; the first phase was opened in May, and the second phase opened in late summer at a cost of $8.5 million. The first phase is the outdoor habitat that includes two 65-foot (20 m)-tall, 100-short-ton (91-metric-ton) Banyan trees interconnected with vines enclosed by a stainless steel netting.\nA 20-foot (6.1 m) waterfall is named after Claire Hubbard, the Orangutan Forest's primary donor. The second phase, the indoor habitat has 3,126 ft2 (0.07 acres; 290 m2). The majority of animals are primates which include the following:\n\nBornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus)\nSiamang (Symphalangus syndactylus)\n\n\n=== Kingdom of the Seas Aquarium ===\n\nThe Walter and Suzanne Scott Kingdoms of the Seas Aquarium, a public aquarium, opened on April 1, 1995, at a cost of $16 million. The building has 71,000 sq ft (6,600 m2) and contains a total of 1,200,000 US gal (4,500,000 l; 1,000,000 imp gal) of water. The exhibit was first renovated in 2011, and opened again on April 5, 2012. As of 2020, the exhibit's bathroom and concession stand are currently undergoing renovations.\nIt features displays of aquatic habitats from polar regions, temperate oceans, the flooded Amazon rainforest, and coral reefs. The 450,000 US gal (1,700,000 l; 370,000 imp gal) shark tank features a 70 ft (21 m) shark tunnel at the bottom of the 17 ft (5.2 m)-deep tank.\nThis tank features sharks, stingrays, sea turtles, and coral reef fish. Other tanks include a jellyfish, and open-ocean schooling fish. A new addition is a portable touch tank which allows visitors to feel a shark's scales and the rubbery skin of a stingray. The only freshwater display is of the Amazon rainforest that includes fish, invertebrates, turtles, and mammals (including common squirrel monkeys).\nThe aquarium features aquatic animals from around the world, including:\n\nTufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata)\nLittle penguin (Eudyptula minor)\nKing penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus)\nGentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)\nPufferfish\nMoray eel\nCoral reef\nSharks\nStingray\nSea turtle\nJellyfish\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Kingdoms of the Night ===\n\nThe Eugene T. Mahoney Kingdoms of the Night opened beneath the Desert Dome in April 2003 at a cost of $31.5 million (includes Desert Dome). Kingdoms of the Night is the world's largest nocturnal animal exhibit  at 42,000 ft2 (0.96 acres; 3,900 m2). Both the Kingdoms of the Night and the Desert combine to a total of 84,000 sq ft (1.9 acres; 7,800 m2). The Kingdoms of the Night features a wet cave (with a 14 ft or 4.3 m deep aquarium), a canyon, an African diorama, a eucalyptus forest, a dry batcave, and a swamp. The swamp is also the world's largest indoor swamp.\nA Kingdoms of the night logo is a sign that has the owl eyes.\nSome of the animals found at the Kingdom of the Night include:\n\nFossa  (Cryptoprocta ferox)\nAardvark (Orycteropus afer)\nBats\nAmerican alligators, including a white individual (one of less than 15 in the world)\nGreater bushbaby\nBeaver\nBushy-tailed jird\nBlind cave fish\nPrehensile-tailed porcupine\nThree-banded armadillos\n\n\n=== Lied Jungle ===\n\nThe Lied Jungle opened on April 4, 1992, at a cost of $15 million.\nIt is one of the largest indoor rainforest exhibits in the world; it occupies an 80-foot (24 m) tall building that spans 1.5 acres (0.61 ha) and is located just inside the main entrance. This exhibit allows visitors to look out from behind a 50-foot (15 m)-tall waterfall.\nInside are 123,000 ft2 (2.82 acres; 11,400 m2) of floor space, of which 61,000 ft2 (1.4 acres; 5,670 m2) are planted exhibit space; 35,000 ft2 (0.8 acres; 3,250 m2) are a display management area; and 11,000 ft2 (0.25 acres; 1,020 m2) are an education area.Visitors can walk along a trail on the floor of the jungle, as well as on a walkway around and above the animals. Both levels are split into sections by continent, including Asia, Africa, and South America. Along both trails, about 90 species can be found, including:\n\nBlue monkey (Cercopithecus mitis)\nCommon squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus)\nBlack howler monkey (Alouatta caraya)\nPygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis)\nScarlet macaw (Ara macao)\nBaird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii)\nIndian crested porcupine\nGibbon\nOtter\nCichlid\nPhilippine crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis)Ring-tailed lemurs, red ruffed lemurs, and black-and-white ruffed lemurs used to be on display in the Lied Jungle, but were moved to the Expedition Madagascar exhibit upon its opening in 2010.\n\n\n==== Notable points ====\nVisitors to the jungle can view the indoor jungle through 90 ft (27 m) of floor-to-ceiling windows at the Durham's TreeTops Restaurant, which is next to the jungle. A portion of the electrical power needed for the jungle is provided by natural gas fuel cells. The jungle has won several awards, including \"Single best zoo exhibit in the country\" in 1994 by the Family Life Magazine; \"Significant Achievement Award for Exhibit Design\" in 1993 by the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums; \"Top ten designs in the world\" in 1992 by Time, and \"Top eight US engineering accomplishments\" in 1992 by the National Society of Professional Engineers\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Owen Sea Lion Shores ===\nThe Owen Sea Lion Shores opened on September 4, 2020, costing $27.5 million. The one-acre exhibit replaced the Durham Family Bear Canyon, and the smaller Owen Sea Lion Pavilion. It features a 275,000-gallon saltwater pool with natural wave chambers, shallow beaches for young pups learning to swim, fish feeders that release fish and calamari at random times and places in the exhibit encouraging hunting behavior, a shaded seating area with a capacity of up to 170, and an underwater viewing cavern.\n\n\n=== Simmons Aviary ===\nThe Simmons Aviary opened in 1983, and is the world's third-largest free-flight aviary. It is home to about 500 birds from around the world. In this 4-acre (16,000 m2) exhibit, visitors see flamingos, ducks, swans, storks, cranes, spoonbills, ibis and egrets.\nThe Aviary is 800 feet (240 m) long and rises to 75 feet (23 m) at the center.\nThe structure is covered with 142,000 sq ft (13,200 m2) of two-inch nylon mesh that is supported by a system of cables and poles. The use of nylon instead of wire is a unique concept. In 2020, the Aviary closed for renovations.\n\n\n=== The Wild Kingdom Pavilion ===\nSituated inside the zoo's main entrance, the 21,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom Pavilion was completed in the spring of 1987. The building currently houses reptiles, insects, amphibians, and small mammals, while also providing business offices, a 312-seat multimedia auditorium, and classrooms.\nThe Wild Kingdom Pavilion has been transformed into the Exploration Station exhibit, serving as a safari-themed \u201cTrail Head\u201d where visitors begin their \u201cwild\u201d adventure at Omaha's zoo. Mutual of Omaha's Exploration Station includes a detailed interactive map of the zoo and video previews of major attractions, as well as information on the History of the Zoo. The center of the Pavillion features a 20-foot (6 m)-high netted tree, with free-flying birds. Below the tree includes water displays with turtles, archer fish, and more. The building's original public area, or living classroom, contains what is known as the Small Animal Collection. This area houses part of the zoo's reptile collection, as well as a large number of invertebrates. The animal collection represents the tremendous diversity in the animal kingdom, and includes tarantulas, turtles, snakes, hedgehogs, and other small animals.\n\n\n=== Other exhibits ===\n\nThe zoo also features Lozier IMAX theater and the new Budgie Encounter.\n\n\n== Retired Exhibits ==\n\n\n=== Cat Complex ===\n\nThe Cat Complex opened in 1977 at a cost of $2.5 million. The complex had 11 indoor enclosures and 10 outdoor enclosures with a claimed capacity of up to 100 cats.\nThe building was the largest cat-breeding and management facility in North America.\nThe Cat Complex was awarded the \"Edward H. Bean Award\" (1994) for tiger husbandry by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\nOmaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is known worldwide for its work in the field of artificial insemination of large cats. The exhibit was closed permanently and demolished in 2019 as the cats located in the Cat Complex were relocated to new exhibits in the African Grasslands and Asian Highlands, or at other zoos and sanctuaries.\nThe complex contained nine species from the family Felidae:\n\nAmur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis)\nCougar (Puma concolor)\nFishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus)\nJaguar (Panthera onca)\nSnow leopard (Panthera uncia)\nAfrican lion (Panthera leo)\nBengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris)\nIndochinese tiger (P. t. corbetti)\nSiberian tiger (P. t. altaica)The zoo's 15-year master plan, composed in 2010, called for the elimination of the Cat Complex along with the overhauling of several other exhibits. Going forward, animals at the zoo will be grouped not by their genetic relatives, but by regions of the world.\n\n\n=== Durham Family Bear Canyon ===\n\nThe Durham Family Bear Canyon opened in 1989 at a cost of $1.4 million. The canyon had a large 30,000-U.S.-gallon (25,000 imp gal; 110,000 L) tank for polar bears. Having previously housed four bear species - the Polar bear, the American black bear, the Sun bear and the Spectacled bear, it was closed and demolished in 2018 to make room for Owen Coastal Shores.\n\n\n=== Red Barn Park ===\nThe Red Barn Park was a petting zoo that opened in 1966. It included numerous domesticated animals including goats and cattle and was particularly noteworthy because of the large red barn that could be found in the area. It was demolished in 2018 and replaced with the Glacier Bay Landing area which opened in the spring of 2019. Many of the animals found in the exhibit were transferred to the Children's Adventure Trails.\n\n\n== Research ==\nThe Bill and Berniece Grewcock Center for Conservation and Research is a world-class research center at the zoo. The center has discovered several new species. The world's first in vitro-fertilized (\"test-tube\") gorilla resides at the zoo. The world's first artificially inseminated tiger was born in Omaha in 1991, followed by the world's first artificially inseminated gaur. The original 16,448-square-foot (1,528.1 m2) facility was constructed in 1996.\nIn 2006, it underwent a $6 million expansion which brings the total space to 32,000 sq ft (3,000 m2).The research center focuses on six areas:\n\nEducation and technology transfer\nConservation medicine\nMolecular genetics\nReproductive physiology\nHorticulture\nNutrition\n\n\n=== Mouse lemurs ===\nA study led by Edward Louis, a conservation geneticist at the zoo, identified three new mouse lemurs (Simmons' mouse lemur, Mittermeier's mouse lemur, and Jolly's mouse lemur) with the first named after Lee Simmons, the zoo's director.\n\n\n== Rides and transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railroad ===\n\nThe Omaha Zoo Railroad is a 2.5-mile (4.0 km), 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) narrow gauge train that loops through the zoo.\nThe railroad began operations on July 22, 1968, after the track was laid down by the Union Pacific railroad. The train operates with one of two oil-powered steam locomotives. Riva is about twice as powerful (although is almost 80 years older) as the #119 and is regularly used on weekends when more visitors are present. The #119 is the original locomotive for the zoo. A new diesel locomotive arrived in September 2008. This diesel is a 2-axle Plymouth locomotive and is used for switching operations of the passenger cars and other railroad-related projects.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe tram is a trackless tram that drives on the walkway paths around the zoo.\nIt has four stops:\n\nBy the Desert Dome (top of the hill)\nBetween the elephant/zebra yard and pygmy goat kraal\nBy the playground near the sea lions\nBetween the carousel and Alaskan Adventure splashpad\n\n\n=== Skyfari ===\nOmaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium opened the Skyfari in 2009. It is an aerial tram that runs from one stop at the Butterfly and Insect Pavilion to the lion platform. It goes over the African veldt (ostriches and giraffes), cheetahs, the railroad tracks, the Garden of the Senses, the koi lagoon, and the lions.\n\n\n=== Carousel ===\nA carousel is available on which visitors can ride handcrafted recreations of wild animals.\n\n\n== Educational programs ==\nThe zoo offers many educational programs. The activities include school-involved programs, special \"edzoocational\" programs, zoo internships, animal-adoption, and volunteer work. Several programs include field trips, guided tours, educator workshops, Little Lion's Preschool, and two-way internet video conferencing to bring the zoo to the classroom. The edzoocational programs are educational programs that are taught in a nontraditional way. These programs include overnight camp-outs at the zoo, scouting programs, summer camps, birthday parties, and on-site speakers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nThe Essential Henry Doorly Zoo Guide and iPhone App\nGorilla breaks window",

        "wiki": "A footbridge (also a pedestrian bridge, pedestrian overpass, or pedestrian overcrossing) is a bridge designed solely for pedestrians. While the primary meaning for a bridge is a structure which links \"two points at a height above the ground\", a footbridge can also be a lower structure, such as a boardwalk, that enables pedestrians to cross wet, fragile, or marshy land. Bridges range from stepping stones\u2013possibly the earliest man-made structure to \"bridge\" water\u2013to elaborate steel structures. Another early bridge would have been simply a fallen tree. In some cases a footbridge can be both functional and artistic. \nFor rural communities in the developing world, a footbridge may be a community's only access to medical clinics, schools, businesses and markets. Simple suspension bridge designs have been developed to be sustainable and easily constructed in such areas using only local materials and labor.\nAn enclosed footbridge between two buildings is sometimes known as a skyway. Bridges providing for both pedestrians and cyclists are often referred to as greenbridges and form an important part of a sustainable transport system.\nFootbridges are often situated to allow pedestrians to cross water or railways in areas where there are no nearby roads. They are also located across roads to let pedestrians cross safely without slowing traffic. The latter is a type of pedestrian separation structure, examples of which are particularly found near schools.\n\n\n== Early history ==\n\nThe simplest type of a bridge is stepping stones, so this may have been one of the earliest types of footbridge. Neolithic people also built a form of a boardwalk across marshes, of which the Sweet Track, and the Post Track are examples from England, that are around 6000 years old. Undoubtedly ancient peoples would also have used log bridges; that is a timber bridge that fall naturally or are intentionally felled or placed across streams. Some of the first man-made bridges with significant span were probably intentionally felled trees.Among the oldest timber bridges is the Holzbr\u00fccke Rapperswil-Hurden crossing upper Lake Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland; the prehistoric timber piles discovered to the west of the Seedamm date back to 1523 B.C. The first wooden footbridge led across Lake Z\u00fcrich, followed by several reconstructions at least until the late 2nd century AD, when the Roman Empire built a 6-metre-wide (20 ft) wooden bridge. Between 1358 and 1360, Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, built a 'new' wooden bridge across the lake that has been used to 1878 \u2013 measuring approximately 1,450 metres (4,760 ft) in length and 4 metres (13 ft) wide. On April 6, 2001, the reconstructed wooden footbridge was opened, being the longest wooden bridge in Switzerland. \nA clapper bridge is an ancient form of bridge found on the moors of Devon (Dartmoor and Exmoor) and in other upland areas of the United Kingdom including Snowdonia and Anglesey, Cumbria, Yorkshire and Lancashire. It is formed by large flat slabs of stone, often granite or schist, supported on stone piers (across rivers), or resting on the banks of streams. Although often credited with prehistoric origin, most were erected in medieval times, and some in later centuries. A famous example is found in the village of Postbridge. First recorded in the 14th century, the bridge is believed to have been originally built in the 13th century to enable pack horses to cross the river. Nowadays clapper bridges are only used as footbridges. \nThe Kapellbr\u00fccke is a 204-metre-long (669 ft) footbridge crossing the River Reuss in the city of Lucerne in Switzerland. It is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe, and one of Switzerland's main tourist attractions. The bridge was originally built c. 1365 as part of Lucerne's fortifications.\nAn early example of a skyway is the Vasari Corridor, an elevated, enclosed passageway in Florence, central Italy, which connects the Palazzo Vecchio with the Palazzo Pitti. Beginning on the south side of the Palazzo Vecchio, it then joins the Uffizi Gallery  and leaves on its south side, crossing the Lungarno dei Archibusieri and then following the north bank of the River Arno until it crosses the river at Ponte Vecchio. It was built in five months by order of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565, to the design of Giorgio Vasari.\nBank Bridge is a famous 25 metre long pedestrian bridge crossing the Griboedov Canal in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Like other bridges across the canal, the existing structure dates from 1826. The special popularity of the bridge was gained through angular sculptures of four winged lions crowning the abutments. They were designed by sculptor Pavel Sokolov (1764-1835), who also contributed lions for Bridge of Lions.\n\n\n== Design ==\nDesign of footbridges normally follows the same principles as for other bridges. However, because they are normally significantly lighter than vehicular bridges, they are more vulnerable to vibration and therefore dynamics effects are often given more attention in design. International attention has been drawn to this issue in recent years by problems on the Pont de Solf\u00e9rino in Paris and the Millennium Bridge in London.\nTo ensure footbridges are accessible to disabled and other mobility-impaired people, careful consideration is nowadays also given to provision of access lifts or ramps, as required by relevant legislation (e.g. Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in the UK). Some old bridges in Venice are now equipped with a stairlift so that residents with a disability can cross them.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\nTypes of footbridges include:\n\nBeam Bridge\nBoardwalk\nClapper bridge\nDuckboards, Timber trackway, Plank road, and Corduroy road\nMoon bridge\nSimple suspension bridge\nSimple truss\nStepping stones\nZig-zag bridgeThe residential-scale footbridges all span a short distance and can be used for a broad range of applications. Complicated engineering is not needed and the footbridges are built with readily available materials and basic tools.Different types of design footbridges include:\n\nTimber footbridges\nSteel footbridges\nConcrete footbridgeFootbridges can also be built in the same ways as road or rail bridges; particularly suspension bridges and beam bridges. Some former road bridges have had their traffic diverted to alternative crossings and have become pedestrian bridges; examples in the UK include The Iron Bridge at Ironbridge, Shropshire, the Old Bridge at Pontypridd and Windsor Bridge at Windsor, Berkshire.\nMost footbridges are equipped with guard rails to reduce the risk of pedestrians falling. Where they pass over busy roads or railways, they may also include a fence or other such barrier to prevent pedestrians from jumping, or throwing projectiles onto the traffic below.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nIt was originally usual for passengers to cross from one railway platform to another by stepping over the tracks, but from the mid-19th century onwards safety demanded the provision of a footbridge (or underpass) at busier places. However, in some quieter areas, crossing the line by walking over the tracks is possible.\n\n\n=== Catwalk ===\nNarrow footbridges or walkways to allow workers access to parts of a structure otherwise difficult to reach are referred as  catwalks or cat walks. Such catwalks are located above a stage (theater catwalk) in a theater, between parts of a building, along the side of a bridge, on the inside of a tunnel, on the outside of any large storage tank in a refinery or elsewhere, etc. The walkway on the outside (top) of a railroad cars such as boxcars, before air brakes came into use, or on top of some covered hopper cars is also called a catwalk. With the exception of those on top of railroad cars, catwalks are equipped with railings or handrails.\n\n\n== In developing countries ==\n\nSince the early 1980s, several charities have developed standardized footbridge designs that are sustainable for use in developing countries. The first charity to develop such designs was Helvetas, located in Zurich, Switzerland. Designs that can be sustainably and efficiently used in developing countries are typically made available to the public gratis.\n\n\n== Long footbridges ==\n\nThe record for the longest footbridge in the world was claimed by then New York State Governor David Paterson in an Oct. 3, 2009 Poughkeepsie Journal article about The Walkway Poughkeepsie Bridge across the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, New York.  On July 22, 2017, the Champlain Bridge Ice Structure (French: l'Estacade Champlain, a bridge built for bicycles and foot traffic only to parallel the Champlain Bridge from Brossard, Quebec west to Nun's Island (L'ile Des Soeurs) & the Island of Montreal, was measured by a calibrated device as being 7,512 feet (2,292 meters) long or 1.4227 miles or 2.292km, starting and ending where the treadway rises above the ground and a pedestrian could access the bridge as close as possible to the St Lawrence River.\nThe Walkway Over The Hudson footbridge was originally built for trains, it was recently restored as a pedestrian walkway.  The footbridge has a total length of 2,063 meters (6,768 feet).  Before it was demolished in 2011, the Hornibrook Bridge which crossed Bramble Bay in Queensland, Australia was longer than the Poughkeepsie Bridge at 2.8 km (1.7 mi).\n\n\n== Other footbridges ==\n\n\n== Advantages ==\nMuch rural travel takes place on local footpaths, tracks and village roads. These provide essential access to water, firewood, farm plots and the classified road network. Communities and/or local government are generally responsible for this infrastructure.\n\n\n== Disadvantages ==\nPedestrian overpasses over highways or railroads are expensive, especially when elevators or long ramps for wheelchair users are required. Without elevators or ramps, people with mobility handicaps will not be able to use the structure. People may prefer to walk across a busy road rather than climb a bridge. It is recommended that overpasses should only be used where the number of users justify the costs.Narrow, enclosed structures can result in perceptions of low personal security among users.

        "wiki": "The General George Crook House Museum is located in Fort Omaha. The Fort is located in the Miller Park neighborhood of North Omaha, Nebraska, United States. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969, and is a contributing property to the Fort Omaha Historic District.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1878, General George Crook moved headquarters for the Department of the Platte from downtown Omaha to Fort Omaha. The General Crook home was built in 1879 to be the residence of the Commander. Constructed in an Italianate design, the building consists of two stories with a grand garden surrounding it. Crowned by hipped roofs, the building is asymmetrical in plan and is in good condition. A long one-story porch projects from its eastern facade.\nGeneral George Crook was the only Commander to occupy the home, as the Department was disbanded after his tenure. In November, 1879, Crook and his wife entertained General and Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant at the home. In September 1880, President Rutherford B. Hayes stayed there while he was reviewing the troops at the Fort.After Crook left Fort Omaha, the house served as a home to each of the subsequent commanders of the Fort. In 1905, the house was used as an officer's club and mess hall. In 1930, it was converted back to a post commander's residence, serving until the Fort was closed in 1973.The Crook House is the oldest structure built as a private residence in Omaha.\nThe building was named a Nebraska State Historical Site in 1970.\n\n\n== Currently ==\n\nThe Douglas County Historical Society restored the house in the 1980s, refurbishing it with period furniture and restoring its heirloom Victorian gardens. Today, it is open to the public for tours and for special events.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Omaha\nLandmarks in Omaha, Nebraska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDouglas County Historical Society - official site",

        "wiki": "Omaha ( OH-m\u0259-hah) is the largest city in the state of Nebraska and the county seat of Douglas County. Omaha is in the Midwestern United States on the Missouri River, about 10 miles (15 km) north of the mouth of the Platte River. The nation's 40th-largest city, Omaha's 2019 estimated population was 478,192.\nOmaha is the anchor of the eight-county, bi-state Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area. The Omaha Metropolitan Area is the 59th largest in the United States, with an estimated population of 944,316 (2018). The Omaha-Council Bluffs-Fremont, NE-IA Combined Statistical Area (CSA) encompasses the Omaha-Council Bluffs MSA as well as the separate Fremont, NE Micropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of the entirety of Dodge County, Nebraska. The total population of the CSA was 970,023 based on 2017 estimates. Approximately 1.3 million people reside within the Greater Omaha area, within a 50 mi (80 km) radius of Downtown Omaha.\nOmaha's pioneer period began in 1854, when the city was founded by speculators from neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa. The city was founded along the Missouri River, and a crossing called Lone Tree Ferry earned the city its nickname, the \"Gateway to the West\". Omaha introduced this new West to the world in 1898, when it played host to the World's Fair, dubbed the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. During the 19th century, Omaha's central location in the United States spurred the city to become an important national transportation hub. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the transportation and jobbing sectors were important in the city, along with its railroads and breweries. In the 20th century, the Omaha Stockyards, once the world's largest, and its meatpacking plants gained international prominence.\nToday, Omaha is the home to the headquarters of four Fortune 500 companies: mega-conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway; one of the world's largest construction companies, Kiewit Corporation; insurance and financial firm Mutual of Omaha; and the United States' largest railroad operator, Union Pacific Corporation. Berkshire Hathaway is headed by local investor Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world, according to a decade's worth of Forbes rankings, some of which have ranked him as high as No. 1.Omaha is also the home to five Fortune 1000 headquarters: Green Plains Renewable Energy, TD Ameritrade, Valmont Industries, Werner Enterprises, and West Corporation. Also headquartered in Omaha are the following: First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately held bank in the United States; three of the nation's ten largest architecture/engineering firms (DLR Group, HDR, Inc., and Leo A Daly; and the Gallup Organization, of Gallup Poll fame, and its riverfront Gallup University.\nNotable modern Omaha inventions include the following: the \"pink hair curler\" created at Omaha's Tip Top Products; Butter Brickle Ice Cream, and the Reuben sandwich, conceived by a chef at the then\u2013Blackstone Hotel on 36th and Farnam Streets; cake mix, developed by Duncan Hines, then a division of Omaha's Nebraska Consolidated Mills, the forerunner to today's ConAgra Foods; center-pivot irrigation by the Omaha company now known as Valmont Corporation; Raisin Bran, developed by Omaha's Skinner Macaroni Co.; the first ski lift in the U.S., in 1936, by Omaha's Union Pacific Corp.; the Top 40 radio format, pioneered by Todd Storz, scion of Omaha's Storz Brewing Co. and head of Storz Broadcasting, and first used in the U.S. at Omaha's KOWH Radio; and the TV dinner, developed by Omaha's Carl A. Swanson.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nVarious Native American tribes had lived in the land that became Omaha, including since the 17th century, the Omaha and Ponca, Dhegian-Siouan-language people who had originated in the lower Ohio River valley and migrated west by the early 17th century; Pawnee, Otoe, Missouri, and Ioway. The word Omaha (actually Umo\u207fho\u207f or Uma\u207fha\u207f) means \"Dwellers on the bluff\".In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, including Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at a point about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabann\u00e9's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the monopoly of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park in the area in 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development.Through 26 separate treaties with the United States federal government, Native American tribes in Nebraska gradually ceded the lands that now make up the state. The treaty and cession involving the Omaha area occurred in 1854 when the Omaha Tribe ceded most of east-central Nebraska. Logan Fontenelle, an interpreter for the Omaha and signatory to the 1854 treaty, played an essential role in those proceedings.\n\n\n=== Pioneer Omaha ===\n\nBefore it was legal to claim land in Indian Country, William D. Brown operated the Lone Tree Ferry that brought settlers from Council Bluffs, Iowa to the area that became Omaha. Brown is generally credited as having the first vision for a city where Omaha now sits. The passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in 1854 was presaged by the staking out of claims around the area to become Omaha by residents from neighboring Council Bluffs. On July 4, 1854, the city was informally established at a picnic on Capital Hill, current site of Omaha Central High School. Soon after, the Omaha Claim Club was formed to provide vigilante justice for claim jumpers and others who infringed on the land of many of the city's founding fathers. Some of this land, which now wraps around Downtown Omaha, was later used to entice Nebraska Territorial legislators to an area called Scriptown. The Territorial capitol was in Omaha, but when Nebraska became a state in 1867, the capital was relocated to Lincoln, 53 miles (85 km) south-west of Omaha. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled against numerous landowners whose violent actions were condemned in Baker v. Morton.Many of Omaha's founding figures stayed at the Douglas House or the Cozzens House Hotel. Dodge Street was important early in the city's early commercial history; North 24th Street and South 24th Street also developed independently as business districts. Early pioneers were buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery and Cedar Hill Cemetery. Cedar Hill closed in the 1860s and its graves were moved to Prospect Hill, where pioneers were later joined by soldiers from Fort Omaha, African Americans and early European immigrants. There are several other historical cemeteries in Omaha, historical Jewish synagogues and historical Christian churches dating from the pioneer era, as well. Two sculpture parks, Pioneer Courage and Spirit of Nebraska's Wilderness and The Transcontinental Railroad, celebrate the city's pioneering history.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe economy of Omaha boomed and busted through its early years. In 1858, the Omaha Daily Republican was founded by the Omaha Printing Company (rebranded Aradius Group, 2016), it was Nebraska's first regional newspaper\u2013founded before Nebraska claimed statehood. Omaha was a stopping point for settlers and prospectors heading west, either overland or by the Missouri River. The steamboat Bertrand sank north of Omaha on its way to the goldfields in 1865. Its massive collection of artifacts is on display at the nearby Desoto National Wildlife Refuge. The jobbing and wholesaling district brought new jobs, followed by the railroads and the stockyards. Groundbreaking for the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1863, provided an essential developmental boom for the city. In 1862, the U.S. Congress allowed the Union Pacific Railroad to begin building westward railways; in January 1866 it commenced construction out of Omaha.The Union Stockyards, another important part of the city's development, were founded in South Omaha in 1883. Within 20 years, Omaha had four of the five major meatpacking companies in the United States. By the 1950s, half the city's workforce was employed in meatpacking and processing. Meatpacking, jobbing and railroads were responsible for most of the growth in the city from the late 19th century through the early decades of the 20th century.Immigrants soon created ethnic enclaves throughout the city, including Irish in Sheelytown in South Omaha; Germans in the Near North Side, joined by the European Jews and black migrants from the South; Little Italy and Little Bohemia in South Omaha. Beginning in the late 19th century, Omaha's upper class lived in posh enclaves throughout the city, including the south and north Gold Coast neighborhoods, Bemis Park, Kountze Place, Field Club and throughout Midtown Omaha. They traveled the city's sprawling park system on boulevards designed by renowned landscape architect Horace Cleveland. The Omaha Horse Railway first carried passengers throughout the city, as did the later Omaha Cable Tramway Company and several similar companies. In 1888, the Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company built the Douglas Street Bridge, the first pedestrian and wagon bridge between Omaha and Council Bluffs.Gambling, drinking and prostitution were widespread in the 19th century, first rampant in the city's Burnt District and later in the Sporting District. Controlled by Omaha's political boss Tom Dennison by 1890, criminal elements enjoyed support from Omaha's \"perpetual\" mayor, \"Cowboy Jim\" Dahlman, nicknamed for his eight terms as mayor.Calamities such as the Great Flood of 1881 did not slow down the city's violence. In 1882, the Camp Dump Strike pitted state militia against unionized strikers, drawing national attention to Omaha's labor troubles. The Governor of Nebraska had to call in U.S. Army troops from nearby Fort Omaha to protect strikebreakers for the Burlington Railroad, bringing along Gatling guns and a cannon for defense. When the event ended, one man was dead and several were wounded. In 1891, a mob hanged Joe Coe, an African-American porter after he was accused of raping a white girl. There were also several other riots and civil unrest events in Omaha during this period.\nIn 1898, Omaha's leaders, under the guidance of Gurdon Wattles, held the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, touted as a celebration of agricultural and industrial growth throughout the Midwest. The Indian Congress, which drew more than 500 American Indians from across the country, was held simultaneously. More than 2 million visitors attended these events at Kountze Park and the Omaha Driving Park in the Kountze Place neighborhood.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nWith dramatically increasing population in the 20th century, competition and fierce labor struggles led to major civil unrest. In 1900, Omaha was the center of a national uproar over the kidnapping of Edward Cudahy, Jr., the son of a local meatpacking magnate.The city's labor and management clashed in bitter strikes, racial tension escalated as Blacks were hired as strikebreakers, and ethnic strife broke out. A major riot by earlier immigrants in South Omaha destroyed the city's Greek Town in 1909, completely driving out the Greek population.The civil rights movement in Omaha has roots that extend back to 1912, when the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People west of the Mississippi River was founded in the city.The Omaha Easter Sunday Tornado of 1913 destroyed much of the city's African-American community, in addition to much of Midtown Omaha.Six years later, in 1919, the city was caught up in the Red Summer riots when thousands of whites marched from South Omaha to the courthouse to lynch a Black worker, Willy Brown, a suspect in an alleged rape of a white woman. The mob burned the Douglas County Courthouse to get the prisoner, causing more than $1 million damage. They hanged and shot Will Brown, then burned his body. Troops were called in from Fort Omaha to quell the riot, prevent more crowds gathering in South Omaha, and to protect the Black community in North Omaha.The culture of North Omaha thrived throughout the 1920s through 1950s, with several creative figures, including Tillie Olsen, Wallace Thurman, Lloyd Hunter, and Anna Mae Winburn emerging from the vibrant Near North Side.Musicians created their own world in Omaha, and also joined national bands and groups that toured and appeared in the city.\n\nAfter the tumultuous Great Depression of the 1930s, Omaha rebounded with the development of Offutt Air Force Base just south of the city. The Glenn L. Martin Company operated a factory there in the 1940s that produced 521 B-29 Superfortresses, including the Enola Gay and Bockscar used in the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.The construction of Interstates 80, 480 and 680, along with the North Omaha Freeway, spurred development. There was also controversy, particularly in North Omaha, where new routes bisected several neighborhoods. Creighton University hosted the DePorres Club, an early civil rights group whose use of sit-in strategies for integration of public facilities predated the national movement.Following the development of the Glenn L. Martin Company bomber manufacturing plant in Bellevue at the beginning of World War II, the relocation of the Strategic Air Command to the Omaha suburb in 1948 provided a major economic boost to the area.From the 1950s through the 1960s, more than 40 insurance companies were headquartered in Omaha, including Woodmen of the World and Mutual of Omaha. By the late 1960s, the city rivaled, but never surpassed, the United States insurance centers of Hartford, Connecticut, New York City and Boston.After surpassing Chicago in meat processing by the late 1950s, Omaha suffered the loss of 10,000 jobs as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. The city struggled for decades to shift its economy as workers suffered. Poverty became more entrenched among families who remained in North Omaha.\nIn the 1960s, three major race riots along North 24th Street destroyed the Near North Side's economic base, with recovery slow for decades. In 1969, Woodmen Tower was completed and became Omaha's tallest building and first major skyscraper at 478 feet (146 m), a sign of renewal.\n\nSince the 1970s, Omaha has continued expanding and growing, mostly to available land to the west. West Omaha has become home to the majority of the city's population. North and South Omaha's populations continue to be centers of new immigrants, with economic and racial diversity. In 1975 a major tornado, along with a major blizzard, caused more than $100 million in damages in 1975 dollars.Downtown Omaha has since been rejuvenated in numerous ways, starting with the development of Gene Leahy Mall and W. Dale Clark Library in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, Omaha's fruit warehouses were converted into a shopping area called the Old Market.\nThe demolition of Jobber's Canyon in 1989 led to the creation of the ConAgra Foods campus. Several nearby buildings, including the Nash Block, have been converted into condominiums. The stockyards were taken down; the only surviving building is the Livestock Exchange Building, which was converted to multi-use and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.A historic preservation movement in Omaha has led to a number of historic structures and districts being designated Omaha Landmarks or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of the push toward preservation came after Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the largest-ever National Register historic district in the United States, a record that still stands as of 2013. The Jobbers Canyon Historic District, along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city's historic district. The Jobber's Canyon warehouses had before then been allowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless population that had come to live in the abandoned buildings. At the time, there were no plans in place for revitalizing the buildings.In the 1980s and 1990s, Omaha also saw major company headquarters leave the city, including Enron, founded in the city in 1930 and taken to Houston in 1987 by the now-notorious Kenneth Lay. First Data Corporation, a large credit-card processor, also was founded in Omaha in 1969; as of 2009, its headquarters are in Atlanta.\nInacom, founded in Omaha in 1991, was a technology company that customized computer systems for large businesses, and was on the Fortune 500 list from 1997 until 2000, when it filed for bankruptcy. Northwestern Bell, the Bell System affiliate for Northwestern states, had its headquarters in Omaha from its founding in 1896 until it moved to Denver in 1991 as US West. Level 3 Communications, a large Tier 1 network provider, was founded in Omaha in 1985 as Kiewit Diversified Group, a division of Kiewit Corporation, a Fortune 500 construction and mining company still headquartered in Omaha; Level 3 moved to Denver in 1998. World Com was founded by a merger with Omaha's MFS Communications, started as Metropolitan Fiber Systems in 1993. MFS, backed by Kiewit Corporation CEO Walter Scott and Warren Buffett, purchased UUNET, one of the largest Internet backbones in the world, for $2 billion in 1996. The now-infamous Bernie Ebbers purchased the much larger MFS for $14.3 billion in 1997 under his World Com. He moved headquarters of the merged company from Omaha to Mississippi.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nAround the start of the 21st century, several new downtown skyscrapers and cultural institutions were built. One First National Center was completed in 2002, surpassing the Woodmen Tower as the tallest building in Omaha as well as in the state at 634 feet (193 m). The creation of the city's new North Downtown included the construction of the CenturyLink Center and the Slowdown/Film Streams development at North 14th and Webster Streets. Construction of the new TD Ameritrade Park began in 2009 and was completed in 2011, also in the North Downtown area, near the CenturyLink Center. TD Ameritrade Park is now the home of the College World Series, an event tourists flock to each year.\nNew construction has occurred throughout the city since the start of the 21st century. Important retail and office developments have occurred in West Omaha such as the Village Pointe shopping center and several business parks including First National Business Park and parks for Bank of the West and C&A Industries, Inc and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and several others. Downtown and Midtown Omaha have both seen the development of a significant number of condominiums in recent years. In Midtown Omaha significant mixed-use projects are underway. The site of the former Ak-Sar-Ben arena has been redeveloped into a mixed-use development Aksarben Village. In January 2009 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska announced plans to build a new 10 story, $98 million headquarters, in the Aksarben Village, completed in Spring 2011. Gordmans is also building their new corporate headquarters in Aksarben. The other major mixed-use development is Midtown Crossing at Turner Park. Developed by Mutual of Omaha, the development includes several condominium towers and retail businesses built around Omaha's Turner Park.The Holland Performing Arts Center opened in 2005 near the Gene Leahy Mall and the Union Pacific Center opened in 2004.\n\nThere have also been several developments along the Missouri River waterfront in downtown. The Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge was opened to foot and bicycle traffic on September 28, 2008. Started in 2003, RiverFront Place Condos first phase was completed in 2006 and is fully occupied and the second phase was opened in 2011. The development along Omaha's riverfront is attributed with prompting the City of Council Bluffs to move their own riverfront development time line forward.In the summers of 2008, 2012 and 2016 the United States Olympic Team swimming trials were held in Omaha, at the Qwest/Century Link Center. The event was a highlight in the city's sports community, as well as a showcase for redevelopment in the downtown area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nOmaha is located at 41\u00b015\u2032N 96\u00b00\u2032W. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 130.58 square miles (338.20 km2), of which 127.09 square miles (329.16 km2) is land and 3.49 square miles (9.04 km2) is water. Situated in the Midwestern United States on the bank of the Missouri River in eastern Nebraska, much of Omaha is built in the Missouri River Valley. Other significant bodies of water in the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area include Lake Manawa, Papillion Creek, Carter Lake, Platte River and the Glenn Cunningham Lake. The city's land has been altered considerably with substantial land grading throughout Downtown Omaha and scattered across the city. East Omaha sits on a flood plain west of the Missouri River. The area is the location of Carter Lake, an oxbow lake. The lake was once the site of East Omaha Island and Florence Lake, which dried up in the 1920s.\nThe Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area consists of eight counties; five in Nebraska and three in Iowa. The metropolitan area now includes Harrison, Pottawattamie, and Mills Counties in Iowa and Washington, Douglas, Sarpy, Cass, and Saunders Counties in Nebraska. This area was formerly referred to only as the Omaha Metropolitan Statistical Area and consisted of only five counties: Pottawattamie in Iowa, and Washington, Douglas, Cass, and Sarpy in Nebraska. The Omaha-Council Bluffs combined statistical area comprises the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan statistical area and the Fremont Micropolitan statistical area; the CSA has a population of 858,720 (2005 Census Bureau estimate). Omaha ranks as the 42nd-largest city in the United States, and is the core city of its 60th-largest metropolitan area. There are no consolidated city-counties in the area; the City of Omaha studied the possibility extensively through 2003 and concluded, \"The City of Omaha and Douglas County should merge into a municipal county, work to commence immediately, and that functional consolidations begin immediately in as many departments as possible, including but not limited to parks, fleet management, facilities management, local planning, purchasing and personnel.\"Geographically, Omaha is considered as being in the \"Heartland\" of the United States. Important environmental impacts on the natural habitat in the area include the spread of invasive plant species, restoring prairies and bur oak savanna habitats, and managing the whitetail deer population.Omaha is home to several hospitals, mostly along Dodge St (US6). Being the county seat, it is also the location of the county courthouse.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nOmaha is generally divided into six geographic areas: Downtown, Midtown, North Omaha, South Omaha, West Omaha, and East Omaha. West Omaha includes the Miracle Hills, Boys Town, Regency, and Gateway areas. The city has a wide range of historical and new neighborhoods and suburbs that reflect its socioeconomic diversity. Early neighborhood development happened in ethnic enclaves, including Little Italy, Little Bohemia, Little Mexico and Greek Town. According to U.S. Census data, five European ethnic enclaves existed in Omaha in 1880, expanding to nine in 1900.Around the start of the 20th century. the City of Omaha annexed several surrounding communities, including Florence, Dundee and Benson. At the same time, the city annexed all of South Omaha, including the Dahlman and Burlington Road neighborhoods. From its first annexation in 1857 (of East Omaha) to its recent and controversial annexation of Elkhorn, Omaha has continually had an eye towards growth.Starting in the 1950s, development of highways and new housing led to the movement of the middle class to suburbs in West Omaha. Some of the movement was designated as white flight from racial unrest in the 1960s. Newer and poorer migrants lived in older housing close to downtown; those residents who were more established moved west into newer housing. Some suburbs are gated communities or have become edge cities. Recently, Omahans have made strides to revitalize the downtown and Midtown areas with the redevelopment of the Old Market, Turner Park, Gifford Park, and the designation of the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District.\n\n\n=== Landmark preservation ===\n\nOmaha is home to dozens of nationally, regionally and locally significant landmarks. The city has more than a dozen historic districts, including Fort Omaha Historic District, Gold Coast Historic District, Omaha Quartermaster Depot Historic District, Field Club Historic District, Bemis Park Historic District, and the South Omaha Main Street Historic District. Omaha is notorious for its 1989 demolition of 24 buildings in the Jobbers Canyon Historic District, which represents to date the largest loss of buildings on the National Register. The only original building surviving of that complex is the Nash Block.\nOmaha has almost one hundred individual properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Bank of Florence, Holy Family Church, the Christian Specht Building and the Joslyn Castle. There are also three properties designated as National Historic Landmarks.Locally designated landmarks, including residential, commercial, religious, educational, agricultural and socially significant locations across the city, honor Omaha's cultural legacy and important history. The City of Omaha Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission is the government body that works with the mayor of Omaha and the Omaha City Council to protect historic places. Important history organizations in the community include the Douglas County Historical Society.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nOmaha, due to its latitude of 41.26\u02da N and location far from moderating bodies of water or mountain ranges, displays a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa). July averages 76.7 \u00b0F (24.8 \u00b0C), with average relative humidity around 70% which then leads to relatively frequent thunderstorms. Temperatures reach 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) on 29 days and 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) on 1.7 days annually. The January daily average is 23.5 \u00b0F (\u22124.7 \u00b0C), with lows reaching 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) on 11 days annually. The lowest temperature recorded in the city was \u221232 \u00b0F (\u221236 \u00b0C) on January 5, 1884, and the highest 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on July 25, 1936. Average yearly precipitation is 30.6 inches (777 mm), falling mostly in the warmer months. Snow is the most common precipitation in winter, with average seasonal snowfall being 28.7 inches (73 cm).\nBased on 30-year averages obtained from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center for the months of December, January and February, Weather Channel ranked Omaha the 5th coldest major U.S. city as of 2014.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 408,958 people, 162,627 households, and 96,477 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,217.9 inhabitants per square mile (1,242.4/km2). There were 177,518 housing units at an average density of 1,396.8 per square mile (539.3/km2). The city's racial makeup was 73.1% White, 13.7% African American, 0.8% Native American, 2.4% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 6.9% from other races, and 3.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 13.1% of the population. Non-Hispanic Whites were 68.0% of the population.There were 162,627 households, of which 31.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.6% were married couples living together, 13.7% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.9% had a male householder with no wife present, and 40.7% were non-families. 32.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.3% had someone living alone who was at least 65 years old.

The city's gender makeup was 49.2% male and 50.8% female.\nThe median household income (in 2017 dollars) from 2013-2017 was $53,789.\n\n\n=== 2000 census ===\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 390,007 people, 156,738 households, and 94,983 families residing within city limits. The population density was 3,370.7 people per square mile (1,301.5/km2). There were 165,731 housing units at an average density of 1,432.4 per square mile (553.1/km2). The city's racial makeup was 78.4% White, 13.3% African American, 0.7% Native American, 1.7% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.9% from other races, and 1.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.5% of the population.The city's median household income was $40,006, and the median family income was $50,821. Males had a median income of $34,301 versus $26,652 for females. The city's per capita income was $21,756. About 11.3% of the population and 7.8% of families were below the poverty line, including 15.6% of those under the age of 18 and 7.4% of those 65 and older.\n\n\n=== People ===\n\nNative Americans were the first residents of the Omaha area. The city of Omaha was established by white settlers from neighboring Council Bluffs who arrived from the Northeast United States a few years earlier. While much of the early population was of Yankee stock, over the next 100 years numerous ethnic groups moved to the city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Omaha's population as 96.4% White and 3.6% Black. Irish immigrants in Omaha originally moved to an area in present-day North Omaha called \"Gophertown\", as they lived in dug-out sod houses. That population was followed by Polish immigrants in the Sheelytown neighborhood, and many immigrants were recruited for jobs in South Omaha's stockyards and meatpacking industry. The German community in Omaha was largely responsible for founding its once-thriving beer industry, including the Metz, Krug, Falstaff and the Storz breweries.\nSince its founding, ethnic groups in the city have clustered in enclaves in north, south and downtown Omaha. In its early days, the sometimes lawless nature of a new frontier city included crime, such as illicit gambling and riots.\nIn the early 20th century, Jewish immigrants set up many businesses along the North 24th Street commercial area. It suffered with the loss of industrial jobs in the 1960s and later, the shifting of population west of the city. The commercial area is now the center of the African-Americans community, concentrated in North Omaha. The African American community has maintained its social and religious base, while it is experiencing an economic revitalization.\nThe Little Italy neighborhood grew south of downtown, as many Italian immigrants came to the city to work in the Union Pacific shops. Scandinavians first came to Omaha as Mormon settlers in the Florence neighborhood. Czechs had a strong political and cultural voice in Omaha, and were involved in a variety of trades and businesses, including banks, wholesale houses, and funeral homes. The Notre Dame Academy and Convent and Czechoslovak Museum are legacies of their residence. Today the legacy of the city's early European immigrant populations is evident in many social and cultural institutions in Downtown and South Omaha.\nMexicans originally immigrated to Omaha to work in the rail yards. Today they account for most of South Omaha's Hispanic population and many have taken jobs in meat processing. Other large early ethnic populations in Omaha included Danes, Poles, and Swedes.\nA growing number of African immigrants have made their homes in Omaha in the last twenty years. There are approximately 8,500 Sudanese living in Omaha, including the largest population of Sudanese refugees in the United States. Most have immigrated since 1995 because of warfare in Sudan. They represent ten ethnic groups, including the Nuer, Dinka, Equatorians, Maubans and Nubians. Most Sudanese people in Omaha speak the Nuer language. Other Africans have immigrated to Omaha as well, with one-third from Nigeria, and large populations from Kenya, Togo, Cameroon and Ghana.With the expansion of railroad and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many immigrants and migrants. As the major city in Nebraska, it has historically been more racially and ethnically diverse than the rest of the state. At times rapid population change, overcrowded housing and job competition have aroused racial and ethnic tensions. Around the start of the 20th century, violence towards new immigrants in Omaha often erupted out of suspicion and fear.In 1909, anti-Greek sentiment flared after increased Greek immigration, and worsened their tendency to become strikebreakers. The killing of a policeman of Irish descent enraged the Irish community; an angry mob violently stormed the Greek neighborhood in Omaha in what would become known as the Greek Town Riot. That mob violence forced the Greek immigrant population to flee from the city. By 1910, 53.7% of Omaha's residents and 64.2% of South Omaha's residents were foreign born or had at least one parent born outside of America.Six years after the Greek Town Riot, in 1915, a mob killed Juan Gonzalez, a Mexican immigrant, near Scribner, a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an Omaha Police Department officer investigated a criminal operation that sold goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. Racial profiling targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the Elkhorn River, where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. It was discovered Gonzalez was unarmed, and he had a reliable alibi for the time of the murder. No one was ever indicted for his killing.In the fall of 1919, following Red Summer, postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of African Americans as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching Willy Brown and the ensuing Omaha Race Riot. Trying to defend Brown, the city's mayor, Edward Parsons Smith, was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.Like other industrial cities in the U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in all, as the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area if they could get to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems.\nDespair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.\nWhites in Omaha have followed the white flight pattern, suburbanizing to West Omaha. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, gang violence and incidents between the Omaha Police and Black residents undermined relations between groups in North and South Omaha.\n\n\n==== Latinos in Omaha ====\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAccording to USA Today, Omaha ranks eighth among the nation's 50 largest cities in both per-capita billionaires and Fortune 500 companies.

In 1898 the city hosted more than 1 million visitors from across the United States at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, a world's fair that lasted for more than half the year.Research on leisure and hospitality situates Omaha in the same tier for tourists as the neighboring cities of Des Moines, Iowa; Topeka, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Denver, Colorado; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A recent study found investment of $1 million in cultural tourism generated approximately $83,000 in state and local taxes, and provided support for hundreds of jobs for the metropolitan area, which in turn led to additional tax revenue for government.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nSeveral national newspapers, including the Boston Globe and The New York Times  have lauded Omaha's historical and cultural attractions.\nThe city is home to the Omaha Community Playhouse, the largest community theater in the United States.

There are 152 parishes in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Omaha, and several Orthodox Christian congregations throughout the city.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nOmaha's rich history in rhythm and blues, and jazz gave rise to a number of influential bands, including Anna Mae Winburn's Cotton Club Boys and Lloyd Hunter's Seranaders. Rock and roll pioneer Wynonie Harris, jazz great Preston Love, drummer Buddy Miles, and Luigi Waites are among the city's homegrown talent. Doug Ingle from the late 1960s band Iron Butterfly was born in Omaha, as was indie folk singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, though both were raised elsewhere.\nToday, the diverse culture of Omaha includes a variety of performance venues, museums, and musical heritage, including the historically significant jazz scene in North Omaha and the modern and influential \"Omaha Sound\".Contemporary music groups either in or originally from Omaha include Mannheim Steamroller, Bright Eyes, The Faint, Cursive, Azure Ray, Tilly and the Wall and 311.

The mayor is Jean Stothert, who was elected in May 2013, and re-elected May 10, 2017. The longest-serving mayor in Omaha's history was \"Cowboy\" Jim Dahlman, who served 20 years over eight terms. He was regarded as the \"wettest mayor in America\" because of the flourishing number of bars in Omaha during his tenure. Dahlman was a close associate of political boss Tom Dennison. During Dahlman's tenure, the city switched from its original strong-mayor form of government to a city commission government. In 1956, the city switched back.The city clerk is Elizabeth Butler. The City of Omaha administers twelve departments, including finance, police, human rights, libraries and planning.

Omaha is one of only three cities in Nebraska to use this option, out of 17 eligible. The City of Omaha is considering consolidating with Douglas County government.Although registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the 2nd congressional district, which includes Omaha, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama opened three campaign offices in the city with 15 staff members to cover the state in fall 2008. Mike Fahey, the former Democratic mayor of Omaha, said he would do whatever it took to deliver the district's electoral vote to Obama; and the Obama campaign considered the district \"in play\". Former Nebraska U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and former Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama, and in November 2008 Obama won the district's electoral vote. This was an exceptional win, because with Nebraska's split electoral vote system Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win an electoral vote in Nebraska since 1964.In 2011, Nebraska lawmakers moved Offutt Air Force Base and the town of Bellevue \u2014 an area with a large minority population \u2014 out of the Omaha-based 2nd District and shifted in the Republican-heavy Omaha suburbs in Sarpy County. The move is expected to dilute the city's urban Democratic vote.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nOmaha's rate of violent crimes per 100,000 residents has been lower than the average rates of three dozen United States cities of similar size. Unlike Omaha, those cities have experienced an increase in violent crime overall since 2003. Rates for property crime have decreased for both Omaha and its peer cities during the same time period. In 2006, Omaha was ranked for homicides as 46th out of the 72 cities in the United States of more than 250,000 in population.As a major industrial city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions that came with rapid growth and the arrival of large numbers of immigrants and migrants. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.Gambling in Omaha has been an important part of the city's history. From its founding in the 1850s through the 1930s, the city was known as a \"wide-open\" town where gambling of all sorts was openly accepted. By the 1950s, at the same time large-scale restructuring of the railroads, the meatpacking industry and other sectors caused widespread job losses and unemployment, Omaha reportedly had more illicit gambling than any other city in the nation. From the 1930s through the 1970s, an Italian criminal element controlled gambling in the city.Today, gambling in Omaha is limited to keno, lotteries, and parimutuel betting. This leaves Omahans to drive across the Missouri River to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where casinos are legal and many businesses operate. Recently, the National Indian Gaming Commission approved a controversial proposal made by the Ponca tribe of Nebraska. It will allow the tribe to build a casino in Carter Lake, Iowa, which sits on the west side of the Missouri River, adjacent to Omaha, where casinos are illegal.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nOmaha has many public and private educational institutions, including Omaha Public Schools, the largest public school district in Nebraska, that serves more than 47,750 students in more than 75 schools.

By the middle of the 20th century, nearly every major railroad served Omaha.\nToday, the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District celebrates this connection, along with the listing of the Burlington Train Station and the Union Station on the National Register of Historic Places. First housed in the former Herndon House, the Union Pacific Railroad's corporate headquarters have been in Omaha since the company began. Their new headquarters, the Union Pacific Center, opened in Downtown Omaha in 2004.\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service through Omaha.

Metro Transit, previously known as Metro Area Transit, is the local bus system.\n\nOmaha's position as a transportation center was finalized with the 1872 opening of the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge that linked the transcontinental railroad to the railroads terminating in Council Bluffs. In 1888, the first road bridge, the Douglas Street Bridge, opened. In the 1890s, the Illinois Central drawbridge opened as the largest bridge of its type in the world. Omaha's Missouri River road bridges are now entering their second generation, including the Works Progress Administration-financed South Omaha Bridge, now called Veteran's Memorial Bridge, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

There were alot of younger people still doing Halloween celebrations and being that it was so cold I couldn't enjoy to the fullest. They really could stand to make changes to the parking, or should I say the lack of it...",
          "Nice venue to go to with friends or loved ones. Down stairs and a upstairs. Only reason for 4 and not 5 due to the fact drinks are 5.00 or more and a cover charge to enter. I understand the cover but for the price of drinks you would think \u2026",

        "wiki": "South Manitou Island is located in Lake Michigan, approximately 16 miles (26 km) west of Leland, Michigan.  It is part of Leelanau County and the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.  The uninhabited island is 8.277 sq mi (21.44 km2) in land area and can be accessed by a ferry service from Leland. Guided tours on open-air vehicles are available to visitors, but most traffic is on foot. Larger North Manitou Island lies to its north.\nThe island is 3 miles (4.8 km) wide and 3 miles (4.8 km) long.  It is part of an island chain that extends north to the Straits of Mackinac. The island consists of a ridge of tilted layers of limestone, buried under a blanket of glacial debris. Glaciers carved out the Lake Michigan basin. When the basin filled with water, the peaks of the ridge remained exposed as islands. During post-glacial times, winds blowing on the high, sandy bluffs on the west side of the island moved sand inland, forming sand dunes. Florence Lake is the island's only inland lake.  The island has a system of trails and campsites.\nA growth of Northern white cedars on the southwestern corner of the island are among the oldest and largest in the world.  The largest is 18 ft (5.5 m) around and is estimated to be over 500 years old.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSouth Manitou Island was originally settled in the mid-1830s by William Burton to provide cord wood to fuel the Great Lakes steamships. His dock was built in the middle of the crescent-shaped bay on the eastern side of the island, which offered the only natural deep-water harbor between Chicago and Buffalo. In 1847, the village included Burton's Wharf, a house, blacksmith shop, grocery store, barn, and a wooden tamarack railroad track extending from the dock inland to haul wood for the steamers. When the first post office opened in 1870, it was located here. When logging operations ended and the dock fell into disrepair, the original island village dwindled in size and importance. Burdick's moved their general store from its original location near the old dock to a site near the Lifesaving station in 1923 on the southeastern shore, and that marked the shift of the island community to the current village site located at the present dock where the passenger ferry arrives.Farming developed slowly on the island, but by 1870 most islanders were self-sufficient farmers. Surplus crops were sold to passing ships and mainland markets. The isolation of the island provided an ideal environment for growing prize-winning rye, beans and peas. Today, there are no active farms on the island, but farm buildings, abandoned machinery, the old school and cemetery are reminders of the past. The island is now uninhabited, and most of its buildings lie in ruins.\n\n\n== Lighthouse and Life-Saving Service Station ==\n\nSouth Manitou Island was popular in the 19th and 20th centuries as a harbor and fueling station.  With the completion of the Erie Canal in 1826, the development of commercial navigation on the Great Lakes increased rapidly. The Manitou Passage was the most important route for schooners and steamers traveling the 300 mile length of Lake Michigan. The island was a stop for early mariners between Chicago and the Straits of Mackinac.\nTo guide storm-driven ships, Congress appropriated $5,000 in 1838 for the construction of a lighthouse. Construction began in 1839, but very little is known about this first lighthouse on South Manitou Island. The specifications were the same as for the Old Presque Isle lighthouse, which included a 30-foot circular tower and a stone keeper's dwelling, but written accounts describe a 1.5 story house with a light tower on one gable end. No sketches or photos exist to determine what was actually built. The location of the light was on a 30-foot sandy knoll near the shore close to the location of the present lighthouse, but the exact location is not known.\nIn 1858, the U.S. Lighthouse Establishment recognized the need for greater safety and replaced this house with a two-story brick residence with a 35-foot tower on top. The tower housed a Fourth Order Fresnel lens. A fog signal building was added and both structures still stand today.\nThe increased shipping traffic brought changes and in 1871, a 100-foot tower was built. The tower is 18 feet in diameter at the base. The walls are hollow and 5 feet thick at the base tapering to 3 feet thick at the top. A passageway was added connecting the tower to the keeper's dwelling. A Third Order Fresnel lens from Paris was installed with a 3-wick lamp that had a range of 18 miles. In 1875, the first steam fog signal on Lake Michigan was installed replacing the fog bell. The 100 foot lighthouse was in operation from 1871 to 1958. The lighthouse is still in good condition. Recent efforts have restored its light tower to operational status for the summer months.\nIn 1901, the United States Life-Saving Service built a station on the island.  The USLSS became part of the United States Coast Guard in 1915. The station was permanently closed in 1958.  This station is now the island's ranger station and is not open to the public.\n\n\n== Shipwrecks ==\n\nThe Manitou islands are surrounded by over 50 known shipwreck sites, some of which are popular diving spots. A preserve was established in 1988 to conserve the historic and archeological value of the fifty known shipwreck sites, dating from 1835 to 1960. One such shipwreck is the Francisco Morazan, which grounded and became a total loss in 1960 off the south shore of the island. She ran over the wreck of the bulk freighter Walter L Frost, stranded November 4, 1903, with a cargo of corn and general merchandise.\nThe eastern side of the island is dominated by a large round bay. This bay is deep until very close to shore. On more than one occasion, ships found here a safe port in a storm, even some of the large bulk carriers. During the \"Big Blow\" of 1913, Captain John Stufflebeam nosed the bow of the passenger/packet steamer Illinois up onto the beach. He kept the engines going full for 49 hours so the wind would not blow the vessel back out to sea, until he was able to send two seamen ashore to fasten to a stout tree. When the storm abated 24 hours later, he untied from the tree, put his engines in reverse and backed away from shore to proceed safely on his journey.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSouth Manitou Island: Blocks 1180 and 1181, Census Tract 9704, Leelanau County, Michigan United States Census Bureau\nInventory of Maritime and Recreation Resources of the Manitou Passage Underwater Preserve, Kennth J.

        "wiki": "Standing Bear Lake, also known as Dam Site 16, is a park located at 6404 North 132nd street in West Omaha, Nebraska.\nThe park has a 135-acre (55 ha) lake with boating in the summertime, and ice skating in the winter. The park and recreation area covers about 396 acres (160 ha) of land surrounding the lake, with a 131-acre (53 ha) wildlife area is located on the west side of the park.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nStanding Bear Lake park opened in 1977, and includes fishing and boating, trails, and picnic areas.Also known as Dam Site 16, the lake was originally built as a dam for flood control on Papillion Creek in the Lower Papio Valley. Recently the Nebraska State Game and Parks Commission added trout fishing to the lake.The park is named after Chief Standing Bear, who with his people, was told to leave his homeland along the Niobrara River in northeast Nebraska for Indian Territory in Oklahoma. After finding no supplies in Oklahoma and many of his people dying, including his own son, Standing Bear led 30 members of the Ponca Tribe back to Nebraska. He had to fight for the right to be recognized as a human being and his basic humanity, saying, \"I am a man. The same God made us both.\" \n\n\n== Features ==\n\nOne of the earliest trails in the Omaha area is around Standing Bear Lake. The 6-foot-wide (1.8 m) trail slopes in places and is 3.5 miles (5.6 km) around but does not completely encircle the lake.A large variety of fish may be found in the lake, including walleye, catfish, bass, bluegill, crappie, drum, saugeye, yellow bass, and trout.The park includes a remote control airplane flying field.Ice skating is offered in the winter.\nOne unusual feature at Standing Bear is a wind organ. Created by artist Douglas Hollis, the sculpture is a combination of metal pipes placed vertically in the ground. Each pipe has a hole in its side for filtering the wind and making sound.Standing Bear sits in the middle of various housing developments. This makes it easy to get to, yet it still offers a secluded area to relax and get away from the city.\n\n\n== See also ==\nParks in Omaha, Nebraska\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The walking trails are pleasant. It\u2019s a good place to see local wildlife. I kind of wish there was a little more to do, but it\u2019s good for what it is.",
          "Fun place for a day adventure. Excellent walking trails all around. In the summer you can rent a canoe and enjoy the lake.",
          "Still one of my favorite running parks. They have a paved trail that totals about 3.5 miles if you go around the entire lake. However, the trail does not extend the entire way around and you will be forced to walk on a pretty busy street for a portion of it to totally circle",
          "Standing Bear has several different fun aspects- the lake, picnicing, hiking, boating, + an airfield for model airplanes!",
          "I live in north Omaha and drove by this lake all the time. Then I stopped and saw all the trails and fell in love with the place.",
          "My husband and I enjoy walking on the paths around Standing Bear Lake---fall, spring, and early summer.",
          "Standing Bear lake has a lot to offer and we enjoy going there. Nice boat ramp for launching and very nice paved trails to hike on. This is a all year place to go. I love to go ice fishing there in the winter time. We catch lots of Crappie and Blue gills along with large",
          "Standing Bear is my favorite place to SUP and kayak. As a fairly unskilled paddler, it is safer to be in a small lake. The surrounding trees, birds, and friendly folks make it an enjoyable experience. We did not find many picnic tables, especially near the parking lot where we",
          "We visited the lake on a holiday. The City didn't seem to know there would be visitors. The one port-a-potty in our area needed to be emptied, and it did not have a lock on the door. It was filthy. We had to drive about 2 miles to use a store's facilities. The lake has several",
          "More than a place to hike or fish...you can see some wildlife, watch the seasons change in the variety of flowers and trees. Plus, the metal sculpture of the buffalo, the wind pipes and the RC airplane activities are worth taking in! Nice place to just sit with a picnic lunch",
          "This is a great lake to walk around except that you can't walk around it! Beautiful nature the deers are very friendly. It's about 4 miles around but you have to walk on grass on 144th which is very busy. I rarely walk around because of the mud and the danger of traffic. Sad",
          "The first time we went, we were blown by the vastness of the lake, the quietude and generally clean environs. Compare that with Lake Manawa we had visited shortly before (with too much loud crowd from the lower economic strata and you'll get the drift). We even saw deer drinking",

          "First of all, the lake is manmade, so it's not a natural feature of Nebraska. Second of all, it's not very clean. It's a place for people who want to spend the day fishing, and also for teenagers to hang our because they haven't anywhere else to hang out. The lake is poorly",
          "the bike bath that goes around the lake is a perfect easy ride. flat for the most part, but the thing I really love about it is never busy like zorinsky. it's. a 4 mile loop. it looks like there are nice places to picnic. I just never had.",

          "I googled this place and decided to go here on a sunday..and this by far was the best decision that I made. It was splendid. Long trails. If you are looking for peace, calm and serene place to spend your weekend this is the right place. Away from the hustle bustle of the city,",
          "Wonderful park and lake in my area. We visit often for a walk and or bike ride. Only thing that would make it better is of the city would connect the trail on the west side of the lake. Until then, we walk half way around and turn around.",
          "My good friend and I like to walk on Saturday mornings, and Standing Bear is a great place. We like to park in a neighborhood on the southwest edge of the lake. There have been car break-ins in the past at parking lots on the lake, so getting away from that threat makes sense",

          "I've been to Standing Bear lake, and even though it's near a housing development, you'd think your out in the country! The lake area is huge, plus trees abound & there's plenty of picnic areas to choose from. Went fishing there, and there's one fish out in that lake that's",

Best time to usually come is right before sunset you can get some of the best views then.",

          "Beautiful location. Stunning clear water and a very serene walking path. Highly recommended for family gatherings and pet exercise. There were many fishermen pulling out many species of fish. Definitely a place to put in your visit list.",
          "I wish the city would quit chopping down a large chunk of the flowers and bushes along the trails. I go there for photography and like to take pictures of butterflies and bees and it's very saddening that the city feels the need to destroy those things for no reason. Trimming and maintaining is fine but destroying entire bushes is not.",

        "wiki": "For other species of cownose rays, see Rhinoptera.\n\nThe cownose ray (Rhinoptera bonasus) is a species of eagle ray found throughout a large part of the western Atlantic and Caribbean, from New England, United States to southern Brazil (East Atlantic populations are now generally considered a separate species, R. marginata). Cownose rays grow rapidly, and male rays often reach about 35 inches (89 cm) in width and weigh 26 pounds (12 kg). Females typically reach 28 inches (71 cm) in width and weigh 36 pounds (16 kg). These rays also belong to the order Myliobatiformes, a group that is shared by bat rays, manta rays, and eagle rays.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nRhinoptera bonasus, comes from the Greek derivation of the word parts.\n\"rhinos\"- nose\n\"pteron\"- wing\n\"bonasos\"- bison\n\n\n== Gestation and reproductive behavior ==\nCownose rays breed from June through October. A large school of cownose rays gather of varying ages and sexes in shallow waters. A female will swim with the edges of her pectoral fins sticking out of the water, with male cownose rays following her trying to grasp the fins to mate.The embryo grows within its mother with its wings folded over its body. Initially it is nourished by an egg yolk, although the uterine secretions of the mother nourish it later in its development. The length of gestation is disputed, but it is believed to last between 11 and 12 months and is variable. At full term, the offspring are born live, exiting tail first.\n\n\n== Lifespan ==\nSexual maturity for both males and females is reached around 4 to 5 years of age. In the Gulf of Mexico, females live up to 18 years, and males only live up to 16 years.\n\n\n== Size and appearance ==\nThe cownose ray is 11 to 18 inches (28 to 46 cm) in width at birth. A mature specimen can grow to 45 inches (1.1 m) in width, and weigh 50 pounds (23 kg) or more. There is some controversy over the size that a mature cownose ray can reach. A ray reaching a span of 84 inches (2.1 m) has been recorded. The cownose ray is often mistaken for being a shark by beach-goers. This is due to the tips of the rays fins sticking out of the water, often resembling the dorsal fin of a shark.A cownose ray is typically brown-backed with a whitish or yellowish belly. Although its coloration is not particularly distinctive, its shape is easily recognizable. It has a broad head with wide-set eyes, and a pair of distinctive lobes on its subrostral fin. It also has a set of dental plates designed for crushing clams and oyster shells. When threatened the cownose ray can use the barb at the base of its tail to defend itself from the threat.A cownose ray has a spine with a toxin, close to the ray's body. This spine has teeth lining its lateral edges, and is coated with a weak venom that causes symptoms similar to that of a bee sting.\n\n\n== Feeding habits ==\nThe cownose ray feeds upon clams, oysters, hard clams and other invertebrates. It uses two modified fins on its front side to produce suction, which allows it to draw food into its mouth, where it crushes its food with its dental plates. Cownose rays typically swim in groups, which allows them to use their synchronized wing flaps to stir up sediment and expose buried clams and oysters.The cownose ray prefers to feed either in the early morning hours, or in the late afternoon hours; when the waves are calm and visibility is higher than during the day. The cownose ray has a jaw that reflects its diet of: benthic bivalve mollusks, crustaceans, and polychaetes. Their jaws are extremely robust and have teeth with a hardness comparable to that of cement, allowing them to eat hard shells.  The feeding habits of cownose rays is cause for increasing concern, as they are known for destroying oyster beds that are already being destroyed largely by human pollution. The cownose rays destruction of large oyster beds only further puts oyster beds at risk.\n\n\n== Migration ==\n\nThe cownose ray often migrates from the Gulf of Mexico to Trinidad, Venezuela, and Brazil. The Atlantic migration pattern consists of the cownose rays moving north in late Spring and moving south in late Fall.Migration may be influenced by water temperature and sun orientation, which explains the seasonal migration pattern. Southern migration may be influenced by solar orientation and Northern migration may be influenced by the change in water temperature.It is unknown whether their migratory behavior is due to feeding or premigratory mating activity.The cownose ray is also present in areas such as Maryland and Virginia, and can be seen migrating and schooling, as it is not uncommon for them to swim near the surface, despite feeding mostly on the bottom. These schools can be seen and migration tracked via airplane as it is easy to see the schools from the sky. However, while the migration patterns can tracked, the exact reason for migration is currently unknown.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\nCownose rays appear naturally in the Eastern and Western Atlantic Ocean. Within the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, the cownose ray can often be found in Mauritania, Senegal, and Guinea. In the Western Atlantic Ocean, they are located from Southern New England to Northern Florida in the United States, as well as throughout the Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad, Venezuela, and Brazil.They live in brackish and marine habitats and can be found at depth up to 72 feet (22 m). They are social creatures and migrate extremely long distances, often traveling in schools.\n\n\n== Risk to humans ==\nStingrays, including the cownose ray, can pose a low to moderate risk to humans. Rays will lash their tails when threatened, posing a risk of being whipped. If threatened, the cownose ray can also use their barb as a weapon to sting the aggressor. A sting from a cownose ray can cause a very painful wound that requires medical attention once stung. While the sting is not usually fatal, it can be fatal if  stung in the abdomen. There is also a risk associated with eating meat from the sea animal that has not been prepared correctly. Shigella may be acquired from eating meat from a cownose ray that has been contaminated with the bacteria. This bacteria causes shigellosis, and can result in dysentery. Symptoms can include diarrhea, pain, fever, and possible dehydration.\n\n\n== Predators ==\nThe cownose ray sits fairly high up on the food chain, and as a result only has a few natural predators. These predators include; cobia, bull sharks, great hammerheads, and sandbar sharks, as well as humans.\n\n\n== Commercial fishing ==\nOne solution to the cownose rays' destruction of oyster beds, as well as their overpopulation in certain areas, is to open the ray up for commercial fishing. However, since the means to fish them are difficult and expensive to obtain, and the meat of the rays has very little demand, this solution would most likely prove to be too expensive and yield too little of a profit for it to be a viable venture for any commercial fishermen. It is, however, often caught by hobby fishermen.\n\n\n== Aquariums ==\nCownose rays can be seen in many public aquaria worldwide and are often featured in special 'touch tanks' where visitors can reach into a wide but shallow pool containing the fish, which have often had their barbs pinched or taken off (they eventually regrow, similar to human nails), making them safe enough to touch.\nThe following aquariums and zoos are known to have a touch tanks featuring cownose rays (alone or with other fish):\nUSA\n\nAdventure Aquarium in Camden, New Jersey\nAlbuquerque Aquarium in Albuquerque, New Mexico\nAudubon Aquarium in New Orleans, Louisiana\nArizona-Sonora Desert Museum in Tucson, Arizona\nAtlantic City Aquarium in Atlantic City, New Jersey\nAquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California\nButterfly House and Aquarium in Sioux Falls, South Dakota\nCalifornia Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, California\nChildren's Aquarium at Fair Park in Dallas, Texas\nClearwater Marine Aquarium in Clearwater, Florida\nDowntown Aquarium, Denver in Denver, Colorado\nGeorgia Aquarium in Atlanta, Georgia\nHenry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska\nKansas City Zoo in Kansas City, Missouri\nLiving Shores Aquarium in Glen, New Hampshire\nLong Island Aquarium and Exhibition Center in Riverhead, New York\nLowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida\nMarine Science Center in Ponce Inlet, Florida\nMaritime Aquarium in Norwalk, Connecticut\nMystic Aquarium in Mystic, Connecticut\nThe New England Aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts\nNew York Aquarium in Brooklyn, New York\nNewport Aquarium in Newport, Kentucky\nNorth Carolina Aquarium at Pine Knoll Shores in Emerald Isle, North Carolina\nOcean Adventures in Gulfport, Mississippi\nOklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\nPhoenix Zoo in Phoenix, Arizona\nRooster Cogburn Ostrich Ranch in Picacho, Arizona\nSaint Louis Zoo in St. Louis, Missouri\nSan Antonio Aquarium in San Antonio, Texas\nSeaWorld Orlando in Orlando, Florida\nShedd Aquarium in Chicago, Illinois\nTennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tennessee\nTexas State Aquarium in Corpus Christi, Texas\nToledo Zoo in Toledo, Ohio\nTropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida\nTurtle Back Zoo in West Orange, New Jersey\nWonders of Wildlife Museum & Aquarium in Springfield, Missouri\nViaAquarium in Rotterdam, New York\nVirginia Aquarium in Virginia Beach, VirginiaCanada\n\nAquarium of Quebec in Quebec City\nGranby Zoo in Granby\nRipley's Aquarium of Canada in Toronto, Ontario\nThe Vancouver Aquarium in Vancouver, British Columbia\nAssiniboine Park Zoo in Winnipeg, Manitoba\n\n\n=== In Pop Culture ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBarker, A.S.

          "Always enjoy this zoo, great to see updates to displays, hope there are more to come. Wish property was a little more spread out to relieve volumes or people in popular areas",
          "I ranked the Zoo based on the exhibits that were open. Because of Covid, some displays were closed but the ones that were open were excellent, as usual. I made an appointment (per rules during Covid) for early morning and spent the day there. I found extra care being taken to",
          "Lots to see and do! Great way to get out of the house and not think about covid! Lots to see. We spent 3 hours and didn't see everything!",
          "Regardless of the Covid closures we can't wait to go back when the famous dome is opened and the new stingray exhibit. Definitely looking forward to visiting again",
          "This was our first post-COVID visit to the Zoo and we were very happy to be back. The nocturnal animals exhibit was closed but nearly everything else was. Masks were required for ages 5 and up and there were hand sanitizing stations everywhere. We made reservations on-line",
          "Zoo did a good job distancing groups during Covid. This is a great zoo for children and adults. Lots of new areas to visit. I visited over 20 years ago. This zoo just gets better and better.",
          "The Henry Dooley Zoo is amazing, so much to see it takes up about half a day. The zoo is huge! Must check out the rainforest, aquarium, butterfly\u2019s pavilion and the swamp! Very clean and well kept. Will definitely be going again.",
          "We usually only go to the zoo with our kids but we are traveling without them and decided to check out the zoo anyway. We are so glad we did, it is a beautiful zoo, very well landscaped. The highlight though was seeing the gorillas. The gorilla exhibit is so well done you can",
          "Honestly, I am not a zoo person, but having been in Omaha I needed to stop at the zoo. I have heard great things. Partially due to covid19, the heat and the fact that I\u2019m not a zoo enthusiast, I was pretty much over it by the time I made it through Africa. Now! That being said,",
          "The staff was amazing! They were helpful and friendly. The zoo boasts a wide variety of animals and Skyfari. We chose the Skyfari to see more of the zoo because one needs two days or a full day to see it all.",
          "Wow! This zoo is huge!! We were there for 7 hours and walked 8.25 miles to see everything. They have an incredible array of animals and different activites to do. We were able to see a movie in their giant theater. Almost every exhibit was open even though we went during the",
          "I had this place on my list to visit for a while and it did not disappoint. While a few attractions were closed, like the butterfly exhibit, we still spent the whole day looking around and enjoying it. One of the coolest things they do is let you bring your own drinks and food",
          "Spectacular. Every impressive step of the way. Thank you, so much, for adhering to the highest of standards in providing close-to natural environments for the animals, and giving families an opportunity to spend time together, in an outdoor environment. Kudos to Henry Dooley",
          "Whole place has been in construction for several years now, the splash zone and aquarium are about the only thing open but you still have to pay 30 dollars to go in, place is well monitored and mask required.",
          "This is a huge zoo. Between Covid and it being an overcast day, not many animals were out. But we did enjoy the African elephants as they tore tree branches apart, the rhinos soon after they were let out, and the female lions that started playing and p9ouncing on each other.",
          "We came here instead of getting married like we were supposed to - I've been here several times, but I just love the zoo! This zoo has so many great and interesting enclosures and designs that I just love to see. They have such a wide range of animals as well as some of the",
          "We had other commitments, so we only had about three hours to spend at the zoo. Since this was our first time to the zoo, we were not familiar with the zoo layout. We should have printed the map of the zoo before visiting since they are not currently handing out maps (due to",
          "Great zoo, anytime of year. I love the fact that there are plenty of \"indoor\" exhibits....so that, during bad weather, freezing cold days, extreme heat, etc....we can still enjoy many aspects of the zoo. My favorite exhibits are the Gorillas and the Lied Jungle.",
          "I'm not much of a zoo person. My experience with zoos is mostly limited to Brookfield Zoo and Lincoln Park Zoo, both in Chicago. While the exhibits at this zoo seemed to be of higher caliber, what I appreciated was how the zoo was filled with trees. It is also surrounded by",
          "Our first visit to HD Zoo in Omaha during a short family trip. We spent 6 hours there. Lines not long, even with social distancing. We LOVED the gorilla, monkey, exhibits. Loved how the zoo was sectioned into areas/continents the animals came from (Africa/Asian/Australian,",
          "We spent the day here and covid19 restrictions were in place: closed water fountains, wearing masks indoors and restricting numbers in exhibits, no train or tram. It was quite hot outside but shade generally available. Or only complaint was that food service places are all",
          "THIS IS THE BEST ZOO IN THE ENTIRE WORLD! I've been here over 30 times and it never fails to amaze me. I've visited many of the \"famous\" zoos in the country (San Diego Zoo, Bronx Zoo, LA zoo) and none of them even come close in comparison to Henry Doorly Zoo. The LIED Jungle is",
          "We did visit during COVID-19 restrictions, so I was unsure with how much would be open. Although there were multiple exhibits closed, the zoo was amazing!! A very clean and beautiful zoo. The Skyfari is an absolutely MUST DO!! Amazing views of the animals, especially the lions",
          "We visited the zoo in June 2020. We purchased our tickets 2 days in advance. Due to required social distancing, many of the exhibits were not available to the public. The animals were out for us to see. It was a really hot day so they had misting stations available for the",
          "We visited during the Covid-19 restrictions. Basically only Africa and Asia was open but we saw some amazing exhibits. As the summer progreses in sure more will open up.",
          "We were in town for a wedding and didn't have much time but the layout of the zoo was nice for even a quick trip! The tree-house feel of the primate exhibit really makes you feel like you are in the jungle. The exhibits look natural and allow close viewing.",
          "Since the zoo was closed due to COVID-19, persons with zoo memberships were admitted to the Safari P.arl without paying admission. We took advantage of the offer and enjoyed our drive.",
          "We had a wonderful day at the zoo. There is so much to see and do it easily filled the day. Although there is some construction many of the animals were active. The new Asian Highlands is such a beautiful area. This is without a doubt a must visit in Omaha!!!",
          "It was the first nice spring weekend of the season and spring break for our youngest grandson. His first trip to this zoo and our first for at least 10 years. We were disappointed that none of the rides were operating and very few concessions were. Many of the water fountains",
          "Zoo was impressive. The aquarium was my favorite and could have stayed there for hours. Desert dome was fascinating. Lots of hills but it had great resting areas to watch he animals. Of from out of town this is a recommended stop!",
          "Henry Dorley is always rated in the top 3 or 4 zoo's in the world. I believe it will take 3 days to see it all.",
          "Me and my husband went for the day so much to see and do. Wear your walking shoes. Admission was a little steep. But worth it I think.overall i enjoyed it.",
          "After years of waiting, I finally visited the Henry Doorly Zoo for the first time last week. My overall experience was very positive, and the zoo is quite impressive for a city the size of Omaha. While I can't rate it quite as highly as the San Diego Zoo, Toronto Zoo, St. Louis",
          "It didn't hurt that the temperature was 55 degrees in the middle of February, but every place at the zoo that we were able to visit was just awesome! Indoors and out it was just plain fun. My only regret was that we didn't have the time to explore the entire site, but that",
          "This Zoo is well maintained and reflects investment in growth. I was told that the Zoo had recently been expanded and it was far larger than I remember when I visited in my youth. The animals are well maintained and have ample space to walk in their enclosures, this is not",
          "We have memberships and frequent the zoo often. We love this zoo so much and could go there everyday. You definitely will need to spend multiple days here if you want to see everything thoroughly. I\u2019ve read multiple times that this zoo is ranked 1 or 2 best zoo in the world",
          "Very few zoos in the U.S. can compare with this medium size zoo in Omaha. While I generally do not favor keeping animals imprisoned, if keeping them safe from extinction in an environment close to their natural habitat protects the species, it is a good thing. That describes",
          "Went on a 35 degree day! A number of indoor buildings, so it was ok ++ not crowded! The jungle is 2 floors so you see more & you walk in the tropics! Several statues to enjoy as well as flowers. A world class zoo.. go enjoy year round!!",
          "World class zoo has won many awards for layout, variety of animals, animal breeding program, display spaces, aquarium, desert dome...the list goes on & on. Many activities for all ages. Easy to walk. Very appealing to the eye. Our family loves this zoo!",
          "We have been to this zoo twice in the last six years. Once in the late spring and once in the winter. Recommend going in the late spring due to the weather and many animals are inside and cannot be seen in the outdoor enclosures. This is one of the best zoos in the country, so",
          "There are so many amazing exhibits and fin interactive things to participate in! The only thing I wasn't impressed with was teh Desert Dome, when it was first built I thought we were going to be able to be more interactive with the animals, it's ok once.",
          "I've been a member of the zoo for a little over a year now, and I can attest that it is a world-class establishment. Not only are there plenty of really exciting outdoor attractions (including the new Asian Highlands area), but there are enough unique indoor exhibits that a",
          "there is so much stuff to do at this place you should go see Belsky fall aka really my uncle and my dads brother",
          "Very well done and informative. Would recommend seeing it. Wear some comfortable shoes. Lots of parking. Thank you!",
          "Plan on spending a full day here. This is a beautiful zoo with lots to see. Make sure to visit the aquarium.",
          "Growing up in Chicagoland, I have access to two good zoos, but was blown away by this zoo, aquarium and more. The desert dome was a gem and we spent quite some time, especially viewing the nocturnal section. Worth a trip to Omaha!",
          "Lied Jungle and the desert dome are fun to walk through. The sights, smells and sounds of the swamp in the lower level of the desert dome are probably my favorite spot.",
          "We are trying to travel to each state and everywhere we go we visit the zoo, this one is by far the best! HUGE! You can pet and feed stingrays. The indoor desert is amazing, they have a nocturnal exhibit that is amazing. Don't miss this zoo!",
          "One of top two or three zoos in the country. World class everything. Interesting for the entire family. You are going to be walking a lot. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. If the weather is good pack a lunch, will save funds that you will spend in the gift shop. If you",
          "Went to three indoor attractions and all were high quality. The forest building was large, detailed and as close to the real deal as you could get.",
          "This zoo is always expanding and wanting to get better. A premier zoo in the WORLD !! Looking forward to the new exhibit this coming year 2020",
          "This is probably the best zoo I have been to. The zoo is organized and quite clean. They have an amazing (simulated) cave and its incredible. I definitely had a good time, however sad at the same time because they had some areas closed due to winter season and constructions",
          "Even when the weather outside isn't friendly, this is a great place to visit. Make sure to eat lunch by the windows in the Tree Top Cafe to see the monkeys play (cafe ala carte items that aren't inexpensive, but you can pick cheaper options also). The jungle is a great escape",
          "We went to the zoo in December and it was a not so pleasant day, however, we ended up spending 4 hours easily there! Considering it was December, a lot of the animals were indoors, but some were able to be seen/viewed. They are working on improving the aquarium, but it is",
          "One of the highest rated zoos in the world, and for good reason. Give yourself two half days or an entire day.",
          "This is the BEST zoo I have ever been to. Could be a little cheaper, but I understand it is expensive to keep all those animals.",
          "This zoo is very nice and large. Since we went in November, half of the exhibits were closed. We expected some closures but not to the level this zoo took it. The aquarium was very nice, I would stay away from the butterfly exhibit, they don't want to come to humans.",
          "Hands down the best zoo in the country. Why? Because our whole community believes in & supports our zoo. We donate because we are all dedicated to the zoo's mission on conservation. We visit because it is the best destination for, relaxing, or high energy entertainment for all",
          "Loved every minute of our visit to the zoo. The exhibits are very creative and really give you a sense of the animal's habitat.",
          "My family has been going to the zoo for over 50 years. It gets better and better as time flys by! I\u2019m not a fan of circuses or a lot of zoos. I dont feel as though the animals are treated well at many of these places. I do believe that the Henry Dorley Zoo very much cares for",
          "go early it takes all day. many indoor exhibits. about a 5 min. walk between buildings.food at snack bars ok.",
          "Have been here often with the family. Incredible selection of animals, well kept, fun for the kids and adults!",
          "Without a doubt the best zoo in the country. Plan on spending a full day if you want to see everything. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes and be ready to see some of the best exhibits anywhere in the world. The Asian and African exhibits are my favorites....Amazing!",
          "I visited the aquarium with a group on a special tour at night. It was excellent. The exhibits let you feel like you are almost swimming with the fish and penguins.",
          "World class zoo! I took my daughter and granddaughter twice and we still didn\u2019t see everything! Unlike most places, you can pack in your own food and drink, you just can\u2019t take it into any of the on-site restaurants. ( Which are very good but very expensive.) Wear your",
          "This is easily the best zoo in America. The amount of stuff you can do and see, it's just unreal. I took that time out and get it in a 2-day trip. Well worth the time and money!",
          "I have been to a few Zoo's in the US but this one is amazing! There is so much to do there that we didn't even get through the whole thing in one day. The indoor desert was very true to life. Going into the jungle when the bats were active (late afternoon) were everyone's",
          "The great apes and the penguins are my favorites. Their enclosures are state of the art. The zoo is funded by some of Omaha\u2019s millionaires and it shows. Constantly adding new exhibits. Best to go when the weather is nice.",
          "We had a great time. I went with 3 kids and we went through twice. There was literally so much to enjoy.",
          "My daughter lives in Omaha, so I\u2019m there pretty often. I get my daughter & her family a membership for the zoo every year. They go year-round with their kids and they all love it. Very family-friendly. Fun on holidays. Truly recommend going there. Omaha itself is an",
          "I feel very fortunate to live in the same city as this amazing place. The henry doorly zoo is the best. I love that they keep adding and updating. It is such a wonderful place to visit.",
          "If you enjoy a zoo, this is a wonderful one to visit. The exhibits are varied. It is large enough to include a lot, but small enough to visit comfortably. We will certainly return someday.",
          "Lots of reviews on HDZ so I\u2019ll just add that you should not miss Hubbard Gorilla Valley, one of my favorites. The gorillas always deal you a good experience and they seem to always have a baby or juvenile on display.",
          "I really enjoyed the various exhibits at the Doorly Zoo, but there were two exhibits that made me sad. In the orangutan exhibit there were two separate areas and in each one was a lone orangutan. They were sitting as close as they could to each other, but were too far apart to",
          "We visited in the fall, so all the trees were changing and it really added to the beauty of the zoo. This zoo has lots of exhibits that are indoors, including an aquarium and cave experience. The butterfly pavilion is amazing! There\u2019s a good variety of different attractions",
          "Henry Doorly is one of my favorite zoos. The attention to detail is unmatched. Spent a little over four hours and covered the entire zoo. The Desert Dome, Kingdoms of the Night, Scott Aquarium, and Lied Jungle were favorites. When the weather is cold, there is plenty to see",
          "By far the best zoo in America! I recommend a trip yearly due to all of the updates that are always happening.",
          "One of the best Zoo's in the World. If this is your first time, you need to plan on being there all day to see everything.",
          "I grew up in Nebraska and have never seen the Henry Doorley Zoo until this last September. The ouside animal collections are ok and not any more spectactulor than a number of other zoo's - Minneapolis, Miami, Ft. Worth , Dallas, Toronto or Barcelona. What makes the Henry",
          "We were able to see all animals in the exhibits unlike other zoos where the animals always seem to be hiding. The aquarium and stingray beach are great as well.",
          "My family and I drove 5.5 hours to visit this zoo and it was worth it. The only downside was the amount of construction that was occurring which made getting between different exhibits a little more difficult. There are so many different animals and habitat types. We spent two",
          "This is an amazing zoo! If you are a senior, cost for admittance is $17.50. Is you have a local zoo, check to see if membership at your local zoo is reciprocal with Henry Doorly Zoo. We were able to get admittance for buy one senior, get the second free. You can rent strollers",
          "Nice Zoo but where are the animals? We visited several exhibits and found no animals! And having enjoyed the St. Louis zoo where we lived for many years and there is no entrance fee, we found the experience quite expensive. How does a family of four or five afford to go and",
          "This was a large zoo, we couldn't see all the exhibits in one trip. I enjoyed the layout, being circular, we didn't have to backtrack. Many ways to enjoy the experience with a train ride or a skytram. Overall great attraction for out of town visiters.",
          "Not a zoo family but when we read that this is the #1 zoo in America, we knew we had to see it while in Omaha. We were impressed after just entering the first building. We were there for 5 hours and still hadn't seen 2/3 of it. One good thing is that this zoo has SO much space.",
          "I love this zoo. It is clean, enclosures are huge and the animals appear healthy and happy. What more can you ask for.",
          "Zoo is great, but right now under a lot of Construction. Most Construction will be done in late Spring.",
          "This zoo was one of the best zoos we\u2019ve visited in the world. Large spaces for the large animals to roam make the viewing very enjoyable. The indoor spaces are world class. The rain forest, the desert, and the aquarium are all top notch",
          "Visited this place in very early spring on a cold, snow-spitting day-- not many other visitors, but it was still really fun to meander around at my own pace without the crushing crowds. Desert Dome was really interesting (and warm!). Construction happening on several exhibits so",
          "We go here with kids and grand kids several times a year. Always fun, and learn new things. They are constantly adding new and exciting exzibits.",
          "The zoo is super affordable, we were blown away by how clean everything was from the restrooms to the animal enclosures it seemed as everything was very meticulously taken care of. The animals looked healthy and happy. Plenty to do for an entire day. I did think the cost to",
          "We went on a weekend, of course it was packed! It was still a very wonderful experience. Definitely will be taking the family again!",
          "Best zoo in the world! Ranked that for a reason. Always updating! You can get so close to the giraffes and elephants!",
          "This zoo is outstanding with such great displays. The butterfly pavilion is incredible as is the desert dome and the new African exhibit. We were there for 3+ hours and could have stayed much longer.",
          "The best part of the zoo was the aquarium which was only partially accessible due to construction. We were yelled at immediately upon entering the lemur exhibit. All we did was open the door. If the lemurs are napping within a couple of feet of the door, they should have put a",
          "This by far is one of the best zoo's I have ever visited. The aquarium alone was worth the price of admission. You could see most animals clearly from well designed viewpoints. The habitats were clean and well maintained.",
          "The Omaha Zoo is so much more than just a zoo to see animals. The newer exhibits are very interactive!! It\u2019s a Zoo with an outdoor children\u2019s museum! Some trips the kids play in the stream for hours others they are all about seeing the animals!!",
          "If you want to get your exercise and see lots of different animals, this is your place to go. Enjoyed everything.",
          "Best part was seeing a trainer acclimate a brand new baby orangutan - with Mom watching every move very carefully! Took the tram around once to get my bearings and then walked, walked, walked!",
          "we went to the Zoo that we have been to numerous times and this was the most dissapointing, no polar bear no tigers, oh my. the aquarium is outstanding, desert dome is very bare inside hardly any animals, swamp is very interesting and jungle is neat, the kid zone/ petting zoo",
          "Did the backstage the aquarium and it was great. It was a surprise for my daughters birthday and she loved it!",
          "I've been to quite a few Zoos but had heard many times that Henry Dourly was one of the best, and it really is. I particularly liked the nocturnal animals exhibit (Kingdoms of the NIght), where the place is kept dark during the day so the animals are active. There were plenty",
          "We were visiting \"family\" and they took us here, both AF veterans, the clerk at the Ticket Booth gave us all military discount..they had available wheelchairs for my mom and sister..the gift shop very well organized...we did not get to go through the entire zoo BUT what we did",
          "We took the behind the sceens golf cart tour, it turned out to be a waste of time. We saw lots of empty enclosures, but heard how the interns lived on site, and various other lame stories about why there were no animals to see. I had heard for years how great this place was, I",
          "The park has outstanding landscaping! I arrived at 9am and parked at the North entrance, the cashier was very friendly and helpful with the park map. The train was not running yesterday so that was a disappointment, and the sky safari doesn't open until 10am. Those were two",
          "I like that this zoo did not have caged animals, but most were in open natural settings. Of course the lions, tigers and monkeys were behind wire or glass, but still had lots of space to roam. The setting were nice with rain forests, exhibits, and safari like areas. There were",
          "Again this year, Omaha zoo was a part of the vacation. The elephants exhibit was amazing. It was closed last I was here. Love this place!",
          "Our girls love all of the recent renovations. So much so that it's hard to get them to leave Adventure Trails! We are members so it's not too big of a deal when we don't get to see the rest of the zoo, but I'm always very impressed with the updates our zoo makes!",
          "My wife had been there before years ago.Sites seem to improve but not this zoo,mostly under construction and what was there to see had less animals than our small zoo in Des,Moines",
          "I've been to this zoo 25-30 times in the last 8 years, even though it's a 3 hour commute. We take young children and a very able-bodied octogenarian. I used to be thrilled with it and brag on it, and rank it much higher than my local zoo. Not true anymore. Under ludicrous",
          "Spent a full day at the zoo and walked many miles. It was a Sept weekday and not many refreshment stands open - would have been helpful for drinks as it was 90 degrees plus. The environment recreations in the buildings are phenomenal to say the least. The outdoor pens are",
          "Cannot say enough about this zoo. They consider every detail. Aquarium is fantastic, desert dome so cool and the Lied Jungle was probably our absolute favorite! We spent the entire day here and could have stayed longer. Feed the giraffes and ask questions because the staff is",
          "More than a zoo. The aquarium is an unexpected midwest gem. The jungle and the desert attractions are unique and create the feel you are actually in the wild - many plant and animal species within your reach - but please don't touch! Make sure to take the sky tram for a great",
          "This is a really great zoo with lots of interactive things for children to do. They have a good number of giraffes and the viewing area is great with a feeding area and guide to tell us about them!",
          "Took my wife, younger daughter and the two granddaughters to Henry Doorly Zoo recently. Wowza...what an enjoyable experience !!! We entered via the North Entrance because the kids zone is located nearest to that entrance. During the course of the visit, we did the Bay Family",
          "This is a beautiful zoo. The animals were well taken care of and the exibits were incredible. I particularly loved the asian area, the desert dome, the indoor rainforest, and the underground night world. As a bat lover, this zoo was extra special because there were so many",
          "We enjoyed our visit. You could spend several days there it is so massive. We spent a full day seeing all the animals with our grandchildren. We have been there twice and it never disappoints.",
          "We are seniors and spent 4 hours walking the zoo. Enjoyed the variety of animals including butterfly house, aquarium and desert dome. Our complaint is we entered via north entrance and was directed to main area for restrooms. Looking for lunch options we only saw closed sign",
          "This zoo is so massive with too much to see in a day. The zoo just gets better every year. Don\u2019t miss this experience.",
          "We spent the entire day at the zoo until it closed at 6. We went to every animal exhibit, spending extra time at our grandson\u2019s favorites. The animals are in big enclosures which have been made as natural as possible. The elephant viewing inside and out was amazing. We spent a",
          "It is a very nice zoo, my only complaint is that there are not many areas to get food other than snack stands and when we did finally stop to get lunch we waited in line for over an hour. Lesson learned, best to pack a lunch and have a picnic.",
          "As senior citizens, have seen many a zoo. Wonderful to see families of animals (as versus the lone example), both inside and outside accommodations for them. cared for human creatures as well, with sunscreen dispensers in the restroom. Not just \u201cjungle creatures.\u201d But",
          "We loved this zoo. Went on a Thursday so the place was not very busy at all. We spent the whole day walking around and seeing some of the exhibits multiple times. We took a ride on the skyfari chair lift which we recommend. Suggest doing some pre-planning and looking into all",
          "Henry Doorly zoo is fantastic. There was a lot of construction, so we missed my favorite part- the aquarium. My sister uses a wheelchair and the majority of the place is wheelchair accessible. Some of the habitat buildings have roots in the path, so some extra maneuvering is",

          "The Henry Doorly Zoo is a Top Rated Zoo! They continue to improve it every time we visit. This trip they were remodeling the bear areas. They are trying to create areas pertaining to the continents the animals come from. The Asian area had just opened up and was very well",
          "We planned a weekend trip to Omaha to visit the Zoo. Such a nice surprise to find it not super busy for a Saturday. Got busier later in the day. Favorite attraction was the Lied Jungle. Food was just ok but overpriced. Nice touch to get a souvenir glass that offered a discounted",
          "The Henry Doorly Zoo never fails to deliver a fun day. The zoo is full of activities for everyone; something for all ages. We attended with friends who had young children and they had the best time. So much to see and do - highly recommend the sky tram. We arrived at opening and",
          "On a trip last month to Omaha (to satisfy my bucket list to visit all 50 states), we spent an afternoon at the zoo. Since we didn't have much time and there us much to see, I decided to book a golf cart tour for my friend and me. What an amazing experience to go \"backstage\"",

          "We drove from out-of-state to spend a day here in July. We were not disappointed. Great place. Would come again.",
          "This zoo is huge. There are many interesting exhibits to walk through. However, one thing that is a little confusing is that there aren\u2019t actually many animals. A lot of mammals that I am used to see in larger groups at other zoos were often solitary.",
          "Omaha's Doorly Zoo is incredible. We were debating between one and two days for our visit, chose to go only one, and didn't quite make it to everything. The kids had fun feeding archer fish (watch out, they spit) and prairie dogs. My wife's favorite section was the nocturnal",
          "We were there for 6 hours and still didn\u2019t see everything! The animal enclosures were beautiful, the animals were lovely, and the amenities were great. We are already talking about bringing our extended family here soon.",
          "We decided to take my daughter here for her 10th birthday and we were not disappointed. this place is fantastic and you definitely do not want to miss the desert dome. Be prepared to do a lot of walking when you go to this zoo, we walked over 5 miles there, and still did not",
          "We spent almost 8 hours there today with our 8,7, and 3 year old. It really lives up to the hype. Best zoo we have been to. We weren\u2019t bored once. I\u2019ve never been to a zoo with so many animals. We didn\u2019t even get a glimpse of the tiger and leopard but saw so much we didn\u2019t feel",
          "This is obe of the BEST Zoo's in the country. My family had such an amazing experience. Staff is very kind, friendly and helpful. We will definitely come back when we're in Omaha. We live in Denver. This Zoo has Denver beat hands down. They also offer handicapped options which",
          "The Henry Doorly Zoo just keeps getting better and better. The new Asian Grasslands are amazing and you can see the animal in their natural habitats instead of behind glass. I recommend visiting our beautiful zoo in Omaha, Nebraska.",
          "This zoo takes ALL DAY to go through. New things added since we last went: Splash Pad- Very nice, wished I would have packed extra clothes for my kids; Playground Area-Very nice with a water feature for kids to play in too It is one of the best zoos! Highly recommend it!",
          "I visited here on 8/24/2019. It has grown a lot since I last visited here. We enjoyed the Lied Jungle and Desert Dome. With the tram and train it gives you more ways to see the zoo. We caught the 2 o'clock show with the elephants and the 3 o'clock show with the lions. All the",
          "We've been to the San Diego Zoo and teh San Diego Wild Animal Park and this place is right up there! We spent all day, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and saw pretty much everything but we went at a good clip. Very nice that you can bring in your own food/beverages. We carried in our lunch in",
          "I love this zoo because the animals have far better habitats. I\u2019ve seen giraffes run and turn on a dime and run some more to avoid going into their house in the evening. At the new multi-million sea lion exhibit they were all knocking each other into the water and horsing",
          "This is the most amazing zoo in the country. In fact I believe it has been rated #1 several times. They are always adding something new to see or do. The exhibits are amazing and it is possible to see it all in one day but if you wish to stand and watch the animals something",

          "Visited on 8-17-2019. Once you pay the hefty entry fee you'll find many empty cages, sad animals and rude employees. The only place well staffed is the gift shops where you will overpay for every single thing. I expected the prices, what I didn't expect was to pay over $65 for",
          "I am spoiled because I have repeatedly been at the San Diego Zoo. This park is amazing and does not need to shy away from the comparison with San Diego. There are two big differences: This one sits on a large piece of land which allows for some of the enclosures being even",

          "We have been to San Diego and l loved that zoo. But I love this one too. It is so well laid out and there are many animals to see. You can actually see them too. Will go back to this one for sure.",
          "Hands down my favorite zoo! I cant even Express how cool this place is. It's one of the those things u have to see it to appreciate it. Definitely check out the Madagascar and lemurs that run free. Or girafeees and then on top of the hill the lions <3 There is so much to do at",
          "Had heard this as good as San Diego but skeptical. It is truly world class. Plenty of pleasant staff, beautiful vegetation, and delightful exhibits. Was there before crowds and saw most animals (missed more gorillas though). Kudos to security staff who were so professional to",
          "We go to the zoo each year. This year, we were there shortly after it opened, and immediately walked down to the Africa exhibit. Unfortunately, most animals were not out yet. We continued our walk and went through the Gorilla house. There were some animals out here, but again it",
          "This zoo is awesome. Definitely give yourself enough time to see it all - at least half a day for the highlights. Every time I'm in town and come here there's something new to see.",
          "Amazing and big zoo! The splash park that has been added for the children is amazing as well! A lot of new additions since last time i was there in 2013. I do recommend comfy shoes, strollers if taking any children, snacks and lots of water!",
          "I would recommend this zoo to anyone! It had been about 15 years since our last visit and I can't believe the changes since that time. The facility is very clean and constantly changing.",
          "This zoo is consistently rated among the top zoos in the country, and for good reason. It's a very large zoo with fantastic habitats and exhibits. Don't miss the Lied Jungle (indoor jungle building) - it's very impressive, with 2 levels to walk through, including a waterfall",
          "I've been to zoos all over the world and this one is the best. You don't feel sorry for the animals. They do a great job caring for them. You could spend hours indoors on a hot day and still be amazed.",
          "Awesome place for a day of family bonding. Wonderful experience for adults and children to see God's creations!",
          "Both outdoor and indoor attractions to be found. Located on a moderately hilly site which has broad cement pathways to get to exhibits. A small train can take you around the park if walking is a problem. An excellent display of animals in habitats appropriate for them.",
          "This zoo has just about anything and everything. But the one thing that stands out is the people who both work and visit here. A certain teenager who will not be named in our group took off her backpack for a photo with the elephant statue. She was so excited about the",
          "It's a great zoo. Food is pricey but the same as going to like any other sort of venue in my opinion. Lots of things for kids to do to stay busy and then also many animals throughout! I LOVE the indoor jungle and we ate at the restaurant there that overlooks the jungle area, my",

          "It takes alot for me to be disappointed but this one was a doozy! Be sure to visit this zoo if you: A) Want to only be able to see about 1/4 of it B) If you enjoy waiting in long lines for at least 30 minutes to buy tickets, ride the train, ride the Skyfari, or buy overpriced",

          "We love the Henry Doorly Zoo. We planned for 2 days at the zoo, which I think is needed to be able to have fun and not feel rushed. We got to ride the skyfari - which I enjoyed looking down into the animal pens. I don't think that the train ride is worth it, just not much",
          "The best zoo I have ever been too. The aqaurum was beautiful. A lot of walking but was worth it. I will be back. Again, beautiful zoo.",
          "Didn't have enough time for all, but saw the Lied Jungle and Aquarium. Very impressive! Only $20 admission fee and so much to see, as well as helpful staff when you need a map or how to find your way... I have been many times and love it!",
          "The zoo is nice. Waste of time and money. We thought we'd see some animals along the route and save some walking. Nope. You see the backside of buildings and it goes too quickly past what animals are visible. The commentator is difficult to hear/understand. Don't bother.",
          "We recently visited the Henry Doorly Zoo for about the fifth time and continue to be amazed at this gem. We have been to multiple zoos - including the San Diego Zoo - and this attraction rivals any zoo throughout the entire nation. The variety of animals, the ease of getting",

          "I'm a lifelong Nebraskan but I hadn't been to the HD Zoo for over 10 years. I was amazed at how much has changed and been upgraded. One special touch that impressed me was that the zoo employs experts in different areas to answer questions about the exhibits and I found that",

          "I\u2019m from Chicago and while our local zoos (Lincoln Park and Brookfield) are nice medium-sized zoos, they are not even in the same class as Henry Doorly Zoo. It is amazing! It was so cool to see such large, natural animal habitats. The herd of elephants is so cool. The aquarium",
          "There was so much to see and do ! This is an amazing zoo and I especially loved the sky safari ride . It\u2019s relaxing to let your feet dangle and see the animals from above . My best friend and I had a blast- even though it was a little crowded . My recommendation would be to go",
          "We're from St. Louis, and we have no shame in touting our own wonderful zoo. But we were not prepared for the Doorly! Thinking a few hours would do, we were there for 5 hours and were far from seeing everything. Touted by locals as one of the top two zoos in the country, it was",
          "This zoo is highly rated, worth the trip and the crowds. I try to come here every year, at least once, when I visit family in Council Bluffs, Iowa. I grew up in the area, so I have always known Henry Doorly Zoo. I have seen huge improvements over the last 60+ years. The newest",
          "The grounds were well groomed, walking paths nice everything was well maintained. We walked the entire zoo as well as doing the sky tram. Would recommend the sky tram as we seen things from above that we could not see from the pathway. The highlights for me were the baby",
          "There is a good reason why this is one of top 3 zoo's in the country. It is awesome! Great exhibits, nicely laid out, friendly staff and decent food. There are numerous activities for members, afterhours, and classes. Great place to celebrate a youngsters birthday. A must stop",
          "This is an Omaha treasure. Named one of the best zoos in the US. Very well maintained, friendly staff and the animals appear to be treated well and cared for. The focus of the zoo is clearly educational. The picture is one found in the children's play area. I wish school",
          "I\u2019d heard that this the one of the best zoos in the world. Every exhibit was engaging, interactive, and focused ultimately on conservation and appreciation of the natural world. We especially enjoyed Stingray Beach (who knew stingrays could be so engaging and cute?), and the",
          "Awesome. We made a family trip here to Omaha because of the zoo and some other attractions. It was well worth it and we spent two days there. We got to see slot but but everything. It was great!!!!!!",
          "We had one day in Omaha so opted for the Zoo. There is so much to see there was no way we could do it all but the aquarium was awesome and the most impressive exhibit was the Kingdoms of the Night. Never seen anything like it! The only improvement would be better signage for the",
          "We love this zoo! The cost always is a little worrisome when you first pay and enter, but by the end of the day it is all worth it. We learn so much about animals and have so many great experiences when we visit. They are constantly improving and changing the exhibits too.",
          "The zoo was all the reviews said. We loved the different variety of animals at the zoo. The zoo is large so be ready for alot of walking up and down walk ways.",
          "Lots of walking for us but the gradkids always love this place. Neat place was the Stingray feeding building was really interesting. They come swimming right over your hand to eat the prepared minnows. The lion enclose was big but all we could see was a male lioin mane as he",
          "Excellent exhibits and SO clean considering the amount of animals they take care of. We can't wait for the new Seal Beach to be finished!",
          "Go early and if you want to see the larger mammals (like the big cats), go when it's cooler outside. All but 1 of the big cats (cheetahs) were hidden from view presumably sleeping in the shade. The zoo really become busy towards noon. The exhibits are pretty impressive. Plan",
          "Wow! Comparable to Denver Zoo in size. It was well run and easy to navigate. I recommend bring the kids' swimsuits of you go in the heat. The Alaskan Aventure Splash Park was a lifesaver after being in the heat all day. It closed right at 5 and by the time we got to the",
          "We made the mistake of going here on a hot Saturday in July. I haven\u2019t been here for years but I don\u2019t remember the price to get in being so high and the long lines to see the attractions in the buildings. There were really no workers out anywhere helping with anything. The",
          "A must see when my granddaughter visits from California. We especially enjoyed the giraffes this time since the baby giraffe, Zoey, was there. We took advantage of the trolley this year to get us from place to place. You HAVE to see the Stingrays. They are amazing.",
          "This zoo is such a well designed space! In the Adventure Trails area alone there is a long creek and sand play area, waterfalls, a HUGE playground/climbing structure with actual monkeys climbing around you in their own nets, a raft you can pull yourself, goat petting, so so",
          "Very Busy Saturday. Very slow moving Lines out the door for both the Desert Dome and the Aquarium. Did not get to see either as the young children could not wait in such long, very slow moving lines. There were no signs for or visible water fountains and every food station and",
          "If I were to choose the best thing about the zoo, It would be difficult to decide. Let's talk about the Desert Dome, That has got to be the number 1. You can see landscapes like the Namib Desert and the Sonoran Desert. Animals like Rattlesnakes and Merrcats are my favorite.",
          "Love the sky ride; it was a great way to see the animals and to give your feet a rest! A highlight for me was feeding the giraffes. For only $3 you get to hold a branch ( tightly) while the giraffe strips the leaves from the branch. Love that they have sunscreen dispensers",
          "The zoo was a lot of fun. It was very clean. The exhibits were not too far from each other. Seemed like most the animals were out except the giraffes. They were doing work on the aquarium but it didn't feel like a cluster or a mess. They had plenty of misting areas for the kids",
          "It was 100 degrees when we visited. I was worried about that but there were so many indoor places to cool off. I am a big aquarium fan and have visited many throughout the US and Europe, but this one is the best! My family absolutely loved this zoo!",
          "This is a world class zoo. I visit a lot of zoo's. Except for the Panda's, the Doorly Zoo is far better than the National Zoo in DC. Much better maintained than a lot of zoos. The one thing not to miss is the aquarium. Recently updated and expanded. The coral is",
          "Went to the beloved Henry Dooley Zoo, there were 6 giraffe, 6 elephants, one rhino, one hippo, one tiger, one snow leopard , 2 lionsess, a couple deer, the animals inside of the exhibits, a few gorillas, 2 bears (one red panda, one sloth bear) lots of penguins, the",
          "This zoo has it all. It is absolutely beautiful, with stunning grounds and architecture in addition to top notch animal exhibits. The whole zoo is clean and well kept - even the bathrooms (of which there are plenty families with kids). A couple of important things below: 1)",
          "This zoo never fails to impress. They have over the top indoor exhibits that will blow your mind, and the kid themed play section is really nice. A definite place for anybody to visit!!",
          "I had heard this zoo was a great one, one of the best, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. The entire family loved it! There was so many animals to see and experiences to enjoy that even though we spent roughly seven hours there, we were unable to complete them all. I\u2019ve been to the",
          "I am from the Caribbean. I was looking forward to seeing amazing animals. I know the animals wouldn\u2019t come out on demand but my gosh, at least have more than one bear (that was hiding), one tiger which we had to search for, we didn\u2019t even see the lion ( if they had one), many",
          "We really enjoyed the Asia garden. The Africa area is top notch. This is the best zoo I have seen. Thanks",
          "The zoo grounds were beautiful. The zoo was interesting but lacked a variety of animals. The food was overpriced and there was a lack of sitting down space.",
          "A wonderful Zoo. This something we enjoy is the many Zoo in the US. This one is right up there as one of the best. The the day we were there the Elephants were not out. The encloses are very realistic which help understand the animals environment. Could of done another day if we",
          "The zoo is fantastic. I especially loved the rainforest. It was laid out in a spectacular way that reminded me of walking in an Oahu rainforest. It is definitely worth the visit and an excellent, healthy walk.",
          "I\u2019m 15 and I\u2019ve always lived in Omaha. I used to come to the zoo for day trips with my family when I was younger and now I go with my friends often. There are so many things to do that it never gets old. I would especially recommend going to Sting Ray Beach. Although it costs a",
          "I knew the Omaha Zoo would be amazing, but that was definitely an understatement! It is pricey, but with good reason! The exhibits are thought through and they keep going and going. I was amazed at how very large the aquarium is! Forget seeing two or three penguins, how about",
          "The zoo during the summer can be a good experience depending on crowds. The animals were not very active since it was hot outside. I would recommend a visit in the spring or the fall.",
          "Living in Colorado, I have access to two wonderful zoos - Denver Zoo and Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. However, they both pale in comparison to Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo. This 185-acre zoo is spectacular! The animal enclosures are huge, giving the wildlife lots of space to roam. I was",
          "Such a great zoo! My 15teen&9yr loved it. They had some construction going on by the gorillas but probably putting in something amazing. Love the desserts dome building, rain forest building, king of the night which housed so many different kinds of snakes,bats,",
          "Always Great! We love the zoo and always cool off by the penguins. Monkeys are fun to watch and the jungle is awesome",
          "We have been to a lot of zoos, but this was outstanding! Lots of animals, giraffe feedings, etc. The tram and train was cool. The Dome was fantastic. Cooling most stations were great as it was a hot day. Rainforest exhibit and gorillas were awesome too!",
          "This is without a doubt the best zoo, the aquarium is delightful. The penguins are obviously well cared for, and the under water tunnel is amazing! The desert dome is large but could be better utilized. A must see.",
          "I grew up in CA, so I have been to many of the countries top zoos and I was extremely pleased to see such a fantastic zoo in the middle of Nebraska! This is perfect for a family with small children or older children. The animals seem to be treated well, which is so important!",
          "It is clear that lots of really wealthy people have made and continue to make substantial gifts to this zoo. It is very clean, highly staffed, great habitat, lots of animals. Really first class. Their budget must be much larger than a typical city zoo could afford. They must",

          "I thoroughly enjoyed this zoo. It has so many different animals, birds and Aqua life . The landscaping and architecture is beautiful. I would recommend packing your own food and drinks as they are quite expensive to purchase at the zoo. The skyfari is a must! I enjoyed the",
          "We went with a 4 year old and she loved it. The desert dome and tropical forest was a great experience. So was the aquarium. We took both the rail and skyfari. But I would only recommend the skyfari unless your kids like just a train ride. As we did not see much animals during",
          "You can see it all in about 3-4 hours. Clean park, friendly and helpful staff, plenty of eats. We had grandparents and teens with us. Highly recommend the tram.",
          "This was probably one of the nicest zoos I\u2019ve been to. I have traveled to many states and countries and this place was fantastic. Lots of walking to do and if it\u2019s really hot many indoor exhibits to see. I would highly recommend.",
          "This zoo is beautiful. The nice thing is that it has plenty of tree cover to keep the sun off of you. The animals have nice habitats and there are plenty of them. The only downside is that the vendors don\u2019t open until 10 or later and we had to wait until 11 just to get a water.",
          "As usual the zoo keeps getting bigger and better. Loved walking around and hope to go back on our next visit to Omaha",
          "My family- husband, daughter (11 year old) and I came down to Omaha to visit the zoo based on recommendations of family and friends. We thought the exhibits and the animals were great and enjoyed ourselves for a full day of walking around. The price was a little more than I",
          "The whole family enjoys the zoo. I like the dome and the kids like the monkey house. The lemur walk is a must.",
          "I stopped here with a friend on a road trip after a long day of driving and was amazed to find such a fun, unique experience. I make it a point of visiting zoos on my travels and I now understand why this one ranks #1 in America. There was such a variety of habitats with expert",
          "We went as a family with grandchildren. We had limited time so didn't see all of the zoo, as that would take 2 full days. We were very happy with Stingray Beach, the Aviary and a few other exhibits, ending with a relaxing ride around the zoo on the tram, mentally planning the",
          "The modern style for zoos is to make zoo exhibits more theme park like. Instead of just different animals in cages we have animals arranged in thematic exhibits with cool signage and kid friendly settings. The Lied Jungle was a great example of this. You enter the jungle, get",
          "It has been fun to watch this zoo evolve over the years. I first went to this zoo in 1990. It was terrific then. It has turned into one of the best zoos in the country, if not world. The Desert Dome is terrific, but beneath it is the swamp exhibit which is flat out",
          "This zoo has an amazing amount of fun for the entire family. We are happy to report that this zoo is special needs/handicapp friendly! Extremely impressed with the cleanliness at all sites throughout. The food is a bit pricey, but good!!",
          "The best zoo in the country by far. From Indoor Rain Forest to the Desert Dome the Omaha Henry Dorley Zoo is well worth the time and money! Very educational and fun for the the entire family!",
          "The Henry Doorly Zoo seems like a hidden gem. We had never even heard of the zoo until we went to Omaha for the College World Series several years ago. Now, it is a regular visit. And, it has things that help those that may have mobility issues such as the train, or the",
          "We've been to this zoo several times and always find it educational, entertaining, and enlightening. Last visit I was able to use the motorized wheelchair and that was a great benefit to me as well. I highly recommend this fabulous facility to all, though those with mobility",
          "This is definitely a \"Must Do\" if you are in the Omaha area. If you plan on making it a 2 time trip, just purchase a family membership. With that you get the iMax theater also. There is so much to see. Don't spend too much time in the children's entertainment areas, splash",
          "Been a few years since I\u2019ve been and they have done a great job with updates and additions. The kids play area, the splash pad, and Asian highlands were all big and nice. Still love the aquarium walk through tunnel and jellyfish room. Was over 90 that day so a lot of animals",
          "We spent over 20 years in Houston and many near Atlanta, so we appreciate a great zoo. Raising our kids in Houston, where the phenomenal zoo was free, set us up for a lifetime of sticker shock! $40 entrance fee sort of set our expectations high. This zoo didn't disappoint. We",
          "The Omaha zoo is our #1 choice for our family for many reasons. First the variety of exhibits from the aquarium which is absolutely top notch to the Alaskan Adventure (our sons favorite place in the zoo). Second, because it was the place where my wife and I had our first date.",
          "Needed an alone day and strange as it sounds even with a lot of folks around it was pleasant to just go and be alone. New elephant enclosure is perfect for watching the young ones play. Gorilla house is like being inside with them. And the aquarium and penguin display is a",
          "Spent about four hours here with our 2-year old in 100+ degree weather and still thought it was awesome. There's a good mix of indoor and outdoor animal areas so you can still have a good time during inclement weather. We left after four hours because our son needed a nap but",
          "We didn't know what to expect so we arrived a little afternoon and since we were only in the city for the weekend unfortunately we did not get to see the whole place. This place is huge!!! We bought the pass that included the extra attractions like the carousel and train ride.",
          "We had a great day. The zoo is beautiful and clean and set up well. My kids are 12 and 8 and they had a blast. We drove 8 hours to come to the zoo and it was well worth it.",
          "The Omaha zoo was not on our original travel plans but we are glad we stopped. My teenage and school aged kids were so excited to being visiting a zoo. The entire zoo was able to be walked and viewed by us in 4 hours.",
          "Very nice zoo that is well laid out. I also recommend the train ride and Skyfari to give additional views. You will get your steps in for sure!!",
          "We LOVE this zoo, we have been here no less than a dozen times. It gets better every time with all the new habitats being built. The only downside, all of the hills you have to walk up and down. Do not attempt this zoo if you are not able to walk!",
          "We visited the Zoo while in Omaha for the CWS and it did not disappoint. Very nice exhibits - interesting aquarium with many varieties of sea creatures - lots for kids to be interested in as well as adults.",
          "We only had a short period of time to visit so we opted to do the train, the tram, and visit the aquarium and the Wild Kingdom! We did not walk around very much, but we did see lots of animals! The aquarium was my favorite part! The fish were beautiful and very colorful! Very",
          "I love coming here with my family! We get to see everything and we love the train ride! We always have so much fun here! Just make sure if you have young kids to bring lots of waters it gets very hot walking around!",
          "We were here almost the entire day and missed 2 of the exhibits. Nicely done. Very clean. Easy to walk. Pretty average for the most part but loved the variety of animals and how clean everything was, all the way down to the restrooms.",
          "All four of my children loved this zoo. We were able to stay about 5 hours but easily could have come back a second day to keep exploring. The aquarium alone was worth the stop. Other favorites were the butterflies, huge and enclosed play area, and the elephants.",
          "I\u2019ve enjoyed our time at the Henry Doorly Zoo but it does not live up to the hype. The desert dome and Lied Jungle are unique, but there is one entrance and one exit. If you get bored halfway through there is no other exit. the rest of the Zoo is trite. There are no bears aside",
          "My wife and I took a day off from the CWS to relax at the zoo and we had a blast! I heard a local complaining about how crowded it was but I didn\u2019t think it was bad, the lines were not long and the atmosphere was fun. I can\u2019t wait to come back.",
          "Family trip to the zoo on Saturday and it was just fantastic! There is literally something for everyone to enjoy! I love that you can bring in your own lunch and drinks. It allows us to spend money on other fun things, like the train or tram! The aquarium is hard to navigate",
          "This is a very nice zoo. The gorilla exhibit is quite good. Lots of construction going on right now but still worth the visit.",
          "This is our absolute favorite zoo! We travel to come here almost every summer. The new giraffe and elephant enclosures really add to the zoo. Can\u2019t wait to come again.",
          "We recently visited the zoo for the first time since moving to the Omaha area. The first thing we noticed is that it costs waaaaaaaaay more than any other zoo we've ever been to. A word of advice - if you just want to occasionally ride the tram to get from place to place, do not",
          "Pricy but you could spend the day here. Wonderful collections of animals and well displayed in a parklike setting. Other attractions include water pad, carousel, train, tram, Sky lift. The plantings are gorgeous. Lots of docents who are very helpful. Wonderful program for youth",
          "This is one of the top zoos in the country, hands down!!! We were visiting from Detroit and we are zoo buffs, so we wanted to check out this zoo. We have been to 11 zoos around the country, including San Diego, Atlanta, and D.C.. This zoo is the second best zoo on our list. We",
          "This is an amazing zoo. Easily in the top 5 in the USA. As most of the reviewers have already said, this an experience not to be missed. Our friends who go frequently suggested that since we only had one day to spend here, we would see a great deal more if we took the golf cart",
          "Overall the zoo is awesome and always growing and getting better. Most of the exhibits are setup great. They only have a few left that are outdated. But they are making them better to see and better for the animals. Usually have a membership each year and enjoy just taking a",
          "This is a very nice zoo, but has a lot of incline walking. Needs to have better signs to tell how to exit the zoo.",
          "I brought my daughter back and they have added quite a bit. Really impressive. The elephants were so cool. Everything is pretty much all together. I wish they had more places to eat throughout the zoo and maybe more stands with drinks and snacks. This is why the four star",
          "Living in Omaha you find yourself doing what the tourists do. Not really. I've been going to the Henry Doorly Zoo since I could remember (25+ years) and I still enjoy every part of the zoo. There is construction going on now for improvements.",
          "This is without a doubt the #1 thing I would recommend to those visiting our city. Plan to spend an entire day here without a doubt and you could still not get to see it all. The zoo features a movie theatre, carousel, Skyfari (view animals from the air and get transportation",
          "You can tell this is one of the top 2 zoos in America, and taking good care of the animals is a priority, which is why they got rid of the cat complex and gave all the big cats away to other zoos that could take better care of them. Same with the bears. I hope in the future",
          "We were not visiting with children but still found the zoo enjoyable with just adults in our party. It was also really affordable too (admission was close to $45 for two adults) plus extras were not to bad like train rides for $6 each. There is a lot to see and walking around to",
          "I must admit I was skeptical. I was told over and over it was one of the top zoos in the country. Penguins! Yes, there are penguins. I've visited some of the top zoos in the country to include San Diego. I'll admit Henry Doorly falls into that category.",
          "Well this zoo has lived up to all of its accolades ! I spent the entire day visiting all the different areas. I enjoyed trekking through the desert dome. I got to see flora and fauna I normally do not see at zoos. I know all the zoos I visit promote conservation, but there is",
          "It lived up to all of our expectations. It is a beautiful zoo and the staff are very friendly. Make the trip!",
          "I lived in this area 28 years ago and I just couldn't wait to visit this zoo again. For me this zoo is the absolute best zoo I've ever been to. It got even better and I wish I had more time because I only got to see the aquarium, butterfly exhibit, dessert dome and jungle with",

          "We visited the Henry Doorly Zoo on Memorial Weekend with our grown kids that live in Omaha. It rates in my top 2 zoos in the USA. This beautiful and well designed zoo knows how to move people in quickly on the busiest holiday weekends and the design of the zoo is excellent and",
          "Henry Doorly Zoo has been considered one of the \"Top 10\" Zoos in America for a long while, and it certainly deserves that. It has probably been 8-10 years since I visited the zoo last and the renovations that have been completed since then offer an even greater visitor",
          "This is a very good zoo, I spent 7 hours here with our grandchildren aged 3, 5 and 9 and we did not see everything. Besides being a good zoo, there are a lot of exceptional play areas for kids for them to decompress. Some of the concession stands were very slow but others",
          "This is one of the best zoo experiences in the country. The new Asian exhibits are phenomenal, especially how they made the newly constructed structures look like they've been there for hundreds of years. So many giraffes, elephants, and gorillas. Awesome indoor exhibits when",
          "We have visited many Zoos during our trips to the states and this definitely rates one of the best, it\u2019s the only zoo you can walk around in an orderly fashion so you don\u2019t miss any of the animals, it was a very hot day when we visited so many of the animals were hiding in the",
          "One of many great things to do in Omaha. The zoo offers an awesome skyfari (sky ride) that gives one a great overview of the zoo. The penguins are a can\u2019t miss stop. The aquarium gives a unique perspective to aquatic life. Well laid out zoo. We ate at the Omaha Steak",
          "Had a great time at the zoo! Can bring your own food/drink in the zoo if you like but food /drink prices weren't too bad. Especially liked the food and ice cream at Glacier Bay Landing which was new to us.",
          "Who knew the best zoo in America was in Omaha, Nebraska?! My mom and I were visiting family in Omaha and were told to 100% go to the zoo ~ Certainly glad we did! Highlights were the aviary, desert eco-system, rain forest eco-system, butterfly garden, the sky tram & the movie",
          "It\u2019s like any regular zoo that you may have visited in the past. It has same animals just like other zoos. The one thing that distinguishes it though is the desert dome and the skyfari and train and tram. They have a section called glacier bay which is to model after how a",

          "First time here and two things I will take away from this trip: the size of the zoo and how well/strategically placed the places to eat are, practically intertwined with exhibits. Probably all has been said before many times in other reviews but plan on being here all day if",

          "when you are on the road you see advise saying that this is the best zoo of the world's. I don't know for the World but in US and Canada it'S really the best zo we have ever made it has the Aquarium include so you don't have to buy 2 tickets going in two differents place.",
          "Here are some tips. Go early and do the indoor attractions- the desert dome, Lied Jungle, insect house and aquarium as they get very crowded. In some areas there is a narrow pathway where strollers or wheel chairs take almost the entire path (mainly at desert dome). This",
          "Really nice zoo. Plan to walk a lot. Take sunscreen. They do allow food and drinks. On weekends consider buying tickets online as the line took 10-15 minutes. Families with small children will love the train. The aquarium was much bigger than I expected. Some new areas are",

          "What a neat zoo. Everything was very clean, spaced out enough that people weren't all stuck together. Plenty of animals and exibits to keep everyone interested. Well worth the price of admission...highly recommend going if you get the chance",
          "What an incredible zoo. I haven't gone to many since I was a child but even as an adult I was captivated. We had the chance to see the new baby giraffe in the barn which was just so cute! I have to say be prepared for sticker shock if you don't bring food and drink into the",
          "The kids loved this zoo! So many things to do and see not sure how someone could see it all in one day! One tip bring your own snacks, food and drinks. The snack stands weren\u2019t open yet and the dining with seating food was very pricey. We did enjoy the French fries but that\u2019s",
          "Who knew that Omaha had one of the top five zoos in the world! We were so thrilled that we had sufficient time to be able to spend a day at the zoo. The exhibits were amazing - the animals have wonderful facilities to live in and are clearly very well cared for and every",
          "Came here with my granddaughter last summer expecting a nice clean zoo. This zoo is something not to be missed for zoo lovers. From the butterfly house to the \"swamp\" with alligators. Every \"land\" amazed us. Put it on your to do list if visiting.",
          "Gorgeous! They are always expanding and improving, but how else do you maintain the reputation for being the best zoo in the world? I have been coming here since 1977, and I am never disappointed. A few pics are below.",
          "Always rated as one of the best zoosk in the US for good reason, Henry Doorly is a great place for family enjoyment. The IMAX theater adds versatility to the location in the event of rain. This is a must-visit and worth a trip to Omaha from wherever you are, especially if you",
          "The zoo is fantastic for everyone, young or old. You can easily spend an entire day and still not get through the entire attraction. The Swamp, and the Rain Forrest are my personal favorites, but the new Africa attraction is pretty spectacular as well! Must visit",
          "I absolutely love this zoo. It is by far the best I have been to. The exhibits are very spacious and are geared toward the natural environment of the animals. It's educational and fun for the entire family. A MUST see in Omaha",
          "This zoo is absolutely beautiful. As a child I loved visiting this zoo and bow as a mother I have loved watching it grow and love taking my children there. We love that you can pet sting rays and its awesome they allow you to bring your own food and drinks!",
          "very beautiful place to spend the day with the family, The new kids area is a blast so much to see and do",
          "There were some interesting animals, and the biosphere was informative. But on the whole the zoo sections that we saw seemed very old school with cages that were relatively small and little to no environment. It made me sad",
          "If I could give this zoo a ten I would. We aren\u2019t really zoo people but we\u2019re told not to miss it by locals. This zoo is fantastic. Extremely well kept and more then you can see in one day. Please don\u2019t miss it if your in Omaha. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",
          "I like zoos okay. We didn\u2019t have plans to go while we were in Omaha but everyone kept raving about it so we decided to go. We planned on a two hour visit. We were there for six and half hours and could have spent more time. This is not just a zoo. It has an aquarium, botanical",
          "We basically drove to Omaha from Denver for steak and the zoo. A new city we've never been too. The zoo was tons of fun though be prepared to walk some hills. One section was under construction for a whole new exhibit but that's ok, there was plenty to see. It still took us",
          "Do yourself a favor and go see this attraction when Omaha. This is one of the best Zoo's in the world. I believe it ranks in the top 10 and you will see why when you visit. The Rain Forest is phenomenal!! The aquarium, saffari, the dessert dome...and on and on. This is a",
          "We spent all day at the zoo with a 13 year old and 8 year old. My 17 year old stayed a few hours. We loved the desert dome, nocturnal building, a great aquarium , lied jungle, & the gorillas! Parking was free! Lunch was expensive and just ok as expected for a zoo.",

          "We visited the Zoo and only had a few hours to explore. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Our favorites were the penguins, tigers, elephants and the aquarium. This would be a great place to bring your kids/grandkids.",
          "I have gone here several times and there's so much to do that you can't see it all in one day. Plus unlike most parks and zoos they allow you to bring outside food and drink so you can save money if you want to.",
          "Always amazing time! So much to see there so make sure to plan on a full day. Well worth it every time making great memories with the family!",

          "It was my very first time visiting the Henry Doorly Zoo and I was blown away. I worked at the Blank Park Zoo which is a bit smaller but the Henry Zoo is so beautiful and well maintained. The animals have plenty of room indoors and outdoors. Staff are very knowledgeable and very",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed this zoo. It was a bit cold out, so not all of the animals were outside. Never fear. There is the tropical rainforest, the desert dome, the aquarium and the butterfly exhibit to keep you busy!! The aquarium has a tube you walk through and the fish,",

          "First time visit to the Omaha Zoo. Great layout, enclosures, and exhibits. The Desert Dome and Lied Jungle rainforest were outstanding. Did not experience the large movie screen though. Well worth the $18 admission with discount. Visited on a cool weekday out of the summer",

          "Wonderful zoo. Can't wait to go back when it is warmer and the rides are working!! Aquarium was great.",
          "This is truly a great place to come with family and friends. Lots of walking, bring a cart or rent ones for young children. Food is good but a little pricey- may be smart to pack a lunch. The Jungle and the Aquarium are not to be missed.",

          "I love \u2764\ufe0f this Zoo! Just bought an annual membership so I can go more often. The Lied Jungle dome is like being in a tropical rainforest - great when winter is still hanging on a bit. Some construction going on right now for the new Asian exhibit but desert dome, aquarium and",

Looking forward to return trip in warmer",

          "This is always an amazing experience with children. Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo has ruined other zoo visits for me because this is such an excellent zoo, nothing else can compare. It is nearly impossible to enjoy/appreciate all the exhibits in one visit. The attractions they",

          "World class zoo-the animals do not disappoint. Baby pigmy hippo was well cared for but still easily visible. Gorillas are interactive. Recommend bringing your own food as there are not enough vendors and the wait is ridiculous for ordering.",

          "We've been to the HD Zoo now a couple of times, with a wide range of ages. Our youngest is a cheetah fanatic and was not disappointed...although we were a bit confused as they weren't in the 'big cat' area. It was worth the walk to the far end of the zoo to see them in a large",
          "This zoo is one fantastic place! When I first moved to Omaha 40 years ago -- it was just getting off the ground! Today, it is one top-notch zoo with animals on display, but much more going on behind the scenes in studying and conservation of animals. Don't miss this if you",
          "The Henry Doorly Zoo here in Omaha is the best I've ever been to. It takes more that 2 days to see it properly. The Aquarium and the Rain Forest are my favorites, but the rest is so awesome, it's hard to claim a favorite. The animals are very well cared for and their diets",

          "We went to the Henry Doorly Zoo and it was very fun. We go there often but it never gets old. The animal are very entertaining for all ages. We went during a winter month so none of the rides were open and most of the animals were not out. After we walked for awhile our feet",
          "It was snowing when we went. Like frEEzing cold. We spent almost 2 hours inside the warm domb. It was amazing. Then, we went to the aquarium. We were there over 5 hours and spent very little time walking around outside in the freezing cold (The animals were mostly holed up",
          "I have been to 25 different zoos and this zoo has become my new favorite. The zoo has large enclosures for the animals, the enclosures look very natural to the actual animals habitats in the wild and are well laid out so you can see the animals from different angles. If you",

          "Who would have thought that Omaha has the best zoo I've ever been to in the country, granted we went in November when some of the exhibits were closed, but, that didn't matter. There is so much to see there, I can imagine it taking a couple of days to see everything.",
          "The Henry Doorly Zoo is a very good zoo. However, the price of tickets almost makes it unaffordable for families who come to visit once a year. Once inside the zoo, many attractions require additional money to participate.",

          "I worked as a teenager in 1966 for Dr Lee Simons when he started to revitalize the zoo. Since then there have been so many changes I couldn't name them. What is important is that they all moved the zoo in the positive direction. I'm proud to have been a very small part of it.",
          "Absolutely a great place to go. My husband and I go frequently just for couple hours, walk around, watch an I MAX show, have a fresh burger off the grill. Our kids are grown and live out of town. One of the things they like to do when they are here to visit in summer, fall and",

          "The Henry Doorly Zoo in my opinion is the best Zoo in the US. There are so many unique exhibits that you can\u2019t see it all in a day. Even the railroad is unique, the large locomotive was built in Austria in the 1800\u2019s. Go check it out it\u2019s worth it.",
          "The Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha is one of my favorite places!! It is so beautiful there! The staff is phenomenal. They all have smiles on their faces while they are working. They are very passionate about their jobs, about the animals and conservation in general. The staff enjoys",

          "I\u2019ve been going to this zoo for 36 years and it only gets better! Many of the new exhibits are large and allow the animals to wander similar to their natural habitats. We recently had an overnight and slept in the aquarium and it was fun and well organized!",
          "We went to the zoo on a snowy December day, so not a lot of people were there. It was so awesome, because there were lots of zoo keepers to answer our many questions! One zoo employee joined us for an hour or more, and gave us a personal tour! She definitely went out of her way",

          "Attended a private event at the aquarium last night. Enjoyed food and drinks as we strolled through the tunnels watching huge fish swim all around us! Too bad this app won\u2019t let me upload a few of the videos.",
          "It is surprising that a city the size of Omaha has such an amazing zoo--but it does. It was raining pretty hard and was chilly so we tried to stay indoors; there was still plenty to see. I would recommend the desert, wild kingdom and aquarium when the weather is bad. We did",
          "This zoo was spectacular. So well laid out so that you can see the animals up close and personal from many different angles, yet the animals have large habitats. The aquarium was amazing. This is going to be the place we go annually when we visit our son in Des Moines.",
          "This Zoo is the best and you will want to go several times a year so you can see it all and participate in all their offerings. The Zoo pass pays for itself usually after 1 trip!",

We are used to the KC zoo which is underwhelming for the most part so Omaha\u2019s is remarkable in comparison. In addition to the train, carousel type things every zoo has, they",

          "It was a hot day which was a bummer cause we would have liked to do more sightseeing but we got in as much as we could. We did the train and the sky tram which gave a real Birdseye view! The butterfly garden was special. The dome is unlike any other Exhibit I\u2019ve ever seen.",

        "wiki": "Zorinsky Lake Park is a park located at 156th and F streets in West Omaha, Nebraska. Named after Senator Edward Zorinsky of Omaha, the park has a 255-acre (103 ha) lake offering boating and fishing. The park is surrounded by 770 acres (310 ha) of public land, including 190 acres (77 ha) dedicated to wildlife management. The park is home to the Bauermeister prairie, which houses 120 species of plants, birds, and wildlife.\n\n\n== About ==\nIn response to damaging floods in 1964 and 1965, several dams were constructed on Papillion (Papio) Creek and its tributaries for flood control. In 1984, the reservoir was completed, and then the dam structure was closed in 1989. Zorinsky Lake Park opened in 1993 after the US Army Corps of Engineers leased the land to the City of Omaha. The Park was named after the late U.S. Senator Edward Zorinsky. The park includes two playgrounds, several playing fields and multiple picnic areas. Tree-lined trails running through Zorinsky Lake encompass the perimeter of the lake.  The small lake is approximately 3.15 miles (5.07 km) and the big lake is 4.44 miles (7.15 km) around. It is 7.4 miles (11.9 km) around the both lakes. The path is marked every tenth of the mile with green markers to give the location around the lake.The park hours are from 5:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. 7 days a week. The lake has a surface area of 255 acres (103 ha) and is a day-use facility offering two modern playgrounds, baseball diamonds, soccer fields, a football field, hiking and bicycling trails, and a universally accessible fishing dock. According to the Nebraska Game and Park Commission, Zorinsky Lake was stocked with 79 largemouth bass on April 16, 2009 and 38,000 walleye on June 10, 2009. The maximum speed limit on the lake is 5 mph (8.0 km/h) and there is no-wake boating permitted.  The boat ramp is located on the east side of the lake and can be accessed from 156th and f Street.\nIn November 2010, a local Boy Scout found a zebra mussel attached to a beer can at the edge of the lake.  In an attempt to eradicate the invasive mollusk, the lake was partially drained in the winter of 2010\u201311, lowering its level by 17.5 feet (5.3 m): it was thought that removing the water and exposing the mussels to sub-freezing air temperatures would kill them off.\n\n\n== See also ==\nParks in Omaha, Nebraska\nTrails in Omaha\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "This is a list of parks in Omaha, Nebraska. It includes cemeteries and golf courses. Most parks in Omaha are governed by the City of Omaha Parks and Recreation Department.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1854 Alfred D. Jones drew four parks on the original map of Omaha City. They were called Jefferson Square, which was paved over by I-480; Washington Park, which is where the Paxton Block currently sits at North 16th and Farnam Streets; Capitol Square, where Omaha Central High School is now located, and; an unnamed tract overlooking the river with Davenport Street on the north, Jackson Street on the south, North 8th on the east and North 9th Street on the west. Jefferson Square lasted until 1969, when it was razed to make way for a new interstate in downtown Omaha. The riverfront from the interstate south to the headquarters of ConAgra Foods is now the Heartland of America Park.\nHanscom Park became Omaha's first park. Miller, Fontenelle, Elmwood and Riverview were Omaha's largest parks in 1920. (Riverview Park Zoo eventually became Henry Doorly Zoo.) Levi Carter Park was its largest, at 220 acres (0.89 km2). Other parks in the system that year were Bemis, Deer, Kountze Park, Curtis Turner, Harold Gifford, Mercer, Jefferson Square, Hixenbaugh, Burt playground, Bluff View, Spring Lake, Highland, McKinley, Clear View and Morton.Omaha's boulevard system was designed to be part of the parks system in 1889 by renowned landscape architect Horace Cleveland. The Omaha Park and Boulevard System was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe Department of Parks, Recreation, and Public Property is the City of Omaha's agency responsible for administering public parks.\n\n\n== Current parks ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of cemeteries in Omaha\nCulture in Omaha\nSports in Omaha\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParks in Omaha \u2013 info about parks and public places in Omaha",

        "wiki": "Omaha ( OH-m\u0259-hah) is the largest city in the state of Nebraska and the county seat of Douglas County. Omaha is in the Midwestern United States on the Missouri River, about 10 miles (15 km) north of the mouth of the Platte River. The nation's 40th-largest city, Omaha's 2019 estimated population was 478,192.\nOmaha is the anchor of the eight-county, bi-state Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area. The Omaha Metropolitan Area is the 59th largest in the United States, with an estimated population of 944,316 (2018). The Omaha-Council Bluffs-Fremont, NE-IA Combined Statistical Area (CSA) encompasses the Omaha-Council Bluffs MSA as well as the separate Fremont, NE Micropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of the entirety of Dodge County, Nebraska. The total population of the CSA was 970,023 based on 2017 estimates. Approximately 1.3 million people reside within the Greater Omaha area, within a 50 mi (80 km) radius of Downtown Omaha.\nOmaha's pioneer period began in 1854, when the city was founded by speculators from neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa. The city was founded along the Missouri River, and a crossing called Lone Tree Ferry earned the city its nickname, the \"Gateway to the West\". Omaha introduced this new West to the world in 1898, when it played host to the World's Fair, dubbed the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. During the 19th century, Omaha's central location in the United States spurred the city to become an important national transportation hub. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the transportation and jobbing sectors were important in the city, along with its railroads and breweries. In the 20th century, the Omaha Stockyards, once the world's largest, and its meatpacking plants gained international prominence.\nToday, Omaha is the home to the headquarters of four Fortune 500 companies: mega-conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway; one of the world's largest construction companies, Kiewit Corporation; insurance and financial firm Mutual of Omaha; and the United States' largest railroad operator, Union Pacific Corporation. Berkshire Hathaway is headed by local investor Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world, according to a decade's worth of Forbes rankings, some of which have ranked him as high as No. 1.Omaha is also the home to five Fortune 1000 headquarters: Green Plains Renewable Energy, TD Ameritrade, Valmont Industries, Werner Enterprises, and West Corporation. Also headquartered in Omaha are the following: First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately held bank in the United States; three of the nation's ten largest architecture/engineering firms (DLR Group, HDR, Inc., and Leo A Daly; and the Gallup Organization, of Gallup Poll fame, and its riverfront Gallup University.\nNotable modern Omaha inventions include the following: the \"pink hair curler\" created at Omaha's Tip Top Products; Butter Brickle Ice Cream, and the Reuben sandwich, conceived by a chef at the then\u2013Blackstone Hotel on 36th and Farnam Streets; cake mix, developed by Duncan Hines, then a division of Omaha's Nebraska Consolidated Mills, the forerunner to today's ConAgra Foods; center-pivot irrigation by the Omaha company now known as Valmont Corporation; Raisin Bran, developed by Omaha's Skinner Macaroni Co.; the first ski lift in the U.S., in 1936, by Omaha's Union Pacific Corp.; the Top 40 radio format, pioneered by Todd Storz, scion of Omaha's Storz Brewing Co. and head of Storz Broadcasting, and first used in the U.S. at Omaha's KOWH Radio; and the TV dinner, developed by Omaha's Carl A. Swanson.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nVarious Native American tribes had lived in the land that became Omaha, including since the 17th century, the Omaha and Ponca, Dhegian-Siouan-language people who had originated in the lower Ohio River valley and migrated west by the early 17th century; Pawnee, Otoe, Missouri, and Ioway. The word Omaha (actually Umo\u207fho\u207f or Uma\u207fha\u207f) means \"Dwellers on the bluff\".In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, including Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at a point about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabann\u00e9's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the monopoly of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park in the area in 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development.Through 26 separate treaties with the United States federal government, Native American tribes in Nebraska gradually ceded the lands that now make up the state. The treaty and cession involving the Omaha area occurred in 1854 when the Omaha Tribe ceded most of east-central Nebraska. Logan Fontenelle, an interpreter for the Omaha and signatory to the 1854 treaty, played an essential role in those proceedings.\n\n\n=== Pioneer Omaha ===\n\nBefore it was legal to claim land in Indian Country, William D. Brown operated the Lone Tree Ferry that brought settlers from Council Bluffs, Iowa to the area that became Omaha. Brown is generally credited as having the first vision for a city where Omaha now sits. The passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in 1854 was presaged by the staking out of claims around the area to become Omaha by residents from neighboring Council Bluffs. On July 4, 1854, the city was informally established at a picnic on Capital Hill, current site of Omaha Central High School. Soon after, the Omaha Claim Club was formed to provide vigilante justice for claim jumpers and others who infringed on the land of many of the city's founding fathers. Some of this land, which now wraps around Downtown Omaha, was later used to entice Nebraska Territorial legislators to an area called Scriptown. The Territorial capitol was in Omaha, but when Nebraska became a state in 1867, the capital was relocated to Lincoln, 53 miles (85 km) south-west of Omaha. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled against numerous landowners whose violent actions were condemned in Baker v. Morton.Many of Omaha's founding figures stayed at the Douglas House or the Cozzens House Hotel. Dodge Street was important early in the city's early commercial history; North 24th Street and South 24th Street also developed independently as business districts. Early pioneers were buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery and Cedar Hill Cemetery. Cedar Hill closed in the 1860s and its graves were moved to Prospect Hill, where pioneers were later joined by soldiers from Fort Omaha, African Americans and early European immigrants. There are several other historical cemeteries in Omaha, historical Jewish synagogues and historical Christian churches dating from the pioneer era, as well. Two sculpture parks, Pioneer Courage and Spirit of Nebraska's Wilderness and The Transcontinental Railroad, celebrate the city's pioneering history.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe economy of Omaha boomed and busted through its early years. In 1858, the Omaha Daily Republican was founded by the Omaha Printing Company (rebranded Aradius Group, 2016), it was Nebraska's first regional newspaper\u2013founded before Nebraska claimed statehood. Omaha was a stopping point for settlers and prospectors heading west, either overland or by the Missouri River. The steamboat Bertrand sank north of Omaha on its way to the goldfields in 1865. Its massive collection of artifacts is on display at the nearby Desoto National Wildlife Refuge. The jobbing and wholesaling district brought new jobs, followed by the railroads and the stockyards. Groundbreaking for the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1863, provided an essential developmental boom for the city. In 1862, the U.S. Congress allowed the Union Pacific Railroad to begin building westward railways; in January 1866 it commenced construction out of Omaha.The Union Stockyards, another important part of the city's development, were founded in South Omaha in 1883. Within 20 years, Omaha had four of the five major meatpacking companies in the United States. By the 1950s, half the city's workforce was employed in meatpacking and processing. Meatpacking, jobbing and railroads were responsible for most of the growth in the city from the late 19th century through the early decades of the 20th century.Immigrants soon created ethnic enclaves throughout the city, including Irish in Sheelytown in South Omaha; Germans in the Near North Side, joined by the European Jews and black migrants from the South; Little Italy and Little Bohemia in South Omaha. Beginning in the late 19th century, Omaha's upper class lived in posh enclaves throughout the city, including the south and north Gold Coast neighborhoods, Bemis Park, Kountze Place, Field Club and throughout Midtown Omaha. They traveled the city's sprawling park system on boulevards designed by renowned landscape architect Horace Cleveland. The Omaha Horse Railway first carried passengers throughout the city, as did the later Omaha Cable Tramway Company and several similar companies. In 1888, the Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company built the Douglas Street Bridge, the first pedestrian and wagon bridge between Omaha and Council Bluffs.Gambling, drinking and prostitution were widespread in the 19th century, first rampant in the city's Burnt District and later in the Sporting District. Controlled by Omaha's political boss Tom Dennison by 1890, criminal elements enjoyed support from Omaha's \"perpetual\" mayor, \"Cowboy Jim\" Dahlman, nicknamed for his eight terms as mayor.Calamities such as the Great Flood of 1881 did not slow down the city's violence. In 1882, the Camp Dump Strike pitted state militia against unionized strikers, drawing national attention to Omaha's labor troubles. The Governor of Nebraska had to call in U.S. Army troops from nearby Fort Omaha to protect strikebreakers for the Burlington Railroad, bringing along Gatling guns and a cannon for defense. When the event ended, one man was dead and several were wounded. In 1891, a mob hanged Joe Coe, an African-American porter after he was accused of raping a white girl. There were also several other riots and civil unrest events in Omaha during this period.\nIn 1898, Omaha's leaders, under the guidance of Gurdon Wattles, held the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, touted as a celebration of agricultural and industrial growth throughout the Midwest. The Indian Congress, which drew more than 500 American Indians from across the country, was held simultaneously. More than 2 million visitors attended these events at Kountze Park and the Omaha Driving Park in the Kountze Place neighborhood.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nWith dramatically increasing population in the 20th century, competition and fierce labor struggles led to major civil unrest. In 1900, Omaha was the center of a national uproar over the kidnapping of Edward Cudahy, Jr., the son of a local meatpacking magnate.The city's labor and management clashed in bitter strikes, racial tension escalated as Blacks were hired as strikebreakers, and ethnic strife broke out. A major riot by earlier immigrants in South Omaha destroyed the city's Greek Town in 1909, completely driving out the Greek population.The civil rights movement in Omaha has roots that extend back to 1912, when the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People west of the Mississippi River was founded in the city.The Omaha Easter Sunday Tornado of 1913 destroyed much of the city's African-American community, in addition to much of Midtown Omaha.Six years later, in 1919, the city was caught up in the Red Summer riots when thousands of whites marched from South Omaha to the courthouse to lynch a Black worker, Willy Brown, a suspect in an alleged rape of a white woman. The mob burned the Douglas County Courthouse to get the prisoner, causing more than $1 million damage. They hanged and shot Will Brown, then burned his body. Troops were called in from Fort Omaha to quell the riot, prevent more crowds gathering in South Omaha, and to protect the Black community in North Omaha.The culture of North Omaha thrived throughout the 1920s through 1950s, with several creative figures, including Tillie Olsen, Wallace Thurman, Lloyd Hunter, and Anna Mae Winburn emerging from the vibrant Near North Side.Musicians created their own world in Omaha, and also joined national bands and groups that toured and appeared in the city.\n\nAfter the tumultuous Great Depression of the 1930s, Omaha rebounded with the development of Offutt Air Force Base just south of the city. The Glenn L. Martin Company operated a factory there in the 1940s that produced 521 B-29 Superfortresses, including the Enola Gay and Bockscar used in the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.The construction of Interstates 80, 480 and 680, along with the North Omaha Freeway, spurred development. There was also controversy, particularly in North Omaha, where new routes bisected several neighborhoods. Creighton University hosted the DePorres Club, an early civil rights group whose use of sit-in strategies for integration of public facilities predated the national movement.Following the development of the Glenn L. Martin Company bomber manufacturing plant in Bellevue at the beginning of World War II, the relocation of the Strategic Air Command to the Omaha suburb in 1948 provided a major economic boost to the area.From the 1950s through the 1960s, more than 40 insurance companies were headquartered in Omaha, including Woodmen of the World and Mutual of Omaha. By the late 1960s, the city rivaled, but never surpassed, the United States insurance centers of Hartford, Connecticut, New York City and Boston.After surpassing Chicago in meat processing by the late 1950s, Omaha suffered the loss of 10,000 jobs as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. The city struggled for decades to shift its economy as workers suffered. Poverty became more entrenched among families who remained in North Omaha.\nIn the 1960s, three major race riots along North 24th Street destroyed the Near North Side's economic base, with recovery slow for decades. In 1969, Woodmen Tower was completed and became Omaha's tallest building and first major skyscraper at 478 feet (146 m), a sign of renewal.\n\nSince the 1970s, Omaha has continued expanding and growing, mostly to available land to the west. West Omaha has become home to the majority of the city's population. North and South Omaha's populations continue to be centers of new immigrants, with economic and racial diversity. In 1975 a major tornado, along with a major blizzard, caused more than $100 million in damages in 1975 dollars.Downtown Omaha has since been rejuvenated in numerous ways, starting with the development of Gene Leahy Mall and W. Dale Clark Library in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, Omaha's fruit warehouses were converted into a shopping area called the Old Market.\nThe demolition of Jobber's Canyon in 1989 led to the creation of the ConAgra Foods campus. Several nearby buildings, including the Nash Block, have been converted into condominiums. The stockyards were taken down; the only surviving building is the Livestock Exchange Building, which was converted to multi-use and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.A historic preservation movement in Omaha has led to a number of historic structures and districts being designated Omaha Landmarks or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of the push toward preservation came after Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the largest-ever National Register historic district in the United States, a record that still stands as of 2013. The Jobbers Canyon Historic District, along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city's historic district. The Jobber's Canyon warehouses had before then been allowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless population that had come to live in the abandoned buildings. At the time, there were no plans in place for revitalizing the buildings.In the 1980s and 1990s, Omaha also saw major company headquarters leave the city, including Enron, founded in the city in 1930 and taken to Houston in 1987 by the now-notorious Kenneth Lay. First Data Corporation, a large credit-card processor, also was founded in Omaha in 1969; as of 2009, its headquarters are in Atlanta.\nInacom, founded in Omaha in 1991, was a technology company that customized computer systems for large businesses, and was on the Fortune 500 list from 1997 until 2000, when it filed for bankruptcy. Northwestern Bell, the Bell System affiliate for Northwestern states, had its headquarters in Omaha from its founding in 1896 until it moved to Denver in 1991 as US West. Level 3 Communications, a large Tier 1 network provider, was founded in Omaha in 1985 as Kiewit Diversified Group, a division of Kiewit Corporation, a Fortune 500 construction and mining company still headquartered in Omaha; Level 3 moved to Denver in 1998. World Com was founded by a merger with Omaha's MFS Communications, started as Metropolitan Fiber Systems in 1993. MFS, backed by Kiewit Corporation CEO Walter Scott and Warren Buffett, purchased UUNET, one of the largest Internet backbones in the world, for $2 billion in 1996. The now-infamous Bernie Ebbers purchased the much larger MFS for $14.3 billion in 1997 under his World Com. He moved headquarters of the merged company from Omaha to Mississippi.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nAround the start of the 21st century, several new downtown skyscrapers and cultural institutions were built. One First National Center was completed in 2002, surpassing the Woodmen Tower as the tallest building in Omaha as well as in the state at 634 feet (193 m). The creation of the city's new North Downtown included the construction of the CenturyLink Center and the Slowdown/Film Streams development at North 14th and Webster Streets. Construction of the new TD Ameritrade Park began in 2009 and was completed in 2011, also in the North Downtown area, near the CenturyLink Center. TD Ameritrade Park is now the home of the College World Series, an event tourists flock to each year.\nNew construction has occurred throughout the city since the start of the 21st century. Important retail and office developments have occurred in West Omaha such as the Village Pointe shopping center and several business parks including First National Business Park and parks for Bank of the West and C&A Industries, Inc and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and several others. Downtown and Midtown Omaha have both seen the development of a significant number of condominiums in recent years. In Midtown Omaha significant mixed-use projects are underway. The site of the former Ak-Sar-Ben arena has been redeveloped into a mixed-use development Aksarben Village. In January 2009 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska announced plans to build a new 10 story, $98 million headquarters, in the Aksarben Village, completed in Spring 2011. Gordmans is also building their new corporate headquarters in Aksarben. The other major mixed-use development is Midtown Crossing at Turner Park. Developed by Mutual of Omaha, the development includes several condominium towers and retail businesses built around Omaha's Turner Park.The Holland Performing Arts Center opened in 2005 near the Gene Leahy Mall and the Union Pacific Center opened in 2004.\n\nThere have also been several developments along the Missouri River waterfront in downtown. The Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge was opened to foot and bicycle traffic on September 28, 2008. Started in 2003, RiverFront Place Condos first phase was completed in 2006 and is fully occupied and the second phase was opened in 2011. The development along Omaha's riverfront is attributed with prompting the City of Council Bluffs to move their own riverfront development time line forward.In the summers of 2008, 2012 and 2016 the United States Olympic Team swimming trials were held in Omaha, at the Qwest/Century Link Center. The event was a highlight in the city's sports community, as well as a showcase for redevelopment in the downtown area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nOmaha is located at 41\u00b015\u2032N 96\u00b00\u2032W. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 130.58 square miles (338.20 km2), of which 127.09 square miles (329.16 km2) is land and 3.49 square miles (9.04 km2) is water. Situated in the Midwestern United States on the bank of the Missouri River in eastern Nebraska, much of Omaha is built in the Missouri River Valley. Other significant bodies of water in the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area include Lake Manawa, Papillion Creek, Carter Lake, Platte River and the Glenn Cunningham Lake. The city's land has been altered considerably with substantial land grading throughout Downtown Omaha and scattered across the city. East Omaha sits on a flood plain west of the Missouri River. The area is the location of Carter Lake, an oxbow lake. The lake was once the site of East Omaha Island and Florence Lake, which dried up in the 1920s.\nThe Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area consists of eight counties; five in Nebraska and three in Iowa. The metropolitan area now includes Harrison, Pottawattamie, and Mills Counties in Iowa and Washington, Douglas, Sarpy, Cass, and Saunders Counties in Nebraska. This area was formerly referred to only as the Omaha Metropolitan Statistical Area and consisted of only five counties: Pottawattamie in Iowa, and Washington, Douglas, Cass, and Sarpy in Nebraska. The Omaha-Council Bluffs combined statistical area comprises the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan statistical area and the Fremont Micropolitan statistical area; the CSA has a population of 858,720 (2005 Census Bureau estimate). Omaha ranks as the 42nd-largest city in the United States, and is the core city of its 60th-largest metropolitan area. There are no consolidated city-counties in the area; the City of Omaha studied the possibility extensively through 2003 and concluded, \"The City of Omaha and Douglas County should merge into a municipal county, work to commence immediately, and that functional consolidations begin immediately in as many departments as possible, including but not limited to parks, fleet management, facilities management, local planning, purchasing and personnel.\"Geographically, Omaha is considered as being in the \"Heartland\" of the United States. Important environmental impacts on the natural habitat in the area include the spread of invasive plant species, restoring prairies and bur oak savanna habitats, and managing the whitetail deer population.Omaha is home to several hospitals, mostly along Dodge St (US6). Being the county seat, it is also the location of the county courthouse.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nOmaha is generally divided into six geographic areas: Downtown, Midtown, North Omaha, South Omaha, West Omaha, and East Omaha. West Omaha includes the Miracle Hills, Boys Town, Regency, and Gateway areas. The city has a wide range of historical and new neighborhoods and suburbs that reflect its socioeconomic diversity. Early neighborhood development happened in ethnic enclaves, including Little Italy, Little Bohemia, Little Mexico and Greek Town. According to U.S. Census data, five European ethnic enclaves existed in Omaha in 1880, expanding to nine in 1900.Around the start of the 20th century. the City of Omaha annexed several surrounding communities, including Florence, Dundee and Benson. At the same time, the city annexed all of South Omaha, including the Dahlman and Burlington Road neighborhoods. From its first annexation in 1857 (of East Omaha) to its recent and controversial annexation of Elkhorn, Omaha has continually had an eye towards growth.Starting in the 1950s, development of highways and new housing led to the movement of the middle class to suburbs in West Omaha. Some of the movement was designated as white flight from racial unrest in the 1960s. Newer and poorer migrants lived in older housing close to downtown; those residents who were more established moved west into newer housing. Some suburbs are gated communities or have become edge cities. Recently, Omahans have made strides to revitalize the downtown and Midtown areas with the redevelopment of the Old Market, Turner Park, Gifford Park, and the designation of the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District.\n\n\n=== Landmark preservation ===\n\nOmaha is home to dozens of nationally, regionally and locally significant landmarks. The city has more than a dozen historic districts, including Fort Omaha Historic District, Gold Coast Historic District, Omaha Quartermaster Depot Historic District, Field Club Historic District, Bemis Park Historic District, and the South Omaha Main Street Historic District. Omaha is notorious for its 1989 demolition of 24 buildings in the Jobbers Canyon Historic District, which represents to date the largest loss of buildings on the National Register. The only original building surviving of that complex is the Nash Block.\nOmaha has almost one hundred individual properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Bank of Florence, Holy Family Church, the Christian Specht Building and the Joslyn Castle. There are also three properties designated as National Historic Landmarks.Locally designated landmarks, including residential, commercial, religious, educational, agricultural and socially significant locations across the city, honor Omaha's cultural legacy and important history. The City of Omaha Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission is the government body that works with the mayor of Omaha and the Omaha City Council to protect historic places. Important history organizations in the community include the Douglas County Historical Society.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nOmaha, due to its latitude of 41.26\u02da N and location far from moderating bodies of water or mountain ranges, displays a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa). July averages 76.7 \u00b0F (24.8 \u00b0C), with average relative humidity around 70% which then leads to relatively frequent thunderstorms. Temperatures reach 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) on 29 days and 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) on 1.7 days annually. The January daily average is 23.5 \u00b0F (\u22124.7 \u00b0C), with lows reaching 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) on 11 days annually. The lowest temperature recorded in the city was \u221232 \u00b0F (\u221236 \u00b0C) on January 5, 1884, and the highest 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on July 25, 1936. Average yearly precipitation is 30.6 inches (777 mm), falling mostly in the warmer months. Snow is the most common precipitation in winter, with average seasonal snowfall being 28.7 inches (73 cm).\nBased on 30-year averages obtained from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center for the months of December, January and February, Weather Channel ranked Omaha the 5th coldest major U.S. city as of 2014.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 408,958 people, 162,627 households, and 96,477 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,217.9 inhabitants per square mile (1,242.4/km2). There were 177,518 housing units at an average density of 1,396.8 per square mile (539.3/km2). The city's racial makeup was 73.1% White, 13.7% African American, 0.8% Native American, 2.4% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 6.9% from other races, and 3.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 13.1% of the population. Non-Hispanic Whites were 68.0% of the population.There were 162,627 households, of which 31.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.6% were married couples living together, 13.7% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.9% had a male householder with no wife present, and 40.7% were non-families. 32.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.3% had someone living alone who was at least 65 years old. The average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 3.14.\nThe median age in the city was 33.5 years. 25.1% of residents were under the age of 18; 11.4% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 27.9% were from 25 to 44; 24.4% were from 45 to 64; and 11.4% were 65 years of age or older. The city's gender makeup was 49.2% male and 50.8% female.\nThe median household income (in 2017 dollars) from 2013-2017 was $53,789.\n\n\n=== 2000 census ===\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 390,007 people, 156,738 households, and 94,983 families residing within city limits. The population density was 3,370.7 people per square mile (1,301.5/km2). There were 165,731 housing units at an average density of 1,432.4 per square mile (553.1/km2). The city's racial makeup was 78.4% White, 13.3% African American, 0.7% Native American, 1.7% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.9% from other races, and 1.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.5% of the population.The city's median household income was $40,006, and the median family income was $50,821. Males had a median income of $34,301 versus $26,652 for females. The city's per capita income was $21,756. About 11.3% of the population and 7.8% of families were below the poverty line, including 15.6% of those under the age of 18 and 7.4% of those 65 and older.\n\n\n=== People ===\n\nNative Americans were the first residents of the Omaha area. The city of Omaha was established by white settlers from neighboring Council Bluffs who arrived from the Northeast United States a few years earlier. While much of the early population was of Yankee stock, over the next 100 years numerous ethnic groups moved to the city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Omaha's population as 96.4% White and 3.6% Black. Irish immigrants in Omaha originally moved to an area in present-day North Omaha called \"Gophertown\", as they lived in dug-out sod houses. That population was followed by Polish immigrants in the Sheelytown neighborhood, and many immigrants were recruited for jobs in South Omaha's stockyards and meatpacking industry. The German community in Omaha was largely responsible for founding its once-thriving beer industry, including the Metz, Krug, Falstaff and the Storz breweries.\nSince its founding, ethnic groups in the city have clustered in enclaves in north, south and downtown Omaha. In its early days, the sometimes lawless nature of a new frontier city included crime, such as illicit gambling and riots.\nIn the early 20th century, Jewish immigrants set up many businesses along the North 24th Street commercial area. It suffered with the loss of industrial jobs in the 1960s and later, the shifting of population west of the city. The commercial area is now the center of the African-Americans community, concentrated in North Omaha. The African American community has maintained its social and religious base, while it is experiencing an economic revitalization.\nThe Little Italy neighborhood grew south of downtown, as many Italian immigrants came to the city to work in the Union Pacific shops. Scandinavians first came to Omaha as Mormon settlers in the Florence neighborhood. Czechs had a strong political and cultural voice in Omaha, and were involved in a variety of trades and businesses, including banks, wholesale houses, and funeral homes. The Notre Dame Academy and Convent and Czechoslovak Museum are legacies of their residence. Today the legacy of the city's early European immigrant populations is evident in many social and cultural institutions in Downtown and South Omaha.\nMexicans originally immigrated to Omaha to work in the rail yards. Today they account for most of South Omaha's Hispanic population and many have taken jobs in meat processing. Other large early ethnic populations in Omaha included Danes, Poles, and Swedes.\nA growing number of African immigrants have made their homes in Omaha in the last twenty years. There are approximately 8,500 Sudanese living in Omaha, including the largest population of Sudanese refugees in the United States. Most have immigrated since 1995 because of warfare in Sudan. They represent ten ethnic groups, including the Nuer, Dinka, Equatorians, Maubans and Nubians. Most Sudanese people in Omaha speak the Nuer language. Other Africans have immigrated to Omaha as well, with one-third from Nigeria, and large populations from Kenya, Togo, Cameroon and Ghana.With the expansion of railroad and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many immigrants and migrants. As the major city in Nebraska, it has historically been more racially and ethnically diverse than the rest of the state. At times rapid population change, overcrowded housing and job competition have aroused racial and ethnic tensions. Around the start of the 20th century, violence towards new immigrants in Omaha often erupted out of suspicion and fear.In 1909, anti-Greek sentiment flared after increased Greek immigration, and worsened their tendency to become strikebreakers. The killing of a policeman of Irish descent enraged the Irish community; an angry mob violently stormed the Greek neighborhood in Omaha in what would become known as the Greek Town Riot. That mob violence forced the Greek immigrant population to flee from the city. By 1910, 53.7% of Omaha's residents and 64.2% of South Omaha's residents were foreign born or had at least one parent born outside of America.Six years after the Greek Town Riot, in 1915, a mob killed Juan Gonzalez, a Mexican immigrant, near Scribner, a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an Omaha Police Department officer investigated a criminal operation that sold goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. Racial profiling targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the Elkhorn River, where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. It was discovered Gonzalez was unarmed, and he had a reliable alibi for the time of the murder. No one was ever indicted for his killing.In the fall of 1919, following Red Summer, postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of African Americans as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching Willy Brown and the ensuing Omaha Race Riot. Trying to defend Brown, the city's mayor, Edward Parsons Smith, was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.Like other industrial cities in the U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in all, as the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area if they could get to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems.\nDespair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.\nWhites in Omaha have followed the white flight pattern, suburbanizing to West Omaha. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, gang violence and incidents between the Omaha Police and Black residents undermined relations between groups in North and South Omaha.\n\n\n==== Latinos in Omaha ====\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAccording to USA Today, Omaha ranks eighth among the nation's 50 largest cities in both per-capita billionaires and Fortune 500 companies.

A recent study found investment of $1 million in cultural tourism generated approximately $83,000 in state and local taxes, and provided support for hundreds of jobs for the metropolitan area, which in turn led to additional tax revenue for government.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nSeveral national newspapers, including the Boston Globe and The New York Times  have lauded Omaha's historical and cultural attractions.\nThe city is home to the Omaha Community Playhouse, the largest community theater in the United States.

The mayor is Jean Stothert, who was elected in May 2013, and re-elected May 10, 2017. The longest-serving mayor in Omaha's history was \"Cowboy\" Jim Dahlman, who served 20 years over eight terms. He was regarded as the \"wettest mayor in America\" because of the flourishing number of bars in Omaha during his tenure. Dahlman was a close associate of political boss Tom Dennison. During Dahlman's tenure, the city switched from its original strong-mayor form of government to a city commission government. In 1956, the city switched back.The city clerk is Elizabeth Butler. The City of Omaha administers twelve departments, including finance, police, human rights, libraries and planning.

The City of Omaha is considering consolidating with Douglas County government.Although registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the 2nd congressional district, which includes Omaha, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama opened three campaign offices in the city with 15 staff members to cover the state in fall 2008. Mike Fahey, the former Democratic mayor of Omaha, said he would do whatever it took to deliver the district's electoral vote to Obama; and the Obama campaign considered the district \"in play\". Former Nebraska U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and former Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama, and in November 2008 Obama won the district's electoral vote. This was an exceptional win, because with Nebraska's split electoral vote system Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win an electoral vote in Nebraska since 1964.In 2011, Nebraska lawmakers moved Offutt Air Force Base and the town of Bellevue \u2014 an area with a large minority population \u2014 out of the Omaha-based 2nd District and shifted in the Republican-heavy Omaha suburbs in Sarpy County. The move is expected to dilute the city's urban Democratic vote.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nOmaha's rate of violent crimes per 100,000 residents has been lower than the average rates of three dozen United States cities of similar size. Unlike Omaha, those cities have experienced an increase in violent crime overall since 2003. Rates for property crime have decreased for both Omaha and its peer cities during the same time period. In 2006, Omaha was ranked for homicides as 46th out of the 72 cities in the United States of more than 250,000 in population.As a major industrial city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions that came with rapid growth and the arrival of large numbers of immigrants and migrants. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.Gambling in Omaha has been an important part of the city's history. From its founding in the 1850s through the 1930s, the city was known as a \"wide-open\" town where gambling of all sorts was openly accepted. By the 1950s, at the same time large-scale restructuring of the railroads, the meatpacking industry and other sectors caused widespread job losses and unemployment, Omaha reportedly had more illicit gambling than any other city in the nation. From the 1930s through the 1970s, an Italian criminal element controlled gambling in the city.Today, gambling in Omaha is limited to keno, lotteries, and parimutuel betting. This leaves Omahans to drive across the Missouri River to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where casinos are legal and many businesses operate.

By the middle of the 20th century, nearly every major railroad served Omaha.\nToday, the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District celebrates this connection, along with the listing of the Burlington Train Station and the Union Station on the National Register of Historic Places. First housed in the former Herndon House, the Union Pacific Railroad's corporate headquarters have been in Omaha since the company began.

        "wiki": "This is a list of parks in Omaha, Nebraska. It includes cemeteries and golf courses. Most parks in Omaha are governed by the City of Omaha Parks and Recreation Department.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1854 Alfred D. Jones drew four parks on the original map of Omaha City. They were called Jefferson Square, which was paved over by I-480; Washington Park, which is where the Paxton Block currently sits at North 16th and Farnam Streets; Capitol Square, where Omaha Central High School is now located, and; an unnamed tract overlooking the river with Davenport Street on the north, Jackson Street on the south, North 8th on the east and North 9th Street on the west. Jefferson Square lasted until 1969, when it was razed to make way for a new interstate in downtown Omaha. The riverfront from the interstate south to the headquarters of ConAgra Foods is now the Heartland of America Park.\nHanscom Park became Omaha's first park. Miller, Fontenelle, Elmwood and Riverview were Omaha's largest parks in 1920. (Riverview Park Zoo eventually became Henry Doorly Zoo.) Levi Carter Park was its largest, at 220 acres (0.89 km2). Other parks in the system that year were Bemis, Deer, Kountze Park, Curtis Turner, Harold Gifford, Mercer, Jefferson Square, Hixenbaugh, Burt playground, Bluff View, Spring Lake, Highland, McKinley, Clear View and Morton.Omaha's boulevard system was designed to be part of the parks system in 1889 by renowned landscape architect Horace Cleveland. The Omaha Park and Boulevard System was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe Department of Parks, Recreation, and Public Property is the City of Omaha's agency responsible for administering public parks.\n\n\n== Current parks ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of cemeteries in Omaha\nCulture in Omaha\nSports in Omaha\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParks in Omaha \u2013 info about parks and public places in Omaha",

        "wiki": "The Old Market is a neighborhood located in downtown Omaha, Nebraska, United States, and is bordered by South 10th Street to the east, 13th Street to the west, Farnam Street to the north and Jackson Street to the South. The neighborhood has many restaurants, art galleries and upscale shopping. The area retains its brick paved streets from the turn of the century, horse-drawn carriages, and covered sidewalks in some areas. It is not uncommon to see a variety of street performers, artists, and other vendors.\n\n\n== Historic designation ==\nThe area is on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, and borders the former site of the Jobbers Canyon Historic District, as well as the still-existent Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District and the Warehouses in Omaha MPS. There is a walking tour of historic buildings available from the Omaha Chamber of Commerce. There are also several specifically noted historic buildings within the district.\n\u2192\n\n\n== Historic buildings ==\nBuildings within the Old Market have served a variety of purposes, and were built during various eras. Originally built to sell groceries wholesale and retail to the city of Omaha and beyond, the Old Market district was preceded by the Market House in Omaha's Jefferson Square.\nThe Old Market district was started being built when the Market House still stood. They included:\nP. E. Iler Block, a contributing property to the district. Built in 1901, the six story building was originally built as a warehouse. A 1990 rehabilitation converted the building into retail and office space.The Windsor Hotel is a three-story brick building built in 1885. The building was converted into rental residential and commercial space, in 1985. The Broatch Building was built in 1880, and expanded in 1887.The McClure-Smith Building is a two-story brick building that was built around 1878. Originally a steam bakery, a 1985 rehabilitation converted the building to office and retail space.The A. I. Root Building is a three-story brick building constructed, in 1904, as offices. The building was doubled in size by the addition of an equal-size portion, in 1909. In 1993, it was converted to retail and residential spaces.The Morse-Coe Shoe Company, now known as the Mayfield Apartments, was built as a five-story warehouse and light industrial building, in 1894. A 2002 rehabilitation converted the structure to a mixed-use of apartments, retail space and parking. The George H. Lee Building was built, in 1903, as warehouse and office space.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nMost of the buildings in the Old Market are brick, and the streets throughout are covered with bricked surfaces, cobblestone and asphalt. There were also cast-iron fronts, metal cornices, stone trim, and metal sidewalk coverings shelters attached to many of the buildings around the turn of the 20th century.\n\n\n=== Building details ===\n\n\n== Redevelopment ==\nConAgra Foods relocated their headquarters to neighbor the Old Market in 1991, after a contentious battle with local advocates after the City of Omaha demolished the Jobbers Canyon Historic District.\n\n\n== 2016 Old Market explosion ==\nOn January 9, 2016, at 2:51 pm local time, a large explosion occurred at M's Pub on the northwest corner of 11th and Howard streets causing a large fire to break out. The fire and subsequent efforts to extinguish it caused a total loss of the 100-year-old building as firefighters worked through the night and following morning. Temperatures at the time were in the sub-zero range causing large-scale freezing of the water from the fire fighting efforts. The explosion is believed to have been caused by a gas line that was accidentally ruptured by contractors on behalf of Verizon installing fiber-optic cables. Although several people were injured during the explosion, there were no fatalities. Eyewitnesses reported injuries sustained by multiple people within the immediate vicinity of the explosion, although these were not broadcast  by local media outlets.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website for the Old Market in Omaha\nThe Omaha Old Market Online\nThe Omaha Old Market Online",

          "We came into town on a Sunday so not everything was open (and it is COVID) but we still had a great time walking around, drinking and eating. This place would be a blast next summer when COVID is over and on a Friday or Saturday when everything is open. There are so many shops,",
          "This piece of downtown is an absolute gem. I was walking around wondering where all the cute shops might be hidden, but I was in the business district. I meandered down here and was immediately dazzled. There is so much to do! Plan to spend the afternoon down there again today!",

          "I wanted an old market place to walk through artsy places with good food so we went there, but the sidewalks were very dirty. Not a fun place to walk. Looking for something kept up a little better. It has potential, but needs a bath. Cigarette butts, litter, and just dirt",

          "We enjoyed walking around the Old Market area. There are lots of restaurants and bars. I was disappointed that there weren't more shops in the area though. There are several antique shops which seem more like junk stores, with a large variety of stuff. From empty, old beer cans",
          "Loved the Old Market area on our recent trip to Omaha. Lots of restaurants and shops all close to on another. We were there on a Monday evening in late August with family. Enjoyed the atmosphere and quaint feeling. Highly recommend. I wish we had spent more time here.",

          "I live the Ild Market! Love the many great restaurants, the horse and carriage rides, the rental bikes and scooters, the unique ice cream shops, and the general artsy vibe. There are lots of great things to do here if you're a window shopper, a beer drinker, a fine dining lover,",

          "Great food and great beer. It's a great place to eat and it's really a wonderful building. My husband had the put roast which he loved and I had the steak tip Stroganoff which was really great.",
          "Visiting the Old Market village was like a step back in time. The streets were all paved with cobblestone. You can eat, visit shops, take a carriage ride, plus much more. A must stop to do.",
          "This is written from someone who\u2019s lived in Omaha, but hasn\u2019t been back for a few years. Old Town still has charm, but I was surprised to see so many shops closed, and begging on the streets. The riverfront park in downtown Omaha is under construction and there just wasn\u2019t the",

          "Fun place to hang out> Many restaurants, bars and places to walk and browse. Nice patio areas to sit outside too",
          "A few more venues would help all the existing facilities in the area. Mostly bars and run of the mill average food! Even the locals are tired of it and the new restaurants and bars closer to the baseball field have HUGELY hurt businesses in the area. There are absolutely no",
          "We enjoyed walking around even though it was very hot days. The stores were interesting, quite a variety of things to see. Art, food places, Fairmont antique/candy store was amazing - it took me back to my grandparents days and when I was little. Only on Saturdays they close",
          "Very cool historic market area in the middle of Omaha. The market consists of a few blocks of nice little shops, bars, restaurants and art galleries in a very historic area. Parking van be a little difficult on weekend but if you're patient, you'll eventually find a spot. It's",
          "Not much changes from visit to visit. Though I've lived in Omaha for 35 years I only visit a couple times a year as I'm not a drinker or late night party person. There are a couple of events like the arts festival that are fun. Also, the farmer's market is worth a walk",
          "This is a fun, family friendly downtown area. There are lots of shops to wander through, but many empty storefronts also. There are lots of great restaurants to choose from. Some areas seemed more run down, but still lots of options. There is a retro candy store/ Mercantile",
          "This was a highlight of our trip to Omaha. We love getting into the local scene instead of touristy stuff and this fit the bill. Tons of unique shops and restaurants/bars. We would definitely go back if ever in Omaha again.",
          "Went to eat and tried the scooters for fiance's birthday. It is not posted that you cannot ride the scooters on the sidewalk and then we got picked out of a lot of people and given a ticket that goes on our driving record. It was a trap and the cops even felt bad that they had",
          "I love a good downtown area, however this experience was a bit of a let down. They had a few good restaurants. The sidewalks were a disaster, I spent more time tripping than walking. Everything was tired and old, I would definitely not bring children here. If you are looking to",
          "Enjoy shopping in old market. The restaurants are fantastic. Went to a nearby nail salon and they did a great job on my manicure and pedicure. Visited a couple restaurants while I was there and had great meals. Would definitely recommend.",
          "We liked this area a lot, it had a lot of good resturants to chose from, and shoping which we were not as interested in. The resturants were mostly in old revamped buildings with a lot offering outside seating, which we like.",
          "We came to the Old Market area to see unique shops while in the area. I would say a majority of the businesses are food and/or bars. It\u2019s a neat area to walk around in but don\u2019t allot a large amount of time to it. Lots of dining options, a couple candy/ice cream shops, and a few",
          "Old market is a perfect place to spend a few hours one evening. Eclectic shops, all sorts of dining options and outstanding ice cream to finish it off.",
          "Upscale chic stores occupy the buildings of the old market which is around 9 square blocks. The buildings are great. They are lined by wide covered sidewalks that make strolling them very pleasant even in the worst weather. The cobblestone streets around these buildings",
          "Nice to see the old buildings and imagine the wholesale activities that would have taken place a century ago. Pretty good variety of food but higher price than I felt justified.",
          "If you can't find what you're looking for in Old Market, it probably isn't in Omaha. We found candy shops, ice cream, restaurants, drinks, coffee, antiques and general shopping here for several days. Breweries, a wine tasting room, tequila and most everything else. I loved this",
          "The Old Market doesn't skimp on flowers and atmosphere. Many people of all ages were enjoying being there. I didn't walk the whole area as I chose the Durham Museum for most of my time. Being with others would make the market district more fun.",
          "Good food, but the area itself is unremarkable compared to similar districts in Dallas, San Diego, or Kansas City. It's an area with some niche shops and good restaurants, but didn't have much of a vibe to it (at least the day I was there)",
          "I was looking for an independent bookstore called Our Bookstore. It wasn\u2019t easy to find because the area has lots of little walkways and uses alleys well. I enjoyed mooching around.",
          "This is about a four block by four block area of old brick buildings from the late 1800s that have been converted into residential lofts, restaurants of all types and price points, and stores from clothing to vintage items of all kinds. It\u2019s a great walk around and great people",
          "Omaha\u2019s downtown Old Market is a vibrant and active downtown with tons of eateries and shops. The sidewalks however are tripping hazards.",
          "Love the shops! Lots to do!! Definitely worth grabbing a meal and hanging out there when visiting Omaha.",
          "We had ice cream at Ted & Wallys, visited the Dolci ice cream store and the candy store :) We also took a carriage ride for my twin daughters 13th bday!",
          "We stopped in the Old Market on the way to the airport and found a great restaurant to have lunch (Upstream Brewing Company). We walked around for about 20 minutes looking around but didn't have much time after lunch to get to the airport. Would have liked to look into some of",
          "Plenty of places to eat. Places to get dessert if you like. Check them out as I did and it was worth it.",
          "Old market was a cute area just thought it was gonna be bigger.... the best was Ted and Wallys ice cream... they have cute shops and plenty of options for eating... also a market on sat but it's over around lunch so don't wait to late, we only caught 10mins of it and it was so",
          "Loved the old market in omaha! This place has lots of things to do and see and especially the candy shop they have! If you have a sweet tooth then that is the place to go! All kinds of shops for everything you are looking for!",
          "There are probably more places to eat than to shop or see as an attraction/thing to do in the Old Market. I think Ted and Wallys ,if you are looking for ice cream, and Fairmont Mercantile, for antique/novelty shopping, are both a must if you have interest in either or both.",
          "Traveled our way here and was met first by the farmer's market. Bonus! Lots of variety, lots of hidden gems. There are directories around to help you navigate. We spent just over 3 hours here and only got through about a 1/4 of the total market area. Most shopkeepers were",
          "In town for college World Series. Had a blast shopping here. Wonderful shops!! Outside seating at the restaurants was fun to watch the people",

          "Quaint area. Cobblestone streets. Lots to do. Tough to find parking...but worth it. Very fun experience. My kids were amazed at the \u201cold buildings\u201d and the \u201cbrick road\u201d it was a lot of walking and so worth it. I think it would be fun to visit around Christmas to see how they",
          "My wife and I stopped at the Scooters after a morning run near the river. It was pretty nice and quiet as most folks weren\u2019t on the move yet. Not a lot of activity here on a Sunday morning which was just fine with us.",
          "While parking can be a challenge, there are lots of fun things to do here and you will have a great time and experience! Lots of great restaurants and fun shops that stay open later!",
          "Not only are there great shops, restaurants & architecture, but the Saturday farmer's market is top notch - Not to miss!",
          "We went Saturday morning to the Farmer's Market and it was a beautiful day for it! Many different vendors, lots of produce (LOTS of dogs!)- a bit congested but not terrible. After that we ate brunch at Stokes Grill and Bar, sitting outside. Again, beautiful day and fun to watch",

          "I\u2019ve been to this area each time I\u2019ve been in Omaha. I love it. The restaurants are plentiful as are the great little shops. My favorite restaurant is Plank Seafood and Provisions. The food there is amazing as is the service. I highly recommend the area.",
          "I was looking forward to visiting the area but with all the rain during our visit, it was not a good rainy day location.",
          "Once you find a parking spot, Old Market is a great place to eat, shop, walk and just hang out. They've managed to keep the same intimacy and charm for many years.",
          "Was passing through Omaha and looking to kill some time. Came around 11 on a Sunday morning and a majority of businesses were still closed. Fortunately, the businesses that were open were all so kind and friendly. Would recommend to anyone looking to shop in Omaha!",
          "When in town do go and visit this area as it has been completely renovated and is a good mix of shops and food. Furthermore there is the farmer\u2019s market in the morning if you\u2019re interested. In short it\u2019s worthwhile",
          "Great area for weekend, day-time or night-time activities. Excellent ships, some of the best restaurants in the US and great bars also.",

          "This is a great place to walk around and find great new stuff and reminisce on old stuff as well. So many great shops in the Old Market to find adventure, laughs and maybe even the perfect gem!",
          "I love the Old Market shops, galleries, restaurants and bars, but the streets and sidewalks need a good cleaning. It has been that way for years and isn\u2019t getting better. Bring a fire truck over and hose it down before the annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting and do this once a",
          "That\u2019s my opinion to go at night to see beautiful lights but go there around 3 pm on weekend since parking lot always full. You guys can walk to check all the stores and can ride the horse carriage or rent bicycles \ud83d\udeb2 or open bar with bicycle to ride with 6 people. It\u2019s",
          "Lots of shops and restaurants as well as street music and entertainment. I saw carriage rides too. Great place to people watch. Probably 1-2 hrs or 3-4 if you eat too.",

          "To me this is the most interesting area in Omaha. Small cafes, bars, etc. in old historic buildings. Not all the offerings are great but worth walking around to get a feel of the old industrial market area.",
          "The Old Market is somewhat overrated. There are very few shops here, so it is mostly restaurants. If that's all you want, that's fine. But to me, an old market implies a lot more.",
          "I want to start this review by thanking the Mercer family who put millions and millions of investment dollars into saving this historical downtown Omaha restaurant and shopping district. In the 1960s, Omaha\u2019s downtown was declining as large shopping centers were moving to the",

        "wiki": "The American television sitcom The Big Bang Theory, created and executive produced by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007, while the American comedy spin-off prequel television series Young Sheldon, created and executive produced by Lorre alongside Jim Parsons and Steven Molaro, premiered on CBS on September 25, 2017.\nThe Big Bang Theory initially centers on five characters: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, two Caltech physicists; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who at the beginning of the program's narrative lives across the hall, later weds Leonard, moves in with him and becomes a pharmaceutical representative, and Leonard and Sheldon's friends and co-workers aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz, and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali.\n\nOver time, several supporting characters have been introduced and promoted to starring roles, including coworker and romantic partner of Leonard Leslie Winkle, Sheldon's wife Amy Farrah Fowler, Howard's wife Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz, comic book store proprietor and friend of the other characters Stuart Bloom, and Emily Sweeney (though the Emily character was introduced as a girlfriend for Raj and when those characters broke up Emily no longer appeared). The series also features numerous supporting characters, each of whom plays a prominent role in a story arc. Included among them are parents of the main characters, their dates and their coworkers. Celebrities such as Stephen Hawking appear in cameo roles as themselves.\nYoung Sheldon initially centers on title character and child prodigy Sheldon Cooper at the age of nine, going to high school and living with his family in the fictional town of Medford, East Texas: Sheldon's mother Mary, his father and the head football coach at Medford High, George Sr., his twin sister Missy, his older brother George Jr., and his grandmother Constance \"Connie\" Tucker, also known as \"MeeMaw\". The series also features numerous supporting characters, each of whom plays a prominent role in a story arc. Included among them are Sheldon's present and former classmates, their dates and coworkers, and those of his family. Celebrities such as Elon Musk appear in cameo roles as themselves. Jim Parsons, who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, narrates the series and serves as an executive producer.\n\n\n== Main characters ==\n\n\n=== Cast table ===\n\n\n=== The Big Bang Theory main characters ===\n\n\n==== Leonard ====\n\nLeonard Leakey Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki) is an experimental physicist with an IQ of 173. Originally from New Jersey, he received his PhD at age 24, spending at least some of his time at Princeton University. He shared an apartment in Pasadena with colleague and friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper until season 9. Unlike his equally geeky friends, Leonard is interested and adept in building relationships with other people. Compared to his friends, he is relatively successful with women.\nThe writers have toyed with a romance between him and next-door neighbor Penny since the series premiere, with their unresolved sexual tension being a major force for drama. Leonard dated Penny for most of season three. Following his break-up with Penny, Leonard began a relationship with Raj's sister Priya in season four. The two attempted a long-distance relationship after Priya moved back to India, but Leonard broke up with her in season five after she admitted to cheating on him. In season five's \"The Recombination Hypothesis\", Leonard and Penny start dating again.\nIn season six's \"The 43 Peculiarity\", Penny tells him she loves him for the first time. Over the next two years, they talk about marriage and each have unsuccessful proposals until the penultimate episode of season seven, when they become engaged. They get married in the ninth-season premiere, followed by a wedding redo for their friends and families since the couple had eloped. In the series finale \"The Stockholm Syndrome\", it is revealed that they are expecting their first child.\nLeonard's family includes other accomplished scientists: his mother, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, is a neuroscientist and world-renowned psychiatrist, his sister is a medical researcher, and his father, Dr. Alfred Hofstadter, is an anthropologist. Also, his brother Michael is a Harvard law professor.\n\n\n==== Sheldon ====\n\nSheldon Lee Cooper (Jim Parsons) is a theoretical physicist, possessing a BS, MS, PhD, Sc.D., and an IQ of 187. Born in East Texas, he was a child prodigy, and received his PhD at age 16 from Caltech. He is often cold, self-centered, condescending, and immature, but is not intentionally hurtful: his conduct is generally well-intentioned, but poorly judged. He has a softer side, as he does care about his friends, and loves his family and wife Amy Farrah Fowler, though he often insults them either about their intellect levels or different opinions. In seasons 1\u20139, he shares an apartment in Pasadena with friend and fellow physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\nHe has a deep love and interest for science fiction and comic books, to the point of an obsession, and shows particular affinity for Spock from the Star Trek franchise. He refrains from any form of physical contact and exhibits a strict adherence to routines to the point of exhibiting signs of obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder. Any disruption to routines distresses him enormously. A running gag has him always knocking on doors in a pattern of three knocks and one call repeated three times. In the interests of making life run on rational and predictable lines, he requires Leonard to sign a legalistic and exhaustive \"Roommate Agreement\", and later imposes a similar \"Relationship Agreement\" on Amy.\nSheldon has trouble in social settings. His commitment to his friends is often called into question, as he is known for being constantly and consistently, if unintentionally, condescending and rude. He also has difficulties lying or keeping a secret, giving himself away with wild facial tics and implausible statements. He is, however, fond of occasionally telling a joke or playing a prank, which he typically punctuates with his trademark exclamation \"Bazinga!\" He has a superiority complex and makes no effort to hide his contempt for other people's lower intellects, often making highly inappropriate comments.\nSheldon meets Amy Farrah Fowler in the third-season finale and starts a slowly evolving relationship with her. In the tenth season, the two move in together for a five-week experiment to test their compatibility and later decide to make the arrangement permanent. At the end of that same season, admirer Ramona Nowitzki makes a romantic overture to Sheldon, prompting him to propose to Amy. In the finale of season eleven, Sheldon and Amy get married. In the series finale, Sheldon and Amy jointly share the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on Super-Asymmetry.\n\n\n==== Penny ====\n\nPenny (Kaley Cuoco), is Leonard and Sheldon's neighbor across the hallway. Originally from a small town outside Omaha, Nebraska, she was a waitress and occasional bartender at the local Cheesecake Factory until season seven, and is an aspiring actress. According to Sheldon, she is a \"good-natured simpleton\". She is kind-hearted, outgoing, and does display the most common sense out of all the original five main characters. She also appears to be the most street-smart. Her lack of educational qualifications (she dropped out of community college) are a constant source of disparaging comments from Sheldon.\nShe has dated several men during the course of the series, including Kurt, Stuart, and Zack, but her recurring romantic interest is Leonard. Leonard pursued Penny during season one and they dated briefly at the start of season two, which led to some awkwardness. They began dating again and were a couple for most of season three, but she ended the relationship after he told her he loved her and she was not ready to reciprocate. Penny and Leonard begin to date again during the fifth season. After several unsuccessful proposals from both sides, Penny realizes that her happiness is derived from her relationship with Leonard and they become engaged and later elope, upsetting their friends and families and leading to a wedding redo with their friends and families present. In the series finale \"The Stockholm Syndrome\", it is revealed that Penny is pregnant with her and Leonard's first child. She has a tense relationship with Sheldon, whose nerdy and obstinate personality often exasperates her, but they are ultimately good friends, helping each other in various situations. By season four, Penny also begins to socialize more with Bernadette and Amy, who frequently visit Penny's apartment, go out together, and comfort each other.\nAt the start of season eight, Penny pursues a career in pharmaceuticals and interviews for a job at Bernadette's workplace. She gets the job, and gradually becomes more independent, including earning a higher salary than Leonard. She reveals in season nine that she is not happy with her job, but insists on keeping it to help her eliminate her former credit card debts and secure a good financial future. In season 10, Leonard and Penny are finally living alone in apartment 4A after Sheldon moves in with Amy. In the series finale \"The Stockholm Syndrome\", it is revealed that they are expecting their first child. \nInitially, not much is known about Penny's family, but it is mentioned in the series that her father, Wyatt (portrayed by Keith Carradine,) raised her like a boy, her mother smoked marijuana while she was pregnant with her, her sister shot her husband while they were intoxicated, and her brother is a meth dealer. Her mother, Susan (Katey Sagal), and brother, Randall (Jack McBrayer), are finally seen in the first episode of season ten. Her family's last name is never revealed during the series.\n\n\n==== Howard ====\n\nHoward Joel Wolowitz, M.Eng. (Simon Helberg) is an aerospace engineer at Caltech's Department of Applied Physics, who often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment. Unlike Sheldon, Leonard, and Raj, Howard does not have a doctorate, and often gets disparaged as a result, especially by Sheldon. He defends this by pointing out that he has a master's degree in Engineering from MIT and that the equipment he designs is launched into space, unlike the theoretical work of his friends. In the fifth-season finale, Howard goes to the International Space Station on Expedition 31.\nHoward lives in Altadena with his domineering, belittling, and unseen mother, who treats him like a child. While he sometimes expresses irritation at this treatment, for the most part, he appears to prefer it. Howard dotes on his mother and participates in many of her daily routines. A recurring gimmick in the series is Howard and his mother communicating with each other from different rooms by yelling, a habit which Bernadette also adopts in later episodes. His father left them when he was 11, and Howard gets visibly distressed when the subject comes up. Howard fancies himself a ladies' man and attempts pick-up lines whenever a woman is present, although he drops this habit once he starts going out with Bernadette. He is Jewish, but is not serious about his faith, and does not keep kosher. However, he does observe the Sabbath and the Jewish holidays.\nIn the pilot episode, he speaks English, French, Mandarin, Russian, Arabic, and Persian, along with fictional languages like Klingon and Sindarin. Howard suffers from asthma, transient idiopathic arrhythmia, allergies to peanuts, almonds, and walnuts, and is prone to canker sores and pink eye. Howard dated Bernadette briefly in season three. After some difficulties, they resumed their relationship in season four, which culminated in their engagement. In the fifth-season finale, Howard and Bernadette are married on the roof of the apartment building shortly before he has to leave for Kazakhstan, where he is to be sent to the International Space Station. In season six, he finally leaves his mother's house and moves into Bernadette's apartment. In the episode \"The Comic Book Store Regeneration\", Howard's mother passes away in her sleep while in Florida, prompting him to move back into his home with Bernadette. Stuart, the owner of the guys' favorite comic book store, also moves in.\nUpon learning that Bernadette is pregnant in season nine, Howard panics about handling the impending baby, particularly earning enough money. With the help of his friends, he designs a new form of guidance system that attracts the attention of the Air Force. In \"The Birthday Synchronicity\", Bernadette gives birth to a girl named Halley, on Amy's birthday, who screams like Howard's late mother, Debbie Wolowitz.\nIn season 11, Howard learns that Bernadette is pregnant again and later in the same season in \"The Neonatal Nomenclature\", Bernadette gives birth to a boy named Neil Michael Wolowitz.\n\n\n==== Raj ====\n\nRajesh Ramayan Koothrappali, PhD (Kunal Nayyar) is Howard Wolowitz's best friend and another genius of the group. His name is usually shortened to \"Raj\". He is from New Delhi, India, and works in the physics department at Caltech, where his area of expertise is astroparticle physics. He lives in an apartment in Pasadena. As with his friends, he is mutually involved with and obsessed with science fiction and comic books in general. He is also a fan of Harry Potter and Indian music, but appreciates the Indian lullabies his mother sang and the catchiness of Hindi phrases. Raj is a Hindu and believes in karma (reincarnation), but eats beef. He is very shy around women outside of his family, and during the first six seasons of the show, found himself unable to speak to women while in their presence unless he drank alcoholic beverages, or believed he had done so. When Penny, Amy, and Bernadette were around, Raj usually whispered what he wanted to say to Howard or Leonard, who then repeated or responded to what Raj said aloud. Despite this, Raj has sometimes ended up in bed with women, leaving the other characters perplexed.Unlike his friends, Raj has many feminine interests, such as reading Archie comics and Twilight and watching chick flicks such as Bridget Jones's Diary. A recurring joke in the series has people, including his parents and Leonard's mother, speculating that Raj might be gay due to his feminine interests and his close friendship with Howard, with whom he has arguments similar to those of a married couple. However, Raj has always stated that he is straight, but metrosexual. He had an infatuation with Penny, and secretly wrote love poems about Bernadette. Raj comes from a very wealthy family in India, and often communicates with his parents, Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, via webcam. He has a younger sister, Priya.\nIn season six, Raj started seeing a shy and sweet woman named Lucy, who had many things in common with Raj. However, she feels too pressured when he asks her to meet his friends and breaks up with him. As of season seven, he no longer requires alcohol, drugs, or medication to speak in front of women. In season seven, Raj starts dating Emily Sweeney, a dermatologist, and their relationship becomes exclusive at the end of the seventh season. In the ninth season, he meets a bartender/scriptwriter and dates her along with Emily. However, in season ten, he mentions he is currently single. After his parents divorced, Raj's father ended his financial support and he was forced to move into Leonard and Penny's apartment. Due to friction between them, Raj moved into an apartment over Bert's garage. After starting to live on his own and learning to manage his own finances, Raj has finally started to work at the Observatory where his expertise is more highlighted. In the final season, Raj's father arranges a marriage for him with an Indian hotel concierge named Anu. They breakup when she take a job in London.\n\n\n==== Leslie Winkle ====\n\nLeslie Winkle, PhD (Sara Gilbert) is an experimental physicist who works in the same lab as Leonard. In appearance, she is essentially Leonard's female counterpart, equipped with the black-framed glasses and sweat jackets. She also has a lazy eye. Leslie had casual sexual relationships with both Leonard and Howard, considering it a completely physical reaction to her body's cycles. She is one of Sheldon's arch-enemies, due to their conflicting scientific theories.\nSara Gilbert made her first appearance in the third episode of season one and her final appearance as a regular in the third-season finale. Entertainment Weekly reported in January 2009 that she had been downgraded from starring status to recurring because the producers of the series were unable to come up with new storylines for the character. She returned for a guest role in the 200th episode, \"The Celebration Experimentation\", in season nine, with her character talking briefly about how she and Sheldon have changed over the years and affectionately calls him \"dumbass\" again at Sheldon's insistence (due to his dislike for change).\n\n\n==== Bernadette ====\n\nBernadette Maryann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz, PhD (Melissa Rauch) is originally a waitress and co-worker of Penny's at The Cheesecake Factory, using her wages to pay for her graduate studies in microbiology. She is a smart, short-tempered, ruthless, and often competitive young woman who sometimes displays a sweet, nice, and friendly personality. Despite her squeaky voice, she has a darker side. A recurring joke in the series references Bernadette and her lab team handling dangerous or infectious specimens, leading to accidental byproducts or exposure to diseases, in some cases resulting in Bernadette being quarantined.\nBernadette is of Polish origin and Catholic upbringing, and was originally seen wearing a cross necklace. She frequently manipulates people, often pretending to be a friendly and good-natured individual, quickly making friends with Penny and Amy, as well as the rest of the gang. Despite her short stature, she is regarded as being somewhat intimidating, largely because of her sharp tongue, aggressive demeanor, and occasional signs of mania. In season eight's \"The Locomotion Interruption\", Penny interviews for a pharmaceutical sales representative position with Bernadette's boss, and secures it because she concurs with his opinion that Bernadette is kind of a bully and that they are slightly terrified of her.\nPenny first introduced Bernadette to Howard on Leonard's request. During their first date, Bernadette and Howard do not find any common field of interest until they discover that they both have domineering mothers. After their third date, Bernadette declares that three dates is the threshold for deciding whether they want a long-term relationship. Blindsided, Howard hesitates initially, causing a temporary rift between them, but then impulsively proposes marriage to show her that he does care about her. Frustrated, she declines, but when he sings a heartfelt song for her at the Cheesecake Factory, she declares that it is the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for her and their relationship continues. A lengthy offscreen breakup occurs when she catches Howard engaging in cybersex, but Howard apologizes and their relationship resumes.\nIn her initial appearances in the third season, Bernadette does not use her high-pitched speaking voice and is portrayed as almost a dim-witted blonde by taking things literally and not understanding even the simplest of ideas. She mentions this fact in season four's \"The Alien Parasite Hypothesis\", where she says she is much smarter than Howard, but in order to protect his manhood, she acted dumber.\n\nIn the fourth season finale, she obtains her doctorate and is subsequently hired by a pharmaceutical company (Zangen) that offers her a high salary. While preparing for their wedding in the fifth season, Bernadette is shocked and repulsed when she learns about Howard's past sexual escapades, although once again, an apology and reconciliation occurs in the same episode. They marry the day before Howard leaves for his upcoming mission to the International Space Station.\nDuring seasons six and seven, the newlyweds deal with Howard's difficulty in readjusting to life on Earth, the struggle to keep a healthy relationship with Howard's mother, and arguments over money. In the ninth-season episode, \"The Valentino Submergence\", Bernadette reveals that she is pregnant, informing Howard in the next episode. She comically reveals that the baby was conceived in Sheldon's bed, much to Sheldon's chagrin. Raj learns about the baby's gender and inadvertently reveals that the child is a girl. In \"The Birthday Synchronicity\" Bernadette gives birth to a girl named Halley who screams like the baby's late grandmother, Debbie Wolowitz.\nIn season 11, Bernadette learns that she is again pregnant, while Howard is telling her Sheldon and Amy got engaged. Her doctor puts her on six months of bed rest, which makes her fond of watching detective- and criminal-themed TV shows. In \"The Neonatal Nomenclature\" Bernadette gives birth to a boy named Neil Michael Wolowitz (Neil for Armstrong, Gaiman and Diamond and Michael for Bernadette's father), but she insists that she and Howard call him by his middle name. In season 12, Bernadette pushes Penny in her sales career.\n\n\n==== Amy ====\n\nAmy Farrah Fowler, PhD (Mayim Bialik PhD) is a neuroscientist and Sheldon's love interest in the series. She has a PhD in neurobiology (Bialik herself has a PhD in neuroscience), with a research focus on addiction in primates and invertebrates, occasionally mentioning such experiments as getting a capuchin monkey addicted to cigarettes or starfish addicted to cocaine.\nRaj and Howard found Amy through an online dating site after secretly establishing an account using Sheldon's name and information. The site matches her to Sheldon, and the two share many similar traits. Once she and Sheldon meet, she becomes, as Sheldon puts it, a girl who is his friend, but not his \"girlfriend\". The two initially communicate by computer, but at the encouragement of the group, she starts socializing with the gang in person.\nEarly on, Amy is essentially a female counterpart to Sheldon. She is coldly rational, displays little emotion, and is awkward in social situations ranging from endearing to embarrassing. In season five, after Amy goes out on a date with comic-book store owner Stuart, Sheldon decides to solidify their relationship as boyfriend/girlfriend with a 31-page \"Relationship Agreement\". Later in the season, Amy begins a campaign to increase Sheldon's feelings for her by becoming more involved in his interests, including video games and Star Trek, and treating him as his mother did. Sheldon says during Howard and Bernadette's wedding ceremony that he hopes the two of them are as happy together as he is alone, hurting Amy's feelings, but he spontaneously takes her hand for comfort later as Howard is launched into space.\nBy the beginning of season six, they are regularly holding hands at Amy's insistence, but Sheldon repeatedly resists all of her attempts to engage in further physical intimacy. By mid-season, Sheldon gets some intimate views of Amy when he cares for her while she has the flu, pushing him further toward a traditional relationship with her. She also provides Sheldon with consoling hugs, and receives a slap on the rear by an intoxicated Sheldon who tells everyone that she is a great gal.\nThey eventually move into Penny's old apartment together, while Penny moves in with Leonard, and later make the arrangement permanent. Amy is later offered a three-month course at a science camp in New Jersey and leaves with Sheldon's encouragement. She becomes angry when she learns of Sheldon spending time with Ramona Nowitzki, who she suspects has romantic feelings for Sheldon (which she does). In the season finale, after Ramona kisses Sheldon, he visits Amy and proposes to her. The episode ends on a cliffhanger awaiting her answer. In the season 11 premiere episode \"The Proposal Proposal\", which picks up immediately after Sheldon's proposal, Amy's answer is further delayed by a phone call from Leonard and Penny, after which she finally says yes. She and Sheldon marry in the season 11 finale. Amy objects to Sheldon wanting to provide sperm for Zack Johnson's baby, but does try and get him excited about having their own child.\nIn the final season, Sheldon and Amy publish their work on super-asymmetric string theory and win the Nobel Prize in Physics together.In 2020, a year after The Big Bang Theory went off the air, it was revealed that Kate Micucci, who ultimately got the role of Lucy, had auditioned for the role of Amy Farrah Fowler.\n\n\n==== Stuart ====\n\nStuart David Bloom (Kevin Sussman) runs the Comic Center in Pasadena, the comic book store that the characters often visit. Stuart is characterized by his low self-esteem and loneliness, which often result in pathetic attempts to engage with women and win favor with the main cast. This is despite owning his own (albeit troubled) business, and being a talented portraiture artist who attended the Rhode Island School of Design.During Stuart's first appearances in season 2, he shows enough social skills to ask Penny on a date on two occasions, though neither ends successfully. In \"The Hofstadter Isotope\", his first date with Penny goes well for most of the evening, but when they return to her apartment, their run-in with Sheldon devolves into an endless argument between Stuart and Sheldon over the minutiae of Batman comics that puts Penny to sleep. In \"The Classified Materials Turbulence\", their second date unravels when in the throes of a romantic embrace, Penny calls him \"Leonard\", ending any future prospects for them as a couple. In season five, Stuart goes on a date with Amy, but Sheldon interrupts the date to solidify his relationship with her.\nStuart was the partner of Wil Wheaton in a trading-card game tournament in which they defeated the team of Raj and Sheldon. As proprietor of a comic-book store, Stuart has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of comic books and superheroes. In the season-four episode \"The Toast Derivation\", he mentions that he is in financial trouble and that the store is now also his home, and over the years, he has questioned the profitability or success running the store.\nDuring \"The Decoupling Fluctuation\", Stuart becomes close friends with Raj and joins the gang as Howard's replacement while he is in space. When Howard returns, Sheldon wants to dismiss Stuart from the group, but Raj objects. Leonard tie-breaks on the basis that they are receiving a 20% discount in Stuart's store, and Sheldon relents after Stuart offers to go as high as 30%, thereby becoming a bigger and more prominent part of the core group. Sheldon has tried to hide his clear belief that Stuart is more of a hanger-on to the group of friends than a core member, most notably in a story where Stuart was part of a motley \"test brunch\" along with Burt the geologist and a neighbor who only spoke English she'd heard on TV, so Sheldon could work-out any hosting issues before trying an event with his \"real\" friends. Stuart actually got angry and told Sheldon it was clear they didn't even see him as a friend, leading Sheldon to sincerely apologize and try harder to be nice to Stuart for a period. Stuart is also limited vis-\u00e0-vis the group because he is a lot like Raj, a mostly-single guy around three couples, but Raj is best friends with Howard and closer friends with the others than Stuart.\nAfter his comic-book store is destroyed in a fire, Howard offers him a place to stay and a job as his mother, Debbie's, nurse. Stuart likes the job and develops a surprising closeness with Debbie, even staying long after she recovers, to Howard's annoyance. After Debbie's death, Howard and Bernadette move back into the house, with Stuart still staying. In the eighth-season finale, the two attempt to ask Stuart to move out, but are unable to bring themselves to do it after Stuart reveals it is his birthday. He eventually makes his own decision to move in the middle of season 9; however in the middle of season 10, he reveals that he has been evicted from his apartment and tries to use his helping with Howard and Bernadette's baby to move back in with them, much to Raj's chagrin. He does not always appear with the main group, as he was somehow not at Howard and Bernadette's during the birth of their 2nd child Neil.\nKevin Sussman was a recurring guest actor from seasons two to five, and was promoted to starring role for the sixth season onwards.During season 11, he hires a woman named Denise (Lauren Lapkus), at his shop, and becomes attracted to her. In the season 11 finale, Denise is his date to Sheldon and Amy's wedding, where she exhibits an attraction to Stuart when he displays a superior level of knowledge of Star Wars trivia to Mark Hamill, who is performing the ceremony. In the second episode of season 12, they are revealed to have made out at the ceremony, and have their first date at the end of that episode.\n\n\n==== Emily ====\nEmily Sweeney, M.D., (Laura Spencer) is a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital, whom Raj finds on an online dating site. Emily went to Harvard and is shown to have a slightly alarming personality trait: she delights in the macabre.\nIn season seven, after finding Emily's online dating profile, Raj has Amy contact her. Amy and Emily exchange emails and find they have a lot in common. Emily does not like Raj's inability to correspond with her directly; but, when he does agree to meet her, he acts weirdly and she leaves. Raj later bumps into Emily and apologizes for their previous encounter. She gives him another chance and agrees to go out to dinner with him. In \"The Relationship Diremption\", Raj and Emily have dinner with Howard and Bernadette. Upon meeting Emily, Howard recognizes her from a blind date they had sometime before he met Bernadette. The blind date ended badly, causing him embarrassment at the dinner, but no issues.\nIn \"The Gorilla Dissolution\", Raj and Sheldon bump into Emily at the movies with another guy. Later, she visits him to talk and reveals that the guy was her tattoo artist who had been asking her out for weeks and she did so just to end the obligation. Emily then spends the night; and, in the next episode, Raj reveals to the gang that Emily and he are exclusive.\nIn season eight, Raj introduces Emily to Leonard and Penny; however, Penny senses that Emily does not like her. Emily reveals that she is uncomfortable with the fact that Raj and Penny previously kissed. Emily and Penny later sit down to settle their differences, with mixed results. Emily continues to socialize with the gang in season 8, and in the finale, she suggests to Raj that they have sex in a graveyard. Raj wonders whether he should break up with her because of her alarming personality. The next season, Raj somewhat rashly breaks up with Emily after meeting another girl, Claire, and fantasizing about starting a family with her, though Claire makes amends with her boyfriend and berates Raj for his actions. He tries to reconcile with Emily, but she shuts the door in his face. Later in the season, Emily and Raj reconcile after a tearful phone call. However, in season 10, Raj mentions that he is currently single. He and Howard invite Emily, Claire, Lucy, and Emily the deaf woman to Raj's apartment for an intervention to find out why women keep dumping Raj. Emily mentions that, although she enjoyed her sexual relationship with Raj, she was put off by his fear of his parents.\nLaura Spencer was a recurring guest actress on the series in seasons seven and eight. During production of season 9, she was promoted to a \"fractional\" starring role; the upgraded status ensured her availability on an as-needed basis, without requiring her in every episode. She returned as a guest in season 10; the character was written out of the series, and did not appear after season 10.\n\n\n=== Young Sheldon main characters ===\n\n\n==== Mary Cooper ====\nMary (n\u00e9e Tucker) Cooper (Zoe Perry) is Sheldon's loving, caring and religious mother and a devout Christian from Texas. She has two other children besides Sheldon--Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, and his brother George, who is shown via a family tree to be three or four years older than Sheldon and Missy. Her husband, a rambunctious alcoholic, was also named George, but he died when Sheldon was still a boy. To Mary's relief, her other children do not share Sheldon's hyperintelligence, once commenting to Leonard, \"I thank the good Lord my other kids are as dumb as soup\". Mary herself is not intellectual, but is quite wise, though she is prone to making insensitive comments such as calling Japanese words \"kung fu letters\" at a sushi restaurant, or calling Native Americans \"our\" Indians. Despite her religious views, she is tolerant of other faiths, as evidenced by her serving Raj a dish of chicken after making sure it was not something Indians considered \"magical\". She also struggles to follow her beliefs sometimes. She is a loving mother and has been able to control Sheldon, with Leonard describing her as Sheldon's \"Kryptonite\" to Penny. When Penny and Sheldon engaged in a fierce dispute, Penny called for Mary's help, who subsequently called and scolded Sheldon about his actions. Leonard wishes his mother were as loving as Sheldon's mother, although Sheldon himself appears at best ambivalent about her parenting. Sheldon mentions that Mary once hit him with a Bible because he refused to eat his Brussels sprouts. She apparently thought something was wrong with her son while he was growing up, as Sheldon will often remark after someone calls him crazy, \"I'm not crazy; my mother had me tested!\" Though Mary confirms this, she wishes that she had taken him to Houston for further testing.\nIn her first visit, Leonard calls Mary to intervene when Sheldon is fired for being disrespectful to his new boss, Dr. Gablehauser. She manages to convince Sheldon to apologize and he gets his job back, and she becomes romantically interested in Dr. Gablehauser. When Sheldon asks, \"Is Dr. Gablehauser going to be my new daddy?\", Mary replies, \"We'll see\".\nIn season three of The Big Bang Theory, after returning from the North Pole, Sheldon returns to his home in Texas after the other guys tampered with his research. Mary calls the guys and they come to fetch Sheldon. Sheldon initially refuses to leave, although after an argument with his mother about evolution, Sheldon decides to leave. Mary is again called to intervene in \"The Zazzy Substitution\" when Sheldon buys a clowder of cats after his \"break-up\" with Amy. Mary uses reverse psychology to get Sheldon to reconcile with Amy. She again comes to visit in \"The Rhinitis Revelation\" before going on a Christian cruise, and Sheldon becomes jealous when she would rather go sightseeing with the rest of the gang instead of cooking for him and attending physics lectures.\nIn season seven of The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon returns to Texas to assist Mary in the birth of his twin sister's baby. Howard later takes Sheldon to see Mary after visiting NASA headquarters, but flees after Sheldon sees her having sex. Sheldon returns and gets into an argument, and is sent to his room. After Howard tells him about how he drove away an admirer of his mother, Sheldon apologizes to Mary, saying that he will accept her choices on the outside while condemning her internally for being a hypocrite by going against her religious beliefs. Mary forgives him.\nIn season 8 of The Big Bang Theory, Mary meets Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, Leonard's mother. The two very different women start out as civil, but later quickly clash as Beverly insults and belittles Mary strict religious beliefs, and Mary in turn derides Beverly's cold attitude. Mary is especially insulted when Beverly is left dumbstruck how a genius intellect like Sheldon could be born to a woman like her. After taking a break from each other, the two come to terms: Mary decides to forgive Beverly for her offhandish ways, and Beverly realizes there is more than one way to raise a child. The two mothers make up and Beverly tries unconditional love by trying an awkward hug with Leonard.\nIn season nine of The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon calls her to tell her that Amy broke up with him and that he would like to send the family heirloom engagement ring back, but she advises him to hold on to it, just in case. She reappears in the season finale \"The Convergence-Convergence\" where she comes to attend Leonard and Penny's re-wedding where she is not at all happy to see Beverly. She meets Leonard's father Alfred Hofstadter and the two get along great as they have each other's nice, gentle, and caring personalities, bonding over their mutual dislike of Beverly, and their admiration of each other's beliefs. The two of them end up fighting with Beverly at the restaurant during the pre-ceremony dinner and the two leave together and after finding out they are staying at the same hotel, they decide to share a cab and it is implied that the two hook up. \nIn season 10 of The Big Bang Theory, during a visit to see her, Sheldon and Amy break it to her they are living together and Sheldon is stunned that she is not offended that they are \"living in sin\" due to her belief he was never going to find anyone.\nIn season 11 of The Big Bang Theory, Mary reappeared in the season premiere, \"The Proposal Proposal,\" when Sheldon phoned her to tell her that he and Amy were engaged. Mary was happy for both of them, but she was not surprised, as she had been praying for them. Sheldon informed his mother that they would not be getting married in a church, which was okay with Mary, as she said anywhere Jesus is a church, and he'll be there in her heart. She was also quite surprised to hear that there was more than one woman interested in Sheldon, otherwise she might've prayed a little too hard. After hanging up, Mary thanks the Lord for making the engagement happen, and that even though he (the Lord) can do anything, that was mighty impressive.\nShe reappeared in \"The Solo Oscillation,\" where she called Sheldon, who was annoyed by it, since he was trying to find something to work on.\nIn \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\", Mary and her daughter Missy are picked up from the airport by Raj. She mentions that they had also been driven to the airport by an Indian fellow. Missy object to her comment. Mary also is in denial that her daughter is also separated from her husband. Later at the wedding, when Mrs. Fowler wants to take her daughter way because she thinks that Sheldon has left her at the altar, Penny tells her to stop and that Sheldon would never hurt the woman he loves. Mary stands up and applauds Penny who tells her to sit down too. Mary also tells Sheldon how proud she is of him and that her comment that sometimes it is the imperfections in things that make things perfect gives Sheldon an epiphany about his string theory work.\nMary has argued with Leonard's mother, Beverly, over the fact she never nurtured Leonard properly the way she has with Sheldon, while Beverly has criticized her for her narrow-minded beliefs.\nA younger version of Mary (played by Metcalf's real-life daughter Zoe Perry) is a main character in the prequel series Young Sheldon. It is revealed in season 2 that Mary became a devout Christian after a difficult birth with Sheldon and Missy where Missy almost died. It is also revealed that she had a miscarriage after the pregnancy with Sheldon and Missy. In season 3 it is revealed that she was forced into a shotgun wedding with George.\n\n\n==== George Sr. ====\nGeorge Cooper Sr. is the father of Georgie, Sheldon and Missy Cooper and the husband of Mary Tucker-Cooper. In The Big Bang Theory, it is established that he died when Sheldon and Missy were fourteen years old. He is portrayed by Lance Barber.\n\n\n==== Georgie Jr. ====\nGeorge \"Georgie\" Cooper Jr. (Jerry O'Connell): Sheldon and Missy's brother, who lives in Texas and runs a car tire business. Often at odds while growing up, the Cooper brothers begin to reconcile their differences when Sheldon and Leonard visit George in season 11 before Sheldon's wedding. Known as Georgie in his younger days, he appears as a main character on Young Sheldon played by Montana Jordan.\n\n\n==== Missy ====\nMissy Cooper (Raegan Revord): She is intellectually and socially quite unlike her brother.\nThe adult version of the character is played by Courtney Henggeler and appears in the episode \"The Porkchop Indeterminacy\" of Big Bang Theory. Missy has grown up to be a tall, attractive woman that promptly catches the attention of Leonard, Howard, and Raj. Sheldon realizes that, within Missy's eggs, lies the potential for another \"superior mutation\" like him. He temporarily sets himself up as a guardian to Missy in order to choose the best mate for her. Missy refers to Sheldon as \"Shelly\" and, despite their differences, she loves him and is proud of his accomplishments. In \"The Cooper Extraction\", she gives birth to a baby boy with Sheldon helping while her husband is recovering from a motorcycle accident, but does not appear on-screen. Henggeler reprises the role in the eleventh-season finale \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\", where Missy, pregnant with her second child, travels with her mother to Pasadena to attend Sheldon's wedding. It is mentioned that she is separated from her husband, which piques Raj's interest.\n\n\n==== MeeMaw ====\n\nConstance \"MeeMaw\" Tucker (June Squibb): Sheldon's grandmother from Texas. Sheldon is her favorite grandchild, whom she calls \"Moonpie\". Sheldon, in turn, is very affectionate and protective toward her; while he can be very critical of other family members, he will not allow anyone to criticize his grandmother. Meemaw is often mentioned by Sheldon, but did not appear on the series until episode 14 of season nine, \"The Meemaw Manifestation\".\nMeemaw takes an immediate dislike to Amy upon meeting her. It appears she came to visit her grandson, but the real reason she came was to size Amy up and she dislikes Amy because of her breaking Sheldon's heart when she broke up with him. Meemaw keeps this to herself until dinner where she reveals this in front of her grandson, his girlfriend and the married Hofstadter couple. Later, Sheldon reasons with her about how she made her husband (Sheldon's maternal grandfather) a better person when he was stubborn and egotistical and Meemaw soon gives her blessings to Sheldon and Amy's relationship.\nIn the prequel series Young Sheldon, Meemaw is played by Annie Potts. In that series, it is revealed that she is Sheldon's maternal grandmother and has a significant gambling habit.\n\n\n==== Pastor Jeff ====\nJeffery Difford (Matt Hobby) is a pastor at the church that Sheldon and his family attend in Young Sheldon. Like Mary, he has friction with Sheldon's atheism, but he often challenges Sheldon to explore their line of thought through logic exercises. He was originally given the last name Hodgkins, but it was changed to Difford as of the episode \"Seven Deadly Sins and a Small Carl Sagan\".\n\n\n== Supporting characters ==\nThe following list is sorted in alphabetical order by first name:\n\n\n=== Cast table ===\n\n\n=== The Big Bang Theory supporting characters ===\n\n\n==== Alex Jensen ====\n\nAlex Jensen (Margo Harshman) is a Caltech graduate student who appears in season six.  Sheldon hires her to review his kindergarten and elementary-school notebooks for any possible Nobel Prize-winning research and attend to the tasks that Sheldon perceives a waste of his own valuable time. Amy is at first jealous until she sees Alex instead flirting with an unresponsive Leonard.\nAfter repeated attempts by Alex, Leonard finally realizes that Alex is making advances toward him. While proclaiming his loyalty to Penny, Leonard is flattered. Sheldon interferes (with the perceived intention of mitigating a situation that needed none) by lecturing Alex, but only succeeds in insulting her. After Alex files a sexual harassment complaint, Sheldon is forced to apologize and is ordered take a university-mandated online sexual-harassment course. Because Sheldon considers his own time as too valuable to waste on it, Sheldon asks Alex to take the course instead. For Valentine's Day, Sheldon sends Alex out to buy a present for Amy, which he likes so much, he keeps.\n\n\n==== Anu ====\nAnu (Rati Gupta) is the woman who Raj's father sets him up with after asking him to arrange a marriage for him who first appears in season 12. She works in a hotel as a concierge.\nIn \"The Wedding Gift Wormhole\", depressed over everyone else being in a relationship, Raj asks his father to arrange a marriage for him, and sets him up with Anu. On their first date, Anu's commanding personality and practical approach to marriage startle Raj but nonetheless he agrees to go ahead with it. Howard criticizes Raj for this \u2013 he never expected Raj to just give up on romance. Raj admits this to Anu so she proposes to him, and he says yes. She meets Penny and Bernadette in \"The Tam Turbulence\", where they track her down at the hotel she works at to check her out and end up impressed by her connections in the hotel industry, although the evening turns sour when they get drunk and end up telling her embarrassing things about Raj. In \"The Consummation Deviation\", Anu wants to have sex with Raj for the first time, but he gets so nervous that his selective mutism returns. Confessing this to her, she is very understanding, revealing an unusual secret of her own: she hates music. The next morning, he is able to have sex with her in the shower. When Raj installs a doorbell camera at Anu's home, he accidentally spies on her and sees her greeting her ex-boyfriend, they realize how little they know about each other. The wedding gets cancelled, but they agree to start their relationship over by just dating. Anu later gets a job offer while working in London, and Raj considers leaving to propose to her, but Howard convinces him to wait for the right woman.\n\n\n==== Arthur Jeffries ====\n\nArthur Jeffries, or Professor Proton (Bob Newhart) is the star of a fictional in-universe science show that Sheldon and Leonard watched as children. The character is a homage to Mr. Wizard. After the show was cancelled, Jeffries was not taken seriously as a scientist and resorted to doing children's parties as his persona. In \"The Proton Resurgence\", Sheldon hires him to do a private party for Leonard and himself (and Penny). Later, Jeffries has a heart attack as a result of climbing the apartment stairs with his equipment. He asks Sheldon to take his place at a party for a Korean family, which Sheldon agrees to do as \"Professor Proton, Jr\".\nWhile Sheldon idolizes him, Jeffries is constantly irritated by Sheldon's personality, and takes a shine to Penny. In \"The Proton Displacement\", Leonard, Sheldon, and Amy bump into Jeffries at a drugstore, and Sheldon becomes upset when Jeffries asks Leonard for help on a paper instead of him, and when he finds out that Jeffries thinks he is annoying, Sheldon works with Bill Nye the Science Guy, whom Jeffries accuses of stealing material from his TV show. After Nye abandons Sheldon and files for a restraining order against him, Jeffries arrives at Sheldon and Leonard's apartment and asks Sheldon for his advice on his paper (although Sheldon already hacked his email account and read it for himself).\nIn \"The Proton Transmogrification\" on Star Wars Day, Leonard tells Sheldon that Jeffries has died. Sheldon immediately pretends not to care and refuses to go to the funeral. Jeffries appears to Sheldon in a dream, where Sheldon compares him to Obi-Wan Kenobi, dressing him in Jedi robes and making him appear as a Force ghost. When Sheldon asks for his wisdom, Jeffries tells Sheldon to appreciate everything in life, including his friends, and never take it for granted.\nJeffries returns in \"The Opening Night Excitation\" when his ghost convinces Sheldon to spend time with Amy on her birthday instead of going to see Star Wars: The Force Awakens as he had planned to do for months. After hearing Professor Proton's words, Sheldon decides to prove his devotion to Amy by finally having sex with her, as she has been hoping he will do for the past few years. Some time later, after Sheldon takes Amy to see The Force Awakens, Jeffries returns to Sheldon to ask him about his first sexual experience with her, but Sheldon thinks Jeffries is talking about the film and tells him he enjoyed it.\nFor his role as Jeffries, in 2013, Newhart won his first Primetime Emmy Award. Newhart plays the same character on Young Sheldon.\n\n\n==== Barry Kripke ====\n\nBarry Kripke, PhD (John Ross Bowie) is a co-worker of the guys, who frequently clashes with Sheldon. He works in plasma physics. Kripke has a case of rhotacism in which he pronounces the letters \"R\" and \"L\" as \"W\" in much the same way as Elmer Fudd from Looney Tunes, Jimmy Five from Monica's Gang and Gilda Radner in her \"Baba Wawa\" sketches. In season five, Kripke purchases an iPhone with voice-recognition technology, but, because of his rhotacism, the device is incapable of understanding his verbal \"wequests\", prompting him to deride it as ineffective. Until season seven, whether he was aware of his impediment was never clarified.\nIn his first appearance, he pits his robot, the Kripke Krippler, against the men's robot, M.O.N.T.E., in an unofficial robot fight. The guys lose to Kripke, and M.O.N.T.E. is destroyed. In \"The Friendship Algorithm\", Sheldon attempts to befriend Kripke to gain access to an open science grid computer to conduct research, but it turns out to be futile, as Kripke has no control over the computer's usage time, and Sheldon consequently expels Kripke from the group. Kripke continues his antagonism towards Sheldon in \"The Vengeance Formulation\" by pulling a prank on Sheldon when he is a guest on NPR's Science Friday by putting a helium tank in his office, making Sheldon's voice more squeaky. In \"The Toast Derivation\", Sheldon tries to befriend Kripke and a few others when he is feeling excluded by his friends, but Kripke and the others all connect in a manner that Sheldon finds 'wrong' and leaves.In season five, Kripke and Sheldon battle over a retired professor's office; but, after a long sports contest, Kripke loses to Sheldon. He is later invited to Howard's bachelor party, where he uses his turn toasting to complain that no strippers are at the party.\nIn season six, Kripke and Sheldon are forced to work together on a proposal involving fusion reactors, which involves an exchange of work. Sheldon is shocked to discover that Kripke's work is more advanced than his own, and he tearfully admits as much to Amy. Kripke assumes that Sheldon is in a sexual relationship with Amy and that has led to his work quality declining, and Sheldon does not deny it (although this appears to be just a convenient excuse since his work is inferior to Kripke's). Kripke also battles for tenure alongside Sheldon, Leonard, and Raj.\nIn season seven, Kripke ridicules Sheldon when his discovery of a new element was false, nicknaming Sheldon \"The Retractor\".\nIn season nine, Kripke calls Sheldon and Amy's live show Fun with Flags along with Raj and directs the conversation to irrelevant questions to the show. He also uses the show to call out for potential romantic relationships and asked Amy questions about her love life when Sheldon and she broke up. He attends Sheldon's birthday party and constantly hits on Leonard's mother, Beverly.\n\n\n==== Bert Kibbler ====\n\nProfessor Bertram Kibbler (Brian Posehn) is a geologist at Caltech, who met Amy while she was working there in her own lab in \"The Occupation Recalibration\". Bert brings Amy interesting and beautiful rocks every day. It takes Howard and Raj to point out that he likes her. Bert then asks her to a rock and mineral show, which she declines because she has a boyfriend. When Bert starts talking about how no one wants to do anything with him, Amy in a fit of sympathy agrees to go. Unfortunately, Bert is taking it as a date. Raj and Howard offer to talk to him to let him down easy, and they end up going with him to the show.\nBert first appeared in \"The Contractual Obligation Implementation\" where he is socially awkward and Raj meets just prior to a library date with Lucy. He tried to crash their date, and Raj sent him away. His name was not mentioned in the plot, but the closing credits gave the name Bert.\nIn \"The Dependence Transcendence\", Bert hosts a Caltech party that only Amy and Penny attend. He feels that Amy is the coolest girl at work and that Sheldon is cool only because he is dating Amy. As the girls are leaving, he tells them that he is in love with both of them.\nHe reappears in \"The Fetal Kick Catalyst\" as a guest at Sheldon and Amy's brunch in their apartment. He mentions that a girlfriend he was living with once moved out and took all his best rocks.\nIn \"The Geology Elevation\", Bert wins the MacArthur Fellowship grant, which makes Sheldon jealous. When Sheldon finally confronts him over this, Bert points out that the theoretical physicist has his friends and Amy to be happy about. In his office, his diploma shows he received his degree from the University of Arizona. He later accompanies Sheldon to The Ellen DeGeneres Show to make peace. His full name is shown in his award. By the end of season 10, Raj moves into the apartment over Bert's garage.\nBert reappears in \"The Separation Agitation\", and it is revealed that he has a recent girlfriend named Rebecca, who only appears to be with him for his grant money. After breaking up with her, Bert instantly regrets it and buys expensive gifts to win her back. At the end of the episode, he is revealed to have succeeded.\n\n\n==== Beverly Hofstadter ====\n\nBeverly Hofstadter (Christine Baranski) is Leonard's narcissistic, unloving, and overly analytical mother. Beverly is a neuroscientist, as well as a psychiatrist. She is Sheldon's female equivalent regarding neurotically strict speech patterns, lack of respect for social conventions, and compulsive attention to detail. The only reason she had children was to use them as personal experiments for her research, so was very distant and unmotherly towards Leonard. Beverly mentions that Leonard's brother and sister are more successful in their respective fields than he is; though she respects this enough to keep contact with them (unlike Leonard), she is not proud, since they are not her accomplishments. One of her famous books is Needy Baby, Greedy Baby, in which she describes an infant's (Leonard's) unrealistic nurturing expectations. Sheldon often refers to her books when frustrated with Leonard's attempt to obtain some of his personal needs in their relationship. Leonard sees his mother as cold and not nurturing, even telling Penny that one time he made a hugging machine just to get hugs (and that his father asked to borrow it). The lack of Beverly's maternal feelings and actions toward Leonard has led to him being called the \"King of Foreplay\" because of his obsessive need to please.\nIn her first visit, Beverly makes Penny cry by delving into her history with her father (driving her, and later Leonard, to the bottle), and considers Raj and Howard's relationship to be an \"ersatz homosexual marriage\". After bonding with Sheldon, Beverly sings Journey's \"Any Way You Want It\" with him on karaoke.\nIn season three, Beverly comes to visit at Christmas, where she reveals that she is divorcing her husband, Alfred, after she caught him in bed with another woman. Despite Leonard's reluctance to tell Beverly about his and Penny's relationship, Penny takes her to the Cheesecake Factory for a round of drinks and reveals their relationship. After Beverly gropes a busboy, she and Penny both go to Del Taco and then return to Leonard and Sheldon's apartment where she confronts Leonard on not telling him about Penny, and then is confronted by him for not being a loving and caring mother for him. After Beverly tries to show motherly affection by hugging Leonard, she kisses a shocked Sheldon and leaves. The next morning, a hungover Beverly gives her blessing to Leonard and Penny's relationship and vows not to reveal her drunken kiss with Sheldon, wanting to work instead on her maternal relationship with Leonard.\nIn season five, Sheldon calls Beverly on Skype to help Leonard following Penny and Raj's hook-up, and she tells Leonard to \"buck up, sissypants...If you need any more help from me, my books are available on Amazon\".\nIn season seven, Leonard uses Beverly's latest book to get sympathy from Penny. However, Bernadette finds out from Howard what Leonard is doing and tells Penny, who calls Beverly, leaving a briefly pantsless Leonard to chat with his mother on Skype. Leonard later informs his mother of his engagement to Penny, but she reveals that Sheldon already told her. She decides to accept his engagement with Penny because Sheldon likes her.\nIn season eight, Beverly comes to visit to see Leonard receive an award, where she meets Sheldon's mother, Mary. The mothers get into an argument after Beverly describes Mary's religious beliefs as a superstition, and Mary, in turn, berates Beverly for her cold and distant attitude towards Leonard. Beverly later reflects with Sheldon that perhaps other ways exist to raise children than she did. The mothers make up and Beverly tries to show affection by hugging Leonard, though it is awkward for both of them.\nIn season nine, she attends Sheldon's birthday party and enjoys a proposition from Barry Kripke. Later, she returns for a visit to interview people for her new book, and spends her time bonding with Amy and Bernadette, frustrating Penny's attempts to bond with her. When Penny confronts her for this, she admits that she feels insulted about not being invited to her son's wedding. Penny suggests doing a second wedding ceremony for her, which she accepts and the two finally bond. She is unhappy about her ex-husband, Alfred, attending since their marriage ended due to his affair, and is even angrier when Alfred and Mary Cooper display mutual attraction and leave the rehearsal dinner together. Beverly and Alfred argue all night and Beverly once again quarrels with Mary. At the ceremony, she agrees with Alfred that Leonard was the best thing to come out of their relationship.\nIn season 11, Beverly begins talking to Penny as a friend and confidant, troubling Leonard, especially when he learns that Beverly told Penny that she is proud of her, a level of praise she never bestowed upon Leonard himself. When Leonard confronts Beverly, he is touched when she says that of all of her children's spouses, Penny is the one she is most impressed by, and that for this, she is indeed proud of him.\nShe reappeared in \"The Novelization Correlation\" as the character Ilsa from Leonard's book, as well as appearing over Skype.\nIn season 12, she appeared in \"The VCR Illumination\" via video chat when Leonard and Penny talked to her about comforting Sheldon. She reappeared in the seventeenth episode, \"The Conference Valuation\".\nIn \"The Maternal Conclusion\", Beverly visits Leonard and Penny acting nice and truly interested in Leonard's new physics project. Later she admits that she is doing research for a new book which makes Leonard blow up. Finally he forgives her which makes both of them feel much better and they end in a true loving embrace.\nFor her role as Beverly, in both 2009 and 2010, Baranski was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\n\n==== Claire ====\n\nClaire (Alessandra Torresani) is a writer for a children's science fiction series whom Raj and Howard meet in the comic book store in season 9. Claire wants to collaborate with Raj on the science portions of a movie script. When Raj reveals to her that he has a girlfriend, Emily, she assures him that she is only interested in his technical assistance, and they can still meet as friends. However, Raj develops visions of marriage and children with Claire. After Raj breaks up with Emily, he calls Claire on Valentine's Day, only to learn that she has just got back together with her boyfriend. She also calls Raj an \"ass\" for breaking up with Emily just before Valentine's Day. Later, however, she asks Raj out for a drink after she has again broken up with her boyfriend. However, Raj is on his way to reunite with Emily, and chooses to be with her. However, Raj later starts seeing Claire again while at the same time dating Emily. She and Raj continue to date, but they keep their relationship casual with no commitment. When she meets Raj's friends, Claire begins to realize that Raj has been dating multiple women, and successfully tricks him into admitting it.\nIn season 10, Raj reveals that he is now single, having broken up with both Emily and Claire at the ladies' behest. Later in the season, when Raj tries to figure out what is wrong with himself, Claire accepts an invitation to Raj's apartment, where she meets his previous girlfriends. Claire reveals that she broke up with Raj after finding him too needy and vain and declares that she is now in a better relationship.\n\n\n==== Dan ====\n\nDan (Stephen Root) is a senior member of staff at Zangen, who first appears in \"The Locomotion Interruption\" when he interviews Penny for a pharmaceutical sales representative position as a favor to Bernadette. Penny realizes that the interview is not going well so she ends it and starts to leave. As a favor, she asks Dan not to tell Bernadette how badly she did because she is kind of scared of her. Dan says that he thought he was the only one who was scared of her. They start to bond, agreeing that Bernadette is something of a bully. Dan comments that she has that squeaky little voice, and that everyone else thinks she is SO nice. He had to cut one of Bernadette's research programs, but was too scared of her to do it. Dan and Penny both agree not to tell Bernadette about the results of the interview. Later Bernadette is talking to Howard at home, and tells him that it is hard to believe, but Penny got the job. She feels that it is because Dan really loves her.\nDan reappears in \"The Champagne Reflection\", when Penny makes Bernadette face up to her bullying ways. Dan is still afraid of Bernadette, and tells the story of how she yelled at him and his grandson after they lost the three-legged race at the company picnic. His grandson called her the mean kid with the big boobies. Bernadette is horrified when she realizes how everyone perceives her. Her father had taught her to be tough and she can be cruel with some of her comments without even knowing it. She says she thought she was the sweetest person she knew, and should be in a tree baking cookies like a Keebler elf. She goes to apologize to Dan and discovers that, owing to everyone's fear of her, they have been paying for her daily coffee even after the company stopped doing so (something they accomplished with a swear jar kept for Bernadette's sake); and have given her the private use of a toilet that was meant for everyone. She now feels like she has to leave the company and starts crying. Desperate for her to stop, Dan promises to keep paying for her coffee, and even offers to get her an espresso machine. Bernadette has found a new way to get what she wants.\n\n\n==== Dave Gibbs ====\n\nDave Gibbs (Stephen Merchant) is a tall British man who dates Amy after she breaks up with Sheldon. Dave is recently divorced because his wife left him for a French chef. When her friends try to find Amy a date on a dating mobile app, they see a text message from Dave, and Amy reveals they have already gone out together for coffee. Sheldon is about to propose to Amy for closure when he sees Amy and Dave kissing after their date. When Amy and Dave later go out again for dinner (while Penny, Bernadette, and a reluctant Leonard spy on them), he shows an unusual fascination with Sheldon, which discomforts Amy. He considers Sheldon and Leonard to be physics superstars and idolizes them. He later gets an opportunity to meet Leonard and shake his hand after Leonard has to relieve himself while spying on their date, and with great excitement, Dave announces that he will never again wash his hand. After Sheldon rejects Amy's proposal that they be a couple again, Amy once again tries dinner with Dave, who goes out of his way to refrain from mentioning Sheldon, knowing how uncomfortable that subject made her previously. Sheldon then suddenly arrives and professes his love to Amy, and the two mend their relationship, leaving Dave to awkwardly excuse himself and invite Sheldon to meet again on his way out.\n\n\n==== Denise ====\n\nDenise (Lauren Lapkus) is the assistant manager at Stuart's comic book store introduced in season 10. She is quite a comic book geek. At first, Sheldon doesn't like the change that her hiring brings to the store, but starts to like her because of her comic book knowledge and her ability to figure out his preferences in comic books. After being annoyed by Sheldon's praising of Denise, Amy goes down to the bookstore to demand that Denise teach her enough about comics to make it appear that she likes them.  In \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\", Stuart asks her to come to Sheldon and Amy's Wedding with him. Denise declines until she learns that Star Wars actor Mark Hamill is going to be there. She sits besides Stuart at the wedding and watches as he answers questions about Star Wars better than Mark Hamill. Denise is amazed by his knowledge and calls him hot. A relationship starts between Denise and Stuart in \"The Wedding Gift Wormhole\". They spend time together and enjoyed each other's company though Stuart is insecure about their relationship. Denise invites Stuart to move in, but he backs off not wanting to ruin their relationship. In episode twenty-two of season 12, \"The Maternal Conclusion\", they move in together after convincing Denise's creepy roommate Mitch to move out.\n\n\n==== Eric Gablehauser ====\nEric Gablehauser (Mark Harelik) is the head of the Physics Department, the group's boss at the university. When he first starts working at the university, he fires Sheldon after Sheldon insults his intelligence. Eventually, Gablehauser rehires Sheldon after he and Sheldon's mother display a mutual romantic interest. Gablehauser later hosts the Physics Bowl, and gives Raj attention when he is featured in a People article for discovering a planet.\n\n\n==== V. M. Koothrappali ====\n\nV. M. Koothrappali (Brian George) is Raj's father in India. His wife and he communicate with their son via Skype and constantly try to arrange dates for him. They want their son to marry a woman of Indian descent and give them grandchildren. Although in many episodes Raj mentions that he grew up in poverty, his friends remind him of the contrary by pointing out that Dr. Koothrappali is a gynecologist, drives a Bentley, and employs servants. In one such episode, Raj replies that the Bentley is leased and there are only four servants in his family home, two of whom are children. Dr. Koothrappali enjoys Doogie Howser reruns, which are apparently new to India. Other than Raj, he also maintains contact with their daughter Priya via Skype whenever she is out of India. In season four, Dr. Koothrappali becomes angry with Leonard when he learns that his daughter, Priya, is dating Leonard without his knowledge. According to Sheldon, the Koothrappalis are \"Richie Rich rich\".\nThe Koothrappalis go through a rough patch in their marriage, culminating in them separating in season eight around the time of their 40th wedding anniversary, with Dr. Koothrappali moving out and Mrs. Koothrappali setting fire to his car. Dr. Koothrappali makes his first physical appearance on the show in season eight, visiting the main characters at a Christmas party after the divorce. Dr. Koothrappali later cuts off Raj financially when he buys a helicopter drone, but Raj manages to turn the situation around by pitting his father against his mother. He also asks his father to give advice to a nervous, pregnant Bernadette.\nIn \"The Allowance Evaporation\", Raj after meeting his ex-girlfriends who said he was too spoiled and a momma's boy, tells his father that he was no longer taking any money from him. His father was delighted that his last only unmarried offspring was going to stand on his own two feet.\nIn \"The Wedding Gift Wormhole\", it's revealed that he is dating again and decides to set up Raj with a woman for an arranged marriage. \nHe returns in \"The Propagation Proposition\" via video chat after Raj has broken up with Anu; he is angry about any money he has lost due to the wedding being cancelled.\n\n\n==== Mrs. Koothrappali ====\n\nMrs. Koothrappali (Alice Amter) is Raj's mother in India. Mrs. Koothrappali is especially worried that, despite Raj being old enough to marry, the closest they have to a daughter-in-law is \"that little Jewish boy Howard\". She enjoys Doogie Howser reruns, which are apparently new to India. Other than Raj, she also maintains contact with Priya via video chat whenever she is out of India. She also had some anger towards Leonard when it became apparent that he was dating Priya without her knowledge.\nFollowing their divorce in season eight, Raj mentions that his mother bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set fire to her ex-husband's car. Mrs. Koothrappali makes her first physical appearance on the show in \"The Graduation Transmission\", where Raj uses the Koothrappali's divorce to get money from her when his father cuts him off financially, and pits her against her ex-husband.\n\n\n==== Janine Davis ====\n\nJanine Davis (Regina King) is a human resources representative working at the university. She first appears in season six after Sheldon offends his assistant Alex while trying to solve a problem regarding her crush on Leonard, leaving Mrs. Davis to handle Alex's sexual-harassment complaint against Sheldon. Sheldon tells Mrs. Davis his belief that she, like all women, is a \"slave\" to her sexual \"urges\", unaware that his remarks are racist and sexist. In his attempt at defense, Sheldon rats out what he considers similar behavior by Raj, Howard, and Leonard, prompting Mrs. Davis to summon them to her office, as well. Mrs. Davis later serves on the tenure committee that is considering Raj, Sheldon, Leonard, and Kripke for a vacant tenured position, causing each of them to try to win her favor. Sheldon, in his effort to earn the position, offends her once again by giving her the box set for the miniseries Roots. Despite this, Sheldon is still short-listed for tenure, even if he offends Mrs. Davis yet again by giving her what he thinks is a traditional handshake originating in African American communities.\nIn season seven, Mrs. Davis says that she is recently divorced because her husband cheated on her, and Raj attempts to strike up a conversation with her at a university mixer. After offending her, Raj apologizes, and the two talk about their troubles. Following the mixer, while Raj is insistent that Mrs. Davis and he had a \"moment\", Howard disagrees. Mrs. Davis makes another appearance in season 8, where she informs Sheldon that he has to teach a class as a junior professor, and in season 11, has to deal with Leonard after he gives an embarrassing interview on the radio about the university.\n\n\n==== Kurt ====\nKurt (Brian Patrick Wade) is a tall, intimidating bodybuilder and Penny's ex-boyfriend at the beginning of the series. In the pilot, Penny reveals that he cheated on her, and Leonard and Sheldon later go to his apartment and attempt to retrieve Penny's television set from him, but they were unsuccessful and Kurt apparently found them so irritating that they returned home without pants. Kurt is invited to Penny's Halloween party, for which he dresses up as a caveman, where he has yet another run in with Leonard, who is dressed as a hobbit. After Kurt sees Penny kissing Leonard, Leonard victoriously shouts to him, \"That's right, you saw what you saw. That's how we roll in The Shire!\"In season two, Penny experiences financial difficulties. After Leonard learns about Penny's problems, he tries to help her cut expenses, and in the process learns that Kurt owes her $1800. Without telling Penny, Leonard and the guys go to Kurt's place to collect the money, but they are unsuccessful, and Kurt writes \"I owe Penny $1800 ~ Kurt\" on Leonard's forehead in indelible ink. Later, Penny reveals that Kurt visited her the next morning and paid her, in turn. However, much to Leonard's disappointment, Kurt never told Penny about Leonard's visit, and instead took the opportunity to ask Penny out for dinner. However, the date apparently does not go anywhere as Kurt is never seen or mentioned again.\n\n\n==== Lucy ====\n\nLucy (Kate Micucci) shows up at a party at the comic-book store on Valentine's Day at an event for people who had no dates. She has social anxiety issues, which allows Raj and her to connect. On their first date, she becomes so nervous that she goes to the bathroom and climbs out of the window to get away. Raj falls apart and refuses to leave his apartment; however, after apologizing to him, Lucy and Raj start afresh. Raj and Lucy have a date at a library and communicate by text messages, and at the end, she offers to kiss him, but chickens out at the last second. In \"The Bon Voyage Reaction\", Raj tries to introduce Lucy to the rest of the gang. Lucy becomes nervous at the thought of meeting so many new people that Raj suggests she meet just one of his friends first, to which she agrees. Lucy meets Amy, but Raj pressures Lucy and upsets her. Lucy breaks up with Raj by an email, and afterwards a heartbroken Raj finally speaks to Penny without having consumed alcohol. Originally, Kate Micucci had been one of the actresses considered for the Amy Farrah Fowler character.\nIn season seven, Penny meets Lucy at the Cheesecake Factory and confronts her about her breakup with Raj, and later Lucy arranges to meet with Raj to apologize to him for breaking up with him via email. This leads Raj to believe the two of them will get back together, but Lucy tells him she is with someone else. Although she is not seen, Lucy later texts Raj saying that she misses him and wants to get back together, but after finding out that he is also dating Emily, Lucy rebuffs Raj.\nLucy appears in season 10, where Raj invites her to his apartment along with his other ex-girlfriends to find out why he is still single. Lucy mentions that she is now in a better relationship.\n\n\n==== Mike Rostenkowski ====\nMike Rostenkowski (Casey Sander) is Bernadette's father and a tough retired police officer. Mike has a rough and rude personality and often bullies others, although he deeply loves his daughter, calling Bernadette his \"little girl\". Before he is first seen, Bernadette establishes his personality by telling Howard a long list of subjects he cannot discuss with Mike, including Jimmy Carter, foreigners, homosexuals, and even Howard's Jewish identity.\nIn his first appearance, he tells Howard that, while he does not think highly of him, his respect for Howard grew when he learned he had been selected to become an astronaut. However, after Howard expresses his fears about not returning from space, Mike tells him not to worry as Bernadette will have no trouble finding another suitable bachelor if Howard dies in space, much to the future astronaut's dismay. In the season-five finale, Mike attends Howard and Bernadette's wedding and walks his daughter down the aisle.\nIn season six, Howard and Mike are pushed into a fishing weekend by their spouses, but neither man really wants to go. Mike suggests that they go to a casino to shoot craps. Having earned more of Mike's respect, Howard is now able to address him as \"Mike\" rather than \"Sir\".\nIn season seven, because his wife is out of town, Bernadette gets Mike to come to Howard's mother's house for Thanksgiving dinner, though he would rather watch football at home. Since Sheldon understands football from growing up with his father, Mike and Sheldon bond and drink heavily together. After insulting Howard, Mike later tells Howard that he is not \"all that bad\", but implies that this statement is untrue when he comments on his drunken state. In \"The Table Polarization\", Mike, Bernadette, Raj, and Mike Massimino (via Skype) perform an intervention on Howard's decision to go back to space. Mike mentions that Howard asked him to shoot him in the foot to avoid the first space mission, which Howard insists was a joke.\nIn season nine, he comes to Howard and Bernadette's house since they are talking about renovating and he comes over to help. While Howard and he are busy under the foundations of the house, Mike asks Howard why he does not want kids, but Howard sets things straight when he tells Mike that it is actually Bernadette who does not want kids. In the room above, Bernadette overhears this and tries to drown out the conversation by yelling \"Earthquake!\" and drumming her feet on the floor, causing a dust avalanche on both of them. Bernadette had lied to her father about not wanting kids because she did not want to disappoint him. Mike says he does not want to see her miss out since raising children was the most rewarding experience of his life, but Bernadette points out that her mother did everything while all Mike did was come home from work, sit on the couch, and drink beer, which is unrelated to raising kids. Defeated, Mike leaves, saying this is really a conversation for husband and wife and tells Bernadette if her mother asks, he was at the Wolowitz house until 10. He briefly comes back into the kitchen and sees Howard and Bernadette doing \"dirty talk\" and then disappears again through the doorway.\n\n\n==== President Siebert ====\n\nPresident Siebert (Joshua Malina) is the president of the California Institute of Technology. He is married and has a daughter. Siebert is often mentioned by Sheldon. A recurring gag is that Sheldon often calls or visits Siebert in the middle of the night to get information, and usually gets a bitter response. Siebert sends Sheldon on the expedition to the North Pole at the end of season two.\nIn his first appearance, Siebert organizes a get-together with wealthy donors and faculty members to garner funds for the university's programs. He urges the guys to make an appearance to schmooze the donors so they will give to their projects. Seeing Sheldon's behavior toward the donors, he asks that he not appear again.\nIn season five, Siebert forces Sheldon to use up his vacation days, and when Sheldon and Kripke battle for an office at the university, they interrupt Siebert at a urinal to get him to make a decision on who gets the office.\nIn season eleven, the President returns and is very excited about Sheldon and Amy's asymmetry string theory paper. He helps them promote it and submitting a Nobel Prize nominations for the two of them.\n\n\n==== Priya Koothrappali ====\nPriya Koothrappali (Aarti Mann) is Raj's younger sister. Having graduated at the top of her class at the University of Cambridge (where like Sheldon, her roommate was from Texas), she is one of the lead attorneys at India's biggest car company.\nIn her first appearance, Priya has a two-day layover and comes to visit her brother. Leonard and she are revealed to have had a relationship five years earlier (without her parents' or Raj's knowledge) when she was in town, and that Leonard had been much more invested in the relationship than she was. Leonard even offered to relocate to New Delhi to be with her. He tries to keep their relationship a secret from the guys, but Sheldon discovers Priya in their apartment after spending the night together. Leonard eventually reveals to the rest of the guys that he spent the night with Priya, as he is unable to bear the burden of keeping the secret. Priya returns to Los Angeles for business in \"The Cohabitation Formulation\", and Leonard and she decide to try to have a real relationship, over the protests of Raj. It upsets both Raj, knowing that his sister is having sex with one of his best friends (sometimes in Raj's bed), and Penny, who is revealed to harbour unresolved feelings for Leonard. Priya soon becomes jealous of Penny and asks Leonard to stop spending time with her, which causes Penny, Amy, and Bernadette to hate her. Priya contests Sheldon's roommate agreement with Leonard, employing her legal background to deny Sheldon power over him, but upon Amy's advice, Sheldon drafts a new agreement and blackmails Leonard into signing it by threatening to tell Priya's parents she is dating Leonard, which she cannot bear because they want her to date an Indian (although her father would accept her dating Howard due to his belief that Jews are financially savvy and do not drink much). At the end of season four, Leonard overhears her parents claiming that she is moving back to India, which he interprets as the end of their relationship, leading him to expose their secret relationship to her parents.\nIn season five, although they are separated, with Priya moving back a month earlier than expected, they nonetheless remain in touch via Skype, having a cyber-dinner/breakfast date. At Howard's suggestion, Leonard and Priya also attempt to simulate intercourse, but when it comes time for her to remove her clothing, Leonard's screen freezes up because of his exceeding the bandwidth. Leonard later manages to get cue cards to help himself with a seduction speech to Priya, but while delivering it to her, he inadvertently reveals to her parents that they are cyber-dating (they were in the same room as she when he called), with them acidly asking for him to continue with the speech. In \"The Good Guy Fluctiation\", Leonard tells Priya about his attraction to a comic-book enthusiast named Alice; Priya admits to cheating on him with her former boyfriend, which visibly upsets Leonard. When Priya states that they both messed up a little, Leonard retorts that while he messed up a little, she messed up a lot. She claims that it is not a competition, to which he replies that it is and that she won and he switches off his laptop. In the next episode, Leonard refers to himself as single, indicating that Priya and he have broken up as a result of their last conversation.\nIn season 10, it is mentioned that out of the six Koothrappali children, only Raj is still single, indicating that Priya has married since her last appearance.\n\n\n==== Ramona Nowitzki ====\n\nRamona Nowitzki, Ph.D., (Riki Lindhome) first appears in the season 2 episode, \"The Cooper\u2013Nowitzki Theorem\", when she is a graduate student at Caltech who is a huge fan of Sheldon's work and develops a near-obsessive crush on him. She meets Sheldon personally in the cafeteria and arranges to have dinner with him in his apartment. Where other people might be worried about such behavior being reminiscent of stalking, Sheldon reacts positively to Ramona by appreciating the fact that he is getting a free dinner. During their date, the rest of the gang is sitting on the couch as spectators of this strange turn of events. She keeps \"helping\" Sheldon by arranging suitable working conditions for him, such as getting breakfast for him at the cafeteria and giving him foot rubs. Unfortunately for Sheldon, she overdoes her insistence that Sheldon dedicate his time solely for work, depriving him of his favorite hobbies such as playing games, watching TV, and going for paintball with the guys. Even more unfortunately for Sheldon, he cannot seem to get rid of her, especially when she settles herself in his apartment. Ramona proves to be irritating for the entire group, especially when she assumes that Penny likes Sheldon. She still asks Penny to be sisters with her. She makes it difficult for anyone to communicate with him and scares them away. Eventually, Sheldon solves the problem he has been working on. Enthusiastic about his solution, he asks Ramona how he can reward her for all her help. But when she asks for him to share credit with her and name the theorem \"Cooper-Nowitzki\", he finally kicks her out of the apartment.\nRamona reappears in the season 10 finale. She now has her Ph.D., and has secured a post-doc position at Caltech. Amy is away at Princeton, and the gang becomes worried for Sheldon because Ramona's crush on him begins again. She brings him meals, and eventually kisses him in his office. Finally aware of her advances, Sheldon makes an excuse to leave the office, and promptly flies to New Jersey where he proposes to Amy.\nIn the first episode of season 11, Amy shocks Ramona by hugging her, as it was Ramona's advances that prompted Sheldon to propose.\n\n\n==== Ruchi ====\nRuchi (Swati Kapila); is a new co-worker of Bernadette's at Zangen who first appears in season 11. Ruchi used to live in India, and was in an arranged engagement, until she broke off the engagement and moved to America.\nIn her first appearance, Bernadette takes Ruchi out for drinks, though despite Howard's suggestion, refuses to set her up with Raj or Stuart. While out for drinks, Raj and Stuart show up uninvited (after Howard told them where they were) and both take an interest in Ruchi and try to win her over. Raj invites Ruchi out for drinks behind Stuart's back in a bid to get her alone. When Stuart shows up and later throws Raj under the bus, she tells them that she is not interested in dating anybody right now and just wants to make some friends. Raj later bumps into Ruchi at a bar while watching a cricket match with Howard and they eventually hook up. Afterwards, Ruchi wants to keep things casual with Raj, which he has difficult maintaining, especially after a date with her when she reveals that she does not believe in soul mates and sees romantic love more as a bio-chemical reaction. Despite this, Raj continues to see Ruchi to have sex with her. While she is on bed rest, Bernadette becomes convinced that Ruchi is trying to steal her job and asks Raj to investigate her suspicions. After revealing to Raj she is taking over all of Bernadette's projects, Raj tells Bernadette and tries to defend Ruchi like a boyfriend would, pointing out Bernadette's hypocrisy as she would most likely have stolen from other people's projects as well. When she finds out about this, Ruchi is not happy and promptly dumps Raj.\n\n\n==== Wil Wheaton ====\n\nWil Wheaton plays a fictionalized version of himself. Wil played Wesley Crusher in Star Trek: The Next Generation, a character that Sheldon idolized as a child. In 1995 Wheaton made Sheldon's \"mortal enemy\" list after Wheaton failed to show up at a fan convention. Sheldon took a 10-hour bus ride to attend the convention and was disappointed that Wheaton was a no-show.\nIn season three, Sheldon enters a trading-card game tournament (Mystic Warlords of Ka'a) to confront Wheaton. When Sheldon is about to defeat his hated rival, Wheaton tells him that he missed the 1995 \"Dixie Trek\" convention because his grandmother had died. In sympathy, Sheldon deliberately messes up his next move to benefit Wheaton. Wheaton reveals that he lied about his grandmother and then wins the game by taking advantage of the opening Sheldon leaves him. Wheaton later plays in a bowling match against Sheldon, where he uses gamesmanship again, breaking up Leonard and Penny to win.\nIn season four, Wheaton appears at a special screening of Raiders of the Lost Ark and uses his celebrity status to go to the front of a long line. This antagonizes Sheldon, who derides him as the \"Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe\". Wheaton and his entourage effectively prevented Sheldon and his friends from attending the screening when the last seat in the theater went to the person directly in front of them in line. Ultimately, Sheldon steals the reels containing the prints of the film and Wheaton leads a mob of angry audience members after Sheldon.\nIn season five, Wheaton invites the guys to a party at his house and appears to be genuinely sorry for his past actions, giving Sheldon a signed Wesley Crusher action figure as a way of thanking Sheldon for being a fan. His gesture is met with a renunciation of his \"mortal enemy\" status and a hug from Sheldon. Wheaton is invited to Howard's bachelor party, where he films the toasts and uploads them to the Internet, getting Howard and Raj in trouble with Bernadette.\nIn season six, Wheaton appears in a Star Trek-themed episode of Sheldon's web-series Fun with Flags and insults Amy after she criticizes his performance. After Sheldon ditches Amy to spend time with Wheaton, Amy becomes angry with Sheldon, who later unknowingly becomes intoxicated and almost starts a fist fight with Wheaton, demanding an apology.\nIn season seven, Amy calls Wheaton to cheer up Sheldon after Leonard disproves Sheldon's scientific discovery. Wheaton later gives Penny advice when she wrestles with whether to take a role in the sequel to a low-budget horror film in which she once starred. After taking the role, Penny finds that Wheaton is also appearing in the film. Wheaton and Penny are both fired from the film after an argument with the director.\nIn season eight, Wheaton invites Penny to appear on his podcast, where she talks about her acting career. Leonard and Penny get into an argument on air, much to the amusement of Wheaton.\nIn season nine, Wheaton introduces Adam Nimoy, son of Mr. Spock portrayer Leonard Nimoy, to Sheldon, for Sheldon to be interviewed for a documentary that Adam Nimoy is producing about Spock and his impact on popular culture. In a later episode, Wheaton fills in for Sheldon when he joins Leonard, Howard, and Raj for the midnight premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. When he arrives at the theater, the audience immediately jeers him for dressing as Spock, but Wheaton explains that he did so intentionally because he believes the audience should not take whether the film succeeds or fails so seriously. He appears again to celebrate Sheldon's birthday in the show's 200th episode, \"The Celebration Experimentation\".\nIn season eleven, Sheldon wants to replace Arthur Jeffries in the role of Professor Proton, following Jeffries' death, and asks Wheaton to be his acting coach for the part. However, when Wheaton somehow gets the part instead, Sheldon is dismayed and after many unsuccessful attempts to get his friends to boycott the franchise, he demands that Wheaton turn down the role. Wheaton refuses, claiming he wants to inspire young scientists and Sheldon begins to consider him an enemy again. However, after watching the show Sheldon likes Wheaton's portrayal of Prof. Proton and gets jealous when he sees that Wheaton has brought Howard to be a guest on his show. Although Sheldon apologizes to Wheaton, mending their friendship, Wheaton refuses to bring Sheldon as a guest on his show and instead invites Amy to be a guest on the show. At the end of season eleven, Wil is Sheldon and Amy's first choice to officiate their wedding ceremony, but is replaced when Mark Hamill becomes available.\nIn season twelve episode \"The D&D Vortex\", Wheaton as Professor Proton invites Sheldon to meet William Shatner, and Sheldon gets so excited that he then proceeds to throw up on him. When Sheldon shows up at Wheaton's house to apologize, Wheaton accepts the apology, but as he is in the middle of a private Dungeons & Dragons game featuring William Shatner, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kevin Smith, Joe Manganiello and Stuart, he shuts Sheldon out. When the guys find out about the game, they get Stuart to quit and Wheaton invites Leonard, asking him not to tell anyone. Leonard then tells Penny and she tells Amy and Bernadette; the girls stalk Wheaton in an attempt to get themselves invited when they hear that Manganiello from Magic Mike will be there. Because of that indiscretion, Wil kicks out Leonard and admonishes the guys for using him for his connections, and says that one of the worst things about being a celebrity is not knowing whether someone will like him for himself. To apologize, the guys invite Wil to play D&D with them at Leonard's apartment, but Wil, secretly in the middle of a game with Penny, Amy and Bernadette and the group, politely turns them down but offers to arrange for another time. Penny sits next to Shatner telling him he tells \"Grandpa Jokes\" and Bernadette tells Abdul-Jabbar how she and her father used to watch him, while Amy creeps out Manganiello and is moved away from him. Wheaton then allows them all to take a photo together and send it to the guys as payback, which Leonard himself admits they all deserved.\nWil Wheaton, LeVar Burton, Leonard Nimoy (in voice-over only), Brent Spiner, William Shatner and George Takei have all appeared on the show, making the Star Trek franchise the most represented franchise on the show in terms of guest appearances.\n\n\n==== Marissa Johnson ====\nMarissa Johnson (Lindsey Kraft) is married to Penny's ex-boyfriend, Zack Johnson. They meet with Leonard and Penny and they want Leonard to father their child since Zack is infertile.\n\n\n==== Mrs. Wolowitz ====\nMrs. Debbie Malvina Wolowitz (voiced by Carol Ann Susi) is Howard's over-protective, controlling, belittling, but loving and caring stereotypical Jewish mother. The character is not shown on-screen with the exception of one episode in season six in which her body, but not face, is briefly shown. Mrs. Wolowitz's raspy voice is heard usually in scenes at her house, which she shares with Howard. She talks to Howard always by yelling at him from another room, which results in awkward conversations with Howard yelling back at her. In a flashback, when the guys hear her yelling in a masculine voice, they ask Howard if that was his father, to which Howard replies, \"If she grows any more hair on her face, yes\".\nMrs. Wolowitz is also described as being enormously obese and wearing a wig and painted-on eyebrows. She seems to be oblivious to Howard's work as an engineer and treats him as though he is still a child. She is a master at Wheel of Fortune and guessing answers at game shows. She frequently refers to Leonard, Sheldon, and Raj as Howard's \"little friends\" (as in, \"I made some cookies and Hawaiian Punch for you and your little friends!\") and often refers to Caltech as a \"school\". Howard often makes references to his mother as being a \"crazy old lady\", but deep down, he is deeply attached to his mother and quite happy to be treated like a child. She is also noted to be on hormone replacement therapy, and she wants to \"play doctor\" with Raj when he asks to sleep over.\nWhen Howard reveals that he has proposed to Bernadette and she has accepted, she collapses, causing Howard to panic and dislocate his shoulder while trying to barge into the bathroom to help her. The timing leads him to believe that she may not like Bernadette (who is Catholic) and has suffered a heart attack from the shock of the news. In actuality, her fainting was due to food poisoning from the food she ate while meeting Bernadette and was completely unrelated to Howard's news. She has graciously accepted Bernadette as her daughter-in-law and is impressed by Bernadette's doctorate.\nIn an early episode, Howard attempts to move out after a fight with his mother, but has serious delusions that she is trying to force him to stay, when in actuality, she is urging him to move out, which leads to him staying. However, at the beginning of season six, she is so angry and upset about Howard moving in with Bernadette that she cries at the thought of being lonely, prompting him to promise he will convince Bernadette to move into their house instead. However, Bernadette remains firm but once Howard has finally moved out of his mother's house, he tells her a story about inviting his mother to be an assistant during his magic tricks as a child, helping her forget her loneliness, making Bernadette feel guilty and decide that she and Howard should sleep over at his mother's house from time to time to remind her that she is not alone. Later in the season, Howard asks Raj to look in on his mother to make sure she is okay while he and Bernadette are out on a trip. Raj enjoys dinner with her but as he is about to leave, she cries at being lonely, causing a sympathetic Raj to stay for dessert. He ends up sleeping in Howard's old bedroom, but once Howard warns him that his mother will use her loneliness and mother him in a desperate attempt to make him stay, he attempts to escape but is caught by her.\nIn season seven, Mrs. Wolowitz breaks her leg and keeps driving away the nurses hired to care for her. Even Penny rejects the job of caregiver after a very short time. After Stuart's comic-book store burns down, Howard invites Stuart to work for Mrs. Wolowitz; however, they develop a strange relationship, much to Howard's annoyance. Howard is also upset about the fact that now she dotes more heavily on Stuart, getting him premium cable, new clothes, money to rebuild the comic book store and even recording an answering machine message with him.\nFollowing the death of Carol Ann Susi, producers decided that Mrs. Wolowitz would die in the season-eight episode \"The Comic Book Store Regeneration\". Howard receives a phone call while in the store from his aunt Gladys in Florida, whom Mrs. Wolowitz had gone to visit. She says that Mrs. Wolowitz lay down for a nap and never woke up afterwards. Howard and Bernadette then move back into Howard's old home, and Stuart decides to stay with them. He eventually moves out halfway through season nine, allowing them to redecorate. Mrs. Wolowitz is also in the season-eleven episode \u201cThe Bitcoin Entanglement\u201d, using archive recordings from previous episodes.\n\n\n==== Wyatt ====\n\nWyatt (Keith Carradine) is Penny's father. He comes to visit, and Penny feels compelled to involve Leonard in a ruse to make him think they are still together. (Wyatt reveals that he favors the successful Leonard over Penny's other \"loser\" boyfriends.) When the plot is revealed, he gets mad at Penny and feigns anger at Leonard, but after Penny leaves the room, he encourages Leonard to keep trying to get Penny back (because he wants his grandchildren to \"grow up in a house without wheels\"). Strangely, though, in the first episode where Leonard's mother visits, Penny tearfully reveals her rough childhood, saying that Wyatt wanted a boy and even called her \"slugger\" until she reached puberty. Wyatt appears again in season nine, when Penny finally plucks up the courage to tell her father she eloped with Leonard. Wyatt is happy, but he also confesses that he killed Penny's pet pig a year ago. In the season 10 premiere, \"The Conjugal Conjecture\", he comes to Pasadena with his wife and son to attend Leonard and Penny's re-wedding and during the ceremony he walks Penny down the aisle, welcomes Leonard to their family and advises him not to lend Penny's brother any money.\n\n\n==== Zack Johnson ====\nZack Johnson (Brian Thomas Smith) is a dim-witted but friendly beefcake type whom Penny dates on and off after her second break-up with Leonard. Zack works as the menu designer for restaurants that are owned by or which have hired his father's company to design their menus.\nIn season three, Leonard invites Penny and Zack up to the roof to watch his experiment of bouncing laser beams off the moon; Zack misunderstands what is happening, and thinks they are going to blow up the moon. Later, Penny and Zach go out to a party, but she is so put off at how stupid he is that she runs back to Leonard for sex, saying he ruined her ability to tolerate stupid men.\nIn season four, Zack runs into Penny, Bernadette, and Amy at a restaurant, and Amy becomes physically attracted to him. Sheldon arranges a meeting between Zack and Amy to satisfy her \"urges\", but his lack of intellect immediately discourages Amy. Unlike Penny's other boyfriends, Zack considers Leonard, Howard, Sheldon, and Raj (whom he calls \"the science dudes\") to be \"cool\" and makes a genuine effort to get to know them, even treating them as his friends. After accompanying them on a trip to the comic-book store (where Raj and he bond over a mutual fondness for Archie comics), he enters a New Year's Eve costume party with them, portraying Superman in their version of the Justice League. In \"The Toast Derivation\", Sheldon invites him over for a party, where he bonds with Kripke and Stuart, as well.\nIn season seven, it is discovered that Zack and Penny have been unknowingly married for three years after the two were intoxicated and attended a wedding chapel in Las Vegas (they were not aware that weddings in Las Vegas are real). Penny invites him to Mrs. Wolowitz's house for Thanksgiving, where they get the marriage annulled.\nIn season nine, episode 22, Zack's observations indicate he is, in some respects, more observant and smarter than \"the science dudes\".\nIn season ten, episode 22, Zack and his fianc\u00e9e, Sarah, plan a double date with Penny and Leonard, but Sarah does not turn up. Zack offers Penny a job at his menu printing company which she accepts, but when she calls Zack he tells her that Sarah is uncomfortable with them working together.\nIn season eleven, episode 9, it is revealed that seven years prior, Penny gave Zack Leonard's old laptop, which Leonard had given her while they were dating. Penny and Leonard arrive at Zack's apartment to retrieve the laptop, where he shows them that Penny had made a video she intended to send to Leonard apologizing for their break-up.\nIn season twelve, episode 12, Penny runs into Zack again after he buys her, Bernadette and Amy drinks. He reveals that he has sold his menu company and become rich from the profits, and invites her and Leonard to dinner at his yacht with him and his new wife, Marissa Johnson. Penny and Leonard proceed to make fun of the newlyweds on how dumb they are until Zack and Marissa ask Leonard to be their sperm donor in hopes of conceiving a child. Because Penny said that she never wants children, Penny and Leonard argue about the situation, but eventually Penny agrees to support whatever decision Leonard makes. In season twelve, episode 15, Leonard ultimately cannot go through with it and tells Zack to ask Sheldon, whom declines after Amy is outraged at the idea.\n\n\n=== Young Sheldon supporting characters ===\n\n\n==== Billy Sparks ====\nBilly Sparks (Wyatt McLure) is a boy who lives with his parents and sister next to the Coopers and Meemaw. He has been mentioned in The Big Bang Theory as one of Sheldon's childhood bullies, although in Young Sheldon he is rather good-natured and at times is friends with Sheldon, but is shown to be extremely dim-witted and simple-minded.\n\n\n==== Brenda Sparks ====\nBrenda Sparks (Melissa Peterman) is Billy Sparks's mother who works at the bowling alley frequented by Meemaw. She is not a very pleasant person and often clashes with Mary.\n\n\n==== Dale Ballard ====\nCoach Dale Ballard (Craig T. Nelson) is a baseball coach who lets Missy play after he says no and Meemaw intervenes. He also ends up dating Meemaw after her breakup with Dr. Sturgis.\n\n\n==== Dr. John Sturgis ====\nDr. John Sturgis (Wallace Shawn) is a physics professor at the university East Texas Tech that Sheldon attends part-time. Dr. Sturgis is initially a pen pal of Sheldon Cooper, before the child prodigy audits his quantum chromodynamics course. Dr. Sturgis is instantly smitten with Sheldon's Meemaw and they begin dating, much to Sheldon's approval, but also to Sheldon's urging.\nHe is also rather childish like going to bed at 7:30 and asking Meemaw's permission to do things as if she were his mother.\n\n\n==== Herschel Sparks ====\nHerschel Sparks (Billy Gardell) is a neighbor of the Cooper family and Meemaw, the husband of Brenda Sparks, and the father of Billy and Bobbi Sparks. He runs his own garage, where he offers Georgie a part-time job. Georgie turns out to be a wonderful employee, something that makes George and Herschel happy and stunned. Herschel is often bossed around by his wife, something that he and George bond over since George is often bossed around by Mary as well.\n\n\n==== Paige ====\nPaige Swanson (Mckenna Grace) is a 10-year-old child prodigy whom Sheldon meets in one of his classes with Dr. Sturgis. She turns out to be a bit smarter than him and this causes Dr. Sturgis to pay attention a lot to her, something that makes Sheldon jealous, so Meemaw has to step in. Unlike Sheldon, she is very sweet, has excellent social skills, and is capable of being friends with non-intellectuals, as is reflected in her friendship with Missy.\n\n\n==== Tam Nguyen ====\nTam Nguyen (Ryan Phuong \u2013 YS / Robert Wu \u2013 TBBT) is a Vietnamese-American boy who, in Young Sheldon, is Sheldon's classmate and only friend. His father Le Nguyen, and mother Trang Nguyen, run a store called \"Medford Mart\". He has two sisters, Mai and Kim-Ly. \nTam laments his difficult childhood in war-torn Vietnam, which included his father being incarcerated in a detention camp, and his encounter with the Ku Klux Klan when he first arrived in America. Tam takes his frustration out on other people, such as Sheldon's father George. He has a troubled relationship with his parents, having been treated badly by both of them after moving to the United States. The episode \"A Loaf of Bread and a Grand Old Flag\" suggests that Tam has a good relationship with his sisters, as he talks about starting a labor union with them and taking their parents to court.\nBy the time of The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon and Tam are no longer friends. In the Season 12 episode \"The Tam Turbulence\", they met up again after not speaking in 20 years. When Leonard, Howard and Raj find out about Tam, having never previously heard of him, they try to meet him. They do so at Caltech, assuming that Sheldon was to blame for the end of the friendship. It turns out that when Sheldon was moving to California he had asked Tam to move there with him; Tam agreed, but after meeting a girl named Beth decided to stay in Texas instead. He and Beth married soon after and had one son and at least one other child. Sheldon and Tam make up at the end of the episode, with Tam saying that he was confident Sheldon would make other friends and be successful, and that he has been happy with Beth and their children all these years and has had a very happy life overall, in contrast to his abusive childhood.\n\n\n==== Veronica Duncan ====\nVeronica Duncan (Isabel May) is Georgie Cooper's most significant love interest on Young Sheldon. \nInitially introduced as a popular and \"easy\" girl, Veronica becomes a devout Christian after going through a \"Sin House\" one Halloween. Georgie is obsessed with her and frequently takes every advantage he can to be close to her or impress her in any way, such as agreeing to be baptized with her (only to attempt \u2013 comically and painfully unsuccessfully \u2013 to steal a kiss), defend her against an abusive step-parent (after Mary had taken her in), or coming up with a series of get-rich-quick schemes to buy her expensive gifts (which she rejects, though she seems more receptive towards a bracelet made of the candy he was selling in his latest scheme).\n\n\n== Minor characters ==\n\nDr. Alfred Hofstadter (Judd Hirsch): Leonard's father, an anthropologist who once worked with famed archaeologist Louis Leakey (Leonard's middle name is Leakey in consequence). He was miserable in his marriage to Leonard's mother Beverly, who was always annoying and was unmotherly towards their children. Alfred claimed she was cold and emasculating, and had not shown him any physical affection for years. When Leonard was six, he walked in on his parents naked, and she was swatting his rear end with Leonard's brand-new ping-pong paddle, and as a result in season three, the two were revealed to be getting divorced after he had had an affair with a waitress. In his first appearance in \"The Convergence-Convergence\" during his visit for Leonard and Penny's rewedding, he meets Mary Cooper and the two get along great as they have each other's nice, gentle, and caring personalities, bonding over their mutual dislike of Beverly, and their admiration of each other's beliefs. The two of them end up fighting with Beverly at the restaurant during the pre-ceremony dinner and the two leave together and after finding out they are staying at the same hotel, they decide to share a cab and it is implied that the two hook up. In \"The Conjugal Conjecture\", Alfred is revealed to have not slept with Mary, but they still plan on seeing each other in the future. In the ceremony, he says that though Beverly and he do not bring the best out in each other, something wonderful did come out of their relationship: Leonard. Beverly agrees. On the way to the airport, they appear to be civil for about a minute until they start bickering over Leonard's driving.\nAlthea Robinson (Vernee Watson): makes an appearance in the pilot episode as an attendant at a sperm bank, and then makes three appearances as an emergency room nurse in \"The Peanut Reaction\" episode (season one) and \"The Robotic Manipulation\" episode (season four), and as a ward nurse in \"The Werewolf Transformation\" (season five).

In the series finale, she finally made an onscreen appearance and she resembles her mother.\nNeil Michael Wolowitz, Howard and Bernadette's baby son, born in the episode \"The Neonatal Nomenclature\". Hours before his birth, Howard is unhappy that Bernadette has already decided to name the baby after her father, Michael, without consulting him first. He doesn't agree with this and is even more disturbed that many of the names he has thought of come from her ex-boyfriends in college. Eventually Howard and Bernadette compromise as she gives birth to Neil, after Neil Armstrong and Neil Diamond, with Michael as the middle name.

          "It was so easy to reserve a room at a time great for us. We found plenty of easy parking. The staff was WONDERFUL, patient, and helpful. I wish we lived here because this is so fun. We did Batman & Leaks because we got a discount. They were hard but fun!",
          "Not great, but not bad either.  We did the room with the Egyptian theme and made it out with a little under 10 minutes to spare with three people.  It was one small room and the with basically 5 chests you need to open.  I won't give away too much,but if you are expecting an elaborate multi room game,this is NOT it.",

        "wiki": "The history of the Union Pacific Railroad stretches from 1862 to the present. For operations of the current railroad, see Union Pacific Railroad; for the holding company that owns the current railroad, see Union Pacific Corporation.\nThere have been four railroads called Union Pacific: Union Pacific Rail Road, Union Pacific Railway, Union Pacific Railroad (Mark I), and Union Pacific Railroad (Mark II). This article covers the Union Pacific Rail Road (UPRR, 1862\u20131880), Union Pacific Railway (1880\u20131897), and Union Pacific Railroad (Mark I)(UP, 1897\u20131998).  For the history of the Union Pacific Railroad (Mark II), see Union Pacific and Southern Pacific Transportation Company.\n\n\n== Beginnings: 19th century ==\nThe original company, Union Pacific Rail Road (UPRR), was created and funded by the federal government by Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862 and 1864. The laws were passed as war measures to forge closer ties with California and Oregon, which otherwise took six months to reach. UPRR remained under partial federal control until the 1890s.  Its management was noted for many feuds and high turnover.  The UPRR main line started in Council Bluffs, Iowa and moved west to link up with the Central Pacific Railroad line, which was built eastward from Sacramento.\nConstruction on the UPRR main line was delayed until the American Civil War ended in 1865. Some 300 miles of main line track were built in 1865\u201366 over the flat prairies. The Rocky Mountains posed a much more dramatic challenge but the crews had learned to work at a much faster pace with 240 miles built in 1867 and 555 miles in 1868\u201369.  The two lines were joined together in Utah on May 10, 1869, hence creating the first transcontinental railroad in North America. Interstate 80, built in the 1950s, paralleled the UPRR main line.\nIn 1870 the fare in coach from Omaha to San Francisco was $33.20 (sleeper cars cost extra). The train stopped for meals at lunch rooms along the way. Passenger traffic for the long trip was light at first\u20142,000 a month in the 1870s, growing to 10,000 a month in the 1880s.Wall Street speculator Jay Gould (1836\u20131892) took control of the UPRR in 1874, as well as the smaller Kansas Pacific Railway based in Kansas City. He merged the two into the Union Pacific Railway in 1880, giving the Union Pacific new markets in the wheat and ranching regions of Kansas and eastern Colorado.  Branches were opened to mining districts in Montana, Idaho, and Utah and (until 1893) to farmlands in Oregon.  Despite severe austerity measures the Union Pacific was unable to repay its old government loans.  Most of the wheat farmers joined the People's Party a Populist movement in the 1890s and engaged in heated anti-railroad rhetoric. The Populists were soon voted out and had no lasting impact on the Union Pacific.\nIn the Panic of 1893 a financial crisis, the Union Pacific Railway, like 153 other American railroads, went bankrupt. The trains continued to operate but the bondholders lost their investment. In 1897, a new Union Pacific Railroad (UP) was formed and absorbed the Union Pacific Railway; this new railroad reverted to the original Union Pacific name of the original company but now pronounced \"Railroad\" and not \"Rail Road\". Empire builder E. H. Harriman (1848\u20131909) purchased the UP for a song. He upgraded its 3,000 miles of trackage, modernized its equipment and merged it with the Southern Pacific, which dominated California.  The Supreme Court broke up the merger in 1910. From 1910 to 1980, there was little growth in the UP, which dominated the farming, ranching, mining and tourist trade in a region stretching from Omaha and Kansas City in the East, to Salt Lake City and Denver in the West. Economically, the UP provided transcontinental service, as well as shipping out wheat and other crops, cattle, and mining products and bringing in consumer items and industrial goods from the East.\nThere was little expansion 1910\u20131980 but after that the UP system grew to over 32,000 miles of track with large lines like the Southern Pacific, the Missouri Pacific Railroad and the Missouri\u2013Kansas\u2013Texas Railroad becoming part of the UP system as well as smaller ones.\n\n\n=== Finances ===\n\nThe UPRR main line was completed in 1869, at a cost of $109 million. About $50 million was spent on the construction work. The rest included a profit of about $13\u201316 million to the owners, possibly several million dollars in bribes to Congressman and especially heavy discounts in the sale of bonds of a railroad that most investors thought would never make a profit. The original UPRR was entangled in the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal, exposed in 1872. Its independent construction company, the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier, had bribed congressmen. The UPRR itself was not guilty but it did get bad publicity.\nThe Panic of 1873 another financial crisis, led to financial troubles but not bankruptcy. Jay Gould took control in 1873 and built a viable railroad that depended on shipments by local farmers and ranchers. Gould immersed himself in every operational and financial detail of the system. He built up encyclopedic knowledge, then acted decisively to shape its destiny. \"He revised its financial structure, waged its competitive struggles, captained its political battles, revamped its administration, formulated its rate policies and promoted the development of resources along its lines.\". Gould created the new Union Pacific Railway and merged the original UPRR, the Union Pacific Rail Road, into the new Union Pacific Railway.\n\nAfter Gould's death, the Union Pacific Railway slipped and declared bankruptcy during the Panic of 1893. In 1897, a new Union Pacific Railroad (UP) was formed and absorbed the Union Pacific Railway, this new railroad reverted to the original Union Pacific name of the original company but now pronounced \"Railroad\" and not \"Rail Road\".E. H. Harriman bought the line cheaply, and made it much more efficient and highly profitable. He tried to incorporate it into a vast western system but the Supreme Court blocked his attempts as monopolistic.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nThomas C. Durant had overall charge of the UPRR construction program. He selected routes on the basis of how cheap they were to construct, for that would maximize profits on the fixed congressional loans. He did not give emphasis to the long-term economic potential of the area served. He, therefore, vetoed the civil engineers who wanted to use the otherwise highly attractive South Pass route in Wyoming.Building the line came in stages: first, the surveyors (often with Army protection) Laid out the precise line to minimize the grade and the need for bridges and trestles. Then came the grading party with plows and shovels. Finally came the ties and the rails, along with the telegraph line, signals, sidings and switches. Starting in summer 1865 Omaha became the logistics base for thousands of tons of rails, ties, tools, and supplies. As soon as a few miles of track was ready, supplies were moved to a forward supply point, and teams of horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons carried them to the work point. Eventually, the teams could lay several miles of track per day \u2014 the record was 10 miles. It was largely a pick-and-shovel and wheelbarrow job, with most of the unskilled work done by Irish immigrants.The original UPRR 1,087 miles (1,749 km) of track started in Council Bluffs, Iowa.  Winter and spring caused severe problems as the Missouri River froze over in the winter; but not well enough to support a railroad track plus train. The train ferries had to be replaced by sleighs each winter. Starting in 1873, the railroad traffic crossed the river over the new 2,750 feet (840 m) long, eleven span, Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge to Omaha, Nebraska.)  The main line bridged the Elkhorn River and then crossed over the new 1,500 feet (460 m) Loup River bridge as it followed the north side of the Platte River valley west through Nebraska along the general path of the Oregon, Mormon and California Trails.\nDuring the winter of 1865\u201366, former Union General John S. Casement, the new Chief Engineer, assembled men and supplies to push the railroad rapidly west.  To protect the railroad's surveying and hunting parties, the U.S. Army instituted active cavalry patrols that grew larger as the Indians grew more aggressive. Temporary, \"Hell on wheels\" towns, made mostly of canvas tents, accompanied the railroad as construction headed west. Most faded away but some became permanent settlements.The railroad bridged the North Platte River over a 2,600-foot-long (790 m) bridge at North Platte, Nebraska, in December 1866 after completing about 240 miles (390 km) of track that year. In late 1866, General Grenville M. Dodge was appointed Chief Engineer on the Union Pacific; Casement continued to work as chief construction boss and his brother Daniel Casement continued as financial officer.  The North Platte/South Pass route was popular with wagon trains but not attractive to the railroad, for it was about 150 miles (240 km) longer and much more expensive to construct up the narrow, steep and rocky canyons of the North Platte.  By 1867, a new route was found and surveyed that went along part of the South Platte River in western Nebraska and after entering what is now the state of Wyoming, ascended a gradual sloping ridge between Lodgepole Creek and Crow Creek to 8,200 feet (2,500 m) Evans pass was discovered in 1864. From North Platte, Nebraska (elevation 2,834 feet (864 m)), the railroad proceeded westward and upward along a new path across the Nebraska Territory and Wyoming Territory along the north bank of the South Platte River and into what later become the state of Wyoming at Lone Pine, Wyoming. Evan's Pass was located between the new railroad towns of Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Laramie, Wyoming. The new route surveyed across Wyoming was over 150 miles (240 km) shorter, had a flatter profile, allowed for cheaper and easier railroad construction, and also went closer by Denver and the known coalfields in the Wasatch and Laramie Ranges.  The railroad gained about 3,200 feet (980 m) in the 220 miles (350 km) climb to Cheyenne from North Platte, Nebraska\u2014about 15 feet (4.6 m) per mile (1.6 km)--a very gentle slope of less than one degree average. This \"new\" route had never become an emigrant route because it lacked the water and grass to feed the emigrants' oxen and mules. Steam locomotives did not need grass, and the railroad drilled wells for water.  Coal was mined in Wyoming by the time the UP arrived. Coal shipments by rail were also looked on as a potentially major source of income\u2014this potential is still being realized, as Wyoming is the nation's largest coal producer in the 21st century.\n\nThe original Union Pacific reached the new railroad town of Cheyenne in December 1867, having laid about 270 miles (430 km) that year. They paused over the winter, preparing to push the track over Evans' (Sherman's) pass. At 8,247 feet (2,514 m), Evans/Sherman's pass is the highest point reached on the transcontinental railroad.  The Dale Creek Crossing bridge was one of their more difficult railroad engineering challenges. Located 35 miles (56 km) from Evans pass, UP connected to Denver and its Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company railroad line in 1870. Cheyenne became a major railroad center and was equipped with extensive railroad yards, maintenance facilities and a Union Pacific presence. Its location made it a good base for helper locomotives to couple to trains with snowplows to clear the tracks of winter snow or help haul heavy freight over Evan's pass. The Union Pacific's junction with the Denver Railroad with its connection to Kansas City, Kansas, Kansas City, Missouri and the railroads east of the Missouri River again increased Cheyenne's importance as the junction of two major railroads.\nThe railroad established towns along the way: Fremont, Elkhorn, Grand Island, North Platte, Ogallala, Sidney, Nebraska as the railroad followed the Platte River across Nebraska territory.  Interstate 80 now follows nearly the same route.  In the Dakota Territory (Wyoming) it built the new towns of Laramie, Rawlins  and Evanston, Wyoming, as well as many more fuel and water stops. The Green River was bridged on October 1, 1868\u2014the last big river to cross. Evanston became a significant train maintenance shop town equipped to carry out extensive repairs on the cars and steam locomotives.\nIn the Utah Territory, the railroad once again diverted from the main emigrant trails to cross the Wasatch Mountains and went down the rugged Echo Canyon (Summit County, Utah) and Weber River canyon. To speed up construction as much as possible, Union Pacific contracted several thousand Mormon workers to cut, fill, trestle, bridge, blast and tunnel its way down the rugged Weber River Canyon to Ogden, Utah ahead of the railroad construction. The Mormon and Union Pacific rail work was joined in the area of the present-day border between Utah and Wyoming. The longest of four tunnels built in Weber Canyon was 757-foot-long (231 m) Tunnel 2.  The tunnels were all made with the new nitroglycerine explosive which expedited work but caused some fatal accidents.The tracks reached Ogden on March 27, 1869; then skirted north of the Great Salt Lake to Brigham City and Corinne, Utah, before finally connecting with the Central Pacific Railroad at Promontory Summit in Utah territory on May 10, 1869.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\nIn the 1860s, the original UP purchased three short Mormon-built roads: the Utah Central Railroad extending south from Ogden to Salt Lake City, the Utah Southern Railroad extending south from Salt Lake City into the Utah Valley, and the Utah Northern Railroad extending north from Ogden into Idaho. It built or purchased local lines that gave it access to key locations: Denver, Colorado, Portland, Oregon, and to the Pacific Northwest.  It acquired the Kansas Pacific (originally called the Union Pacific, Eastern Division, though an entirely separate railroad). It also owned narrow gauge trackage into the mining districts high in the Colorado rockies and a standard gauge line south from Denver across New Mexico into Texas.\n\n\n=== Business standards ===\nJan Richard  Heier argues that, \"America's greatest technological achievement of the nineteenth century\" was the transcontinental railroad. He adds that the political scandal over the disposition of millions of dollars in government bonds led to Congressional hearings that showed the weakness of accounting methods. The reporting of assets, liabilities, and capital followed standards of the day. The companies had to invent new methods for accounting for stock dividends and bond discounts.Congress distrusted the UP, and forced it to hire as the new president a distinguished member of the Adams family, Charles Francis Adams, Jr. in 1884. Adams had long promoted various reform ideas, but had little practical experience in management. As railroad president, he was successful in getting a good press for the UP, and set up libraries along the route to allow his employees to better themselves. He had poor results dealing with the Knights of Labor labor union. When the Knights of Labor refuse extra work in Wyoming in 1885, Adams hired Chinese workers. The result was the Rock Springs massacre, that killed scores of Chinese, and drove all the rest out of Wyoming. He tried to build a complex network of alliances with other businesses, but they provided little help to the UP.  He had great difficulty in making decisions, and in coordinating his subordinates. Adams was unable to stanch the worsening financial condition of the UP, and in 1890 Gould forced his resignation.\n\n\n=== Land sales and settlers ===\nIn addition to charges for freight and passenger service, the UP made its money from land sales, especially to farmers and ranchers. The UP land grant gave it ownership of 12,800 acres per mile of finished track. The government kept every other section of land, so it also had 12,800 acres to sell or give away to homesteaders.  The UP's goal was not to make a profit, but rather to build up a permanent clientele of farmers and townspeople who would form a solid basis for routine sales and purchases.  The UP, like other major lines, opened sales offices in the East and in Europe, advertised heavily, and offered attractive package rates for farmer to sell out and move his entire family, and his tools, to the new destination. In 1870 the UP offered rich Nebraska farmland at five dollars an acre, with one fourth down and the remainder in three annual installments. It gave a 10 percent discount for cash.  Farmers could also homestead land, getting it free from the federal government after five years, or even sooner by paying $1.50 an acre. Sales were improved by offering large blocks to ethnic colonies of European immigrants. Germans and Scandinavians, for example, could sell out their small farms back home and buy much larger farms for the same money. European ethnics comprised half of the population of Nebraska in the late 19th century. Married couples were usually the homesteaders, but single women were also eligible on their own.\n\n\n== 20th century ==\n\n\n=== Harriman ===\n\nE. H. Harriman (1848-1909) in 1898 became chairman of the UP executive committee, and from that time until his death his word was law on the Union Pacific system. He merged the UP with the larger Southern Pacific in 1900 to obtain greater efficiency and more monopoly power in the Southwest. The Justice Department sued, and in 1912 the Supreme Court separated the two companies because the suppression of competition was in restraint of trade and violated the 1890 Sherman antitrust act.\n\n\n=== 1920s ===\nLabor unrest was generally low in the United States after the great strikes of 1919, but there was tension among the shopmen of the Union Pacific. The railroad cut wage rates in Las Vegas, Nevada, the site of major repair shops. On 1 July 1922, boilermakers, blacksmiths, electricians, carmen, and sheet metal workers went on strike.  The over-the-rails workforce did not join them.  Local public opinion at first favored the strikers. After episodes of violence by striking pickets, the railroad obtained a federal injunction restraining against threats or attacks.  The railroad also threatened to move the maintenance facilities to more favorable city. Public support for the strike fell away. The strike collapsed in September, and union membership collapsed.\n\n\n=== Statistical trends ===\n\nIn the tables \"UP\" includes OSL-OWR&N-LA&SL-StJ&G. 1925\u20131944 passenger-mile totals do not include Laramie North Park & Western, Saratoga & Encampment Valley, or Pacific & Idaho Northern, and none of the totals includes Spokane International or Mount Hood. From the ICC annual reports, except 1979 is from Moody's.\n\nOn December 31, 1925 UP-OSL-OWRN-LA&SL-StJ&GI operated 9,834 route-miles and 15,265 track-miles. At the end of 1980, Union Pacific operated 9,266 route-miles and 15,647 miles of track. Moody's shows 220,697 million revenue ton-miles in 1993 on the expanded system (17,835 route-miles at the end of the year).\n\n\n== Former services ==\n\nBetween 1869 and 1971, Union Pacific operated passenger service throughout its historic \"Overland Route.\" The last passenger train operated by UP was the westbound City of Los Angeles, arriving at LA Union Station on May 2. Since then, Union Pacific has satisfied its common carrier requirements by hosting Amtrak trains (see \u00a7 Hosted Amtrak trains).Named passenger trains once operated by Union Pacific include the following:\n\nButte Special (operated between Salt Lake City and Butte, Montana)\nChallenger (operated jointly with the Chicago and North Western Railway until October 1955, and thereafter the Milwaukee Road)\nCity of Denver (operated jointly with the Chicago and North Western Railway until October 1955, and thereafter the Milwaukee Road)\nCity of Las Vegas; later, the Las Vegas Holiday Special (1956\u20131967)\nCity of Los Angeles (operated jointly with the Chicago and North Western Railway until October 1955, and thereafter the Milwaukee Road)\nCity of Portland (operated jointly with the Chicago and North Western Railway until October 1955, and thereafter the Milwaukee Road)\nCity of Salina (1934\u20131940)\nCity of San Francisco (operated jointly with the Chicago and North Western Railway and the Southern Pacific Railroad; after October, 1955 the Milwaukee Road assumed operation of the Chicago-Omaha leg of the service)\nCity of St. Louis\nColumbine (in service to Chicago and Denver, beginning in the 1920s)\nForty-Niner (operated between Chicago and Oakland)\nGold Coast (operated between Chicago and Oakland/Los Angeles)\nIdahoan (operated between Cheyenne and Portland)\nLos Angeles Limited (in service 1905)\nOverland Flyer; renamed the Overland Limited in 1890 (1887\u20131963)\nPacific Limited (operated between Chicago and Ogden, Utah where it was split to serve Los Angeles and San Francisco, beginning in 1913. It was combined with the Portland Rose in 1947.)\nPony Express (operated between Kansas City and Los Angeles 1926\u20131954)\nPortland Rose (in service between Chicago and Portland, beginning in the 1920s)\nSan Francisco Overland (originally operated between Chicago and Oakland, later terminated only at St. Louis)\nSpokane (operated between Spokane and Portland)\nUtahn (operated between Cheyenne and Los Angeles)\nYellowstone Special (operated between Pocatello, Idaho and West Yellowstone, Montana)\n\n\n== Historical Presidents ==\nPresidents of all four incarnations of the Union Pacific Railroad:William Butler Ogden (1862\u20131863)\nJohn Adams Dix (1863\u20131865)\nOliver Ames, Jr. (1866\u20131871)\nThomas Alexander Scott (1871\u20131872)\nHorace F.

It was the last steam locomotive built for UP and has been in continuous service since its 1944 delivery. Many people know the engine as the No. 8444, since an extra '4' was added to its number in 1962 to distinguish it from a diesel numbered in the 800 series. It regained its rightful number in June 1989, after the diesel was retired and donated to the Nevada Southern Railroad Museum in Boulder City, Nevada. Overhauled in 1996, it was taken out of service on June 24, 1999, after the collapse of boiler tubes made of the wrong material. It returned to service on November 10, 2004. It was rebuilt again in 2015 and returned to service in 2016. In addition to being one of UP's oldest locomotives, it is the only steam locomotive to never be officially retired from a North American Class I railroad.\nUP 4014 is a 4-8-8-4 Big Boy class freight steam locomotive. It is the largest operational steam locomotive in the world. Delivered in 1941, the locomotive operated in revenue service until it was withdrawn in 1961. It was donated in late 1961 to the RailGiants Train Museum in Pomona, California, where it became one of the eight Big Boys preserved around the United States. On July 23, 2013, UP announced that it would reacquire No. 4014 from the Southern California chapter of the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society in Pomona, with the goal of restoring it to service. In 2014, No. 4014 was moved from Pomona to the Union Pacific West Colton yard, then to Cheyenne. Restoration to full operating condition was completed in May 2019; its first excursion took place that month.There was previously a third steam engine: UP 3985, a Challenger class dual-service steam locomotive. Restored in 1981, it operated in excursion service until being taken out of service in 2010. It was retired in 2020 and now remains stored in Cheyenne.\n\n\n=== Diesel ===\nUP 951, 949 and 963B are a trio of streamlined General Motors Electro-Motive Division E9 passenger locomotives built in 1955. They are used to haul the UP business cars during excursions and charter specials. While their external appearance remains almost entirely of 1955 vintage, the original twin 1,200-hp 12-cylinder 567 series engines have been replaced with single EMD 16-645E 2,000 hp (1.5 MW) engines (which were salvaged from wrecked GP38-2 locomotives) and the electrical and control equipment similarly upgraded. The set is made of two A units and one B unit. The B unit contains an HEP engine-generator set for powering passenger cars. The two A units were recently modified to eliminate the nose doors for safety during a collision.\nUP 6936 is an EMD DDA40X \"Centennial\" diesel-electric locomotive, the last of its class in service. The largest diesel locomotives ever built, they were manufactured specifically for UP. The locomotive was damaged in a 2000 collision with a dump truck at a grade crossing in Livonia, Louisiana. Another collision took place in 2007.\n\n\n=== Preserved locomotives ===\n\nIn addition to the historic fleet outlined above kept by UP itself, a large number of UP locomotives survive elsewhere. Many locomotives were donated to towns along the Union Pacific tracks, for instance, as well as locomotives donated to museums.\n\nUP 18, 26. From 1948 to 1970, UP operated a series of gas turbine-electric locomotives. These were ultimately retired due to rising fuel costs.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Elmwood Park neighborhood in Omaha, Nebraska is a historically significant area that was developed in the late 19th and early 20th century. It extends from Leavenworth Street on the north to Center Street on the south; from South 50th Street on the east to South 72nd Street on the west. Home to ethnic Swede celebrations through the 1950s, today the neighborhood's park hosts the city's \"Shakespeare on the Green\" festival.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore the neighborhood was created, the area was the focus of the first court trial ever held in the Nebraska Territory. The case took place in 1857 when F.M. Woods brought a case against J. Pentecost for land theft. Defended by Nebraska Territorial politician Edward Morearty, Pentecost won the trial.In the 1880s C.C. and J.E. George laid out Happy Hollow Boulevard and developed the area south of Dodge and west of 50th to Elmwood Park. They filled in the creek that ran along 50th Street and added sidewalks and streetlights. Homes in the area reflected the Colonial, Georgian and Tudor Revival styles. Omaha annexed Elmwood Park and the surrounding neighborhood on April 24, 1917.\n\n\n== Park and boulevard ==\nIn 1889 H.W.S. Cleveland recommended that Omaha acquire a park large enough to shut out city sights and sounds in order to refresh the senses. Elmwood Park, founded in 1889 at 802 South 60th Street, was one of Omaha's largest parks through the 1950s. Soon after the city acquired an initial 55-acre (220,000 m2) donation of land for the park, the Omaha Bee described it as a \"wild and romantic place... containing a wooded ravine that followed the course of a small stream.\" They continued, \"There are all manner of shady nooks in this dell, and some of the largest forest trees in this section of the country are to be seen in it.\" The park, along with Happy Hollow Boulevard, was part of Cleveland's parks and boulevard plan for Omaha. Today the boulevard runs north from Elmwood Park past the University of Nebraska at Omaha campus and Memorial Park, onward to Benson.\nThe Elmwood Park pavilion was built in 1909 at a cost of $5,323.   Designed by F. A. Henninger, the general contractors were Anderson-Freidman Construction.   Originally an open-air structure, it was one of the first structures in Omaha built of cast concrete.  A series of colonnade arches flank the sides of the Spanish Mission-style building.   Deemed unsafe in 1939, it was closed to the public shortly thereafter.  The stuccoed veneer and red tile roofed structure was updated and enclosed in 1940.  In 1987 it was refurbished with $100,000 from a special bond issue.   It is now enclosed and available for public rental.\nIn 1912 a local businessman donated a totem pole to the park that stood there through the 1930s, and the park was the site of camping grounds through the 1950s. The Elmwood Park Golf Course was opened in 1916, and featured ravines, grassy fields and roadways throughout. By 1917, the park had grown to 208.13 acres (0.8423 km2), and it was the second largest in the city. From the late 19th century through the 1930s an annual park was held for Omaha's African American community at the park, with as many as 10,000 people attending. The University of Nebraska at Omaha relocated from its North Omaha campus to a 30-acre (120,000 m2) parcel next to the park in 1937, sealing the park's size permanently. In the 1940s native Omaha billionaire Warren Buffett set up a golf ball stand at the golf course in the park. Renovated again in 1987, the city spent $100,000 from a bond issue to replace windows and repair restrooms at the pavilion. The park received a $1 million renovation in 1993, and in 2000 the Peter Kiewit Foundation made a significant grant to the city that allowed the city to renovate the park\u2019s historic spring area, improve the swimming pool and create new entrance signage.\nToday Elmwood Park includes the 18-hole golf course, two baseball fields and a swimming pool. There are also paths and trails for biking and walking; a lagoon, picnic areas, restrooms, the historic pavilion, open spaces and a historic marker. Elmwood Park is also home to the annual Creighton Prep cross country race, also known as the Prep Invite.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Omaha\nNeighborhoods in Omaha, Nebraska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistoric Photo of Elmwood Park\nPhoto of Elmwood Park Pavilion\nElmwood Park Grotto\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDucey, J.E., Sutherland, D.M., Johnson, C., et al.

The Cemetery is the burial site of hundreds of Mormon pioneers who lived in Winter Quarters, a temporary settlement that lasted from 1846 to 1848 as the settlers moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. It was designated a landmark by the City of Omaha in 1990.Records of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) indicate that 359 Mormon pioneers were buried at the site. Remnants of three of the graves are visible today, uncovered during the erection of a commemorative monument in 1936. The monument, a bronze statue by Salt Lake City artist Avard Fairbanks, depicts parents who have committed the body of an infant to the grave.\nThe graves of a number of Florence residents are also located in the cemetery. The community of Florence began to use the cemetery several years after the departure of the Mormons and prior to the Mormons the area had been used as an Indian burial ground.\nWith the exception of a commemorative marker in the nearby city park, the cemetery is the only visible reminder of the Mormon settlement.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistory of North Omaha, Nebraska\nList of cemeteries in Omaha\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMormon Pioneer Cemetery on the Waymarking website.\nMormon Trail Center at Historic Winter Quarters",

It is located between Sorenson Parkway on the south and Redick Avenue on the north, Florence Boulevard on the east and 30th Street on the west. The Minne Lusa neighborhood borders on the north, and the Saratoga neighborhood is on the south. Fort Omaha borders the neighborhood on the west. Miller Park is the namesake park in the neighborhood, as well as the Miller Park Elementary School. In 2017, the Miller Park/Minne Lusa area was ranked as having the 2nd highest rate of homicides and other violent crimes out of 81 Omaha neighborhoods.\n\n\n== About ==\nMiller Park is named for Dr. George L. Miller, a founding father of the city of Omaha. He was the first physician in Omaha, and later in life, a major landowner throughout the city, including all of the area comprising the neighborhood today. Miller was also the first president of the City of Omaha Board of Park Commissioners.\nOnce considered a possible location for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition of 1898. It was a running consideration for the Expo because of its accessibility via the Florence Boulevard, a north-south thoroughfare once regarded as \"The Prettiest Mile\" because it captured the best views of the Missouri River valley, and because of the wide-open fields the area offered. After losing out to Kountze Park to the south because of its distance from the city, the Miller Park neighborhood rebounded, quickly developing with upper-middle-class homes surrounding the perimeter of the park.Omaha State Senator Lowen Kruse is a past president of the Miller Park-Minne Lusa Neighborhood Association.Miller Park was established in 1891 after George Miller failed to locate the Trans-Mississippi Exposition there two years before. He convinced the city of Omaha to build Omaha's Prettiest Mile Boulevard to the park the following year, which later became known as Florence Boulevard.\n\n\n== Fort Omaha ==\nThe Miller Park neighborhood is home to the Fort Omaha Historic District. Inside the Fort there are dozens of historical buildings, with the Guard House designated by the City of Omaha as an Omaha Landmark, and the General Crook House listed independently on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMiller Park (North Omaha)\nMiller Park Elementary School\nPearl Memorial United Methodist Church\nNeighborhoods of North Omaha, Nebraska\nHistory of Omaha\nArchitecture of North Omaha, Nebraska\n\n\n== External links ==\nMiller Park Neighborhood Association website.\nHistoric photo of Miller Park.\nMiller Park Pavilion\nPhoto of Miller Park Leisure Pool\nHistoric postcard of the local Pearl Memorial United Methodist Church\n\n\n== References ==",

Actor Nick Nolte lived in the Benson neighborhood on North 56th Street before his family moved to the Westside district.\n\n\n== History ==\nErastus Benson was a land speculator, investor and philanthropist who unsuccessfully ran for Mayor of Omaha in 1906. He was an early investor in marketing Thomas Edison's inventions, including the phonograph and the Kinetoscope. In 1887, he purchased approximately 900 acres (3.6 km2) of farm land from Edward Creighton, an Omaha businessman. On March 4, 1887, Benson platted the land on the Creighton farm and called it Benson Place, later changing it to Benson. The newly platted community was located along Military Avenue, approximately 9 miles (14 km) northwest of Omaha.\nIn the mid-to-late 1910s, Omaha embarked on a course of annexations of suburban communities to its north and west.  Residents of Benson, anticipating annexation of their own city, decided to build as many civic improvements as they could: they feared that Omaha would be inattentive to their desire for such improvements after annexation, and they knew that following annexation, the larger city would have to assume the debts incurred to build the improvements.  To this end, they built a new combined city hall and fire station in late 1915.On May 25, 1917, the city of Omaha, Nebraska annexed the town of Benson. At that time, it was 1.4 mi\u00b2 and had 5000 residents.Krug Park was an amusement park located at 2936 North 52nd Street in Benson. In 1930 the park was the site of the worst roller coaster accident in the country to that year, and in 1940 it was closed. Today Gallagher Park is located on the original Krug Park site.\n\n\n== Historic buildings ==\nBenson has many historic buildings, including commercial, governmental, educational and residential structures. Some of them including the following.\nBenson High School, 5120 Maple Street\nMasonic Temple, 5901 Maple Street\nCommercial Building, 5913 Maple Street\nE.H.

        "wiki": "St. Cecilia Cathedral is the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Omaha. Located at 701 North 40th Street in the Gold Coast Historic District, the cathedral was ranked as one of the ten largest in the United States when it was completed in 1959. It is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== About ==\nBegun in 1905 and consecrated in 1959, it was designed by architect Thomas Rogers Kimball.  Ranked among the ten largest cathedrals in the United States when it was completed, the cathedral is 255 ft. long, 158 ft. wide and 222 ft. tall (78 m by 48 m by 68 m).\nThe architectural style of the building is Spanish Renaissance Revival, rather than the  European Gothic architecture popular in the early 20th century.  Kimball justified his choice because of the early influence of Spain and Mexico on the region.  It was once part of the missionary area subject to the See of Santiago de Cuba.\nOn March 16, 2007, a painting of The Virgin Immaculata was reported stolen from St. Cecilia. About 7:30 am, church officials noticed the artwork had been cut from its frame.  The painting was an 8 foot by 5 foot image, part of a collection donated to the cathedral in 2002.  The painting had an estimated value of $100,000.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nThe organ of the cathedral was built by Pasi Organ Builders and inaugurated in 2003. The instrument has 55 stops, 3 manuals and pedals. A unique feature of the organ is the option of playing 29 of the stops in either meantone or Wegscheider well-tempered tuning (the remaining stops being well-tempered).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Catholic cathedrals in the United States\nList of cathedrals in the United States\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Omaha\nList of churches in Omaha, Nebraska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Cathedral Site\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Omaha Official Site",

        "wiki": "Council Bluffs is a city in and the county seat of Pottawattamie County, Iowa, United States. The city is the most populous in Southwest Iowa, and is a primary city of the Omaha-Council Bluffs Metropolitan Area. It is located on the east bank of the Missouri River, across from the city of Omaha. Council Bluffs was known, until at least 1853, as Kanesville. It was the historic starting point of the Mormon Trail. Kanesville is also the northernmost anchor town of the other emigrant trails, since there was a steam-powered boat to ferry their wagons, and cattle, across the Missouri River.Council Bluffs' population was 62,230 at the 2010 census. The Omaha metropolitan region, of which Council Bluffs is a part, is the 59th largest in the United States, with an estimated population of 933,316 (2017).While Council Bluffs is more than a decade older than Omaha, the latter has grown to be a significantly larger city and the anchor of the bi-state metropolitan region.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1804\u20131843 \u2013 Pottawattamie Reservation Caldwell's Camp ===\nThe first Council Bluff (singular) was on the Nebraska side of the river at Fort Atkinson (Nebraska), about 20 miles northwest of the current city of Council Bluffs. It was named by Lewis and Clark for a bluff where they met the Otoe tribe on August 2, 1804.The Iowa side of the river became an Indian Reservation in the 1830s for members of the Council of Three Fires of Chippewa, Ottawa and Potawatomi, who were forced to leave the Chicago area under the Treaty of Chicago, which cleared the way for the city of Chicago to incorporate.\nThe largest group of Native Americans who moved to the area were the Pottawatomi, who were led by their chief Sauganash (\"one who speaks English\"), the son of the British loyalist William Caldwell, who founded Canadian communities on the south side of the Detroit River, and a Pottawatomi woman.\nSeeking to avoid confrontation with the Sioux, who were natives of the Council Bluffs area, the 1,000 to 2,000 Pottawattamie initially had settled east of the Missouri River in Indian territory between Leavenworth, Kansas and St. Joseph, Missouri. When this area was bought from Ioway, Sac and Fox tribes in the Platte Purchase and part of Missouri in 1837, Sauganash and the Pottawatomi were forced to move to their assigned reservation in Council Bluffs. Sauganash's English name was Billy Caldwell, and his village was called Caldwell's Camp. The tribe were sometimes called the Bluff Indians. U.S. Army Dragoons built a small fort nearby.\nIn 1838\u201339, the missionary Pierre-Jean De Smet founded St. Joseph's Mission to minister to the Potawatomi. De Smet was appalled by the violence and brutality caused by the whiskey trade, and tried to protect the tribe from unscrupulous traders. However, he had little success in persuading tribal members to convert to Christianity and resorted to secret baptisms of Indian children.During this time, De Smet contributed to Joseph Nicollet's work in mapping the upper midwest. De Smet produced the first European-recorded, detailed map of the Council Bluffs area; it detailed the Missouri River valley system, from below the Platte River to the Big Sioux River.\n\nDe Smet wrote an early description of the Potawatomi settlement:\n\nImagine a great number of cabins and tents, made of the bark of trees, buffalo skins, coarse cloth, rushes and sods, all of a mournful and funereal aspect, of all sizes and shapes, some supported by one pole, others having six, and with the covering stretched in all the different styles imaginable, and all scattered here and there in the greatest confusion, and you will have an Indian village.\nAs more Native Americans were pushed into the Council Bluffs area by pressure of European-American settlement to the east, intertribal conflict increased, fueled by the illegal whiskey trade. The US Army built Fort Croghan in 1842, to keep order and try to control liquor traffic on the Missouri River. However that fort was destroyed in a flood the same year.By 1846 the Pottawatomi were forced to move again to a new reservation at Osawatomie, Kansas.\n\n\n=== 1844\u20131851 \u2013 Mormon Community of Kanesville ===\nIn 1844, the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party crossed the Missouri River here, on their way to blaze a new path into California across the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Beginning in 1846, there was a large influx of Latter-day Saints into the area, although in the winter of 1847\u20131848 most Latter-day Saints crossed to the Nebraska side of the Missouri River.  Initially, the area was called \"Miller's Hollow\", after Henry W. Miller, who would be the first member of the Iowa State Legislature from the area. Miller also was the foreman for the construction of the Kanesville Tabernacle.By 1848, the town had become known as Kanesville, named for benefactor Thomas L. Kane, who had helped negotiate in Washington, DC federal permission for the Mormons to use Indian land along the Missouri for their winter encampment of 1846\u201347. Built at or next to Caldwell's Camp, Kanesville became the main outfitting point for the Mormon Exodus to Utah, and it is the recognized head end of the Mormon Trail.\nEdwin Carter, who would become a noted naturalist in Colorado, worked here from 1848 to 1859 in a dry goods store. He helped supply Mormon wagon trains.\nSettlers departing west from Kanesville, into the sparsely settled, unorganized parts of the Territory of Missouri to the Oregon Country and the newly conquered California Territory, through the (eventual) Nebraska Territory, traveled by wagon trains along the much-storied Oregon, Mormon, or California Trails into the newly expanded United States western lands.\nAfter the first large organized wagon trains left Missouri in 1841, the annual migration waves began in earnest by spring of 1843. They built up, thereafter, with the opening of the Mormon Trail (1846) until peaking in the later 1860s, when news of railroad's progress had a braking effect.\nBy the 1860s, virtually all migration wagon trains were passing near the renamed town. The wagon train trails became less important with the advent of the first complete transcontinental railway in 1869, but while trail use diminished after that, their use continued on at lesser rates until late in the nineteenth century.\nThe Mormon Battalion began their march from Kanesville to California during the Mexican\u2013American War. This was where plural marriage first began to be openly practiced. Orson Hyde began publishing The Frontier Guardian newspaper, and Brigham Young was sustained as the second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS church). The community was transformed by the California Gold Rush, and the majority of Mormons left for Utah by 1852.\n\n\n=== 1852\u20131900 Council Bluffs and Beginning of Railroad Era ===\nIn 1852, the town was renamed Council Bluffs. It continued as a major outfitting point on the Missouri River for the Emigrant Trail and Pike's Peak Gold Rush, and entertained a lively steamboat trade.\nIn 1863 an anonymous soldier on his way to fight the Dakota Uprising passed through Council Bluffs and described a hardscrabble town:\n\nAt Council Bluffs our arrival was greeted by a few rounds from the old six pounder, while the streets were lined with a curiosity-seeking class of humanity, among which could easily be traced the physiognomy of bipeds of almost every clime\u2014all here to make money. The cute Yankee whittling out wooden hams to sell to Pikes' Peak emigrants, the Chatham Street peddler, with his stock of \"oht clo's,\" ready to swear that he had them manufactured expressly for his western trade; the mock auctioneer, the jeweler with his pinchback jewelry of all kinds; horse and mule jockeys, gamblers, thieves, assassin\u2014and the mischief knows what not, rather than what is\u2014all congregated in this little 7\u00d79 city, stuck in a great ravine, 3 miles from the Missouri River. When you understand that this is the great entrepot for emigration across the Plains, you will readily comprehend that this is a good point at which to \"take stranger in,\" and it is done almost every day. Our stay at Council Bluffs was very short (two days) and I think no one was sorry to leave it.\nCouncil Bluffs (rather than Omaha) was designated by Abraham Lincoln as the official starting point of the transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. The official \"Mile 0\" start is at 21st Street and 9th Avenue which is now marked by a gold spike that was used for the promotion of the movie Union Pacific Council Bluffs physical connection to the Transcontinental Railroad was delayed until 1872 when the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge opened (railroad cars had to be ferried across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs to Omaha in the early days of the Transcontinental).\nThe Chicago and North Western Railway arrived 1867. Other railroads operating in the city came to include the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, Chicago Great Western Railway, Wabash Railroad, Illinois Central Railroad, Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1926, the portion of Council Bluffs west of the Missouri River seceded to form Carter Lake, Iowa. Carter Lake had been cut off by a change in the course of the Missouri River.\nBy the 1930s, Council Bluffs had grown into the country's fifth largest rail center. The railroads helped the city become a center for grain storage, and massive grain elevators continue to mark the city's skyline. Other industries in the city included Blue Star Foods, Dwarfies Cereal, Frito-Lay, Georgie Porgie Cereal, Giant Manufacturing, Kimball Elevators, Mona Motor Oil, Monarch, Reliance Batteries, Woodward's Candy, and World Radio. During the 1940s, Meyer Lansky operated a greyhound racing track in Council Bluffs.\nRestructuring of the railroad industry caused the loss of many jobs after the mid-20th century, as did the restructuring of heavy industry. Many jobs moved offshore. By the late 20th century the city and region were suffering economic stagnation and a declining population, as they struggled to develop a new economy. Downtown urban renewal was undertaken to create a new future while emphasizing the strengths of heritage.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCouncil Bluffs is located at 41\u00b015\u203213\u2033N 95\u00b051\u203245\u2033W (41.253698, \u221295.862388).According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 43.62 square miles (112.98 km2), of which 40.97 square miles (106.11 km2) is land and 2.65 square miles (6.86 km2) is water.Council Bluffs covers a unique topographic region originally composed of prairie and savanna in the Loess Hills with extensive wetlands and deciduous forest along the Missouri River. Excellent vistas can be had from KOIL Point at Fairmont Park, the Lincoln Monument, Kirn Park, and the Lewis and Clark Monument. Lake Manawa State Park is located at the southern edge of the city.\nFor the 1820s era United States Army outpost, see Fort Atkinson (Nebraska).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 62,230 people, 24,793 households, and 15,528 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,518.9 inhabitants per square mile (586.5/km2). There were 26,594 housing units at an average density of 649.1 per square mile (250.6/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 90.9% White, 1.9% African American, 0.6% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 3.6% from other races, and 2.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.5% of the population.\nThere were 24,793 households, of which 31.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.4% were married couples living together, 15.0% had a female householder with no husband present, 6.2% had a male householder with no wife present, and 37.4% were non-families. 30.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.43 and the average family size was 3.01.\nThe median age in the city was 35.9 years. 24.1% of residents were under the age of 18; 10.8% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.1% were from 25 to 44; 25.6% were from 45 to 64; and 13.5% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.7% male and 51.3% female.\n\n\n=== 2000 census ===\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 58,268 people, 22,889 households, and 15,083 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,558.7 people per square mile (601.9/km2). There were 24,340 housing units at an average density of 651.1 per square mile (251.4/km2).

The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.7 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $36,221, and the median income for a family was $42,715. Males had a median income of $30,828 versus $23,476 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,143. About 8.2% of families and 10.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.0% of those under age 18 and 6.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nDowntown Council Bluffs historically covered the area along West Broadway and adjacent streets from Old Town west to the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company Railroad passenger depot at 11th Street. Downtown developed as the economic rival of Old Town after the 1853 opening of the Pacific House Hotel by Samuel S. Bayliss through the 1867 completion of the Chicago and Northwestern. In 1899, the Illinois Central passenger depot opened at 12th St. and West Broadway.\n\nThe area declined as the city's primary retail center after the 1955 completion of the Broadway Viaduct, 1970s urban renewal, and the 1984 opening of the Kanesville Boulevard U.S. Route 6 bypass. Remaining buildings of note include the 1959 Council Bluffs Post Office and Federal Building at 6th Street, the 1986 \"Red\" Nelson Building, the 501 Main Building, the substantially altered 1909 City National Bank Building, and the 1968 First Federal Building. The 1947 State Savings Bank Building at 509 West Broadway and the seven-story 1924 Bennett Building at 405 West Broadway are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The 100 Block of West Broadway is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the 1892 Broadway United Methodist Church at West Broadway and 1st St. remains a prominent community landmark.\nOld Town Council Bluffs was adjudged by Judge Frank Street in the 1850s as the area between West Broadway and Glen Avenue and East Broadway and Frank Street from Harmony Street south to Pierce Street. Today this area encompasses Billy Caldwell's settlement of Potawatomi on Indian Creek during the 1830s and Kanesville established by the Mormons as Miller's Hollow in 1848. Kanesville was the home of Mormon leaders Orson Hyde, George A. Smith, and Ezra T. Benson and served as a major outfitting point on the Mormon Trail during the California Gold Rush. The reconstructed Kanesville Tabernacle in the 300 block of East Broadway is operated as a museum by the LDS Church.\n\nThe West End is a geographically large area on the flood plain east of the Missouri River and downtown Omaha, Nebraska, west of 10th St. and the Broadway Viaduct, and north of 9th Ave. and the Union Pacific Transfer railyards. These neighborhoods of long, tree-shaded avenues are divided by the commercial corridor of West Broadway (U.S. Route 6), once part of the Lincoln Highway. This stretch of West Broadway has traditionally had several drive-in fast food restaurants and automobile dealerships with several grain elevators adjacent along 1st Avenue. West Broadway ends at the Interstate 480 bridge to downtown Omaha. Iowa Highway 192 follows North 16th St. from West Broadway to Interstate 29. Neighborhood landmarks include the 1890s Illinois Central Railroad Missouri River bridge, Stan Bahnsen Park, the Golden Spike monument, the Narrows River Park, Big Lake Park, the site of Dodge Park Playland, the Dodge Christian Church (built with the N.P. Dodge Memorial funds) and many examples of late 19th and early 20th century residential architecture. The West End was used as a location by film director Alexander Payne in the movies Citizen Ruth and About Schmidt.\nCasino Row is located on and near the Missouri River south of West Broadway and Interstate 480, west of South 35th St. and Interstate 29, and north of Interstate 80 along 23rd Avenue west of South 24th St. The opening of the Bluffs Run Greyhound Park in 1986, now the Horseshoe Council Bluffs, was followed in the mid-1990s by riverboat casinos operated by Ameristar and Harvey's Casino Hotel (now Harrah's Council Bluffs). New development in this previously industrial area has included the Mid-America Center, several restaurants and hotels, an AMC Theatres with an IMAX, and a Bass Pro Shops. The appearance of legalized gambling in Council Bluffs became a major issue in neighboring Omaha where Mayor Hal Daub had declared Iowa an \"XXX state\" in 1995 as horse-racing came to an end at Ak-Sar-Ben.\nTwin City is located south of where Interstate 29 splits from Interstate 80, east of South Omaha, Nebraska, west of Indian Creek, and north of the South Omaha Bridge Road (U.S. Route 275 and Iowa Highway 92). This neighborhood developed mostly during the 1960s for workers in nearby Omaha factories and at Offutt Air Force Base. The Interstate 80 Exit at 1-B at South 24th Street includes two large truck stops, a Sapp Brothers and a Pilot Travel Centers, along with several motels, the Western Historic Trails Center, the Bluffs Acres manufactured home development, and The Marketplace shopping area with J.C. Penney as its primary tenant. The Willows on the South Omaha Bridge Road is an example of mid-20th century roadside motel architecture and Bart's Motel further east at South 24th St featured prominent neon signage, was used as a location in the motion picture The Indian Runner, and has since been demolished.\nManawa is the portion of Council Bluffs from the combined Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 south to the city limits between Mosquito and Indian Creeks. The area was developed as a trolley park by the Omaha and Council Bluffs Streetcar Company after the former channel of the Missouri River was \"cut-off\" during an 1881 flood to become modern Lake Manawa State Park. Later development followed the establishment of U.S. Route 275 and the completion of Interstate 80 with additional growth during the 1990s. A variety of fast food restaurants, motels, big-box stores, a TravelCenters of America truck stop, automobile dealerships, and other businesses are located between Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 south to the state park. The Lake Manawa Inn hosts early examples of roadside cabin architecture. In February and March, bald eagles & red-tailed hawks can frequently be seen at Lake Manawa, particularly along the southwest shore.\n\nThe South End is bordered by 12th Avenue on the north, South 16th St. and the Union Pacific Transfer railyards on the west, Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 on the south, and the South Expressway (Iowa Highway 192) on the east. This neighborhood developed during the late 19th century with the railroads, especially the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. In the early 20th century much of the area was dubbed \"Dane Town\" or \"Little Copenhagen\" for the large number of Danish immigrants with several Croatian and Mexican families closer to the Union Pacific railyards at \"Little Vienna\". Neighborhood landmarks include Peterson Park, Longfellow School, and the 1899 Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific passenger depot, now the RailsWest Railroad Museum.\n\nThe Oakland-Fairview neighborhood developed during the 1890s and features a wealth of 19th-century architecture, including the Judge Finley Burke mansion at 510 Oakland built in 1893 out of Minnesota granite. The neighborhood is also home to the Lincoln Monument. Located at the western end of Lafayette Avenue, the monument was erected in 1911 by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution that, according to folklore, commemorates the spot where Abraham Lincoln decided on the location of the transcontinental railroad in 1859. The monument offers expansive views across the West End in the Missouri River Valley to Omaha, Nebraska. Nearby is the entrance to Fairview Cemetery, situated on the north side of Lafayette Avenue, which predates the establishment of the present city and includes the Kinsman Monument and the burial place of many early settlers, including Amelia Bloomer. At the east end of Lafayette Avenue where it intersects with North Second Street stands the Ruth Anne Dodge Memorial, the \"Black Angel\" designed by Daniel Chester French, although the wife of Grenville Dodge is actually buried elsewhere in Council Bluffs.\nMadison Avenue is the area of Council Bluffs adjacent to Exit 5 of Interstate 80 along Madison and Bennett avenues, Valley View Drive, and the area between Iowa Highway 92 north to McPherson Avenue. Mosquito Creek flows through this area which was originally notable for the Potawatomi gristmill and now includes the usual roadside gas stations, fast food restaurants, motels, and the tracks of the Iowa Interstate Railroad. Plans for a shopping mall here first appeared in 1972 and construction finally began on the Mall of the Bluffs in 1985. A Sears, Old Navy, and Barnes & Noble later opened at the mall with adjacent commercial development by Hy-Vee and No Frills Supermarkets. Residential growth east of the railroad tracks towards State Orchard Road and the Council Bluffs Municipal Airport and north to U.S. Route 6 has included developments outside the Council Bluffs city limits. Original anchor stores J.C. Penney and Target both relocated from the Mall of the Bluffs in 2008.\nThe Huntington Avenue neighborhood consists of early 20th century Craftsman homes that wind along the top of the Loess Hills past the 1925 studio of radio station KOIL, now apartments.\nThe historic Council Bluffs' Red-light district was formed during the late 19th century, when at least 10 separate brothels were located on Pierce Street east of Park Avenue with another three brothels down the block on the south side of West Broadway east of Park. One 1890 newspaper article referenced in Lt. RL Miller's \"Selected History of the Council Bluffs Police\" noted the \"places of vice and corruption on Pierce\" and Stella Long's above the Ogden House along with the \"terrible den at the corner of Market and Vine\" and Belle Clover's bagnio at 8th St. and West Broadway.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe liberalization of Iowa gambling laws was followed by the opening of The Bluffs Run Greyhound Park in 1986. By 2005, Council Bluffs was the 19th largest casino market in the United States, with revenue equaling nearly $434 million. Casinos include Ameristar Casino Council Bluffs, Harrah's Council Bluffs, and the Horseshoe Council Bluffs.\nCouncil Bluffs industry includes \"frozen foods, robotics, dairy products, plastics, railroading, electrical products, and pork and beef packaging\" per the city's website. American Games (a manufacturer of lottery gaming products), Barton Solvents, Con-Agra, Grundorf, Katelman Foundry, Omaha Standard Palfinger (a truck body manufacturer established 1926), Red Giant Oil, and Tyson Foods have manufacturing plants in the city.\nGriffin Pipe Products, established in 1921, closed its plant employing about 250 people in March 2014, when it was bought by U.S. Pipe and Foundry, based in Birmingham, Alabama. Griffin Wheels, a part of American Steel Foundries, was one of the largest US manufacturers of iron railroad-car wheels until it switched to pipes in the 1960s.Mid-American Energy built a new coal-fired plant in 2007; the billion dollar investment was the single largest private investment in Iowa's history up until then.In 2007, Google began construction of a server farm on the former site of the Council Bluffs Drive-in theater, on Veterans Memorial Highway. This first phase, completed in 2009, was to create \"200 high quality jobs\". The second Google campus, on Bunge Avenue, had an open house in October 2013, employing 50 people who are \"installing and upgrading Google servers and providing maintenance on equipment\". In March 2014, a third phase, the Southlands expansion, was announced, creating 35 additional jobs and bringing Google's investment up to $1.5 billion, the largest private investment in Iowa's history to date. The state increased its tax abatement of sales and use tax for Google from $9.6 million to $16.8 million. As of July 2014 Google stated it created 130 jobs  and as of June 2016 \"over 300 jobs\" on site.,\n\n\n== Environmental problems ==\nIn 2010, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources found that air in central Council Bluffs measured above the national air quality standard for lead, most likely due to lead emissions in this area by Griffin Pipe Products Company. In 2011, EPA found numerous violations of the Clean Water Act, because the plant's contaminated stormwater commingled with treated process wastewater and was pumped out to the storm sewer, which discharged into the Missouri River.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\nCouncil Bluffs is the location of the Pottawattamie County \"Squirrel Cage\" Jail, in use from 1885 until 1969, which is one of three remaining examples of a Rotary Jail. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it was built as a rotary jail with pie-shaped cells on a turntable. To access individual cells, the jailer turned a crank to rotate the cylinder until the desired cell lined up with a fixed opening on each floor. According to the Historical Society of Pottawattamie County, the Squirrel Cage Jail is the only three-story rotary jail constructed. Although the rotary mechanism was disabled in 1960, the building remained the county jail for another 9 years. Similar, smaller examples of the concept can be seen in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Gallatin, Missouri.\n\nThe city's strong ties to the railroad industry are commemorated by three local museums. The Union Pacific Museum is located in the former Council Bluffs Free Public Library (a Carnegie library), at Pearl Street and Willow Avenue; the Grenville Dodge Home is on Third Street; and the RailsWest Railroad Museum is at South Main Street and Sixteenth Avenue. RailsWest is housed in an 1899 Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad passenger depot later shared with the Milwaukee Road, which was used by the Rocky Mountain Rocket, the Arrow, and the Midwest Hiawatha. RailsWest features an outdoor display of historic train cars, including a Railway Post Office car, two steam locomotives, two cabooses, a Burlington Lounge car, and a 1953 switcher produced by the Plymouth Locomotive Works.\nThe Iowa West Foundation, the charitable wing of the local gambling industry, funded a public art planning process for Council Bluffs in 2004 that emphasized a 2015 goal for the city to become \"a prosperous urban area known for its cultural enlightenment and public art collection.\"\nTo this end the city renovated Bayliss Park in downtown, which was re-dedicated in early 2007 with a new fountain dubbed Wellspring. Its performance pavilion, known as Oculus, was designed by sculptor Brower Hatcher. This was the first installation of the Iowa West Public Art, a foundation established during the Public Art Master Planning process. The Iowa West Foundation then established IWPA along with public art website. In 2008 a 50-foot (15 m)-tall Molecule Man sculpture by Jonathan Borofsky was installed at the Mid-America Center; nearby sculptures were designed by William King and Jun Kaneko. Albert Paley designed elements of the nearby South 24th Street bridge at Exit 1B of the combined Interstate 29 and Interstate 80 at Council Bluffs and Ed Carpenter designed Gateway for the West Broadway viaduct. Artist Dan Corson and the Big Mo by Mark di Suvero are featured at Tom Hanfan's River's Edge Park along the banks of the Missouri River.\nCouncil Bluffs is also home to the Chanticleer Community Theater, TVI Filtration Corporation (a major supplier of discount automotive products), and Hamilton College (Iowa) which is now part of Kaplan University \u2013 Council Bluffs.\nThe black squirrel is the city's mascot. John James Audubon reported the squirrels in 1843, along the Missouri River at Council Bluffs.\nFor one week in late July/early August, the annual Pottawattamie County Fair is held at Westfair grounds. There are carnival rides, concerts, gun shows, tractor races, and a queen contest.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe Iowa Blackhawks (later known as the Council Bluffs Express) of the American Professional Football League played at the Mid-America Center from 2004 until 2012. The Mid-America Center was also home to the Omaha Lancers from 2002 until 2008.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPublic education in the city of Council Bluffs is provided by two school districts: Council Bluffs Community School District and Lewis Central Community School District. Most of the city is located within the Council Bluffs Community School District, which operates of public schools, the following: 14 elementary schools, three middle schools, three high schools (Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson), Tucker Center career center, and Kanesville alternative high school. As of the 2008\u20132009 school year, district had a total enrollment of 9,246. The Lewis Central Community School District (one high school, one middles school, and two elementary schools) serves the southern portion of Council Bluffs and enrolled 3,047 students as of the 2008\u20132009 school year.There are several private schools in Council Bluffs, including Community Christian School, Heartland Christian School, Liberty Christian School, Saint Albert Catholic Schools, and Trinity Lutheran Interparish School.\nThe Iowa School for the Deaf moved to the south edge of Council Bluffs in 1870 along what is now Iowa Highway 92. It is open to all students in both Iowa and Nebraska who are younger than 21 and whose hearing loss places them at a disadvantage in the public schools.\nIowa Western Community College is located on the eastern edge of Council Bluffs near the intersection of Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 6 and is the home of the radio station KIWR. Buena Vista University also has a location in Council Bluffs and partners with Iowa Western Community College to offer bachelor's degree completion programs to IWCC graduates.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe city is well served by Interstate 80, Interstate 29, U.S. Route 6, and the Loess Hills National Scenic Byway. The Union Pacific, BNSF, Iowa Interstate, and Canadian National Railroads all connect in Council Bluffs and carry important freight traffic. MidAmerican Energy has a large coal-burning power plant near the southern city limits.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n Herat, Afghanistan (since 2016)\n Kandahar, Afghanistan (since 2018)\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nStan Bahnsen: pitcher for six Major League Baseball teams\nGladden Bishop: contender for the presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints after Joseph Smith's death on June 27, 1844.\nAmelia Bloomer (1818\u20131894): 19th century suffragist\nPhineas F.

          "Really interesting piece of history across the river from Omaha! So glad we went there on a whim today (they are open on Sundays). Difficult to photograph to convey the interesting design of jail. Well worth the visit",
          "I went to the Flashlight tour that the historical society put on. It was an amazing event and fun time to learn the history of the jail at midnight! There is a lot of history to the Squirrel Cage Jail, they are in the process of refurbishing the jail and researching the history",
          "Worth a visit. A little rough around the edges, but you can tell they are doing their best with the resources they have. There are very few of these to see in the US. Worth a stop.",
          "A really fun and unusual place to visit. The staff has done a great job developing an appropriate collection to bring the actual structure to life. Excellent docent to enrich the experience. Good souvenir shop to support the museum.",
          "I hadn't seen a jail like this before, it's an unusual design. The cells rotated around and there was only 1 door out from each floor. Amazingly the jail operated until 1969. It's an interesting piece of history.",
          "This is a very interesting museum. It has a rather sinister feeling in places as you go through. Be sure to have the guide show you the solitary confinement room accessed through the office.",
          "We stopped for a prison tour last year on vacation so when I found this place on TripAdvisor my family was game. It was on our way through to Denver. Supposedly only three left in the U.S. and this is the only three story one (fourth floor was staff living quarters). Was",
          "This is a very different type of jail from those of today and it\u2019s amazing what life was like in the late 1800s. It\u2019s also amazing that this jail was used until 1969! I took a self guided tour as there were no guides available, but that was ok. The woman at the check in was",
          "As someone who works in Corrections this was truly fascinating as I throughly enjoyed the historic elements of this jail. It was also interesting in terms of engineering and architecture of how it was designed and how it\u2019s still in relative good shape for its age.",

          "The Squirrel Cage Jail is different than any I have ever been to. It's unique construction that spins cage to allow only one cell to be opened at a time makes it unusual. Although it is not currently working, you can see the gears that are in the walls and look up and down in",
          "Visiting from out of state and this is one place we hadn\u2019t been before. What an eye opener, from the concept of the jail to the very interesting ledger of prisoners and the reasons jailed. Be sure and pick up the laminated sheets describing each area. Not something you would",
          "We went on the Halloween tour at this jail. We had a great tour guide he even told if some of his experiences in the jail. It's well worth the money to see how these prisoners lived and it's amazing how the cells actually rotated. It gives you an eerie feeling just being in",

          "I had never heard of a squirrel cage jail until today. What is housed inside of this building is interesting, to say the least. We were on a guided tour, but our guide didn't seem to know many of the answers to our questions. Since this museum is right by the Union Pacific",
          "This one of a kind rotating jail, built in 1885, is an engineering feat. The volunteers are so knowledgeable and the tour was interesting, entertaining, and informative. I thought we would \"run through\" but we spent 90 minutes there reading the newspaper articles about inmates",

          "This 1885 3-story rotating jail remains today as a one-of-a-kind design, much like a lazy susan. The idea was to be able to see whose in the cells without having to walk the beat, reducing manpower costs. The Solitary Confinement cell is a mere 6 feet by 3, so that was one",

          "This is a very odd place. The history that is there and the history still to be learned is awesome. To know that this place housed very bad men on the first & second floor then you find the the third floor housed juveniles from 3-13. Can you imagine a toddler being in a place",
          "The Pottawattamie county jail is not only historical but also a fun place to visit.Located just off down town Council Bluffs,Ia. It shows hw people sent there time in jail when it was in operation an also the unusual way it operates. the jail is also located close to the Union",

          "If you are a history buff and/or have an interest in law enforcement this museum is unique slice of local history!",
          "Very nice place to visit . Lots of history and a great tour was given. Probably best for older kids (5+). Very cool place to see historic jails.",
          "A great location for history buffs who like criminal justice sites. Full of tales about former residents there and perhaps a ghost or two.",
          "A jail that revolves. There is an outer cage of bars, with a circular set of cells that rotate to the only opening in the bars. The jailer would spin the cellblock to bring the selected cell to the opening to allow the inmate to leave. Amazing concept",
          "What a cool place to visit! Had an eerie vibe the whole time my daughter, grandson, and I were there. My grandson was fascinated by how the jail operated. Be sure to check out the model. My daughter and I enjoyed the history of those who were incarcerated there. Well worth",
          "This museum was built as a three story circular jail. The cells did not have doors, the only access was when the circular structure was rotated to the access opening. It was eventually modified because there was no way to get the prisoners out in an emergency. Interesting",
          "Want to experience history.... and maybe some ghosts? Saved from the wrecking ball, this jail was cutting edge in its day. One jailer could oversee about 60 inmates. Floors 1, 2, and 3 housed the criminals; 4th floor was reserved for the jailer and family. The jailer's wife",
          "The Squirrel Cage Jail is one of the most interesting places to visit in Council Bluffs and is located next to the Union Pacific RR Museum. It is reputed to be haunted and has a very unique cell system which allowed the cells to rotate slowly preventing escapes. Has to be seen",
          "Simply a building from the outside and nothing warned us that this attraction is closed in the winter. There was a sign that it would be open in \"Spring\" with no dates. It is Spring already and it wasn't open. Disappointing. However, it is right next to the Union Pacific",
          "The Squirrel Cage Jail is an amazing architectural deisgn.It's a must see. The once rotating jail was designed to be operated with minimal workers. Great history here. Also, the paranormal hunters won't be disappointed as EVPS have been recorded here and strange sounds and",
          "Pretty interesting sight to see. Particular kudos to Carla who did a super job relaying the history of the place including the ghosts! Thanks!",
          "This is a very neat old building. Very reasonable price to go through. They always tell you a little history of the place and then you can self - tour. Highly recommend this place if you are in Council Bluffs, IA",
          "We were told in Omaha about this place. It was not easy to find it as there were no signs around and it is hidden behind the Union Pacific Museum. We visited the jail just on Halloween in the morning. It is a scary place itself namely when you hear or read the stories about the",
          "I had read about the squirrel jail in Council Bluffs, but had never had a chance to stop in to see it. This is a paid attraction, but it's not a tourist trap. After a brief orientation, we were allowed to have free reign to the entire museum except the third floor. Apparently",
          "The jail itself and the engineering were pretty fascinating. It was pretty dirty, though, and not at all accessible. The only working bathroom is on the 2nd floor and is originally part of one of the bedrooms. There is no way you could take a stroller or wheelchair in. The",

          "I popped in to speak with the curator about coming back up with friends. While waiting in the front room, she was starting a self-guided tour so I was able to hear a lot about the history of the jail and watch the teenage son stand in the solitary confinement box. I love",
          "Not a place to visit if you are ghost phobic. This would be a great place to visit around Halloween as I am sure there are many ghosts that reside there to this day. It is interesting to see how people where treated as they were jailed in the past. People who like jail and law",
          "We found the Squirrel Cage Jail listed in Roadside America & AAA & thought it'd be something to see. I had never heard of a jail in the round let alone revolve. According to the docent, no one stayed longer than a year, but in my opinion after a week you'd start to go crazy.",

        "wiki": "Omaha ( OH-m\u0259-hah) is the largest city in the state of Nebraska and the county seat of Douglas County. Omaha is in the Midwestern United States on the Missouri River, about 10 miles (15 km) north of the mouth of the Platte River. The nation's 40th-largest city, Omaha's 2019 estimated population was 478,192.\nOmaha is the anchor of the eight-county, bi-state Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area. The Omaha Metropolitan Area is the 59th largest in the United States, with an estimated population of 944,316 (2018). The Omaha-Council Bluffs-Fremont, NE-IA Combined Statistical Area (CSA) encompasses the Omaha-Council Bluffs MSA as well as the separate Fremont, NE Micropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of the entirety of Dodge County, Nebraska. The total population of the CSA was 970,023 based on 2017 estimates. Approximately 1.3 million people reside within the Greater Omaha area, within a 50 mi (80 km) radius of Downtown Omaha.\nOmaha's pioneer period began in 1854, when the city was founded by speculators from neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa. The city was founded along the Missouri River, and a crossing called Lone Tree Ferry earned the city its nickname, the \"Gateway to the West\". Omaha introduced this new West to the world in 1898, when it played host to the World's Fair, dubbed the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. During the 19th century, Omaha's central location in the United States spurred the city to become an important national transportation hub. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the transportation and jobbing sectors were important in the city, along with its railroads and breweries. In the 20th century, the Omaha Stockyards, once the world's largest, and its meatpacking plants gained international prominence.\nToday, Omaha is the home to the headquarters of four Fortune 500 companies: mega-conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway; one of the world's largest construction companies, Kiewit Corporation; insurance and financial firm Mutual of Omaha; and the United States' largest railroad operator, Union Pacific Corporation. Berkshire Hathaway is headed by local investor Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world, according to a decade's worth of Forbes rankings, some of which have ranked him as high as No. 1.Omaha is also the home to five Fortune 1000 headquarters: Green Plains Renewable Energy, TD Ameritrade, Valmont Industries, Werner Enterprises, and West Corporation. Also headquartered in Omaha are the following: First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately held bank in the United States; three of the nation's ten largest architecture/engineering firms (DLR Group, HDR, Inc., and Leo A Daly; and the Gallup Organization, of Gallup Poll fame, and its riverfront Gallup University.\nNotable modern Omaha inventions include the following: the \"pink hair curler\" created at Omaha's Tip Top Products; Butter Brickle Ice Cream, and the Reuben sandwich, conceived by a chef at the then\u2013Blackstone Hotel on 36th and Farnam Streets; cake mix, developed by Duncan Hines, then a division of Omaha's Nebraska Consolidated Mills, the forerunner to today's ConAgra Foods; center-pivot irrigation by the Omaha company now known as Valmont Corporation; Raisin Bran, developed by Omaha's Skinner Macaroni Co.; the first ski lift in the U.S., in 1936, by Omaha's Union Pacific Corp.; the Top 40 radio format, pioneered by Todd Storz, scion of Omaha's Storz Brewing Co. and head of Storz Broadcasting, and first used in the U.S. at Omaha's KOWH Radio; and the TV dinner, developed by Omaha's Carl A. Swanson.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nVarious Native American tribes had lived in the land that became Omaha, including since the 17th century, the Omaha and Ponca, Dhegian-Siouan-language people who had originated in the lower Ohio River valley and migrated west by the early 17th century; Pawnee, Otoe, Missouri, and Ioway. The word Omaha (actually Umo\u207fho\u207f or Uma\u207fha\u207f) means \"Dwellers on the bluff\".In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, including Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at a point about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabann\u00e9's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the monopoly of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park in the area in 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development.Through 26 separate treaties with the United States federal government, Native American tribes in Nebraska gradually ceded the lands that now make up the state. The treaty and cession involving the Omaha area occurred in 1854 when the Omaha Tribe ceded most of east-central Nebraska. Logan Fontenelle, an interpreter for the Omaha and signatory to the 1854 treaty, played an essential role in those proceedings.\n\n\n=== Pioneer Omaha ===\n\nBefore it was legal to claim land in Indian Country, William D. Brown operated the Lone Tree Ferry that brought settlers from Council Bluffs, Iowa to the area that became Omaha. Brown is generally credited as having the first vision for a city where Omaha now sits. The passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in 1854 was presaged by the staking out of claims around the area to become Omaha by residents from neighboring Council Bluffs. On July 4, 1854, the city was informally established at a picnic on Capital Hill, current site of Omaha Central High School. Soon after, the Omaha Claim Club was formed to provide vigilante justice for claim jumpers and others who infringed on the land of many of the city's founding fathers. Some of this land, which now wraps around Downtown Omaha, was later used to entice Nebraska Territorial legislators to an area called Scriptown. The Territorial capitol was in Omaha, but when Nebraska became a state in 1867, the capital was relocated to Lincoln, 53 miles (85 km) south-west of Omaha. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled against numerous landowners whose violent actions were condemned in Baker v. Morton.Many of Omaha's founding figures stayed at the Douglas House or the Cozzens House Hotel. Dodge Street was important early in the city's early commercial history; North 24th Street and South 24th Street also developed independently as business districts. Early pioneers were buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery and Cedar Hill Cemetery. Cedar Hill closed in the 1860s and its graves were moved to Prospect Hill, where pioneers were later joined by soldiers from Fort Omaha, African Americans and early European immigrants. There are several other historical cemeteries in Omaha, historical Jewish synagogues and historical Christian churches dating from the pioneer era, as well. Two sculpture parks, Pioneer Courage and Spirit of Nebraska's Wilderness and The Transcontinental Railroad, celebrate the city's pioneering history.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe economy of Omaha boomed and busted through its early years. In 1858, the Omaha Daily Republican was founded by the Omaha Printing Company (rebranded Aradius Group, 2016), it was Nebraska's first regional newspaper\u2013founded before Nebraska claimed statehood. Omaha was a stopping point for settlers and prospectors heading west, either overland or by the Missouri River. The steamboat Bertrand sank north of Omaha on its way to the goldfields in 1865. Its massive collection of artifacts is on display at the nearby Desoto National Wildlife Refuge. The jobbing and wholesaling district brought new jobs, followed by the railroads and the stockyards. Groundbreaking for the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1863, provided an essential developmental boom for the city. In 1862, the U.S. Congress allowed the Union Pacific Railroad to begin building westward railways; in January 1866 it commenced construction out of Omaha.The Union Stockyards, another important part of the city's development, were founded in South Omaha in 1883. Within 20 years, Omaha had four of the five major meatpacking companies in the United States. By the 1950s, half the city's workforce was employed in meatpacking and processing. Meatpacking, jobbing and railroads were responsible for most of the growth in the city from the late 19th century through the early decades of the 20th century.Immigrants soon created ethnic enclaves throughout the city, including Irish in Sheelytown in South Omaha; Germans in the Near North Side, joined by the European Jews and black migrants from the South; Little Italy and Little Bohemia in South Omaha. Beginning in the late 19th century, Omaha's upper class lived in posh enclaves throughout the city, including the south and north Gold Coast neighborhoods, Bemis Park, Kountze Place, Field Club and throughout Midtown Omaha. They traveled the city's sprawling park system on boulevards designed by renowned landscape architect Horace Cleveland. The Omaha Horse Railway first carried passengers throughout the city, as did the later Omaha Cable Tramway Company and several similar companies. In 1888, the Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company built the Douglas Street Bridge, the first pedestrian and wagon bridge between Omaha and Council Bluffs.Gambling, drinking and prostitution were widespread in the 19th century, first rampant in the city's Burnt District and later in the Sporting District. Controlled by Omaha's political boss Tom Dennison by 1890, criminal elements enjoyed support from Omaha's \"perpetual\" mayor, \"Cowboy Jim\" Dahlman, nicknamed for his eight terms as mayor.Calamities such as the Great Flood of 1881 did not slow down the city's violence. In 1882, the Camp Dump Strike pitted state militia against unionized strikers, drawing national attention to Omaha's labor troubles. The Governor of Nebraska had to call in U.S. Army troops from nearby Fort Omaha to protect strikebreakers for the Burlington Railroad, bringing along Gatling guns and a cannon for defense. When the event ended, one man was dead and several were wounded. In 1891, a mob hanged Joe Coe, an African-American porter after he was accused of raping a white girl. There were also several other riots and civil unrest events in Omaha during this period.\nIn 1898, Omaha's leaders, under the guidance of Gurdon Wattles, held the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, touted as a celebration of agricultural and industrial growth throughout the Midwest. The Indian Congress, which drew more than 500 American Indians from across the country, was held simultaneously. More than 2 million visitors attended these events at Kountze Park and the Omaha Driving Park in the Kountze Place neighborhood.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nWith dramatically increasing population in the 20th century, competition and fierce labor struggles led to major civil unrest. In 1900, Omaha was the center of a national uproar over the kidnapping of Edward Cudahy, Jr., the son of a local meatpacking magnate.The city's labor and management clashed in bitter strikes, racial tension escalated as Blacks were hired as strikebreakers, and ethnic strife broke out. A major riot by earlier immigrants in South Omaha destroyed the city's Greek Town in 1909, completely driving out the Greek population.The civil rights movement in Omaha has roots that extend back to 1912, when the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People west of the Mississippi River was founded in the city.The Omaha Easter Sunday Tornado of 1913 destroyed much of the city's African-American community, in addition to much of Midtown Omaha.Six years later, in 1919, the city was caught up in the Red Summer riots when thousands of whites marched from South Omaha to the courthouse to lynch a Black worker, Willy Brown, a suspect in an alleged rape of a white woman. The mob burned the Douglas County Courthouse to get the prisoner, causing more than $1 million damage. They hanged and shot Will Brown, then burned his body. Troops were called in from Fort Omaha to quell the riot, prevent more crowds gathering in South Omaha, and to protect the Black community in North Omaha.The culture of North Omaha thrived throughout the 1920s through 1950s, with several creative figures, including Tillie Olsen, Wallace Thurman, Lloyd Hunter, and Anna Mae Winburn emerging from the vibrant Near North Side.Musicians created their own world in Omaha, and also joined national bands and groups that toured and appeared in the city.\n\nAfter the tumultuous Great Depression of the 1930s, Omaha rebounded with the development of Offutt Air Force Base just south of the city. The Glenn L. Martin Company operated a factory there in the 1940s that produced 521 B-29 Superfortresses, including the Enola Gay and Bockscar used in the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.The construction of Interstates 80, 480 and 680, along with the North Omaha Freeway, spurred development. There was also controversy, particularly in North Omaha, where new routes bisected several neighborhoods. Creighton University hosted the DePorres Club, an early civil rights group whose use of sit-in strategies for integration of public facilities predated the national movement.Following the development of the Glenn L. Martin Company bomber manufacturing plant in Bellevue at the beginning of World War II, the relocation of the Strategic Air Command to the Omaha suburb in 1948 provided a major economic boost to the area.From the 1950s through the 1960s, more than 40 insurance companies were headquartered in Omaha, including Woodmen of the World and Mutual of Omaha. By the late 1960s, the city rivaled, but never surpassed, the United States insurance centers of Hartford, Connecticut, New York City and Boston.After surpassing Chicago in meat processing by the late 1950s, Omaha suffered the loss of 10,000 jobs as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. The city struggled for decades to shift its economy as workers suffered. Poverty became more entrenched among families who remained in North Omaha.\nIn the 1960s, three major race riots along North 24th Street destroyed the Near North Side's economic base, with recovery slow for decades. In 1969, Woodmen Tower was completed and became Omaha's tallest building and first major skyscraper at 478 feet (146 m), a sign of renewal.\n\nSince the 1970s, Omaha has continued expanding and growing, mostly to available land to the west. West Omaha has become home to the majority of the city's population. North and South Omaha's populations continue to be centers of new immigrants, with economic and racial diversity. In 1975 a major tornado, along with a major blizzard, caused more than $100 million in damages in 1975 dollars.Downtown Omaha has since been rejuvenated in numerous ways, starting with the development of Gene Leahy Mall and W. Dale Clark Library in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, Omaha's fruit warehouses were converted into a shopping area called the Old Market.\nThe demolition of Jobber's Canyon in 1989 led to the creation of the ConAgra Foods campus. Several nearby buildings, including the Nash Block, have been converted into condominiums. The stockyards were taken down; the only surviving building is the Livestock Exchange Building, which was converted to multi-use and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.A historic preservation movement in Omaha has led to a number of historic structures and districts being designated Omaha Landmarks or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of the push toward preservation came after Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the largest-ever National Register historic district in the United States, a record that still stands as of 2013. The Jobbers Canyon Historic District, along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city's historic district. The Jobber's Canyon warehouses had before then been allowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless population that had come to live in the abandoned buildings. At the time, there were no plans in place for revitalizing the buildings.In the 1980s and 1990s, Omaha also saw major company headquarters leave the city, including Enron, founded in the city in 1930 and taken to Houston in 1987 by the now-notorious Kenneth Lay. First Data Corporation, a large credit-card processor, also was founded in Omaha in 1969; as of 2009, its headquarters are in Atlanta.\nInacom, founded in Omaha in 1991, was a technology company that customized computer systems for large businesses, and was on the Fortune 500 list from 1997 until 2000, when it filed for bankruptcy. Northwestern Bell, the Bell System affiliate for Northwestern states, had its headquarters in Omaha from its founding in 1896 until it moved to Denver in 1991 as US West. Level 3 Communications, a large Tier 1 network provider, was founded in Omaha in 1985 as Kiewit Diversified Group, a division of Kiewit Corporation, a Fortune 500 construction and mining company still headquartered in Omaha; Level 3 moved to Denver in 1998. World Com was founded by a merger with Omaha's MFS Communications, started as Metropolitan Fiber Systems in 1993. MFS, backed by Kiewit Corporation CEO Walter Scott and Warren Buffett, purchased UUNET, one of the largest Internet backbones in the world, for $2 billion in 1996. The now-infamous Bernie Ebbers purchased the much larger MFS for $14.3 billion in 1997 under his World Com. He moved headquarters of the merged company from Omaha to Mississippi.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nAround the start of the 21st century, several new downtown skyscrapers and cultural institutions were built. One First National Center was completed in 2002, surpassing the Woodmen Tower as the tallest building in Omaha as well as in the state at 634 feet (193 m). The creation of the city's new North Downtown included the construction of the CenturyLink Center and the Slowdown/Film Streams development at North 14th and Webster Streets. Construction of the new TD Ameritrade Park began in 2009 and was completed in 2011, also in the North Downtown area, near the CenturyLink Center. TD Ameritrade Park is now the home of the College World Series, an event tourists flock to each year.\nNew construction has occurred throughout the city since the start of the 21st century. Important retail and office developments have occurred in West Omaha such as the Village Pointe shopping center and several business parks including First National Business Park and parks for Bank of the West and C&A Industries, Inc and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and several others. Downtown and Midtown Omaha have both seen the development of a significant number of condominiums in recent years. In Midtown Omaha significant mixed-use projects are underway. The site of the former Ak-Sar-Ben arena has been redeveloped into a mixed-use development Aksarben Village. In January 2009 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska announced plans to build a new 10 story, $98 million headquarters, in the Aksarben Village, completed in Spring 2011. Gordmans is also building their new corporate headquarters in Aksarben. The other major mixed-use development is Midtown Crossing at Turner Park. Developed by Mutual of Omaha, the development includes several condominium towers and retail businesses built around Omaha's Turner Park.The Holland Performing Arts Center opened in 2005 near the Gene Leahy Mall and the Union Pacific Center opened in 2004.\n\nThere have also been several developments along the Missouri River waterfront in downtown. The Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge was opened to foot and bicycle traffic on September 28, 2008. Started in 2003, RiverFront Place Condos first phase was completed in 2006 and is fully occupied and the second phase was opened in 2011. The development along Omaha's riverfront is attributed with prompting the City of Council Bluffs to move their own riverfront development time line forward.In the summers of 2008, 2012 and 2016 the United States Olympic Team swimming trials were held in Omaha, at the Qwest/Century Link Center. The event was a highlight in the city's sports community, as well as a showcase for redevelopment in the downtown area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nOmaha is located at 41\u00b015\u2032N 96\u00b00\u2032W. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 130.58 square miles (338.20 km2), of which 127.09 square miles (329.16 km2) is land and 3.49 square miles (9.04 km2) is water. Situated in the Midwestern United States on the bank of the Missouri River in eastern Nebraska, much of Omaha is built in the Missouri River Valley. Other significant bodies of water in the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area include Lake Manawa, Papillion Creek, Carter Lake, Platte River and the Glenn Cunningham Lake. The city's land has been altered considerably with substantial land grading throughout Downtown Omaha and scattered across the city. East Omaha sits on a flood plain west of the Missouri River. The area is the location of Carter Lake, an oxbow lake. The lake was once the site of East Omaha Island and Florence Lake, which dried up in the 1920s.\nThe Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area consists of eight counties; five in Nebraska and three in Iowa. The metropolitan area now includes Harrison, Pottawattamie, and Mills Counties in Iowa and Washington, Douglas, Sarpy, Cass, and Saunders Counties in Nebraska. This area was formerly referred to only as the Omaha Metropolitan Statistical Area and consisted of only five counties: Pottawattamie in Iowa, and Washington, Douglas, Cass, and Sarpy in Nebraska. The Omaha-Council Bluffs combined statistical area comprises the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan statistical area and the Fremont Micropolitan statistical area; the CSA has a population of 858,720 (2005 Census Bureau estimate). Omaha ranks as the 42nd-largest city in the United States, and is the core city of its 60th-largest metropolitan area. There are no consolidated city-counties in the area; the City of Omaha studied the possibility extensively through 2003 and concluded, \"The City of Omaha and Douglas County should merge into a municipal county, work to commence immediately, and that functional consolidations begin immediately in as many departments as possible, including but not limited to parks, fleet management, facilities management, local planning, purchasing and personnel.\"Geographically, Omaha is considered as being in the \"Heartland\" of the United States. Important environmental impacts on the natural habitat in the area include the spread of invasive plant species, restoring prairies and bur oak savanna habitats, and managing the whitetail deer population.Omaha is home to several hospitals, mostly along Dodge St (US6). Being the county seat, it is also the location of the county courthouse.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nOmaha is generally divided into six geographic areas: Downtown, Midtown, North Omaha, South Omaha, West Omaha, and East Omaha. West Omaha includes the Miracle Hills, Boys Town, Regency, and Gateway areas. The city has a wide range of historical and new neighborhoods and suburbs that reflect its socioeconomic diversity. Early neighborhood development happened in ethnic enclaves, including Little Italy, Little Bohemia, Little Mexico and Greek Town. According to U.S. Census data, five European ethnic enclaves existed in Omaha in 1880, expanding to nine in 1900.Around the start of the 20th century. the City of Omaha annexed several surrounding communities, including Florence, Dundee and Benson. At the same time, the city annexed all of South Omaha, including the Dahlman and Burlington Road neighborhoods. From its first annexation in 1857 (of East Omaha) to its recent and controversial annexation of Elkhorn, Omaha has continually had an eye towards growth.Starting in the 1950s, development of highways and new housing led to the movement of the middle class to suburbs in West Omaha. Some of the movement was designated as white flight from racial unrest in the 1960s. Newer and poorer migrants lived in older housing close to downtown; those residents who were more established moved west into newer housing. Some suburbs are gated communities or have become edge cities. Recently, Omahans have made strides to revitalize the downtown and Midtown areas with the redevelopment of the Old Market, Turner Park, Gifford Park, and the designation of the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District.\n\n\n=== Landmark preservation ===\n\nOmaha is home to dozens of nationally, regionally and locally significant landmarks. The city has more than a dozen historic districts, including Fort Omaha Historic District, Gold Coast Historic District, Omaha Quartermaster Depot Historic District, Field Club Historic District, Bemis Park Historic District, and the South Omaha Main Street Historic District. Omaha is notorious for its 1989 demolition of 24 buildings in the Jobbers Canyon Historic District, which represents to date the largest loss of buildings on the National Register. The only original building surviving of that complex is the Nash Block.\nOmaha has almost one hundred individual properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Bank of Florence, Holy Family Church, the Christian Specht Building and the Joslyn Castle. There are also three properties designated as National Historic Landmarks.Locally designated landmarks, including residential, commercial, religious, educational, agricultural and socially significant locations across the city, honor Omaha's cultural legacy and important history. The City of Omaha Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission is the government body that works with the mayor of Omaha and the Omaha City Council to protect historic places. Important history organizations in the community include the Douglas County Historical Society.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nOmaha, due to its latitude of 41.26\u02da N and location far from moderating bodies of water or mountain ranges, displays a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa).

The city of Omaha was established by white settlers from neighboring Council Bluffs who arrived from the Northeast United States a few years earlier. While much of the early population was of Yankee stock, over the next 100 years numerous ethnic groups moved to the city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Omaha's population as 96.4% White and 3.6% Black. Irish immigrants in Omaha originally moved to an area in present-day North Omaha called \"Gophertown\", as they lived in dug-out sod houses. That population was followed by Polish immigrants in the Sheelytown neighborhood, and many immigrants were recruited for jobs in South Omaha's stockyards and meatpacking industry. The German community in Omaha was largely responsible for founding its once-thriving beer industry, including the Metz, Krug, Falstaff and the Storz breweries.\nSince its founding, ethnic groups in the city have clustered in enclaves in north, south and downtown Omaha. In its early days, the sometimes lawless nature of a new frontier city included crime, such as illicit gambling and riots.\nIn the early 20th century, Jewish immigrants set up many businesses along the North 24th Street commercial area. It suffered with the loss of industrial jobs in the 1960s and later, the shifting of population west of the city. The commercial area is now the center of the African-Americans community, concentrated in North Omaha. The African American community has maintained its social and religious base, while it is experiencing an economic revitalization.\nThe Little Italy neighborhood grew south of downtown, as many Italian immigrants came to the city to work in the Union Pacific shops. Scandinavians first came to Omaha as Mormon settlers in the Florence neighborhood. Czechs had a strong political and cultural voice in Omaha, and were involved in a variety of trades and businesses, including banks, wholesale houses, and funeral homes. The Notre Dame Academy and Convent and Czechoslovak Museum are legacies of their residence. Today the legacy of the city's early European immigrant populations is evident in many social and cultural institutions in Downtown and South Omaha.\nMexicans originally immigrated to Omaha to work in the rail yards. Today they account for most of South Omaha's Hispanic population and many have taken jobs in meat processing. Other large early ethnic populations in Omaha included Danes, Poles, and Swedes.\nA growing number of African immigrants have made their homes in Omaha in the last twenty years. There are approximately 8,500 Sudanese living in Omaha, including the largest population of Sudanese refugees in the United States. Most have immigrated since 1995 because of warfare in Sudan. They represent ten ethnic groups, including the Nuer, Dinka, Equatorians, Maubans and Nubians. Most Sudanese people in Omaha speak the Nuer language. Other Africans have immigrated to Omaha as well, with one-third from Nigeria, and large populations from Kenya, Togo, Cameroon and Ghana.With the expansion of railroad and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many immigrants and migrants. As the major city in Nebraska, it has historically been more racially and ethnically diverse than the rest of the state. At times rapid population change, overcrowded housing and job competition have aroused racial and ethnic tensions. Around the start of the 20th century, violence towards new immigrants in Omaha often erupted out of suspicion and fear.In 1909, anti-Greek sentiment flared after increased Greek immigration, and worsened their tendency to become strikebreakers. The killing of a policeman of Irish descent enraged the Irish community; an angry mob violently stormed the Greek neighborhood in Omaha in what would become known as the Greek Town Riot. That mob violence forced the Greek immigrant population to flee from the city. By 1910, 53.7% of Omaha's residents and 64.2% of South Omaha's residents were foreign born or had at least one parent born outside of America.Six years after the Greek Town Riot, in 1915, a mob killed Juan Gonzalez, a Mexican immigrant, near Scribner, a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an Omaha Police Department officer investigated a criminal operation that sold goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. Racial profiling targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the Elkhorn River, where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. It was discovered Gonzalez was unarmed, and he had a reliable alibi for the time of the murder. No one was ever indicted for his killing.In the fall of 1919, following Red Summer, postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of African Americans as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching Willy Brown and the ensuing Omaha Race Riot. Trying to defend Brown, the city's mayor, Edward Parsons Smith, was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.Like other industrial cities in the U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in all, as the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area if they could get to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems.\nDespair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.\nWhites in Omaha have followed the white flight pattern, suburbanizing to West Omaha. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, gang violence and incidents between the Omaha Police and Black residents undermined relations between groups in North and South Omaha.\n\n\n==== Latinos in Omaha ====\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAccording to USA Today, Omaha ranks eighth among the nation's 50 largest cities in both per-capita billionaires and Fortune 500 companies.

In 1898 the city hosted more than 1 million visitors from across the United States at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, a world's fair that lasted for more than half the year.Research on leisure and hospitality situates Omaha in the same tier for tourists as the neighboring cities of Des Moines, Iowa; Topeka, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Denver, Colorado; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A recent study found investment of $1 million in cultural tourism generated approximately $83,000 in state and local taxes, and provided support for hundreds of jobs for the metropolitan area, which in turn led to additional tax revenue for government.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nSeveral national newspapers, including the Boston Globe and The New York Times  have lauded Omaha's historical and cultural attractions.\nThe city is home to the Omaha Community Playhouse, the largest community theater in the United States. The Omaha Symphony Orchestra and its modern Holland Performing Arts Center, the Opera Omaha at the Orpheum theater, the Blue Barn Theatre, and The Rose Theater form the backbone of Omaha's performing arts community.

There are 152 parishes in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Omaha, and several Orthodox Christian congregations throughout the city.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nOmaha's rich history in rhythm and blues, and jazz gave rise to a number of influential bands, including Anna Mae Winburn's Cotton Club Boys and Lloyd Hunter's Seranaders. Rock and roll pioneer Wynonie Harris, jazz great Preston Love, drummer Buddy Miles, and Luigi Waites are among the city's homegrown talent. Doug Ingle from the late 1960s band Iron Butterfly was born in Omaha, as was indie folk singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, though both were raised elsewhere.\nToday, the diverse culture of Omaha includes a variety of performance venues, museums, and musical heritage, including the historically significant jazz scene in North Omaha and the modern and influential \"Omaha Sound\".Contemporary music groups either in or originally from Omaha include Mannheim Steamroller, Bright Eyes, The Faint, Cursive, Azure Ray, Tilly and the Wall and 311.

Trails throughout the area are included in comprehensive plans for the city of Omaha, the Omaha metropolitan area, Douglas County, and long-distance coordinated plans between the municipalities of southeast Nebraska.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nOmaha has a strong mayor form of government, along with a city council elected from seven districts across the city. The mayor is Jean Stothert, who was elected in May 2013, and re-elected May 10, 2017. The longest-serving mayor in Omaha's history was \"Cowboy\" Jim Dahlman, who served 20 years over eight terms. He was regarded as the \"wettest mayor in America\" because of the flourishing number of bars in Omaha during his tenure. Dahlman was a close associate of political boss Tom Dennison. During Dahlman's tenure, the city switched from its original strong-mayor form of government to a city commission government. In 1956, the city switched back.The city clerk is Elizabeth Butler. The City of Omaha administers twelve departments, including finance, police, human rights, libraries and planning. The Omaha City Council is the legislative branch and has seven members elected from districts across the city. The council enacts local ordinances and approves the city budget. Government priorities and activities are established in a budget ordinance approved annually. The council takes official action through the passage of ordinances and resolutions. Nebraska's constitution grants the option of home rule to cities with more than 5,000 residents, meaning they may operate under their own charters. Omaha is one of only three cities in Nebraska to use this option, out of 17 eligible. The City of Omaha is considering consolidating with Douglas County government.Although registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the 2nd congressional district, which includes Omaha, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama opened three campaign offices in the city with 15 staff members to cover the state in fall 2008. Mike Fahey, the former Democratic mayor of Omaha, said he would do whatever it took to deliver the district's electoral vote to Obama; and the Obama campaign considered the district \"in play\". Former Nebraska U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and former Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama, and in November 2008 Obama won the district's electoral vote. This was an exceptional win, because with Nebraska's split electoral vote system Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win an electoral vote in Nebraska since 1964.In 2011, Nebraska lawmakers moved Offutt Air Force Base and the town of Bellevue \u2014 an area with a large minority population \u2014 out of the Omaha-based 2nd District and shifted in the Republican-heavy Omaha suburbs in Sarpy County. The move is expected to dilute the city's urban Democratic vote.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nOmaha's rate of violent crimes per 100,000 residents has been lower than the average rates of three dozen United States cities of similar size. Unlike Omaha, those cities have experienced an increase in violent crime overall since 2003. Rates for property crime have decreased for both Omaha and its peer cities during the same time period. In 2006, Omaha was ranked for homicides as 46th out of the 72 cities in the United States of more than 250,000 in population.As a major industrial city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions that came with rapid growth and the arrival of large numbers of immigrants and migrants. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.Gambling in Omaha has been an important part of the city's history. From its founding in the 1850s through the 1930s, the city was known as a \"wide-open\" town where gambling of all sorts was openly accepted. By the 1950s, at the same time large-scale restructuring of the railroads, the meatpacking industry and other sectors caused widespread job losses and unemployment, Omaha reportedly had more illicit gambling than any other city in the nation. From the 1930s through the 1970s, an Italian criminal element controlled gambling in the city.Today, gambling in Omaha is limited to keno, lotteries, and parimutuel betting. This leaves Omahans to drive across the Missouri River to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where casinos are legal and many businesses operate. Recently, the National Indian Gaming Commission approved a controversial proposal made by the Ponca tribe of Nebraska. It will allow the tribe to build a casino in Carter Lake, Iowa, which sits on the west side of the Missouri River, adjacent to Omaha, where casinos are illegal.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nOmaha has many public and private educational institutions, including Omaha Public Schools, the largest public school district in Nebraska, that serves more than 47,750 students in more than 75 schools.

They include St. Cecilia Grade School at 3869 Webster St. in Midtown Omaha, Holy Cross at 48th and Woolworth Street in Morton Meadows, St. Robert Bellarmine School at 120th and Pacific Street and St. Stephen the Martyr School at 168th and Q Street, all of which have received the U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School award.\nThe Westside Community Schools, also known as District 66, is an award-winning district in the heart of Omaha. It serves students in pre-kindergarten through the 12th grade and recorded a district enrollment of 6,123 students K-12 for the 2015\u201316 school year.\nThrough annexations Omaha also has the Millard Public Schools and Elkhorn Public Schools. Omaha is also home to Brownell-Talbot School, Nebraska's only preschool through grade 12, independent college preparatory school.\nThere are eleven colleges and universities among Omaha's higher education institutions, including the University of Nebraska Omaha.

Satellite providers such as DirecTV and Dish Network and the local programming they offer are also available throughout the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\nIn 2008 Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine ranked Omaha the No. 3 best city in the United States to \"live, work and play\". Omaha's growth has required the constant development of new urban infrastructure that influence, allow and encourage the constant expansion of the city.\nRetail natural gas and water public utilities in Omaha are provided by the Metropolitan Utilities District. Nebraska is the only public power state in the nation. All electric utilities are non-profit and customer-owned. Electricity in the city is provided by the Omaha Public Power District. Public housing is governed by the Omaha Housing Authority governs Public housing and Metro Area Transit provides public transportation. CenturyLink and Cox provide local telephone and internet services. The City of Omaha maintains two modern sewage treatment plants.Portions of the Enron corporation began as Northern Natural Gas Company in Omaha. Northern provides three natural gas lines to Omaha. Enron formerly owned UtiliCorp United, Inc., which became Aquila, Inc.. Peoples Natural Gas, a division of Aquila, Inc., serves several surrounding communities around the Omaha metropolitan area, including Plattsmouth.There are several hospitals in Omaha. Research hospitals include the Boys Town National Research Hospital, the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the Creighton University Medical Center. The Boys Town facility is well known for hearing-related research and treatment. The University of Nebraska Medical Center hosts the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, a world-renowned cancer treatment facility named in honor of Omahan Eugene Eppley.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nOmaha's central role in the history of transportation across America earned it the nickname \"Gate City of the West.\" Despite President Lincoln's decree that Council Bluffs, Iowa, be the starting point for the Union Pacific Railroad, construction began from Omaha on the eastern portion of the first transcontinental railroad. By the middle of the 20th century, nearly every major railroad served Omaha.\nToday, the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District celebrates this connection, along with the listing of the Burlington Train Station and the Union Station on the National Register of Historic Places. First housed in the former Herndon House, the Union Pacific Railroad's corporate headquarters have been in Omaha since the company began. Their new headquarters, the Union Pacific Center, opened in Downtown Omaha in 2004.\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service through Omaha. The Greyhound Lines terminal is at 1601 Jackson St. in downtown Omaha. Megabus has a stop at Crossroads Mall \u2013 N 72nd St. between Dodge St. and Cass St. \u2013 and provides service to Des Moines, Iowa City, and Chicago. Metro Transit, previously known as Metro Area Transit, is the local bus system.\n\nOmaha's position as a transportation center was finalized with the 1872 opening of the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge that linked the transcontinental railroad to the railroads terminating in Council Bluffs. In 1888, the first road bridge, the Douglas Street Bridge, opened. In the 1890s, the Illinois Central drawbridge opened as the largest bridge of its type in the world. Omaha's Missouri River road bridges are now entering their second generation, including the Works Progress Administration-financed South Omaha Bridge, now called Veteran's Memorial Bridge, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2006, Omaha and Council Bluffs announced joint plans to build the Missouri River Pedestrian Bridge, which opened in 2008.\n\nToday, the primary mode of transportation in Omaha is by automobile, with I-80, I-480, I-680, I-29, and U.S. Route 75 (JFK Freeway and North Freeway) providing freeway service across the metropolitan area. The expressway along West Dodge Road (U.S. Route 6 and Nebraska Link 28B) and U.S. Route 275 has been upgraded to freeway standards from I-680 to Fremont. City owned Metro Transit, formerly as MAT Metro Area Transit, provides public bus service to hundreds of locations throughout the Metro.\nA 2017 study by Walk Score ranked Omaha 26th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities. Of the top 50 most walkable cities only one, Omaha, Nebraska, saw its Walk Score decline, and it only decreased 0.3 points from last year. There is an extensive trail system throughout the city for walkers, runners, bicyclists, and other pedestrian modes of transportation.\n\nOmaha is laid out on a grid plan, with 12 blocks to the mile with a north-to-south house numbering system. Omaha is the location of a historic boulevard system designed by H.W.S. Cleveland who sought to combine the beauty of parks with the pleasure of driving cars. The historic Florence and Fontenelle Boulevards, as well as the modern Sorenson Parkway, are important elements in this system.Eppley Airfield, Omaha's airport, serves the region with over 5 million passengers in 2018. United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, and Frontier Airlines, serve the airport with direct and connecting service. As of 2018, the airport has non-stop service to 34 destinations. General aviation airports that serve the area include the Millard Municipal Airport, North Omaha Airport and the Council Bluffs Airport. Offutt Air Force Base continues to serve as a military airbase; it is at the southern edge of Bellevue, which in turn lies immediately south of Omaha.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nOmaha has six sister cities:\n Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany\n Shizuoka, Shizuoka, Japan\n \u0160iauliai, Lithuania\n Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico\n Naas, County Kildare, Ireland\n Yantai, Shandong, China\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBenson neighborhood (Omaha, Nebraska)\nDundee-Happy Hollow Historic District\nFlorence, Nebraska\nGold Coast Historic District (Omaha, Nebraska)\nHistory of Omaha\nMidtown Omaha\nMillard, Omaha, Nebraska\nNorth Omaha, Nebraska\nOld Market (Omaha, Nebraska)\nOmaha Coalition of Citizen Patrols\nSouth Omaha, Nebraska\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCity of Omaha official website\nOmaha Convention & Visitors Bureau",

          "Freedom Park has an amazingly complete WWII Minesweeper (USS Hazard) and a fantastic training submarine (USS Marlin) and both of them are in wonderful condition! Amazingly preserved with knowledgeable volunteers to help the visitors learn and enjoy. We had young kids with us",
          "There is a WWII naval mine sweeper you can board and look through, a 6 man submarine which was pretty cool, different types of bombs, rockets and guns to look at, some huge anchors, and there is a nice place to sit and have a picnic if you bring one with you.",
          "although I was hungry and there wasn't even a water fountain in sight. I enjoyed this experience and believe it or not, I felt the energy of some of the people who were on that ship. Feeling like I wanted to leave but needed to be there. I'm guessing that's what they were",
          "We had some time to kill before our flight and stopped in at this place because it was on the way to the airport. The road to it looked like the place was closed, however when we got there we were told that it is only open on Saturday. There is a ship and a sub that you can go",
          "Freedom Park is ran by volunteers, so it is only open Saturdays from 10 to 3. It has been restored from the flood of 2011. There is limited restroom facilities, so make a stop before arriving. There is a minesweeper, training sub to walk through, along with a helicopter, some",
          "We really enjoyed our trip to Freedom Park. It was interesting walking thru the sub and the ship on site. The staff were very informative and knew what they were saying. The road to the park and the lot need work but otherwise a very good experience and worth the time to visit.",
          "We got into the park and found out it was only supposed to be construction people that day. Apparently the park is only open on certain days right now, so check ahead. Apparently the place was wiped out by a flood a while back and they don't have it up yet. If you do get in to",
          "Go to this park!! This free park is worth at least $10! We spent a couple hours here. You can tour a destroyer and a small training submarine. You can get up close and see everything. In the yard you can step in a coast guard helicopter, see a war plane, and other various",
          "The other reviews will tell you what a cool, interesting and amazing little museum this is. I'm going to tell you about its' problems. The city of Omaha has sadly neglected this park and has set it up for failure. The problems began when the road that connects the New",
          "This is a great small naval museum hidden away on the banks of the Missouri close to Eppley airfield. However, the google open hours are not correct, as I only got to visit by chance as one of the volunteers was unlocking the dirt track barrier as I arrived. The museum is likely",

          "You really have to look hard to find it, but once you do it is totally worth the effort. My wife served in the Navy for several years and she was in heaven walking on the ship. An actual submarine, torpedoes, helicopters, just to name a few things. It is free to get in and those",

          "We had a great visit. The dirt road and poor entrance made it hard to find the place. Try to go early when the day is coolest. It gets hot inside the ship and submarine. The Navy Submarine Veteran gave us the most detailed tour. Park is free. The view from the ship deck",
          "A quirky spot in Omaha. They have a submarine tour and I remember this being a lot of fun as a kid to see...it's been there over 30 years. There used to be some great fish and chips you could buy around the area at a local hole in the wall restaurant. Would like to see this are",

          "We never did find this place. A great pity - my husband was looking forward to it. All-in-all, a frustrating day in Omaha - everything we tried was closed or no longer existed.",
          "I really wanted to get there, but the access road as shown on all the maps we had is impassible. That is Freedom Park road. The only sign for Freedom Park was inside the Miller Landing River City and there is where nothing starts. We tried others, but none could get us past",
          "The park is closed but while restoration the workers are allowing people to enter the park while they're there we had a good time they were nice enough to let us aboard the ship and give us a tour but all in allwe had a wonderful time and it if we come back this way will go",

          "The Missouri River flood of 2011 hurt this place badly. The boat dock was wiped out, many of the ships and helicopters partially submerged by the river and now caked in mud. A barrier now sits in the middle of the road leading to the park - no signs of reopening.",
          "My family and I loved how authentically open the collection is, it isn't behind glass windows or secluded to unclear view. We loved the fact that includes so much untold history. We enjoyed the visiting with the gentlemen, specially with Bill, who passed away a little while ago.",

          "This is a really cool place to go to. When they open again I'm sure it will be a great place to go again. Last year they closed because of all of the flooding on the Missiouri River. There is a lot of Miliary History there..",
          "Poor road, run down displays, closed access. Don't bother trying to see the USS Hazard or the USS Marlin submarine - both were closed.",
          "Was a little hard to find. Was closed due to flood. However there gentleman who was there working on the ship, gave us some information- the displays are being moved to a new sight, there is ongoing work on the displays. The kids found the displays interesting, but were",
          "I found this really unique to the city. I had not heard of this before until I was in Omaha last time. My friend took me there and it was a surprise. Anyone who was in the Military would like this or if you have a love for boats.",
          "Great when we went but it's been flooded out since then ... they're still working on getting it back in shape",

          "Small park but worth time to reflect and respect. Accessed via a narrow road that could do with some repair. I would have gladly left a contribution if there had been somewhere to do so.",
          "Take the time to tour the whole ship, lots of historical info to read if you want. Love the items throughout the ships to get a real life feel of what it was like back then.",
          "Whether you are visiting Omaha or a native, Freedom Park is a must-see. The USS Hazard is a living memorial to our nation's war veterans and servicemen, and the park is unlike anything that you will see in this region. It truly is a gem right in our own backyard.",
          "We Love Freedom Park!! We discovered Freedom Park while my son was working on an Eagle Scout project for a fellow scout. My son was given the opportunity to paint some of the big guns on display. While he was there the tour guides (navy veterans) gave the scouts a complete tour",
          "The ship and sub are outstanding pieces of military history. There are so many artifacts around the park and it's so well kept, HOWEVER Freedom Park is closed right now (July 2011) due to the fact that most of the park is under water. It is not at all accessible. Please",
          "My family and I visited Freedom Park this weekend. The main purpose of our visit was to see the sister ship to the one my grandpa had served on in WWII to get an idea of what his experience was like. It was snowing and as it turns out the park was not officially opened for tours",
          "I found reference to this museum on my Garmin GPS and decided to go a see it. It was a real surprise to see that we could tour a mine sweeper from the deck down through the crew quarters. Even though it is land locked, it is a beautifully maintain war vessel of WWII. A real",
          "I was at the Freedom Park Naval Museum today and it was by far the best park of my trip to Omaha. The Korean and Vietnam War Veterans were there to enlighten on myriad details of both conflicts involving the navy and their experiences on the surface and sub-surface fleet. Even",
          "We visited Freedom Park on July 21, 2010. The park was technically closed that day but we were able to arrange a tour ahead of time so two amazing gentlemen (Bill and Duane) met us there and took us through the USS Marlin and USS Hazard. It was amazing to be able to walk",
          "Having been taken over by the city of Omaha, Freedom Park has undergone some much needed and much appreciated improvements in recent times. With the help of a cadre of dedicated volunteers it is being refurbished and the park is open and tours are available three days a week.",
          "I grew up in Omaha, and have visited Freedom Park several times. I joined the navy late in 1988, and occasionally while on leave would visit... talk with some of the VETS (sometimes you actually get lucky and find a WWII vet willing to share his experiences.) Recently I",
          "I stumbled upon this display quite by accident last weekend during a business trip to Omaha. Being the son of a WWII Navy Veteran and a student of WWII history I turned off the main road immediately upon seeing the sign for the museum. While I concur with the other reviewer",
          "One of my fiance's coworkers had recommended we make a stop at Freedom Park while we were in the Omaha area. Apparently it was a much nicer attraction when he visited several years ago. We visited in September of 2008 and most of the vehicles on display were showing",

        "wiki": "This is a list of parks in Omaha, Nebraska. It includes cemeteries and golf courses. Most parks in Omaha are governed by the City of Omaha Parks and Recreation Department.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1854 Alfred D. Jones drew four parks on the original map of Omaha City. They were called Jefferson Square, which was paved over by I-480; Washington Park, which is where the Paxton Block currently sits at North 16th and Farnam Streets; Capitol Square, where Omaha Central High School is now located, and; an unnamed tract overlooking the river with Davenport Street on the north, Jackson Street on the south, North 8th on the east and North 9th Street on the west. Jefferson Square lasted until 1969, when it was razed to make way for a new interstate in downtown Omaha. The riverfront from the interstate south to the headquarters of ConAgra Foods is now the Heartland of America Park.\nHanscom Park became Omaha's first park. Miller, Fontenelle, Elmwood and Riverview were Omaha's largest parks in 1920. (Riverview Park Zoo eventually became Henry Doorly Zoo.) Levi Carter Park was its largest, at 220 acres (0.89 km2). Other parks in the system that year were Bemis, Deer, Kountze Park, Curtis Turner, Harold Gifford, Mercer, Jefferson Square, Hixenbaugh, Burt playground, Bluff View, Spring Lake, Highland, McKinley, Clear View and Morton.Omaha's boulevard system was designed to be part of the parks system in 1889 by renowned landscape architect Horace Cleveland. The Omaha Park and Boulevard System was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe Department of Parks, Recreation, and Public Property is the City of Omaha's agency responsible for administering public parks.\n\n\n== Current parks ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of cemeteries in Omaha\nCulture in Omaha\nSports in Omaha\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParks in Omaha \u2013 info about parks and public places in Omaha",

        "wiki": "The Great Plains Black History Museum was formerly located at 2213 Lake Street in the Near North Side neighborhood in North Omaha, Nebraska. It was housed in the Webster Telephone Exchange Building, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A nationally renowned institution for more than 30 years, the museum includes more than 100,000 periodicals, manuscripts, photographs and research materials.  The museum currently conducts programs and presents exhibits throughout Omaha, the State of Nebraska, regionally and nationally upon request.\nIt is the largest museum devoted to the black experience on the Great Plains.  The facility has been closed because of needed renovation but, as the new Board Chairman and Museum President, James Beatty says, \"The building is closed The Museum is open.\" As of the spring of 2011, a new board was in place which was holding community meetings to broaden discussions of the museum's future.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1962, Omaha community leader Bertha Calloway founded the Negro Historical Society. In 1976 she opened the Great Plains Black History Museum, in the Western Telephone Exchange Building.  This had been a community center for recovery efforts after the disastrous 1913 tornado. From 1933 to 1952, it was used by the Urban League as a community center, featuring a variety of services, such as medical, a library and others. \nCalloway's goal over the next 25 years was to teach Nebraskans and other visitors about the contributions of African Americans in the Midwest.  In a 1996 interview Calloway explained, \"People must see black history in order for the images they have of black people to change. That\u2019s what our museum is all about ... revealing a history that\u2019s been withheld.\"  In 1976 Calloway opened the museum, aided by a $100,000 grant from the United States Bicentennial Commission.Since then, the museum has featured paintings, rare books, photographs, and films of the African-American experience in the Midwest. Most African Americans arrived in the Midwest from the South during the first half of the 20th century, in two waves of the Great Migration.  The museum chronicles their transformation to urban workers, the development of churches and other community institutions; and music, literature and other culture.  The museum is one of the largest historical and cultural institutions devoted to African-American life west of the Mississippi River.The museum closed in 2001 after the director Jim Calloway, the son of founder Bertha Calloway, failed to get what he thought was the needed level of funding from the City of Omaha and Douglas County after relying on that funding since the beginning of the museum. The building needs renovation and the museum may consider moving to another facility, or running exhibits for some time in other venues. It has arranged to have the Nebraska State Historical Society take temporary custodial care of the materials. Their staff has been cataloging documents and photographs housed at the NSHS in Lincoln. As of 2010, the museum reorganized with a new board of directors, and in the spring of 2011 started a series of community meetings to discuss its future, including the possibility of exhibiting materials before a museum building is available. As the new president James Beatty says, \"The building is closed but the museum is open!\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of North Omaha, Nebraska\nLandmarks in North Omaha, Nebraska\nList of museums focused on African Americans\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nCliff, M.

          "We have loved being members for many years but will be dropping our membership. The temporary exhibits lately have had a strong politically left slant. The museum is gorgeous and does such a fine job of telling Omaha's history. Why does everyone feel compelled to make a",
          "The Pulitzer exhibit that they have there currently is worth the admission alone. This is a very powerful display of photographs that everyone should go see. The rest of the museum is very neat as well with many different train types and local history of the area.",
          "Looking Fresher Than Ever In May, I was back to Omaha, and also to the Durham Museum (nee the Western Heritage Museum), which is located in the old Union Station, in downtown Omaha, just off of 10th Street, and the Railroad viaduct. This was my third visit, since about 2014,",
          "I have been to The Durham Museum in the past but did not remember the place. I went again to take my 82 year old father since it was something he could do to keep busy. We were both enthralled with their new display of the Pulitzer Prize winning photos. It was heartbreaking but",
          "Great old and well restored art deco building. There are a few permanent exhibits and some activities for kids. My suggestion is keep an eye on the schedule and visit during one of the regularly held special exhibitions that you are interested in. Easy parking and reasonable",
          "The Durham Museum is absolutely spectacular. Housed in the former Omaha Union Station, the building itself is an architectural gem. They just don't build them like this anymore. You can just feel the history from the moment you enter the doors. It makes you wish you could travel",
          "When we have out of town guests the Durham is a must see for local history. Our family enjoyed several hours of the beauty of the art deco main floor, as well as early Omaha local cultural and history You can walk through a train, sit on a street car, stroll through",
          "We weren't sure exactly what to expect when we heard the words, \"Train Museum\", but the Durham Museum was that and a whole lot more. It was really the history of Omaha and the plains of Nebraska, and a step back in time. I loved the soda fountain, and actually sat on a stool",
          "My (also single) girlfirend and I get a joint annual memebership-$55.00 and both of us use the pass to see the exhibits we like and take new friends with us as a guest. At Christmas we have gone to see the tree for 25years with our children, who are now grown and still go with",
          "We had a group of 10 and arrived to see the Christmas tree and al the decorations. They were preparing for a wedding that evening and the staff was rolling out tables and setting up chairs and did not care that there as people trying to view the tree and take pictures. We were",
          "We took our grandson to see the train. He enjoyed going inside of them and we also saw the huge Christmas tree!! It is a great place to go during the winter months when there is not much else to do.",
          "A wonderful building beautifully preserved. A true gem for the Omaha area. The picture might be a little deceiving. There is a downstairs area where the actual train station was with awesome train cars that you can walk through. Well worth the trip if you're in the Omaha",
          "It\u2019s located in a strange area but I had a nice time here. The train cars are cool to see, the museum is interesting and large, and there\u2019s a cute soda shop inside to check out.",

          "Beautiful.great place to visit. Beautiful building and full of history. Friendly people work there in soda fountain area. So polite and professional.",
          "I am so happy that this building has been so well preserved to take visitors back to the era of train travel. We went to the Durham to see a special exhibit on race and one on rock and roll, thinking that we would be in and out in a couple of hours. Wrong. The exhibits we went",
          "First impression, it\u2019s beautifully crafted. It has a small museum shop which unfortunately doesn\u2019t have much but its ok. The train station is quite big and has a lot of unique historical items. It was very nice and I would recommend it. Also now in the month of December they",
          "I spent 2 hours here because there is so much to see. The Pullman train cars are so cool to walk through. The museum is housed in the old Union Station which is a beautiful building and was decorated for Christmas. And two of the other exhibits were definitely worth the time.",
          "This was my 2nd time to attend this event. It is awesome getting to see all of the different cultures together in one place. And I love the entertainment from different ethnic groups also. I will go back hopefully next year!",
          "This is one of the better museums we have visited and we have been to all of the lower 48 states. The first floor hall really gives you a feel of what it was like to travel by train back when that was really the only efficient way to travel. The lower level has lots of cool",
          "The train station is amazing...love the sculptures. Lots of wonderful collections and exhibits. Even an authentic working soda fountain",

          "Give yourself plenty of time to go through the museum. It will take several hours. If you have children ages 2 to 8, plan on spending time in the train area downstairs. Children just love the trains, and they can even go inside the trains, and walk all around them. They will",
          "It was a rainy day so I decided to stop here on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed walking around and the architecture is amazing. The displays are very informative and kept my attention. They also have real train cars that are a lot of fun for families.",

          "I love trains and great train stations that can tell a story! My earliest memory of a train ride took place in elementary school at the Union Station in Kansas City, MO. Today, those memories returned as I made new ones at the Durham Museum, Omaha\u2019s Union Station. Taking some",
          "We had some extra time in Omaha so we thought we would check out this museum. It was a very good stop. Lots of exhibits to see. Good and providing an in depth history of Omaha. Well worth the entry fee. Stop if you have time!",

          "Very interesting display of statues depicting real life situations in the train station with commentary. One can learn about the Pullman and sleeper cars, as well as the layout of the station and many facts concerning its heyday. Visitors are able to see area memorabilia",
          "Great for the whole family very educational yet fun - You could easily spend a whole winter day there !",
          "The trains were great, the rest was nothing much to see. I feel the price was quite high for the collection on display.",

          "The Durham Museum, located nearby to downtown Omaha's Old Market area, is without question, a excellent facility...of such high quality that it is within the Smithsonian heirarchy. Yes, it is that good. An incredible display of history, and array of historical items...the mind",

          "Visited in early July right before Railroad Days on a Tuesday evening when it's open in the evening. Since I didn't have the family, this was a great time to go out there. If you're staying in Old Market, you can walk there, but parking is free. The main hall reminded me of",

          "Bought a season pass for the Durham to take the grandkids to see an exhibit on dinosaurs - and of course all the other excellent exhibits there also! Well worth the price for two adults and two kids for an entire year of various exhibits. The venue is clean and well organized",
          "The museum is a favorite for our grandkids and we continue to enjoy our visits too. The rotating exhibits are always worth seeing and the soda shop has good stuff there too. The girls are always nice and it's seems to be a good place to volunteer if you are interested.",
          "The art deco Union train station is magnificent! It's in excellent condition and you can easily imagine what it was like in its heyday. The exhibits on the main floor were informative. I wasn't as interested in the exhibits on the lower floor although I did enjoy walking through",

          "very interesting place to visit great displays the coin collection was extremely interesting the exhibits do change which is great",
          "To go into the Dunham is stepping back in time. Lives it. If you are a lover of classic movies 30 / 40 / early 50 you will enjoy going to the Dunham. Imagine sitting waiting for your train to take you to a trip across the county. Waiting for your soldier to come home from",
          "The museum is in a beautiful building. Very well maintained. There are nice old trains to see and walk through. Most of the exhibits mean more to the people who live in the area than the visitor. A lot about their history. But it was nice to see it. There were more things",
          "We stopped on our drive west. A fun way to learn about the history of Omaha and Nebraska in a beautiful Art Deco building.",
          "Nice facility and interesting historical items to see in the museum including several dinosaur skeletons.",

          "We visited the Durham Museum on free root beer float day! Yummy. The station is set up just like it was when it was at its peak operating time - World War II. There is a soda fountain where you can get delicious fountain treats. The railroad cars are in the downstairs section",
          "The beautiful upper level, the well-preserved and well-presented Union Station, is a poignant place in Omaha and national history. The main portion of the museum, however, is in the Lower Level, occupying about three times the square footage of the Upper Level. It is an eclectic",
          "The upstairs has been restored. Beautiful! The statues were fun to interact with. The dinosaur exhibit downstairs was amazing! Walking through the old trains was fun for the kids. There was a guy in the train car that was super friendly! He had lots of Omaha history information",
          "While not the most *exciting* stop in Omaha, the museum is worth the trip, if only to take a momentary step back in time. The echoed halls of the train station are your first stop, and the retro appeal extends to the ticket-booth turned gift shop and vintage soda fountain.",
          "The trolley tours are informative, educational, and fun. ALL of them are great with volunteers who are very knowledgeable. The museum itself is well maintained, excellent exhibits and many traveling exhibits that are well worth your time.",

          "We have a membership (for the last several years) and bring out-of-town visitors to this museum frequently. The train history and the full scale train alone are worth the stop in.",
          "Was not quite sure what to expect when I came to this highly rated museum but I did not expect what I found. The museum occupies an unused train station. But what a station. When you first enter the museum you are essentially entering the ground floor of the old station that",
          "Enjoyed seeing the old union station as well as the soda fountain stand. I learned a lot of new things about Omaha and enjoyed walking through the train. Great place for adults as well as children.",
          "I have been to this museum many times and have always loved the exhibits. They have a dinosaur exhibit at this time and I believe you will really enjoy it. There are many things to see in this museum and it was also a train depot many years ago. You can also walk through a",

          "It was scorching in Omaha and I was looking for something fun to do-indoors. The museum came up in my search and I was not disappointed! Being from the East Coast I did not know as much as I should on mid-west history and this was a great way to learn a few new things and have",
          "Loved all the history that was shown here!! I really enjoyed it all! I would say you need about 3 hours for this. I enjoyed a root beer float!",
          "The Durham museum is simply marvelous! I especially loved the train exhibits and the malt shop!! It\u2019s definitely a must see for anyone who visits Omaha!",
          "This building inside and outside is lovely and the displays explain the building materials and what you might call a little eye trickery. The train cars are a big hit and many of the displays keep children in mind. Of course the dinosaurs are terrific. I learned things from all",
          "The Durham is in a classic early turn of the century pre art deco style Americana style of architecture train station. It is beautiful. There is a small gift shop which didn't appeal to me and a old fashioned style soda shop where you can get drinks, sweets and light meals.",
          "e were in Omaha having lunch & my husband surprised me with a visit to your museum which I've talked about for years. I'm a big fan of Art Deco & preservation of historic structures so I must've taken 1,000 photos! Even the air vents were pieces of art! I put myself in the shoes",

          "This is one of those typical, generic, stuffy museums with dark spaces and stale air that has so called art from before nineteenth century. It is suffocating. There was a modern art gallery and that was a breath of fresh air. The museum is free so it did not hurt too much.",
          "The museum is chock full of Omaha history, which makes it so fascinating. One of my favorite things is the railroad car that you can walk through and see what train travel used to be like.It was fun looking at the prices on the menu in the dining car - $1.25 for filet Mignon!",
          "Recently visited THE DURHAM MUSEUM and realized how magnificent this historical, art deco building is. THE MUSEUM incorporated a lot of traveling exhibits that has wide appeal to everyone. The lower level has a permanent exhibit of turn-of-the-century Omaha as well as restored",
          "Hadn\u2019t been here in awhile. This museum was great for providing history of Omaha. Interesting to see how Omaha has changed over the years. Informative exhibits (both temporary and permanent). We enjoyed stopping at the soda fountain before leaving. Root beer floats and",

          "I have spent a lot of time in Omaha recently, but I knew very little about it. The Durham museum is an excellent summary of history and local Omaha culture. There are a variety of exhibits, from full size train and trolley cars that you can actually enter to exhibits about",
          "I love the Durham! Always changing venues with interesting displays of historical information. A must stop when in Omaha!",
          "The entrance of the museum used to be the entrance of central station in Omaha and is a beautiful piece of art-deco work!! The museum is simple but nice and gives an overview of the history of Omaha and Nebraska. Though not as good as the one in Iowa. Still enjoyable though",
          "My granddaughter (8) and I stopped here on the day we were flying out of Omaha. She was delighted with the talking statutes, and the train cars. She loved the exhibits in the attached museum, even the buffalo.",
          "This museum is outstanding. We were there for several hours and could have stayed longer. It is beautiful, educational, and fascinating. Each exhibit was detail oriented. We stopped at the Soda Bar on the way out. They offer a variety of actual soda, milk shakes, and sundaes. It",

          "We had a private party here, great place. Love that they've kept much of the original style. It's open and huge, original benches, ticket windows etc... Loved the old train cars, very neat to see. Fun place to have a party as you get to see the museum (or most of it) too!",
          "Great historical landmark and art deco masterpiece. The architecture is wonderful, and the opportunity to check out the historic passenger cars of train travel from years past is an enjoyable experience for the whole family.",
          "Located in the Union Pacific railway station, this museum is a great place to learn about Omaha history. The varied statutes around the station personify the experience and transport visitors back in time. The restored train cars on the platform level below were excellent.",
          "This place is mind blowing. So beautifully designed. So well maintained. When I checked out places on Trip Advisor, it showed this as a place to visit and suggested buying tickets in advance. I tried buying and Trip Advisor indicated a sold out situation. I called the museum",
          "We love train stations, even the ones that don\u2019t function as train stations any longer. This former train station is beautiful inside with sculptures of people waiting for trains,buying tickets, etc. On the street level you have the former waiting area, a working soda fountain",
          "This museum is great. The preservation of the art deco station is amazing. The exhibits telling the story of Nebraska are great. The train cars that are on display are very nice and it is nice to be able go into them and not just look at them over a rope. The original",
          "This museum also is a great social and banquet venue. I wish I had more time to explore. The space is easy to navigate and a very popular spot for local school trips. Nice staff. Knowledgeable event team. Cute gift shop and tables for a quick bite.",
          "A rainy day in Omaha, and we wanted to do something inside. Several local people had highly recommended this museum for its elements of transportation. I liked that concept. But it turns out this museum is so much more. Yes, it is very cool to see the steam engine, caboose,",
          "A must see for sure!!! An original train station preserved beautifully!! Down stairs is packed full of awesomely laid out history and actual trains you get to walk through and sit on. Old cars and trucks. You actually could spend all day looking at and reading everything. It's",

          "So not a lot of people see this place as a place to visit. I really don't know why. This place has great history, the locomotives and art pieces. My kids had a blast looking and getting in the locomotives the train carts and the station itself. Definitely recomended to anyone",

          "Only a few blocks from Old Market, this Omaha history museum housed in the old railroad station is worth a visit. Free parking next to the museum or on the street, but you can walk if you're already downtown. Lots of interesting information about Omaha, Nebraska, and",
          "The building is gorgeous and at night the grandeur shows even more. Just having a look at it is worth the walk.",
          "I'm so happy I was able to see this museum. The Art Deco former rail station is really a treasure. I enjoyed visiting very much. Rail enthusiasts would particularly enjoy a visit here.",
          "In addition to the trains (who doesn't want to go climb aboard and explore trains??!!!), they have fabulous exhibits on the history of Omaha and Nebraska, as well as a coin collection that is out of this world. The collection includes every coin minted in the USA until 1874",
          "We were. pleasantly surprised with the museum. Looked up history of Omaha and the museum popped up. Building is a beautiful example of Art Deco. Originally a major train station, the museum is filled with photos and displays of Omaha history. There is a full train on the lower",
          "I'm so glad they preserved this museum. This was the original Union Station with the tickets booths and benches (the benches were part of the original heating system - heated benches). Very well done and interesting. Plan to be there an hour or two.",
          "We visited the Durham for the first time more than 7 years ago. Our second visit earlier this month reminded us that the Durham is a wonderful repository of Omaha history. The former Union Station is an excellent example of art deco architecture and worth the price of admission",
          "We had 45 minutes to kill so stopped into the Durham Museum. The interior of the building is worth a free peak. We went downstairs to the museum and knew immediately that we had too much to see it such a short time. We are old but the kids seemed to be having fun, too. We ended",
          "We loved being able to get on the trains and street car that used to ride in Omaha. The Omaha Steaks exhibit was really neat to see. We loved seeing all of artifacts of days gone by. It is truly awesome to see how we started out so many years ago.",
          "Highly recommend this gem. Very informative and well done. We learned so much about Omaha. Don't miss this one!",
          "This used to be working train station. You can walk through the same halls, and sit in the same seats as people did decades ago. The historical exhibits are true to the age in which they came from. Most of the exhibits are life size. In addition to allowing you to be able to",
          "First, I love train stations that were built when trains were how America traveled. Many were lost to \"modernization\" before their value as venues for modern events (music, restaurants, museums, etc.) as well as windows into the past were appreciated and understood. Kansas City",
          "Beautiful old building, with quite a few exhibits that focus on the history of Omaha. The train exhibits were neat for the kids (8 & 5) but that took about 5 minutes to go through. They had a \"Spy\" exhibit which was sparse and kind of awkward. We spent less than 30 minutes",
          "We were enthralled with the beauty of the renovations, as well as the museum aspect (on the lower level) of the Durham. The Great Hall is just breath-taking! It is easy to find, park and enjoy the museum in any weather Nebraska may offer. Plus, they offer many events during",
          "Been to Grand Central Station in Omaha 50 years ago??? You should see it now. It has turned into a fantastic museum showcasing the station and Omaha in days past. Wish we had had more time there.",

          "Loved this museum! I was first drawn to it by the building structure which is a grand, old train station from the 1930s. The museum had several exhibits: a photography exhibit of ranchers and farmers in the Midwest, another photo exhibit of Omaha in the 1970s, train exhibits,",
          "The building has been beautifully restored and we enjoyed the architecture and grandness. Our favorite displays were the restored train cars. Other displays were fairly standard -- nothing very unique or similar to other things that are in other museums. It was a nice thing to",
          "We went here because my husband loves trains. It was too expensive in my opinion. $11 for not a whole lot. It was cool to walk through the trains but the best part was the candy/soda shop. We won't be paying to come back again though.",
          "Fun to hear the statue's recordings and learn how the Indians and pioneers lived. The architecture is art deco and amazing! Yummy ice cream sundaes are a cheap treat.",
          "I took 6 kids with me to go see the museum ages from 11 down to 5. The kids had so much fun downstairs pretending to be mechanics, Cooks, farmers, and so many other different things downstairs that they could do. Then if you take the stairs the stairs play music like a piano",
          "One of The Smithsonian recognized museums and a prime example of Art Deco Architecture. During the 30's and 40's more people passed through this terminal than any of today's airports. I like to wonder through the Grand Hall and other spaces and just marvel at the opulence of",

          "Came to the Durham Museum because I was looking for historical books. I was an out-of-town visitor and had no idea this was formerly the Union Station with fixtures and decor of the original beautiful art deco building. Wonderfully preserved and presented. And the trains",
          "Great tour of Omahas' history through the well crafted displays and significant artifacts. Many memories are brought back to a native resident who has spent a lifetime in the city. You'll find items of interest, no matter what your generation.",
          "Took my little 2 year old granddaughter and believe it or not she had a blast. We climbed all through the full sized train exhibits and the 70's tribute was very fun as well. They even had a place where the kids could play with Hot Wheels cars and tracks.",
          "Omaha's original Union Station, the Durham is well worth a visit to see the impressive aptly named Great Hall and the historic facade tributes to train workers. Do stop in to the soda fountain, a nostalgic trip to the past and enjoy fountain treats like sour cherry soda. We",

          "Put this on our itinerary when we visited Omaha because they had a traveling exhibit of 1970's photography and my wife has a passion for photography. The museum is inside the Omaha Union Station and that alone would be worth the price of admission. t is almost the same as it was",
          "Excellent place to visit with any age group. My grandsons teens and younger love it as well. Must do if you are visiting in the area",
          "Had so much fun over 20 nations present explaining and showing many Christmas traditions. Food and entertainment and fun. 50 foot Christmas Tree with Mr & Mrs Santa. They also had a very large presentation on proabition. Took a gteat picture of myself and Al Capone",
          "I've been to the museum a couple times. My kids enjoy the trains. I've been to several other museums that keep the family's interest a lot better. If we really take out time to read everything we are still some in less than 2 hours.",
          "The Durham was a must see as we planned our two-day trip to Omaha using our TripAdvisor Things to Do listing. We arrived there just before noon and found some event taking place with media attending. It turns out that the museum was formally announcing their being placed on the",

          "I like the main floor for the historical setting of a railroad station in years past. I can almost imagine what the crowd would be like. You can walk through an actual passenger train, with the observation car, sleepers, and general passenger car. The exhibits change",
          "I like to come once a year to see what's new at the station and this was a great one! The architecture is always amazing and the trains are fun. Lots of great Omaha history. I'd say this is a definite for any Omaha trip.",
          "I dropped in as I had a couple of hours to kill, and was well rewarded. It gives a rich and detailed view on the history of the city of Omaha. I was able to get in for free (today 8 and tomorrow 9 April).",
          "The museum a few minutes walk from the Old Market has a very large free car park outside , just off 10th Street. The former station Hall is a very impressive gigantic Art Deco building with a vast interior. The main floor has various cast figures set around the Hall showing",

          "Well designed museum with lots of artifacts from Omaha and early Nebraska. Beautifully presented and informative. They have an old fashioned soda fountain in the station. The old station is a wonderful building. I especially liked the general store from early 20th C. I was",

          "We went to the Durham museum. It was an awesome trip back in time to an old very active Union Train Depot. It was full of charm and had lots to see and do. It had an old fashioned soda fountain. Many, many memories there.",
          "My son was singing with his school choir for all the visitors. Afterwards, we were able to see the Christmas Around The World display & the rest of the museum. It was my first time to Durham (I know...what was I waiting for, lol). It was simply awesome!!",

          "I spend a lot of time at museums like the Smithsonian. But I can honestly say this museum is as good or even better than those. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Omaha.",

          "Love it there!!! Love the displays, the fountains, the trains and just the history. When it is just us, price is not bad but too expensive to take grandkids. Love to sit and imagine the day when it was a super hustle and bustle place. The holiday tree is awesome !!!",
          "When we have guest in town, those of all ages love this museum. There is the sentimentality and fascination with train travel. But there are also wonderful traveling exhibits. And the history of Omaha also unfolds in the various rooms. It's pure fun and history.",

          "I'm a bit biased because I love all things vintage & history, but this is a really unique place to visit. The art deco interior of the lobby alone is worth a stop. The soda fountain is delightful to visit. The volunteers walking around are very informative and funny. The",

        "wiki": "Neale Woods is a nature preserve nearly 600 acres in size in North Omaha, Nebraska. Located about 10 miles north of Downtown, Neale Woods is located in the Ponca Hills on top of the Missouri River Valley. It is operated by  Fontenelle Forest.\n\n\n== History ==\nNeale Woods was begun with a donation of 120 acres of land by Edith Neale in 1971.  Neale's father had homesteaded the land in the mid-1800s. An additional 60 acres of contiguous land was given by Carl Jonas, whose father had been one of the founding members of Fontenelle Forest.  After his death, a bequest from Jonas' estate made possible the purchase of 112 acres of additional land.  Of that amount, 25 acres were cleared and designated as prairies, planted in a way thought to be representative of the land in the mid-1800s.  Jonas' former home now serves as the Neale Woods Nature Center.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nThe Neale Woods Nature Center provides trail maps for visitors. A printable trail map is also available online in digital PDF format. Trails are open every day from dawn until dusk.  The nature center building is open to visitors seasonally during the spring/summer/fall.\n\n\n== Astronomy ==\nNeale Woods was home to the Millard Observatory, which was the largest public observatory in the Omaha metropolitan area. Astronomy nights were generally held two times per month, between the months of August and May.Featured telescopes included:\n\n10\u201d Schmidt-Cassegrain\n2 - 12\u201d Meade LX 200 GPS\n14\u201d Celestron\n13\u201d Coulter\n8\u201d Meade\n3 - 6\u201d telescopesThe Observatory closed in 2013  and the equipment moved to the Strategic Air Command & Aerospace Museum.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFontenelle Forest\nTrails in Omaha\nTourism in Omaha, Nebraska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFontenelle Forest Visitor Information\nNeale Woods - reviewed by Omaha.net\nAudubon Nebraska - Audubon Nebraska",

        "wiki": "Omaha ( OH-m\u0259-hah) is the largest city in the state of Nebraska and the county seat of Douglas County. Omaha is in the Midwestern United States on the Missouri River, about 10 miles (15 km) north of the mouth of the Platte River. The nation's 40th-largest city, Omaha's 2019 estimated population was 478,192.\nOmaha is the anchor of the eight-county, bi-state Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area. The Omaha Metropolitan Area is the 59th largest in the United States, with an estimated population of 944,316 (2018). The Omaha-Council Bluffs-Fremont, NE-IA Combined Statistical Area (CSA) encompasses the Omaha-Council Bluffs MSA as well as the separate Fremont, NE Micropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of the entirety of Dodge County, Nebraska. The total population of the CSA was 970,023 based on 2017 estimates. Approximately 1.3 million people reside within the Greater Omaha area, within a 50 mi (80 km) radius of Downtown Omaha.\nOmaha's pioneer period began in 1854, when the city was founded by speculators from neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa. The city was founded along the Missouri River, and a crossing called Lone Tree Ferry earned the city its nickname, the \"Gateway to the West\". Omaha introduced this new West to the world in 1898, when it played host to the World's Fair, dubbed the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. During the 19th century, Omaha's central location in the United States spurred the city to become an important national transportation hub. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the transportation and jobbing sectors were important in the city, along with its railroads and breweries. In the 20th century, the Omaha Stockyards, once the world's largest, and its meatpacking plants gained international prominence.\nToday, Omaha is the home to the headquarters of four Fortune 500 companies: mega-conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway; one of the world's largest construction companies, Kiewit Corporation; insurance and financial firm Mutual of Omaha; and the United States' largest railroad operator, Union Pacific Corporation. Berkshire Hathaway is headed by local investor Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world, according to a decade's worth of Forbes rankings, some of which have ranked him as high as No. 1.Omaha is also the home to five Fortune 1000 headquarters: Green Plains Renewable Energy, TD Ameritrade, Valmont Industries, Werner Enterprises, and West Corporation. Also headquartered in Omaha are the following: First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately held bank in the United States; three of the nation's ten largest architecture/engineering firms (DLR Group, HDR, Inc., and Leo A Daly; and the Gallup Organization, of Gallup Poll fame, and its riverfront Gallup University.\nNotable modern Omaha inventions include the following: the \"pink hair curler\" created at Omaha's Tip Top Products; Butter Brickle Ice Cream, and the Reuben sandwich, conceived by a chef at the then\u2013Blackstone Hotel on 36th and Farnam Streets; cake mix, developed by Duncan Hines, then a division of Omaha's Nebraska Consolidated Mills, the forerunner to today's ConAgra Foods; center-pivot irrigation by the Omaha company now known as Valmont Corporation; Raisin Bran, developed by Omaha's Skinner Macaroni Co.; the first ski lift in the U.S., in 1936, by Omaha's Union Pacific Corp.; the Top 40 radio format, pioneered by Todd Storz, scion of Omaha's Storz Brewing Co. and head of Storz Broadcasting, and first used in the U.S. at Omaha's KOWH Radio; and the TV dinner, developed by Omaha's Carl A. Swanson.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nVarious Native American tribes had lived in the land that became Omaha, including since the 17th century, the Omaha and Ponca, Dhegian-Siouan-language people who had originated in the lower Ohio River valley and migrated west by the early 17th century; Pawnee, Otoe, Missouri, and Ioway. The word Omaha (actually Umo\u207fho\u207f or Uma\u207fha\u207f) means \"Dwellers on the bluff\".In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, including Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at a point about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabann\u00e9's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the monopoly of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park in the area in 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development.Through 26 separate treaties with the United States federal government, Native American tribes in Nebraska gradually ceded the lands that now make up the state. The treaty and cession involving the Omaha area occurred in 1854 when the Omaha Tribe ceded most of east-central Nebraska. Logan Fontenelle, an interpreter for the Omaha and signatory to the 1854 treaty, played an essential role in those proceedings.\n\n\n=== Pioneer Omaha ===\n\nBefore it was legal to claim land in Indian Country, William D. Brown operated the Lone Tree Ferry that brought settlers from Council Bluffs, Iowa to the area that became Omaha. Brown is generally credited as having the first vision for a city where Omaha now sits. The passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in 1854 was presaged by the staking out of claims around the area to become Omaha by residents from neighboring Council Bluffs. On July 4, 1854, the city was informally established at a picnic on Capital Hill, current site of Omaha Central High School. Soon after, the Omaha Claim Club was formed to provide vigilante justice for claim jumpers and others who infringed on the land of many of the city's founding fathers. Some of this land, which now wraps around Downtown Omaha, was later used to entice Nebraska Territorial legislators to an area called Scriptown. The Territorial capitol was in Omaha, but when Nebraska became a state in 1867, the capital was relocated to Lincoln, 53 miles (85 km) south-west of Omaha. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled against numerous landowners whose violent actions were condemned in Baker v. Morton.Many of Omaha's founding figures stayed at the Douglas House or the Cozzens House Hotel. Dodge Street was important early in the city's early commercial history; North 24th Street and South 24th Street also developed independently as business districts. Early pioneers were buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery and Cedar Hill Cemetery. Cedar Hill closed in the 1860s and its graves were moved to Prospect Hill, where pioneers were later joined by soldiers from Fort Omaha, African Americans and early European immigrants. There are several other historical cemeteries in Omaha, historical Jewish synagogues and historical Christian churches dating from the pioneer era, as well. Two sculpture parks, Pioneer Courage and Spirit of Nebraska's Wilderness and The Transcontinental Railroad, celebrate the city's pioneering history.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe economy of Omaha boomed and busted through its early years. In 1858, the Omaha Daily Republican was founded by the Omaha Printing Company (rebranded Aradius Group, 2016), it was Nebraska's first regional newspaper\u2013founded before Nebraska claimed statehood. Omaha was a stopping point for settlers and prospectors heading west, either overland or by the Missouri River. The steamboat Bertrand sank north of Omaha on its way to the goldfields in 1865. Its massive collection of artifacts is on display at the nearby Desoto National Wildlife Refuge. The jobbing and wholesaling district brought new jobs, followed by the railroads and the stockyards. Groundbreaking for the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1863, provided an essential developmental boom for the city. In 1862, the U.S. Congress allowed the Union Pacific Railroad to begin building westward railways; in January 1866 it commenced construction out of Omaha.The Union Stockyards, another important part of the city's development, were founded in South Omaha in 1883. Within 20 years, Omaha had four of the five major meatpacking companies in the United States. By the 1950s, half the city's workforce was employed in meatpacking and processing. Meatpacking, jobbing and railroads were responsible for most of the growth in the city from the late 19th century through the early decades of the 20th century.Immigrants soon created ethnic enclaves throughout the city, including Irish in Sheelytown in South Omaha; Germans in the Near North Side, joined by the European Jews and black migrants from the South; Little Italy and Little Bohemia in South Omaha. Beginning in the late 19th century, Omaha's upper class lived in posh enclaves throughout the city, including the south and north Gold Coast neighborhoods, Bemis Park, Kountze Place, Field Club and throughout Midtown Omaha. They traveled the city's sprawling park system on boulevards designed by renowned landscape architect Horace Cleveland. The Omaha Horse Railway first carried passengers throughout the city, as did the later Omaha Cable Tramway Company and several similar companies. In 1888, the Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company built the Douglas Street Bridge, the first pedestrian and wagon bridge between Omaha and Council Bluffs.Gambling, drinking and prostitution were widespread in the 19th century, first rampant in the city's Burnt District and later in the Sporting District. Controlled by Omaha's political boss Tom Dennison by 1890, criminal elements enjoyed support from Omaha's \"perpetual\" mayor, \"Cowboy Jim\" Dahlman, nicknamed for his eight terms as mayor.Calamities such as the Great Flood of 1881 did not slow down the city's violence. In 1882, the Camp Dump Strike pitted state militia against unionized strikers, drawing national attention to Omaha's labor troubles. The Governor of Nebraska had to call in U.S. Army troops from nearby Fort Omaha to protect strikebreakers for the Burlington Railroad, bringing along Gatling guns and a cannon for defense. When the event ended, one man was dead and several were wounded. In 1891, a mob hanged Joe Coe, an African-American porter after he was accused of raping a white girl. There were also several other riots and civil unrest events in Omaha during this period.\nIn 1898, Omaha's leaders, under the guidance of Gurdon Wattles, held the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, touted as a celebration of agricultural and industrial growth throughout the Midwest. The Indian Congress, which drew more than 500 American Indians from across the country, was held simultaneously. More than 2 million visitors attended these events at Kountze Park and the Omaha Driving Park in the Kountze Place neighborhood.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nWith dramatically increasing population in the 20th century, competition and fierce labor struggles led to major civil unrest. In 1900, Omaha was the center of a national uproar over the kidnapping of Edward Cudahy, Jr., the son of a local meatpacking magnate.The city's labor and management clashed in bitter strikes, racial tension escalated as Blacks were hired as strikebreakers, and ethnic strife broke out. A major riot by earlier immigrants in South Omaha destroyed the city's Greek Town in 1909, completely driving out the Greek population.The civil rights movement in Omaha has roots that extend back to 1912, when the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People west of the Mississippi River was founded in the city.The Omaha Easter Sunday Tornado of 1913 destroyed much of the city's African-American community, in addition to much of Midtown Omaha.Six years later, in 1919, the city was caught up in the Red Summer riots when thousands of whites marched from South Omaha to the courthouse to lynch a Black worker, Willy Brown, a suspect in an alleged rape of a white woman. The mob burned the Douglas County Courthouse to get the prisoner, causing more than $1 million damage. They hanged and shot Will Brown, then burned his body. Troops were called in from Fort Omaha to quell the riot, prevent more crowds gathering in South Omaha, and to protect the Black community in North Omaha.The culture of North Omaha thrived throughout the 1920s through 1950s, with several creative figures, including Tillie Olsen, Wallace Thurman, Lloyd Hunter, and Anna Mae Winburn emerging from the vibrant Near North Side.Musicians created their own world in Omaha, and also joined national bands and groups that toured and appeared in the city.\n\nAfter the tumultuous Great Depression of the 1930s, Omaha rebounded with the development of Offutt Air Force Base just south of the city. The Glenn L. Martin Company operated a factory there in the 1940s that produced 521 B-29 Superfortresses, including the Enola Gay and Bockscar used in the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.The construction of Interstates 80, 480 and 680, along with the North Omaha Freeway, spurred development. There was also controversy, particularly in North Omaha, where new routes bisected several neighborhoods. Creighton University hosted the DePorres Club, an early civil rights group whose use of sit-in strategies for integration of public facilities predated the national movement.Following the development of the Glenn L. Martin Company bomber manufacturing plant in Bellevue at the beginning of World War II, the relocation of the Strategic Air Command to the Omaha suburb in 1948 provided a major economic boost to the area.From the 1950s through the 1960s, more than 40 insurance companies were headquartered in Omaha, including Woodmen of the World and Mutual of Omaha. By the late 1960s, the city rivaled, but never surpassed, the United States insurance centers of Hartford, Connecticut, New York City and Boston.After surpassing Chicago in meat processing by the late 1950s, Omaha suffered the loss of 10,000 jobs as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. The city struggled for decades to shift its economy as workers suffered. Poverty became more entrenched among families who remained in North Omaha.\nIn the 1960s, three major race riots along North 24th Street destroyed the Near North Side's economic base, with recovery slow for decades. In 1969, Woodmen Tower was completed and became Omaha's tallest building and first major skyscraper at 478 feet (146 m), a sign of renewal.\n\nSince the 1970s, Omaha has continued expanding and growing, mostly to available land to the west. West Omaha has become home to the majority of the city's population. North and South Omaha's populations continue to be centers of new immigrants, with economic and racial diversity. In 1975 a major tornado, along with a major blizzard, caused more than $100 million in damages in 1975 dollars.Downtown Omaha has since been rejuvenated in numerous ways, starting with the development of Gene Leahy Mall and W. Dale Clark Library in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, Omaha's fruit warehouses were converted into a shopping area called the Old Market.\nThe demolition of Jobber's Canyon in 1989 led to the creation of the ConAgra Foods campus. Several nearby buildings, including the Nash Block, have been converted into condominiums. The stockyards were taken down; the only surviving building is the Livestock Exchange Building, which was converted to multi-use and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.A historic preservation movement in Omaha has led to a number of historic structures and districts being designated Omaha Landmarks or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of the push toward preservation came after Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the largest-ever National Register historic district in the United States, a record that still stands as of 2013. The Jobbers Canyon Historic District, along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city's historic district. The Jobber's Canyon warehouses had before then been allowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless population that had come to live in the abandoned buildings. At the time, there were no plans in place for revitalizing the buildings.In the 1980s and 1990s, Omaha also saw major company headquarters leave the city, including Enron, founded in the city in 1930 and taken to Houston in 1987 by the now-notorious Kenneth Lay. First Data Corporation, a large credit-card processor, also was founded in Omaha in 1969; as of 2009, its headquarters are in Atlanta.\nInacom, founded in Omaha in 1991, was a technology company that customized computer systems for large businesses, and was on the Fortune 500 list from 1997 until 2000, when it filed for bankruptcy. Northwestern Bell, the Bell System affiliate for Northwestern states, had its headquarters in Omaha from its founding in 1896 until it moved to Denver in 1991 as US West. Level 3 Communications, a large Tier 1 network provider, was founded in Omaha in 1985 as Kiewit Diversified Group, a division of Kiewit Corporation, a Fortune 500 construction and mining company still headquartered in Omaha; Level 3 moved to Denver in 1998. World Com was founded by a merger with Omaha's MFS Communications, started as Metropolitan Fiber Systems in 1993. MFS, backed by Kiewit Corporation CEO Walter Scott and Warren Buffett, purchased UUNET, one of the largest Internet backbones in the world, for $2 billion in 1996. The now-infamous Bernie Ebbers purchased the much larger MFS for $14.3 billion in 1997 under his World Com. He moved headquarters of the merged company from Omaha to Mississippi.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nAround the start of the 21st century, several new downtown skyscrapers and cultural institutions were built. One First National Center was completed in 2002, surpassing the Woodmen Tower as the tallest building in Omaha as well as in the state at 634 feet (193 m). The creation of the city's new North Downtown included the construction of the CenturyLink Center and the Slowdown/Film Streams development at North 14th and Webster Streets. Construction of the new TD Ameritrade Park began in 2009 and was completed in 2011, also in the North Downtown area, near the CenturyLink Center. TD Ameritrade Park is now the home of the College World Series, an event tourists flock to each year.\nNew construction has occurred throughout the city since the start of the 21st century. Important retail and office developments have occurred in West Omaha such as the Village Pointe shopping center and several business parks including First National Business Park and parks for Bank of the West and C&A Industries, Inc and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and several others. Downtown and Midtown Omaha have both seen the development of a significant number of condominiums in recent years. In Midtown Omaha significant mixed-use projects are underway. The site of the former Ak-Sar-Ben arena has been redeveloped into a mixed-use development Aksarben Village. In January 2009 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska announced plans to build a new 10 story, $98 million headquarters, in the Aksarben Village, completed in Spring 2011. Gordmans is also building their new corporate headquarters in Aksarben. The other major mixed-use development is Midtown Crossing at Turner Park. Developed by Mutual of Omaha, the development includes several condominium towers and retail businesses built around Omaha's Turner Park.The Holland Performing Arts Center opened in 2005 near the Gene Leahy Mall and the Union Pacific Center opened in 2004.\n\nThere have also been several developments along the Missouri River waterfront in downtown. The Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge was opened to foot and bicycle traffic on September 28, 2008. Started in 2003, RiverFront Place Condos first phase was completed in 2006 and is fully occupied and the second phase was opened in 2011. The development along Omaha's riverfront is attributed with prompting the City of Council Bluffs to move their own riverfront development time line forward.In the summers of 2008, 2012 and 2016 the United States Olympic Team swimming trials were held in Omaha, at the Qwest/Century Link Center. The event was a highlight in the city's sports community, as well as a showcase for redevelopment in the downtown area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nOmaha is located at 41\u00b015\u2032N 96\u00b00\u2032W. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 130.58 square miles (338.20 km2), of which 127.09 square miles (329.16 km2) is land and 3.49 square miles (9.04 km2) is water. Situated in the Midwestern United States on the bank of the Missouri River in eastern Nebraska, much of Omaha is built in the Missouri River Valley. Other significant bodies of water in the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area include Lake Manawa, Papillion Creek, Carter Lake, Platte River and the Glenn Cunningham Lake. The city's land has been altered considerably with substantial land grading throughout Downtown Omaha and scattered across the city. East Omaha sits on a flood plain west of the Missouri River. The area is the location of Carter Lake, an oxbow lake. The lake was once the site of East Omaha Island and Florence Lake, which dried up in the 1920s.\nThe Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area consists of eight counties; five in Nebraska and three in Iowa. The metropolitan area now includes Harrison, Pottawattamie, and Mills Counties in Iowa and Washington, Douglas, Sarpy, Cass, and Saunders Counties in Nebraska. This area was formerly referred to only as the Omaha Metropolitan Statistical Area and consisted of only five counties: Pottawattamie in Iowa, and Washington, Douglas, Cass, and Sarpy in Nebraska. The Omaha-Council Bluffs combined statistical area comprises the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan statistical area and the Fremont Micropolitan statistical area; the CSA has a population of 858,720 (2005 Census Bureau estimate). Omaha ranks as the 42nd-largest city in the United States, and is the core city of its 60th-largest metropolitan area. There are no consolidated city-counties in the area; the City of Omaha studied the possibility extensively through 2003 and concluded, \"The City of Omaha and Douglas County should merge into a municipal county, work to commence immediately, and that functional consolidations begin immediately in as many departments as possible, including but not limited to parks, fleet management, facilities management, local planning, purchasing and personnel.\"Geographically, Omaha is considered as being in the \"Heartland\" of the United States. Important environmental impacts on the natural habitat in the area include the spread of invasive plant species, restoring prairies and bur oak savanna habitats, and managing the whitetail deer population.Omaha is home to several hospitals, mostly along Dodge St (US6). Being the county seat, it is also the location of the county courthouse.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nOmaha is generally divided into six geographic areas: Downtown, Midtown, North Omaha, South Omaha, West Omaha, and East Omaha. West Omaha includes the Miracle Hills, Boys Town, Regency, and Gateway areas. The city has a wide range of historical and new neighborhoods and suburbs that reflect its socioeconomic diversity. Early neighborhood development happened in ethnic enclaves, including Little Italy, Little Bohemia, Little Mexico and Greek Town. According to U.S. Census data, five European ethnic enclaves existed in Omaha in 1880, expanding to nine in 1900.Around the start of the 20th century. the City of Omaha annexed several surrounding communities, including Florence, Dundee and Benson. At the same time, the city annexed all of South Omaha, including the Dahlman and Burlington Road neighborhoods. From its first annexation in 1857 (of East Omaha) to its recent and controversial annexation of Elkhorn, Omaha has continually had an eye towards growth.Starting in the 1950s, development of highways and new housing led to the movement of the middle class to suburbs in West Omaha. Some of the movement was designated as white flight from racial unrest in the 1960s. Newer and poorer migrants lived in older housing close to downtown; those residents who were more established moved west into newer housing. Some suburbs are gated communities or have become edge cities. Recently, Omahans have made strides to revitalize the downtown and Midtown areas with the redevelopment of the Old Market, Turner Park, Gifford Park, and the designation of the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District.\n\n\n=== Landmark preservation ===\n\nOmaha is home to dozens of nationally, regionally and locally significant landmarks. The city has more than a dozen historic districts, including Fort Omaha Historic District, Gold Coast Historic District, Omaha Quartermaster Depot Historic District, Field Club Historic District, Bemis Park Historic District, and the South Omaha Main Street Historic District. Omaha is notorious for its 1989 demolition of 24 buildings in the Jobbers Canyon Historic District, which represents to date the largest loss of buildings on the National Register. The only original building surviving of that complex is the Nash Block.\nOmaha has almost one hundred individual properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Bank of Florence, Holy Family Church, the Christian Specht Building and the Joslyn Castle. There are also three properties designated as National Historic Landmarks.Locally designated landmarks, including residential, commercial, religious, educational, agricultural and socially significant locations across the city, honor Omaha's cultural legacy and important history. The City of Omaha Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission is the government body that works with the mayor of Omaha and the Omaha City Council to protect historic places. Important history organizations in the community include the Douglas County Historical Society.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nOmaha, due to its latitude of 41.26\u02da N and location far from moderating bodies of water or mountain ranges, displays a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa). July averages 76.7 \u00b0F (24.8 \u00b0C), with average relative humidity around 70% which then leads to relatively frequent thunderstorms. Temperatures reach 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) on 29 days and 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) on 1.7 days annually. The January daily average is 23.5 \u00b0F (\u22124.7 \u00b0C), with lows reaching 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) on 11 days annually. The lowest temperature recorded in the city was \u221232 \u00b0F (\u221236 \u00b0C) on January 5, 1884, and the highest 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on July 25, 1936. Average yearly precipitation is 30.6 inches (777 mm), falling mostly in the warmer months.

The city of Omaha was established by white settlers from neighboring Council Bluffs who arrived from the Northeast United States a few years earlier. While much of the early population was of Yankee stock, over the next 100 years numerous ethnic groups moved to the city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Omaha's population as 96.4% White and 3.6% Black. Irish immigrants in Omaha originally moved to an area in present-day North Omaha called \"Gophertown\", as they lived in dug-out sod houses. That population was followed by Polish immigrants in the Sheelytown neighborhood, and many immigrants were recruited for jobs in South Omaha's stockyards and meatpacking industry. The German community in Omaha was largely responsible for founding its once-thriving beer industry, including the Metz, Krug, Falstaff and the Storz breweries.\nSince its founding, ethnic groups in the city have clustered in enclaves in north, south and downtown Omaha. In its early days, the sometimes lawless nature of a new frontier city included crime, such as illicit gambling and riots.\nIn the early 20th century, Jewish immigrants set up many businesses along the North 24th Street commercial area. It suffered with the loss of industrial jobs in the 1960s and later, the shifting of population west of the city. The commercial area is now the center of the African-Americans community, concentrated in North Omaha. The African American community has maintained its social and religious base, while it is experiencing an economic revitalization.\nThe Little Italy neighborhood grew south of downtown, as many Italian immigrants came to the city to work in the Union Pacific shops. Scandinavians first came to Omaha as Mormon settlers in the Florence neighborhood. Czechs had a strong political and cultural voice in Omaha, and were involved in a variety of trades and businesses, including banks, wholesale houses, and funeral homes. The Notre Dame Academy and Convent and Czechoslovak Museum are legacies of their residence. Today the legacy of the city's early European immigrant populations is evident in many social and cultural institutions in Downtown and South Omaha.\nMexicans originally immigrated to Omaha to work in the rail yards. Today they account for most of South Omaha's Hispanic population and many have taken jobs in meat processing. Other large early ethnic populations in Omaha included Danes, Poles, and Swedes.\nA growing number of African immigrants have made their homes in Omaha in the last twenty years. There are approximately 8,500 Sudanese living in Omaha, including the largest population of Sudanese refugees in the United States. Most have immigrated since 1995 because of warfare in Sudan. They represent ten ethnic groups, including the Nuer, Dinka, Equatorians, Maubans and Nubians. Most Sudanese people in Omaha speak the Nuer language. Other Africans have immigrated to Omaha as well, with one-third from Nigeria, and large populations from Kenya, Togo, Cameroon and Ghana.With the expansion of railroad and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many immigrants and migrants. As the major city in Nebraska, it has historically been more racially and ethnically diverse than the rest of the state. At times rapid population change, overcrowded housing and job competition have aroused racial and ethnic tensions. Around the start of the 20th century, violence towards new immigrants in Omaha often erupted out of suspicion and fear.In 1909, anti-Greek sentiment flared after increased Greek immigration, and worsened their tendency to become strikebreakers. The killing of a policeman of Irish descent enraged the Irish community; an angry mob violently stormed the Greek neighborhood in Omaha in what would become known as the Greek Town Riot. That mob violence forced the Greek immigrant population to flee from the city. By 1910, 53.7% of Omaha's residents and 64.2% of South Omaha's residents were foreign born or had at least one parent born outside of America.Six years after the Greek Town Riot, in 1915, a mob killed Juan Gonzalez, a Mexican immigrant, near Scribner, a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an Omaha Police Department officer investigated a criminal operation that sold goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. Racial profiling targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the Elkhorn River, where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. It was discovered Gonzalez was unarmed, and he had a reliable alibi for the time of the murder. No one was ever indicted for his killing.In the fall of 1919, following Red Summer, postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of African Americans as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching Willy Brown and the ensuing Omaha Race Riot. Trying to defend Brown, the city's mayor, Edward Parsons Smith, was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.Like other industrial cities in the U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in all, as the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area if they could get to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems.\nDespair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.\nWhites in Omaha have followed the white flight pattern, suburbanizing to West Omaha. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, gang violence and incidents between the Omaha Police and Black residents undermined relations between groups in North and South Omaha.\n\n\n==== Latinos in Omaha ====\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAccording to USA Today, Omaha ranks eighth among the nation's 50 largest cities in both per-capita billionaires and Fortune 500 companies.

In 1898 the city hosted more than 1 million visitors from across the United States at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, a world's fair that lasted for more than half the year.Research on leisure and hospitality situates Omaha in the same tier for tourists as the neighboring cities of Des Moines, Iowa; Topeka, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Denver, Colorado; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A recent study found investment of $1 million in cultural tourism generated approximately $83,000 in state and local taxes, and provided support for hundreds of jobs for the metropolitan area, which in turn led to additional tax revenue for government.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nSeveral national newspapers, including the Boston Globe and The New York Times  have lauded Omaha's historical and cultural attractions.\nThe city is home to the Omaha Community Playhouse, the largest community theater in the United States.

The mayor is Jean Stothert, who was elected in May 2013, and re-elected May 10, 2017. The longest-serving mayor in Omaha's history was \"Cowboy\" Jim Dahlman, who served 20 years over eight terms. He was regarded as the \"wettest mayor in America\" because of the flourishing number of bars in Omaha during his tenure. Dahlman was a close associate of political boss Tom Dennison. During Dahlman's tenure, the city switched from its original strong-mayor form of government to a city commission government. In 1956, the city switched back.The city clerk is Elizabeth Butler.

Mike Fahey, the former Democratic mayor of Omaha, said he would do whatever it took to deliver the district's electoral vote to Obama; and the Obama campaign considered the district \"in play\". Former Nebraska U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and former Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama, and in November 2008 Obama won the district's electoral vote. This was an exceptional win, because with Nebraska's split electoral vote system Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win an electoral vote in Nebraska since 1964.In 2011, Nebraska lawmakers moved Offutt Air Force Base and the town of Bellevue \u2014 an area with a large minority population \u2014 out of the Omaha-based 2nd District and shifted in the Republican-heavy Omaha suburbs in Sarpy County. The move is expected to dilute the city's urban Democratic vote.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nOmaha's rate of violent crimes per 100,000 residents has been lower than the average rates of three dozen United States cities of similar size. Unlike Omaha, those cities have experienced an increase in violent crime overall since 2003. Rates for property crime have decreased for both Omaha and its peer cities during the same time period. In 2006, Omaha was ranked for homicides as 46th out of the 72 cities in the United States of more than 250,000 in population.As a major industrial city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions that came with rapid growth and the arrival of large numbers of immigrants and migrants. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.Gambling in Omaha has been an important part of the city's history. From its founding in the 1850s through the 1930s, the city was known as a \"wide-open\" town where gambling of all sorts was openly accepted. By the 1950s, at the same time large-scale restructuring of the railroads, the meatpacking industry and other sectors caused widespread job losses and unemployment, Omaha reportedly had more illicit gambling than any other city in the nation. From the 1930s through the 1970s, an Italian criminal element controlled gambling in the city.Today, gambling in Omaha is limited to keno, lotteries, and parimutuel betting. This leaves Omahans to drive across the Missouri River to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where casinos are legal and many businesses operate. Recently, the National Indian Gaming Commission approved a controversial proposal made by the Ponca tribe of Nebraska. It will allow the tribe to build a casino in Carter Lake, Iowa, which sits on the west side of the Missouri River, adjacent to Omaha, where casinos are illegal.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nOmaha has many public and private educational institutions, including Omaha Public Schools, the largest public school district in Nebraska, that serves more than 47,750 students in more than 75 schools.

By the middle of the 20th century, nearly every major railroad served Omaha.\nToday, the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District celebrates this connection, along with the listing of the Burlington Train Station and the Union Station on the National Register of Historic Places. First housed in the former Herndon House, the Union Pacific Railroad's corporate headquarters have been in Omaha since the company began. Their new headquarters, the Union Pacific Center, opened in Downtown Omaha in 2004.\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service through Omaha. The Greyhound Lines terminal is at 1601 Jackson St. in downtown Omaha. Megabus has a stop at Crossroads Mall \u2013 N 72nd St. between Dodge St. and Cass St. \u2013 and provides service to Des Moines, Iowa City, and Chicago. Metro Transit, previously known as Metro Area Transit, is the local bus system.\n\nOmaha's position as a transportation center was finalized with the 1872 opening of the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge that linked the transcontinental railroad to the railroads terminating in Council Bluffs. In 1888, the first road bridge, the Douglas Street Bridge, opened. In the 1890s, the Illinois Central drawbridge opened as the largest bridge of its type in the world. Omaha's Missouri River road bridges are now entering their second generation, including the Works Progress Administration-financed South Omaha Bridge, now called Veteran's Memorial Bridge, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2006, Omaha and Council Bluffs announced joint plans to build the Missouri River Pedestrian Bridge, which opened in 2008.\n\nToday, the primary mode of transportation in Omaha is by automobile, with I-80, I-480, I-680, I-29, and U.S. Route 75 (JFK Freeway and North Freeway) providing freeway service across the metropolitan area. The expressway along West Dodge Road (U.S. Route 6 and Nebraska Link 28B) and U.S. Route 275 has been upgraded to freeway standards from I-680 to Fremont. City owned Metro Transit, formerly as MAT Metro Area Transit, provides public bus service to hundreds of locations throughout the Metro.\nA 2017 study by Walk Score ranked Omaha 26th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities. Of the top 50 most walkable cities only one, Omaha, Nebraska, saw its Walk Score decline, and it only decreased 0.3 points from last year. There is an extensive trail system throughout the city for walkers, runners, bicyclists, and other pedestrian modes of transportation.\n\nOmaha is laid out on a grid plan, with 12 blocks to the mile with a north-to-south house numbering system. Omaha is the location of a historic boulevard system designed by H.W.S. Cleveland who sought to combine the beauty of parks with the pleasure of driving cars. The historic Florence and Fontenelle Boulevards, as well as the modern Sorenson Parkway, are important elements in this system.Eppley Airfield, Omaha's airport, serves the region with over 5 million passengers in 2018. United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, and Frontier Airlines, serve the airport with direct and connecting service. As of 2018, the airport has non-stop service to 34 destinations. General aviation airports that serve the area include the Millard Municipal Airport, North Omaha Airport and the Council Bluffs Airport. Offutt Air Force Base continues to serve as a military airbase; it is at the southern edge of Bellevue, which in turn lies immediately south of Omaha.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nOmaha has six sister cities:\n Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany\n Shizuoka, Shizuoka, Japan\n \u0160iauliai, Lithuania\n Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico\n Naas, County Kildare, Ireland\n Yantai, Shandong, China\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBenson neighborhood (Omaha, Nebraska)\nDundee-Happy Hollow Historic District\nFlorence, Nebraska\nGold Coast Historic District (Omaha, Nebraska)\nHistory of Omaha\nMidtown Omaha\nMillard, Omaha, Nebraska\nNorth Omaha, Nebraska\nOld Market (Omaha, Nebraska)\nOmaha Coalition of Citizen Patrols\nSouth Omaha, Nebraska\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCity of Omaha official website\nOmaha Convention & Visitors Bureau",

          "Overall the arena is very nice and clean. I've been here for shows to hockey games and always enjoy it. The only thing I don't like about going here is the parking. IT SUCKS to get out. But everything inside is setup nice and always clean.",
          "This was my first sporting event here. This was a Sunday afternoon game so the attendance was light. Lots of empty seats so we moved around a couple of times. Had to move once because the row was too narrow. Moved 1 row back and problem solved. Lastly, was unsure why the music",

          "For a small town Arena trying to satisfy Omaha Beef, Lancers , Craft Fairs , Concerts I think they are doing the best they can for not knowing how many people are going to show up at each venue. Parking is one of the biggest problems they face. Maybe a shuttle bus from nearby",

          "Much has been said about the limited parking, and while that may be valid, it is of little consequence when one gets to the venue. This place is just great. Broad walkways make getting from one part of the building to another very easy. Access from one level to another can be",
          "The Ralston Arena while looks nice the seats are way to small, i am 6'2 and my knees would not fit in the chairs without turning sideways. Also when leaving the Arena it is a terrible experience you can only turn onto a one way street with only 2 turing lanes, I now understand",

          "My husband and I went to the Ralston Arena for the first time to see an Omaha Lancer's hockey game. What a wonderful surprise this venue is. The ice rink is well maintained, the bathrooms are clean, the concessions are varied and there does not appear to be a bad seat in the",

        "wiki": "The neighborhoods of Omaha are a diverse collection of community areas and specific enclaves. They are spread throughout the Omaha metro area, and are all on the Nebraska side of the Missouri River.\n\n\n== History ==\nOmaha's original neighborhoods were clustered around the original settlement area near 12th and Jackson Streets. On the southwest corner of that intersection William P. Snowden, the city's first settler, built the St. Nicholas Hotel in 1854, three years before the city was incorporated. Early neighborhoods included the Sporting District and the Burnt District. In the early decades after settlement the city expanded, building the Near North Side, Sheelytown (Irish immigrants), and housing districts throughout what is now Downtown Omaha.\nIn the 1880s the next wave of development occurred where land was available at downtown's southern and western edges, including: Bemis Park, Dahlman, Deer Park, Dogtown, Gifford Park, Hanscom Park, and Kountze Place and Little Bohemia.\n\n\n== Former towns ==\nThe boundaries of Omaha have changed significantly since its founding, with the city growing through subdivisions and annexations.  The following areas of the city were incorporated towns which have been annexed by the city of Omaha.  Beechwood was located near the now-gone Florence Lake in East Omaha. It had its own school district, and the site is now occupied by several trailer courts.  Benson is a neighborhood of north-central Omaha near 60th and Maple Streets; it was annexed in 1917.  Dundee is a neighborhood in central Omaha near 50th and Dodge Streets.  Originally a separate city, Dundee was annexed by Omaha in 1915, but the residents fought annexation in the courts until 1917.  Elkhorn takes its name from the Elkhorn River and was incorporated by an act of the territorial legislature in 1889.  It was annexed by Omaha on March 8, 2005 after a two-year court battle.  Elkhorn became part of Omaha on March 1, 2007.  The original town site is near 204th St. and West Maple Road in West Omaha.\nFlorence is a neighborhood in far north Omaha.  The original Mormon settlement in Florence, called Cutler's Park, predated the founding of Omaha in 1846.  Florence was annexed by Omaha in 1917.  Hayes was a historic town located two miles from Bennington that evaporated in the 1870s, when the railroad failed to come to the town.  Millard is a broad area of southwest Omaha, originally a separate city and annexed in 1971.  The original town site is near 132nd and Q Streets.  Saratoga is a historic neighborhood in North Omaha. The town was founded, boomed and busted within one year (1856\u201357). Its legacy includes a school, library and businesses still in the area.\n\n\n== Adjoining cities and towns ==\nSeveral nearby cities and towns operate as suburbs of Omaha.  The largest is Bellevue, which may be the oldest settlement in Nebraska and is the state's third largest city.  It is located just south of Omaha in eastern Sarpy County. Bennington was founded in the 1880s and was originally called \"Bunz Town\". Located northwest of the city, it was a key stop along the Fremont, Elkhorn, and Missouri Valley Railroad in the early 1900s.  Carter Lake, Iowa, which was formerly on the eastern side of the Missouri River, today sits nestled into Nebraska.  Irvington was first named Pappio because of its location on Pappio Creek.  The city is increasingly encroaching on this town in its northwestern corner.  La Vista is a city south of Omaha in north-central Sarpy County.  Papillion is a city south of Omaha and immediately south of La Vista.  It is the county seat of Sarpy County.  Ralston is a city in south-central Douglas County roughly bounded by 72nd, 84th, L, and Harrison Streets.  It is surrounded by Omaha on three sides.  The other side borders with La Vista.  Valley was established in 1886 and was an important shipping point along the Union Pacific Railroad. Waterloo was incorporated in 1883 along the Elkhorn river and borders the west of Omaha. Waterloo was once the world's largest shipper of seed corn, and was home of the Douglas County Fair for over 80 years.\n\n\n== Community areas ==\n\nOmaha is split into several geographically designated areas, which cover several neighborhoods. Midtown is a racially diverse, historically rich area of Omaha immediately west of Downtown Omaha. North Omaha is a community area north of downtown Omaha with a rich historical, architectural, and religious legacy, particularly for the city's African American population.  South Omaha is a community area encompassing many neighborhoods south of downtown Omaha which historically has been home to Omaha's Eastern European immigrant population, and more recently, Central and North American Hispanic immigrants.  Churches and other structures reflect its rich past.  Formerly a portion of this area was a separate city named South Omaha; it was annexed by Omaha in 1915.  West Omaha is the collective term for areas of the city west of 72nd Street, and the area of newer suburbs and community institutions, the next wave of historically significant buildings.  Within that broad area there are several sub-community areas including Northwest Omaha, Southwest Omaha, Millard and Irvington. Also, much further to the west is the newly annexed community area/past city of Elkhorn.\n\n\n=== North Omaha ===\nScriptown was a conspicuous development first platted in 1855 to award Nebraska Territory legislators for the votes for statehood. It was bound by 16th street on the east, 24th on the west and Lake Street to the north. The area was developed quickly, and included a number of prominent homes. The land therein formed the nucleus of Near North Omaha. Near North Omaha became one of the most historically significant communities in Omaha, as it developed commercially and socially into the 20th century. The area was bound by downtown Omaha on the south and the Saratoga neighborhood on the north, 30th Street on the west and 16th Avenue on the east. Created by historical German, Irish, Jewish, and African Americans, the community became a renowned center of Black culture in the United States in the 1920s. From then through the 1960s, the area was dominated by black-owned businesses, churches and social centers. There were also a number of Jewish-owned businesses, as well. The area was the site of several riots in the 1960s, and decayed for the next 30 years. The Great Plains Black History Museum was started there in 1976. Over the last 20 years a series of community restoration projects, including the demolition of the Logan Fontenelle Housing Projects and the creation of Dreamland Plaza, has sought to revitalize the community.\nThe Saratoga community is the location of a historical town that boomed and busted within one year of its founding. Its legacy includes a school, library and businesses still in the area. Also in the area is Kountze Place, a former suburban enclave of wealthy Omaha doctors, lawyers and businessmen. The northeast part of North Omaha, roughly defined by all areas north of Dodge Street and east of 16th Street, until Fort Street when Florence Boulevard becomes the western boundary. The eastern boundary is the Missouri River. Neighborhoods in this section of North Omaha include Carter Lake, Iowa, East Omaha and Beechwood. Carter Lake was formerly on the eastern side of the Missouri River. Originally part of the township of East Omaha, the community was ceded to the State of Iowa after a contentious court battle in the late 1890s. Omaha's Levi Carter Park is located here. Beechwood was located near Florence Lake in East Omaha. Located next to the Missouri River and the now-dry Florence Lake, Beechwood had its own school district and commercial area. Today it is site of a trailer court by the same name. East Omaha proper was once an agricultural area. Once considered for the site of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, it lost out to Kountze Park. Omaha's main airport, Eppley Airfield, is now in East Omaha, and the community has been the location of racial contention for several years. East Omaha was the first annexation to the City of Omaha in 1854.\nFar north Omaha includes everything north of Ames Avenue, west of Florence Boulevard, and east of 72nd Street. It includes Florence, the original Mormon settlement of Cutler's Park, which predates the founding of the City of Omaha; it was annexed in 1917. Miller Park, a neighborhood named after Omaha pioneer Dr. George Miller, was primarily developed from 1920 to 1950, bound by 30th Street on the west and Florence Blvd on the east, Miller Park on the north and Sorenson Parkway on the south. It is the location of several churches, an elementary school and a park by the same name. Minne Lusa is a neighborhood in far North Omaha primarily developed from 1915 and 1926, and bound by Miller Park on the south, Florence on the north, Florence Boulevard and Pershing Drive on the east, and 30th Street on the west. The southwest part of North Omaha includes Benson, located near 60th and Maple Streets. Originally incorporated as a city in the 1880s, it was annexed to Omaha in 1917. Benson has several historic locations, and is an important neighborhood today. Next to Benson is Dundee, near 50th and Dodge Streets. Originally a separate city, Dundee was annexed by Omaha in 1915, but this annexation was fought until 1917. The Gold Coast neighborhood, including St. Cecilia Cathedral, has several important architectural gems, as well as several historical parks. Other important historical neighborhoods in this area include Gifford Park, Orchard Hill and Walnut Hill.\n\n\n== Covenants and racial restrictions ==\nOmaha has a history of race-restrictive housing. Housing covenants became common in the 1920s and were validated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1926. Where there were small ethnic enclaves in early Omaha history, racial minorities were effectively limited to specific neighborhoods in North Omaha and a part of South Omaha. The black neighborhood in Omaha was clearly defined by redlining practices used by real estate agents, and was identified as the Near Northside. Kountze Place, the second Gold Coast, Dundee and other Omaha neighborhoods and blocks had racially or ethnically restrictive housing covenants.\nFurther restrictions on conveyance (rental, lease, sale, transfer) were often included, effectively defining most of the neighborhoods in Omaha during the first decades after establishment.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 1948 that racial restrictions would no longer be enforced. After more than a decade of pressure from the Urban League and others, the City of Omaha adopted an Open Housing Ordinance in 1969. Although unenforceable, legal complications prevent the covenants from being expunged from property title documents.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\nThere are countless current and historically specific neighborhoods throughout Omaha. Perhaps prime among them is the Old Market, a mixed-use commercial/residential district in downtown Omaha that historically housed Omaha's fresh food vendors.\nThe central area of Omaha, immediately west of downtown and extending to 72nd Street, is home to several of historically significant neighborhoods. Gifford Park, Morton Meadows, Gold Coast and Country Club are important to the history of Omaha. Bemis Park is centrally located, and is home to a number of architecturally significant homes and public works.\nLocated in West Omaha is Boys Town, an incorporated village near 132nd and Dodge Streets and is home to the famous institution of the same name. Also on the fringe of the city is Chalco, an unincorporated area southwest of Omaha in northern Sarpy County that forms its own neighborhood.\nSouth 24th Street, Sheelytown, Little Bohemia, Little Italy, Brown Park, Dog Hollow, and Little Poland are all located throughout South Omaha. Spring Lake and Deer Park are also located in the area, as well as Field Club and the Omaha Quartermaster Depot Historic District.\nIn North Omaha, the area of East Omaha was the first annexation to the city in 1854, and is home to a large park and the city's airport. Miller Park is a neighborhood in far North Omaha primarily developed from 1920 to 1950, bound by 30th Street on the west and Florence Blvd on the east, Miller Park on the north and Sorenson Parkway on the south. The Fort Omaha Historic District borders this neighborhood. Immediately to the north is Minne Lusa, a neighborhood primarily developed from 1900-1950, bound by Miller Park on the south, Florence on the north, Florence Blvd and Pershing Drive on the east and 30th Street on the west.\nNear North Omaha is a historical neighborhood close to downtown Omaha. It is bound by downtown Omaha on the south and Kountze Park to the north. Kountze was once a posh Omaha suburb, reachable only via streetcar. It consumed most of the former Saratoga community's land to the north. 30th Street on the west and 16th Avenue on the east border each of these areas. Omaha's Prospect Hill neighborhood is home to the city's pioneer cemetery of the same name, as well as some of the oldest homes in the city.\n\n\n=== List of neighborhoods in Omaha ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nLandmarks in Omaha, Nebraska\nCouncil Bluffs, Iowa\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Omaha, Nebraska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNeighborhoods - City of Omaha.\nNeighborhoods and Housing - Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce.\nNeighborhood Scan - University of Nebraska at Omaha.",

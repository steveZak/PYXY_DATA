        "wiki": "The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa is New Zealand's national museum, located in Wellington. Known as Te Papa, or 'Our Place', it opened in 1998 after the merging of the National Museum and the National Art Gallery. More than 1.5 million people visit every year.\nTe Papa Tongarewa translates literally to 'Container of Treasures'. A fuller interpretation is \u2018our container of treasured things and people that spring from mother earth here in New Zealand\u2019. Te Papa's philosophy emphasises the living face behind its cultural treasures, many of which retain deep ancestral links to the indigenous M\u0101ori people. The Museum recognises the partnership that was created by the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, te Tiriti o Waitangi, in 1840.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== New Zealand Dominion Museum ===\n\nThe first predecessor of Te Papa was the Colonial Museum, founded in 1865, with James Hector as founding director. It was built on Museum Street. Halfway through the 1930s the museum moved to the new Dominion Museum building in Buckle Street, where the National Art Gallery of New Zealand was also housed.\n\n\n=== National Art Gallery ===\nThe National Art Gallery was opened in 1936 and occupied the first floor of the National Art Gallery and Dominion Museum building on Buckle Street, Wellington. It was originally populated with a collection donated by Academy of Fine Arts. The Gallery was formed with the passing of the National Art Gallery and Dominion Museum Act in 1930.\nBoth the Dominion Museum and Gallery were overseen by a single board of trustees. The official opening was by the Governor General in 1934.The early holding consisted largely of donations and bequests, including those from Harold Beauchamp, T. Lindsay Buick, Archdeacon Smythe, N. Chevalier, J. C. Richmond, William Swainson, Bishop Monrad, John Ilott and Rex Nan Kivell.Eru D. Gore was secretary-manager from 1936 till his death in 1948 when Stewart Maclennan was appointed the first director. This was the first appointment in New Zealand of a full-time art gallery director. Past directors of the gallery include:\n\nStewart Maclennan (1948\u201368)\nMelvin Day (1968\u201378)\nLuit Bieringa (1979\u201389)\nJenny Harper (1990\u201392)\n\n\n=== Te Papa ===\n\nTe Papa was established in 1992 by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa Act 1992. Part of the remit for Te Papa was to explore the national identity of New Zealand.The official opening took place on 14 February 1998, in a ceremony led by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, Sir Peter Blake, and two children. The first chief executive of the Museum was Cheryll Sotheran. M\u0101ori traditional instrumentalist Richard Nunns co-led the musicians at a dawn ceremony on opening day.The museum is run by a board appointed by the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage. Board members have included: Wira Gardiner, Fiona Campbell, Sue Piper, Judith Tizard, John Judge, Miria Pomare, Michael Bassett, Christopher Parkin, Sandra Lee, Ng\u0101tata Love, Ron Trotter, Glenys Coughlan, Judith Binney, Philip Carter, and Wendy Lai.The museum had one million visitors in the first five months of operation, and between 1 and 1.3 million visits have been made in each subsequent year. In 2004, more space was devoted to exhibiting works from the New Zealand art collection in a long-term exhibition called Toi Te Papa: Art of the Nation. Filmmakers Gaylene Preston and Anna Cottrell documented the development of Te Papa in their film Getting to Our Place.CEOs of Te Papa include:\n\nCheryll Sotheran (1992\u20132002)\nSeddon Bennington (2003 \u2013 July 2009)\nMichael Houlihan (Aug 2010 \u2013 May 2014)\nRick Ellis (Nov 2014 \u2013 May 2017)\nGeraint Martin (May 2017 \u2013 2019)\nCourtney Johnston (2019\u2013present)The museum has sometimes been the centre of controversy. The siting of significant collections at the water's edge on reclaimed land next to one of the world's most active faults has resulted in concern by some people. There has been criticism of the 'sideshow' nature of some exhibits, primarily the Time Warp section, which has closed. There has also been criticism that some exhibits were not given due reverence. For example, a major work by Colin McCahon was at one stage juxtaposed with a 1950s refrigerator in a New Zealand culture exhibition.New Zealand art commentator Hamish Keith has been a consistent critic of Te Papa at different times referring to it as a \"theme park\", the \"cultural equivalent to a fast-food outlet\" and \"not even a de facto national gallery\", but seemed to moderate his opinion later when making a case for exhibition space on the Auckland waterfront.Staff restructuring at Te Papa since 2012 has generated significant controversy. In October 2018, Te Papa management promised to review restructuring plans, indicating that plans would be scaled back. In February 2019, the Collection Manager of Fishes Andrew Stewart and the Collection Manager of Molluscs Bruce Marshall were made redundant. Numerous museum experts and scientists in New Zealand and worldwide criticised the move, with researchers including Steve O'Shea advocating a boycott. In March 2019, the redundancies were delayed. In April 2019, the Museum reversed the decision for Andrew Stewart, offering him an alternative job.  Between April and May 2019, Te Papa advertised a research position for a molluscan curator and awarded the job to an alternative candidate to Bruce Marshall. The advertisement and decision to not offer the job to Bruce Marshall was criticised harshly by outside experts, prompting moa expert Trevor Worthy to end his 30-year research association with the museum in protest.\n\n\n== Current building ==\n \nThe main Te Papa building is on the waterfront in Wellington, on Cable Street. Inside the building are six floors of exhibitions, caf\u00e9s and gift shops dedicated to New Zealand's culture and environment. The museum also incorporates outdoor areas with artificial caves, native bushes and wetlands. A second building on Tory Street is a scientific research facility and storage area, and is not open to the public.\nTe Papa was designed by Jasmax Architects and built by Fletcher Construction. The 36,000-square-metre (390,000 sq ft) building had cost NZ$300 million by its opening in 1998. Earthquake strengthening of the Cable Street building was achieved through the New Zealand-developed technology of base isolation \u2013 essentially seating the entire building on supports made from lead, steel and rubber that slow down the effect of an earthquake.\nThe site was previously occupied by a modern five-storey hotel. This was jacked off its foundations onto numerous rail bogies and transported 200 metres (660 ft) down and across the road to a new site, where it is now the Museum Hotel.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe History Collection includes many dresses and textiles, the oldest of which date back to the sixteenth century. The History Collection also includes the New Zealand Post Archive with around 20,000 stamps and related objects, and the Pacific Collection with about 13,000 historic and contemporary items from the Pacific Islands.\nThere are significant collections of fossils and archaeozoology; a herbarium of about 250,000 dried specimen; a collection of about 70,000 specimen of New Zealand birds; significant amphibians, reptiles and mammals.\nThe museum has the world's largest specimen of the rare colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni). It weighs 495 kilograms (1,091 lb) and is 4.2 metres (14 ft) long. The squid arrived at the museum in March 2007 after being captured by New Zealand fisherman in the Ross Sea off Antarctica. The cultural collections include collections on photography, M\u0101ori taonga (cultural treasures), and Pacific cultures.\nThe Museum of New Zealand is also home to the Elgar Collection a valuable collection of English and French furniture and paintings the oldest of which date back to the seventeenth century. In 1946 the Dominion Museum one of Te Papa's predecessors received a bequest of some Fernside Homestead\u2019s finest antiques from Ella Elgar\u2019s will. Until 1992 these antiques were displayed in period rooms at the Museum but today objects from the Elgar Collection can be seen in many exhibitions at the museum.\n\n\n== Archives ==\nThe Archives are located in a separate building at Tory Street and are open for researchers on appointment. There are two categories of archive collections: the museum archive and the collected archives.\nThe Museum Archive goes back to the founding of the Colonial Museum in 1865 and that comprise the archives of James Hector. The archives of the National Art Gallery of New Zealand are also part of these archives. The Collected Archives fall into two groups:\n\nArt-related records and other archival papers in specialist areas; for instance the archives of Toss Woollaston, Lois White and Leonard Mitchell)\nA wide variety of archival material, that include the diary of Felton Mathew, Surveyor General at the time of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, and battle plans and correspondences related to World War I; for instance the Gallipoli diary of Captain E.P. Cox.\n\n\n== Library ==\nTe Aka Matua Library, previously a publicly accessible library, is now open only to researchers by appointment between 10am-5pm, Monday-Friday. The library is a major research and reference resource, with particular strengths in New Zealand, M\u0101ori, natural history, art, photography and museum studies. It is located on the fourth floor of the main building.\n\n\n== Mahuki ==\nMahuki is Te Papa's innovation accelerator. It is an in-residence programme in which 10 teams develop solutions to challenges facing cultural institutions.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nTe Papa has a mixture of long term exhibitions of cultural objects, hands-on and interactive exhibitions, cultural spaces and touring exhibitions. The long term exhibitions of cultural objects focus on New Zealand history, M\u0101ori culture and New Zealand's natural world. The hands-on and interactive exhibitions focus on engaging particularly young visitors and include both indoor areas and out-door areas built and planted for the purpose. The key cultural space is the Te Hono ki Hawaiki marae with very impressive whakairo.All permanent exhibitions are free. Many of the touring exhibition are ticketed, but there are occasional free days.In March 1998, a 7 centimetres (2.8 in) high statue of the Virgin Mary sheathed in a condom called Virgin in a Condom was exhibited, an art work by Tania Kovats which attracted protests by Christians.Te Taiao Nature, a 1,400-square-metre exhibition focusing on New Zealand's natural world, opened on 11 May 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRongomaraeroa, the contemporary marae of Te Papa\nNew Zealand Dominion Museum building\nTales from Te Papa, a television series about objects from the collection\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nCollections online",

          "At Te Papa, it is an amazing experience. I only visited for 2 hours but in that tome I only got to see 1 exhibit, the WW1 exhibit. It won't be around for ever so if you have time it definitely pays off to have a visit to it!",
          "Amazing museum! Fantastic interactive exhibits. We loved it so much we went back the next day.",
          "Excellent. You need several days to see through The Papa, excluding any special exhibitions. Post Covid-19, still good, though there are fewer special exhibitions",

          "An intimate experience of the story of New Zealand 's history, culture and its people with a emphasis on M\u0101ori settlement and European immigration.  You can spend hours in this excellent museum and as it turns out, you will.  Definitely make this a must do in your visit to Wellington.",
          "Great museum fully stocked with engaging exhibits. A tip for locals don't buy the tickets when a new exhibition comes up because it's usually free after 3 months or so such as the Anzac exhibit. Loved it but the science component of the exhibits is missing like why is that happening. Still great time there but product are overpriced",
          "We always love visiting Te Papa. We came (this time) for the Alice in Wonderland exhibit. What a great exhibit; fun, imaginative, & informative. Even a whole day didn't see us through all that Te Papa has to offer. The children love it as much as I do.",

          "Enjoyable museum with something for everyone and interactive displays. Fun for the family.",
          "Great museum ! Spent almost a whole day here because there is just so much to see. The war exhibit is a must see ! Very interesting and interactive.

          "We spent a full day here. The guided tours are very worthwhile. The cafe is a bit expensive but the food is delicious. Unfortunately they don't have decaf coffee. The many areas are all very interesting. Don't miss the gemstones!",

          "Amazing adventure with the kids do see the ANZAC exhibition amazing",
          "Absolutely excellent museum. Gallipoli exhibition was extremely well done and very moving as well as educational. We were there all day and didn't see half of the exhibits. Seemed to be lots of interactive stuff to keep kids on board too. Coffee and muffin in cafe was very good if a little pricier than elsewhere.",
          "Best museum I have ever been to! You'll learn everything about the history, geology, fauna, flora, and culture of NZ. Excellent for adults and great for kids. Highly recommended!",
          "Missing a cool childrens play area. Most libraries have a better kids set up. Didn't like the river water display. Showing samples of real rivers would have been more informative and less emotive. Otherwise an excellent museum",
          "It's been the second time we went to Te Papa - would do it again and again and again! We took one of the 1-hour tours and explored by ourselves afterwards. The Gallipoli exhibition shows detailed, huge models, made by the Weta Caves - just \u2026",

          "A must-visit when in Wellington, and it's free entry!  Love how interactive some of the sections are; the kids coming in are enjoying learning and just checking out the different features/displays.  May require more than one visit, unless maybe when you spend the whole day exploring everything it has to offer.",
          "Fascinating and beautifully set out museum - and free! Excellent exhibition of the WW2 Gallipoli campaign, and lovely displays of NZ geology and cultural history. Highly recommended!",
          "There's something for everyone at Te Papa. Always a happening place with usually one big travelling exhibition every few months. On Wellington's waterfront with great views over Wellington Harbour as well. Parking can be at a premium for this very popular museum.",

          "Loved the Gallipoli exhibition, wow.",
          "A great place to spend a few hours with the kids. The displays are well thought out and many have interactive exhibits included. If there is one thing I find is a little of a concern is the price of the special limited time  exhibition's . \u2026",
          "This is an incredible museum. Free entry and so much to see and do. You could walk around all day and take in so much. The Gallipoli exhibit is breathtaking with so much easy to read information and videos along with voice overs. There are \u2026",

          "Beautiful museum with extremely well crafted exhibits. They really tell a story. Plenty for kids to do as well. Best of all? Free entry for almost all exhibits. Must-see. \n\nDownside of free entry is the crowds. We came shortly after opening \u2026",
          "Great. Comprehensive and interesting. Not a massive slog, well curated to give you a flavour. And I'm sure more in depth if needed",
          "The Te Papa museum is a lovely museum in Wellington. It definitely gets busy as the natural history sections of the museum are geared more towards children. Personally, I found that section of the museum the least interesting. The other \u2026",

          "Best museum I've ever been too....",
          "It's a great museum! Lots to see and very well layed out. You should definitely make time for it, especially since it's free! We were lucky to catch the Alice in Wonderland exhibition (not free) which was really well done. Good cuppa and a nice shop too.",
          "Excellent that's it's free. Plenty of exhibitions to visit to learn about NZs unique history. Favourite by far is the first section with all the natural history. We took our time going through everything which took us about 4 hours. We didn't do the paid exhibition however.",
          "This place is amazing. We only had a few hours to explore and we didn't even get through half of it. If you are in the area, this is a must see. Note: some areas don't allow photo. Please be respectful.",
          "Fabulous museum with a great mix of educational attractions. Anzac displays particularly memorable with super sized wax models of various war heroes. Portrait gallery also impressive but suggest a short bio on each painting as done in Canberra.",

          "The Great War exhibition is very harrowing and emotional for those who linger at the oversized statues and listen to the audio clips. It makes me feel sorry for those who are rushing their children through with just a \"Wow, look at that!\" \u2026",

          "Te Papa is always worth a visit....last time it was an amazing Pompeii presentation this time it was a moving, graphical presentation of Gallipoli.....so real that I still have trouble getting the reality of that terrible war and what the ANZACs went through out of my head.",
          "Free entry to most of the exhibitions make this museum a wonderful stop to learn about New Zealand\u2019s history and Maori culture. We especially enjoyed the giant human art works in the Gallipoli exhibition and the Maori tattoo photography (both free of charge). Changing paid",

          "While the museum is free of charge; we pre-paid for the guided orientation tour (+/- 1hr) that I believe takes place on the hour. We were on first tour of the day with Norrie (sp?) who offers an excellent presentation. There were only 5 in our group so we moved along and",
          "We have been before but still a great place to spent 2-3 hours - Cpt. Cook's ship's cannon Peter Jackson's amazing models of ANZAC's, The shaking house and the Maori exhibitions are all really worthwhile",

          "We have visited this museum before but it never fails to disappoint. The Maori section is very interesting as is the Maori art. I think they have changed the downstairs exhibit, but there is plenty for children to do. We had coffee in the comfortable caf\u00e9 on the 4th floor, and",

          "The Te Papa Museum is fabulous, we only had a few hours to visit as we were on a cruise and really you need the whole day. The visual displays are brilliant and suitable for all ages. The emotional, sombre and gripping display of Gallipoli was breathtaking and the best we have",

          "Lots of stories about history of the country. Including about their participation in wars. Too much to take away and digest.",
          "We made the mistake of visiting on a weekend..! It was so busy. As the place is free, I guess everyone takes advantage on the weekends. It was also Pride weekend so maybe additionally busier? Lots to see and do. Some exhibitions were a little dull but most very interactive and",

          "Te Papa is the national museum of New Zealand. Exhibits focus on natural history of animals, people and geography. The special exhibit on New Zealand becoming a nation through the battle of Gallipoli is extremely moving. Parts of the exhibit were made by the people who worked on",
          "We visited the Maori & Gallipoli exhibitions and were very impressed. Whilst the Maori part was all a bit confusing with there being so much information to take in, the Gallipoli section was absolutely brilliant. The story of the battle was extensive, detailed and very well put",
          "Te Papa Museum is a must. Good for young and old with a variety of exhibits that cater to everyone's tastes. Sits right in the center of Wellington. Some floors are free. Great for little ones with interactive areas. When we were there, Alice in Wonderland was an excellent",

          "Probably my 5th or 6th visit over the last 10 years or so. Always impressed and today was no exception. Although I have seen the some of the exhibits before it was still fresh and enjoyable. The new Alice in Wonderland exhibit although interesting was somewhat disappointing",
          "This was the first place of interest we visited immediately after checking in to our hotel. It was highly recommended by friends who had visited. We spent the whole afternnon exploring the several floors and different themes of the exhibits. Truly fascinating exhibits from",
          "This beautiful museum is worth a visit for anyone who wants to know more about New Zealand's history. Plants, animals, people. Distributed over various room and several floors, there's a lot to discover. It's shocking to see how much greener this land use to be, very interesting",
          "It\u2019s a must do when visiting New Zealand. I\u2019d recommend to start from the 4th floor or make your way down. You\u2019ll learn so much about NZ history and culture. Loved it!",
          "The whole museum is good but the Gallipoli exhibition is incredible. The larger than life models of soldiers in action coupled with great interactive displays and commentary from actual soldiers makes this a moving and informative tour. Well worth the time.",
          "Went on a rainy day while traveling around new Zealand thank goodness for the rain it is a brilliant place probably would have given it a miss if the weather was nice spent about seven hours there would recommend to anyone",

          "Really enjoyed our two visits here - busier in the morning than afternoon and so many things to see we found it best to split our visits into 2 hr max blocks. That way we focussed on some gallery and really enjoyed it rather than trying to see everything. I found the nature",

          "We got 100% more out of our visit to this exceptional museum by taking the tour. We had limited time. The one hour tour helped us prioritize what we could see in the time we had. I noticed that many people who hadn't paid for the tour listened in on our guides comments. The",
          "Situated right on the water and at the end of a vibrant boardwalk, we really enjoyed the museum. Most exhibits were free, and the book/gift store had a wide selection of offerings. It was close to a number of restuarants, so easy to get food before or after the visit.",
          "There is so much to see and do in this museum! If you want to see all of it, you will need the entire day. With large exhibitions about nature, history and culture, there is something interesting for everyone. Moreover, the museum seems suitable for all ages: there are many",
          "A must do with some consideration for seniors. The Gallipoli Exhibit is an experience of a life time I found! It deserved more time than we could give it (2 hours) & there was so much to take in. The visuals were extraordinary & the the amounts of information brought this major",
          "We visited this museum as part of our 4 day Wellington trip, there is a lot to see and exhaustion is likely to set in before you have seen it all! Comprehensive explanations are provided with each exhibit and the visuals are all well presented . We experienced the Alice In",

          "Only had a brief time in the museum as it was part of an excursion. Guided tour especially for our group have a flavour of the museum. Highlight was the special exhibition on the Gallipoli campaign. Ideally you would need a full day to do the museum justice.",
          "For the most part, the museum is free. The Gallipoli exhibit is just stunning with its large scale monuments. Both young and old will truly appreciate what they have done here to tell the story of this war. The rest of the museum explores the natural wonders of New Zealand.",
          "exciting and interactive and well presented. Also enjoyed the ANZAC exhibition and the earthquake section",

          "So much to do and 99% of it's free. Gallopoli display just amazing. A def see. Parking not badly priced either and plenty of it. After the museum just walk along the waterfront it's right out the front door. Will def be back.",
          "We went to Te Papa specifically to see Peter Jackson's Gallipoli exhibit and we weren't disappointed! What an absolutely amazing piece of history. The lifelike figures were definately the superstars of the exhibit. There was a huge amount of information available to read and",
          "We have been before and again we\u2019re not disappointed. We went to see the Maori exhibits were were very well set out and very good information. Tours were available but we managed to see it all,by ourselves. A must place to visit I believe. The cafe served very good for which is",
          "All areas were wonderfully presented in such a way as to maintain interest. Over 2 days we spent about 8 hours, the highlight being the section on the new Zealand participation at Gallipoli, which was a most moving representation of the Kiwis there, including various individual",
          "I took a guided tour at Te Papa and it was well worth it. Excellent guide and I learnt a lot about NZ!",
          "I have such fond memories of Te Papa from my childhood. Nature and animal exhibitions are great for children and something that was one of my favorites. It provides so many opportunities for learning about the world and specifically New Zealand. There is something for everyone,",

          "Visited Te Papa on a very windy day. Possibly the reason, including the fact that a cruise liner was docked that it was so busy. Notwithstanding, we enjoyed every minute of the visit - concentrating on the 2 major displays on Nature, and on Gallipoli. The only dissapointment was",
          "My favourite parts are definitely the Maori and natural history parts. I definitely did not spend enough time here. Would have loved to spend a lot longer reading every single thing. Just so fascinating and well curated.",
          "We have been to many museums in as many years but have to say this one is fantastic. This building truly is testament to a nation and its treasures and it\u2019s name is so appropriate. It\u2019s too big for one visit so we would recommend going several times.",

          "This time we had time to see the excellent Gallipoli exhibition as well as everything else this museum has to offer. The Maori section is strong with some good exhibits. The only criticism I could have is that there is a lot of story telling with panels etc but rather a paucity",
          "This is a free museum located in Wellington\u2019s harbor area. Our group opted for a 90 minute guided tour which offered us more insight and was worth the cost. There was so much to see that we eventually spent a total of 4 hours here. Many of the exhibits are interactive, and",

          "This museum is free and is totally eyedropping. The World War 1 section is by far the bet in the world. Created by the company that did the Lord of the Rings films. The WWI exhibit is an emotive and immersive experience that cannot be fully described without walking through",

          "Enjoyed our trip to the museum, especially the Anzac display; the displays and the figures are very unique",
          "A great range of displays including prehistoric, fossils, eco awareness, tectonic plate movement explained simply - even I got it! - earthquake house and far more than we could hope to squeeze into our short visit. There is a great cafeteria attached to the building with",
          "Te Papa Museum should be on your itinerary if you are showing international guests around the beautiful Wellington waterfront. For that matter it's a must see for locals as well. The exhibitions change so it's the type of place to go back to from time to time. The location",
          "This is a must-see for anyone visiting Wellington even if you\u2019re not really a museum person. Everything is designed to ensure your attention so as a result you can interact with everything and for small and big kids Aldine this is ana maxing experience. Set over 4 floors",
          "Spent weeks traveling the country on our honeymoon and this was by and large our favorite museum! There was an incredible color exhibit while we were there that was spectacular! The main exhibits are terrific! Definitely worth a visit!",
          "This is an incredible museum with state-of-the-art displays! It\u2019s not only a very informative museum, but is one of the worlds best museums. This is a must-see in Wellington!",
          "Visited specifically to see the Tatau exhibition (free). Friendly staff, nicely curated. Beautiful giftshop downstairs (and others noticed on other levels) with plenty of locally made products",
          "Fantastic exhibits and very interactive. We took the one hour guided tour which gives you a great overview of the museum. After that we spent about 45 minutes at the Gallolipi exhibit which is very moving and a \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d. This museum realllygives you a feel for the history",
          "This museum is absolutely outstanding and there\u2019s no charge. the ANZAC memorial side of things is incredible, it\u2019s all so worth a visit",
          "The day we visited the museum the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra was performing so that was an added bonus to an already interesting and entertaining experience. Some great exhibitions on our visit.",
          "Must see the amazing wax sculptures of our people from the war, absolutely breathtaking, ensure to listen to each story, and take in all that they went through, rather sad yet so courageous, takes your breath away adding shivers to your shine. Ne sure to do this museum you wont",
          "I didn\u2019t do all the museum due to lack of time so focused on levels two and three. The displays were good and the explanations of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes were interesting. The chance to experience an earthquake in a house was great. You need to allow sufficient time",
          "Had a day in wellington and decided to go to this museum. The only thing I regret is not spending more time there. We should have gone earlier so we could have spent more time going through the exhibits.",
          "Cannot recommend highly enough. A world class museum with fantastic interactive exhibitions that engage all ages. Couldn\u2019t believe it was free. A must see if you\u2019re in the city.",
          "Please stop here! The museum itself is free, but I had to come back a second time ad I wasn't able to see all the exhibits the first day, plus I wanted to see the wonderland exhibit, which is worth the money! Dont forget the outdoor bush exhibit, as its a quick and refreshing",
          "Very good museum the entertains all ages. Great way to learn about early life in NZ. Well worth a visit and has free entry.",
          "The highlight was the giant squid! The museum has a good concept and I loved the giant war time hero\u2019s. A great visit and I could have spent alone time going around the museum.",
          "We are not usually great fans of museums but this is an outstanding exception.It really is magnificent and I would highly recommend a long visit.",
          "There is so much variety on offer in Te Papa - it's one of the best museums I've ever been to. Highly recommended",
          "This museum definitely is worth a visit. It is interactive and captivates children and adults. The nature section is excellent. So too is the expo about Gallipoli. I thought I wouldn't like it but this expo is really interesting. It helps you understand what these poor men have",
          "This has 4 levels and so many different things to see. The 4th floor is very interesting about Maori and non Maori history and the treaty, other floors have exhibitions about earthquakes and volcanoes and extinct and non extinct animals. There's something for everyone. The cafe",
          "we have finally made it to see the Gallipoli display at Te Papa. What a powerful and heart wrenching display, something every New Zealander should see",
          "Went and visited the gillopi exhibition and was very impressed with the information the layout and especially the realistic statues.",
          "We had a great visit to Te Papa. The Anzac Day exhibition was so impressive, the characters were so realistic. We also spent a lot of time in the art area. My son loved the kaleidoscope and changing the colours.",
          "Great source of information. We loved it. There is so much to see and learn about this beautiful country.",
          "Three years ago we visited Te Papa, twice. This time, during a cruise stop-over we headed straight to the Anzac exhibition and took our time to absorb the messages. The exhibition, designed by Peter Jackson (of Lord of the Rings fame and built at the Weta Workshop in",
          "Great museum with a variety of exhibits. We\u2019ve been here many times and there is always something new to discover.",
          "We were shocked that this museum was free and learned a ton about NZ. New Zealand's history truly comes alive in each of the exhibits.",
          "The museum covers both natural and human history and contemporary events. It's also used for commemorations and events. If you want to know about this country's past, present and future this is where you want to go. There are clear explanations for everything and respectful",
          "Amongst so much to see, the gaintlike statues of Gallipoli WW1 soldiers and the \u201cBouquet\u201d of confetti caught mid fall by Nike Savvas in a celebration that never ends in the Toi Art section was outstanding for me.",
          "Fantastic museum, a real \"container of treasures\". Could have spent days here but sadly only had a few hours!",
          "We visited Te Papa basically trying to get a better understanding of the local culture but came out with much more than that. We got tickets for the Wonderland exhibit which is awesome and very interactive, even if not familiar with the story. I highly recommend it. The layout",
          "Terrific exhibitions, child friendly, encourages participation. Staff very helpful. Set your imagination free! Art on the top floor was a soothing balm after the rigours of the terrifying Gallipoli exhibition with double life size utterly lifelike figures. At least half a day",
          "We went to Te Papa recently and were most impressed with the quality of the Museum. It has been very well thought out and the exhibitions are some of the most interesting we have ever seen. Well done Te Papa!",
          "An amazing interactive museum that had all the family engaged. The Gallipoli display was amazing. We could have spent longer.",
          "Te papa is a beautiful place for those wanting to know more about NZ or those who love interactive exhibitions. Would recommend being there all day though cause you spend a long time in one exhibition. Wish the cafe was open longer though could do with a coffee half way through",
          "Great work way to learn of the Maori culture and lots of other pacific islanders. We learnt so much but didnt have time to see everything in one visit. Will return!",
          "Te Papa is a must see for visitors to Wellington. Constantly updated exhibitions means there's always something new to experience.",
          "We had only allocated a few hours in the morning to this museum - and how we regret it. What a fabulous display - the range of interactive displays are such a crowd puller. You'll want to go through each and every one of them - and that takes time! This is definitely worth a",
          "After numerous trips to Te Papa,it continues to wow me with its creative and thought provoking exhibitions and displays. Lots of interactive fun for the children too. A must-see while in Wellington.",
          "What an amazing museum, but you need like a day and a half (minimum) to get around all the wonderful exhibits...and don't forget to go outside by the cafe and do the forest walk. The best exhibit whilst we were there was the Gallipoli remembrance, which was an astounding walk",
          "Te Papa is ever changing. The basic static displays are well worth seeing, but they constantly have special events which are well worth visiting on their own",
          "very good museum no entry fee! but the museum is in perfect conditions and interactive personal very friendly you feel welcome",
          "Really enjoyed the Alice in Wonderland and Nature exhibitions. Really interactive and alot of good facts. Giant squid was very cool!!",
          "Incredibly, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa offers free admission. When we visited in December 2019, one of the top floors had several unique modern art installations. Some were hands-on exhibits and many involved movement and/or changing displays. Other floors",
          "New Zealand's best museum is free (except for special exhibitions) and the Nature section is brilliant for kids - especially the earthquake simulator.",
          "The museum is fantastic! We spent a dismal, grey morning here and found the exhibitions to be interesting, well laid out and highly educational. As a free attraction this is top notch. We do not have little ones, but the level of thought in all the interactive resources was",
          "Hands down the best museum I have been to in years. The Gallipoli section is both moving and confronting, and is worth the visit alone. Incredible large lifelike figures captured in motion- as we discovered later- created by WETA. We spent about 4 hours here over 2 days and",
          "Can't believe this is free - amazing diverse beautifully presented. great location, easy parking. surrounded by waterfront walkway that connects to the wharf where there are great restaurants",
          "We were visiting Wellington and decided to take our kids to the Alice and Wonderland exhibit. We went with friends so there were two almost 2 year olds and one 4 year old. The place was packed and the exhibition was more for older people who were big fans of Alice and",
          "This museum has so much to offer, allow yourself several hours to really enjoy. Make sure to see the Gallipoli the scale of our war exhibit. It is so well put together, thought provoking and emotional. I did get misty eyed.",
          "We had rather limited time, so we chose to focus on only one area of the museum, on the experience of NZ soldiers in the Gallipoli disaster of 1915. I thought the exhibition was wonderful, combining fairly detailed descriptions of the events taking place, with information on the",
          "Enjoyed this insight into Maori culture, bit to commercialised but interesting. Good guide who was very informative.",
          "We mainly visited the Gallipoli exhibition and it was outstanding! I had no prior knowledge of this campaign of World War I and it was so informative and heartbreaking at the same time. The exhibition was stunning! We also spent a little time in the Maori historical exhibit",
          "We enjoyed the Gallipoli exhibition, by luck we arrived at a quiet time so went straight in. When we came out there was quite a queue (no cruise ship in port). We saw that and then the art on the upper floor, it was great seeing the real paintings from famous NZ artists.",
          "What an amazing and exciting day out. The Gallipoli exhibition was the BEST exhibit I have ever seen. Wondeful free family day out.",
          "Alice in Wonderland was not an exhibit I would normally have chosen, but we followed a friends recommendation and are so glad we did. It was weird & wacky & informative & fascinating. The fact that you had to pay to go in also meant the numbers were more manageable than they",
          "This is a terrific museum which tells all about the beginnings of New Zealand (relatively new) and all the tribes of people that settled in New Zealand.",
          "This is a truly fantastic museum, It is carefully curated and offers something for everyone. I particularly liked the Samoan Tattoo exhibition, which was beautiful and thought provoking, but the permanent exhibitions were interesting and well presented. The merchandise and cafe",
          "History of New Zealand including artwork, display of native and animal artifacts, etc. Very colorful and unique items.",
          "Kia Ora It's the most popular place in Wellington and a must visit for every person visiting the city. Earth's history and feeling of earthquake along with war history are the most important things I liked it. A very good souvenirs shop at the ground floor as well Wahe mai",
          "We were restricted for time, so only saw the tribute to the ANZACs exhibit. Wow! No Kiwi or Aussie should miss this, if only to stand in awe beside five amazing representations of some true war heroes. I challenge anyone not to be moved as you lay a poppy beside the last figure",
          "This is a good place to visit. Took my seven year old son. He had had enough by about the third floor. Heep to see. Food in the cafe was very expensive otherwise it was good",
          "..an experience not to miss..much of New Zealand is covered..the vast exhibitions were wonderful both for adults and children alike..",
          "Worth of more than one visit : Nike Savvas Finale : Bouquet is an outstanding colorful installation. Lots of other great stuff too!",
          "Enjoyed another trip to Te Papa both to see new exhibits but also wander through the place again. Alway love swinging into the Gift Shop at the end.",
          "This is a good quality museum which is not just collection of things. The museum seemed to have many activities which made it lively place.",
          "Great tour during which I learnt a great deal about Maori culture. Very helpful and informative guide.",
          "Best museum ever!! Actually not a museum at all... the Wonderland feature was brilliant and the Gallipoli presentation a must - very moving ...",
          "The museum was definitely worth the visit. It contained Maori, native New Zealanders, history and artifacts. There was a special exhibit on Gallipoli, a battle I was unfamiliar with that New Zealanders participated in, that was amazing to see. Many artifacts and large, life-like",
          "Excellent museum, awesome to learn about the rich history and culture of Aoteroa and a must do in Wellington",
          "Very informative . If you don't visit Te Papa then you haven't visited New Zealand. It takes you from the pre gold Rush era to the present . It shows how New Zealand grew it's economy to what it is now.",
          "A beautiful decorated museum, 6 floors with lots of educational information and interactive activities. Free entrance. The Gallipolo war exhibition, the Maori culture, the art department and the nature and history of New Zealand are very interesting. Also very nice for children.",
          "Gold standard for museums. Well set out, helpful staff, interesting and thoughtful displays. The Gallipoli Exhibition is outstanding- over life size models provoking thought, reflection, and questions. A must do.",
          "We called into see an exhibition of what looked like ticker-tape. Fabulous fun. Took the opportunity to visit other exhibitions while we were there.",
          "Lots of information about the Maori and all of New Zealand. Could certainly spend an entire day here. Had a good guided tour, but would have liked more time.",
          "This museum is full of activities and interesting information. The exhibits were very informative and interactive. The exhibits had lots of real animals and old items from the m\u0101uris and it has the largest squid ever caught in the world! The war exhibit was full of massive to",
          "What can I say - Gallipoli is the best museum exhibition I have ever visited. Moving insights into the battles from those who were there. Very sad but an important story sensitively told.",
          "If you are history and culture lover then this is must visit. Larger than life, rich with culture and history, we spent almost 5 hours before we even realised it...beautiful!!!",
          "A great museum, with many different sections and exhibitions. The exhibition dedicated to the Gallipoli war, the natural science museum, the Maori culture, modern art and many others are very interesting. Free admittance, free wifi.",
          "Wow! What an excellent exhibit to showcase Lewis Carroll and his adventures of Alice in Wonderland. So many fun things to see but loved how they showed from the beginning to how we interpret Alice today. Loved the light show in the Mat Hatters Tea Room - very creative.",
          "This museum is fantastic for kids, particularly the ground floor exhibits, with lots of interactive displays about earthquakes, tsunami and the wildlife of New Zealand. The current exhibit on Gallipoli with models by Weta Workshop is well worth a visit too.",
          "When I visited there was a change of exhibitions being undertaken. This seemed to affect the setting of some of the permanent exhibits and detracted from my appreciation of the museum. Hopefully, if I am ever in Wellington again I will be able to appreciate the museum better.",
          "Our friends took us to this museum. Parking onsite is about 8 dollars for two hours but the museum itself is free. We only had two hours before we had to catch our ferry to south island but we were so pleased we went. In fact our only regret was not having more time to explore.",
          "This is an amazing museum and we only got to nibble at a few of its fabulous exhibits. Filled with history, culture and art you could easily spend a day or two. We were especially wowed by the Galipoli exhibit, the Maori exhibit and some amazing art installations.",
          "What amazing displays! Spectacular art was a surprise to us as we weren\u2019t familiar with what the museum had to offer (we just knew it was an important place of interest and had some time to kill) - wow! Were we surprised!! Culturally significant displays and insights, as well as",
          "This is one of the better museums you'll ever visit. Every exhibit is modern, new and well displayed. The Gallipoli exhibit takes you through the entire ordeal in a very realistic display. The Maori room is also very impressive.",
          "Truly one of the best museums I\u2019ve even experienced. There\u2019s no entry charge and there\u2019s even a place to check coats and bags that\u2019s also at no charge. This place is huge and I have no idea how long it would take to fully explore. Whatever you do, however, do not miss the",
          "This museum is a must - they have excellent displays on New Zealand's natural history - especially the explanation of the active nature of New Zealand geology - volcanoes, earthquakes, and their implications for the country.The museum is also a wealth of information about the",
          "Went here twice in one week. It is brilliant, every floor has something interactive for kids to play with and it is really nicely laid out and easy to walk round with a pram.",
          "I never really expect too much from hugely touristic venues but I really enjoyed the food at Te papa. I would highly reccomend the double chocolate muffins !",
          "The Te Papa museum is a must visit if ever in Wellington. The museum is free of charge, only limited/traveling exhibits have a fee. The museum is 4 floors and is great for adults and children. There are a lot of areas and hands-on sections designed for children. As a visitor",
          "Interactive, engaging, accessible museum where the emphasis is on meeting the visitor where they are with interesting hands-on exhibits, kid friendly themes, and larger than life insights into New Zealand and its people.",
          "We hadnt planned on visiting the museum but popped in as it was free and we were passing. There were some incredible exhibits but there was a lot of reading. We would have learned a lot more if we had more time, but it was still lovely to walk around.",
          "If in Wellington, do not miss this brilliant museum. All tastes are catered for with a number of hands on activities for children. The Gallipoli Exhibition is well worth a mention. For Australians and New Zealanders, this is a must. The whole campaign in 1915 is meticulously",
          "This museum has some world-class exhibits, including Gallipoli, Nature, and modern art. We could have stayed much longer, but we ran out of gas. It's also free!",
          "Interactive, fun and very informative. I am not usually a big fan of museums but i absolutely loved this one and wanted to stay all day. Main exhibits are free and you can pay for the special attractions (Alice in wonderland was on while we were there- we didn't have time for",
          "We found the Maori culture section interesting. It was very busy with schoolchildren and the signage could be improved, but we did eventually find the earthquake simulator, which was fun and a very short queue.",
          "The Gallipoli (WWI battle in which many New Zealanders fought) was done in such a moving way, focusing as it did on individual stories and with stunning, larger-than-life, realistic displays. Then the newly remodeled Natural History section is fabulous! Plan to be in the",
          "Every visit to Te Papa delights. There is always something new to learn, to experience, to savour. If its your first time, I recommend taking a guided tour, if not, just wander!",
          "My title says it all. One needs to understand and be immersed into this culture. And...museums in NZ are free. How else to encourage the masses to see their past.",
          "So glad we fit this Te Papa museum into our visit. The WW1 exhibition was so well done and a very moving experience. The nature exhibits were good as well, but the WW1 was worth the time. We probably spent about 3 hours there. The museum is free.",
          "We really wanted to see the Gallipoli exhibit they have while we were visiting on a cruise - it did not let us down. An incredible exhibit which at times was quite emotional. The rest of the museum was great to explore as well. Loved that they had a coat room to check our heavy",
          "This was as good as everybody told us we spent the whole day there and needed longer really my favourite was the gallipoli it was very emotional and real with the soldiers and the little movies with the 3d glasses glad we got to see it before it finished",
          "We were on a cruise ship and this was the second stop on the free shuttle. We had to rush, and did not get to thoroughly enjoy all the amazing exhibits. If time is short in port, go here first.",
          "Enjoyed what we saw, the fact that there is no entry charge is refreshing. Worth your time to check it out",
          "The museum is a good intoduction to New Zealand. The different exhibits were well spread and very interesting for both adults and kids.",
          "We have visited many museums around the World, ranging in quality from the \u201cgood, the bad and the ugly\u201d, with several of the ugly charging an entrance fee. Te Papa Tongarewa, the National Museum of New Zealand (Wellington), is definitely in the \u201cgood\u201d category, great really, and",
          "The most interesting thing for me was the visit underground to see the rubber mounts this huge building floats on to avoid damage in earthquakes. Good permanent displays partnered with special shows and exhibition.",
          "The tour guide makes all the difference. At the House of Parliament we had an awesome guide, but not at the museum. He was passionate about the place and provided tremendous detail, but I almost fell asleep once! A must see on your trip, but get a tour guide that looks like",
          "This museum is perfect for young and old alike, the interactive and enthralling displays will interest everyone. Allow at least four hours if you want to experience it all, or visit it a couple of times as it\u2019s well worth the time.",
          "This is a wonderful museum and one you should not miss if in the Wellington area. First off, the museum is free which makes for a great way to spend a day. Second, it has such interactive and interesting displays. You can learn about the natural history of NZ, the human",
          "We had an amazing tour guide Roger. He was part comedian and actor. Time flew as he guided us through the museum giving an knowledgeable and entertaining commentary. He had vast knowledge and a great delivery. He was even aware of our Canadian Politics.",
          "A visit to this exhibit is a must and worth a trip to Wellington simply to be involved in this brilliantly put together experience. We spent 3 hours in it and were amazed. Emotional is a good description of how one feels listening to the portrayal of ANZAC events.",
          "We visited Te papa museum and it were both educational and emotional. There are learning about nature interactive with house simulations of earthquake and all kind of bird sound. We also went to War exhibition and got so emotional for reading history of the war. We enjoyed it!",
          "A museum where technology complement the showcasing of what is New Zealand. We took a guided tour. The guide was quite good with a nice touch of humour, but it's not necessary to have one. The items are properly classified with proper detailing. New Zealand does not have much of",
          "absolutely magnificant display of then nz troops and an great war figures so real Aussies RSL should look at this too",
          "We had a guided tour for over 2 hours and then we spent almost 3 more hours in the museum. We had lunch in the cafe which was very good and reasonably priced. There is an outside area for walkling. Worth it!",
          "This museum is beautiful inside and out. It is filled with plenty of information about Maori culture and everything related to New Zealand history. It is fantastic and and worth seeing if you're visiting Wellington!",
          "This is a fantastic facility for all ages combining learning, practical tourism, history and art. A must do in Wellington",
          "Came out with a much better grasp of the complexities of New Zealand\u2019s history of human occupation! Took an individual guided tour which was helpful and informative. Impressive building on a beautiful sight on the waterfront.",
          "We really loved this museum. Our time was short so we visited the natural history and geology section and the Maori culture. The displays are extremely visual and interactive; not a lot of reading of small print on static displays required! So informative at every level, a real",
          "We had hoped to learn more about the arrival of the first humans in NewZealand from Polynesia and the subsequent arrival of Europeans and the development into modern day NewZealand presented in a chronological order with dates. The information may have been there but presented",
          "Excellent place to spend half a day as it was so interesting . Very emotional in places with Maori and NZ early history given. Brilliant Wildlife information. Artwork impressive .",
          "Excellent museum. A taonga. Of the highest standard..interactive, fun and everchanging. Would highly recommend",
          "This museum has so much local history and exhibits. The Maori history was great and there is also an outside area with plants and geology exhibits. We stayed there for hours.",
          "Commonly known as Te Papa (\"Our Place\"), its full name means \"Container of Treasures\". This is an understatement. We enjoyed an hour long tour with Paul. The highlights for me occurred in the natural history and Maori sections. -- An interesting video illustrated the",
          "Wow, this is a different kind of museum...interactive , forward thinking, and well set out.. and Free! That was unexpected.. I love the Maori language was put first.. Fabulous gift shop and cafe.. well patronised.. NZ be proud of this.. well worth the praise it gets",
          "Te papa is a wonderful multi-museum. There is a lot about the beginnings and the development of Aotearoa. There is a lot about the Maori people and their customs and culture. There is a section about Maori tattoos. There is a large exhibition of birds and animals extinct or",
          "The building has an impressive interior, but my overall impression is one of relatively little actual content, especially compared to the old Wellington museum or the current Auckland one. The outdoor bush walk is very nice, and there was one (temporary) art installation that",
          "We normally opt out of museums however decided to visit this one and the exhibitions are very creative/ interactive, lots to see and learn from. Spend 2 hours at the facility. If you are in Wellington this is a must visit.",
          "Almost at the end of the quayside close to the little community theater this museum focuses mainly on local Maori artifacts. We found the whole experience very informative and well presented. Found a traditional long boat that my GGG Uncle had assisted in restoring. There are a",
          "A combination of art, story telling, truth telling and a natural history museum this is a must see destination for Wellington. Beautiful building, free entry and friendly staff. Allow several hours to make the most of your time.",
          "This museum is gigantic! We spent four hours, but could have easily spent more. It's free to visit. 10/10 I would recommend.",
          "A great place to spend a rainy day in Wellington. There is so much to see. The Gallipoli war exhibit is dramatic and will touch you deeply - a great tribute. I recommend a whole day for this museum, and even then you will probably miss some. Fantastic experience",
          "the Gallipoli exhibit on the first floor is incredibly well done. the details presented about the battle was impressive. the WETA studios (the Lord of the rings /Hobbit folks) designed statues were amazing. the earthquake house was neat as well. Noce gift shop and cafe. Very",
          "I'm sure the exhibits change as all museums do but the Gallipoli exhibit was wonderful. The excellent explanations of this disastrous campaign of WWI was matched by the amazing larger-than-life exhibits provided by WETA. (also you should to the WETA tour in Wellington). I",
          "Worthwhile place to visit. During my visit the exhibitions included Gallipoli, NZ natural history, and plenty of Maori history. It was all very well put together and I had a really good time exploring it.",
          "It's usually hard to get excited by a museum visit, but this museum and the fascinating behind the scenes tour we took was right up there as one of the best experiences of our trip. We've been to the British Museum in London among others and this ranks right up near the top in",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Zealandia, formerly known as the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary, is a protected natural area in Wellington, New Zealand, the first urban completely fenced ecosanctuary, where the biodiversity of 225 ha (just under a square mile) of forest is being restored.  The sanctuary was previously part of the water catchment area for Wellington, between Wrights Hill (bordering Karori) and the Brooklyn wind turbine on Polhill.\n\nMost of New Zealand's ecosystems have been severely modified by the introduction of land mammals that were not present during the evolution of its ecosystems, and have had a devastating impact on both native flora and fauna. The sanctuary, surrounded by a pest-exclusion fence, is a good example of an ecological island, which allows the original natural ecosystems to recover by minimising the impact of introduced flora and flora.\nThe sanctuary has become a significant tourist attraction in Wellington and is responsible for the greatly increased number of sightings of species such as tui and k\u0101k\u0101 in city's suburbs.\nSometimes described as the world's first mainland island sanctuary in an urban environment, the sanctuary has inspired many similar projects throughout New Zealand, with predator-proof fences now protecting the biodiversity of many other areas of forest. Examples include the 7.7 hectare lowland podocarp forest remnant of Riccarton bush/ Putaringamotu, the 98 hectare Bushy Park and, the 3500 hectare Maungatautari Restoration Project enclosing an entire mountain.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHistorically about 60% of the Wellington region was covered with broadleaf forest.  Karaka, kohekohe, ngaio and nikau trees were common but there were also rata, rewarewa and tawa with occasional podocarps like kahikatea and rimu.  The whole sanctuary valley was covered with this sort of forest until European settlement of the area and the large fires in 1850 and 1860 that cleared the land to be used for farming.  The lower reservoir, retained by an earth dam, was completed in 1878.  Parts of the area continued to be farmed up until 1906 when the remaining catchment was purchased for the water works.  The upper reservoir, retained by a concrete gravity arch dam, was completed in 1908.  From this point, as the whole valley was a protected water catchment area for Wellington city, the slopes were re-vegetated with introduced trees and the native forest also began regenerating.  The upper dam was decommissioned as a reservoir about 1991, the lower one in 1997.Jim Lynch promoted the idea of a wildlife sanctuary. The \"Natural Wellington\" project identified the reservoir catchment as having special significance because it is a large self-contained habitat suitable for a  wide variety of native plants and animals. In 1993 a feasibility study was carried out by the Wellington regional and city councils and after public consultation in 1994, the idea of a sanctuary was given the go-ahead.  The Karori Wildlife Sanctuary Trust was formed in mid-1995 to implement the proposed 'mainland island' wildlife sanctuary.\n\n\n== Pest-exclusion fence ==\n\nThe most crucial aspect of the sanctuary is a pest-exclusion fence, designed to exclude fourteen species of non-native land mammals ranging from deer to mice, which encircles the 8.6 km perimeter of the Sanctuary. Construction of the fence was completed in late 1999 and all mammalian pests within the perimeter were then eradicated over a nine-month period. This predator-proof fence is of great conservation significance, being a world first.\n\n\n=== Species to be excluded by the fence ===\n\nThe fence design was arrived at after trials with the various species to be excluded.  Its main features are a small mesh size (to exclude animals down to the size of a mouse), a curved top-cap (to prevent animals climbing over) and an underground foot (to prevent animals burrowing underneath).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nIn terms of its meeting conservation goals, the sanctuary has met with considerable success due to the design of the perimeter fence.  The fence and ongoing monitoring have successfully kept the sanctuary free of all but the smallest species \u2013 the house mouse. It is thought that small defects in the fence mesh (damaged during construction) allowed mice to re-enter the sanctuary.  Modifications to the fence have been considered in an attempt to permanently exclude mice, but meanwhile, mouse numbers are monitored and controlled.  There have been occasional breaches of the fence by weasels and rats, these occasional incursions are not unexpected (for example resulting from storm damage bringing trees down upon the fence), and are picked up by on-going monitoring with tracking tunnels.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\n\nThe flora and fauna in the sanctuary are recovering from its pre-managed degraded state. Although the original primary forest has been regenerating since 1906, it is still only in the early stages of succession with small hardy trees such as mahoe dominating.

          "Nice place to go walking and see/listen to native wildlife. Different pathways with different walking difficulties and distances, so you can go for a nice and easy hike or a more challenging journey. Best to go with family and friends, and it may be worth bringing a camera in case you find native birds flying around you.",
          "One of my best memories and activity in Wellington. Photos do not do this place justice ! I attended the dawn tour with the family and found the tour informative. We took a relaxing walk in the sanctuary and because it\u2019s a tour after hour, \u2026",
          "It is beautiful. Perfectly laid out with all the different paths one can take. When I saw there was a oath to a goldmine I was happy until I saw it was closed off for being unsafe. I didn't see too many birds but as a guide mentioned that during spring and summer they are out more often as it's cold now. I had a great time.",
          "Really great experience, there's heaps of walking trails to explore and most of them are accessible. They have feeders out for the birds and you can often see quite a few. Well worth a trip. There are scheduled tours, an indoor exhibit, cafe and a gift shop. They have accessible toilets and parents room as well.",
          "Well worth the visit, though free entry days are far too busy and some people are terribly noisy. Pay the premium and enjoy the visit. Take good comfy walking/hiking shoes! (And snacks & water.) Expect at least 2 or 3 hours for the easy walk.",
          "Wonderful walk in the wildlife sanctuary.  Get there early if you want a close carpark or go later when early birds have left. There is a free shuttle.  Lovely cafe too.",
          "Take a tour guide 30$ until 19 july so pretty good deal. Merle was really nice and you can see she loved was she is doing. Explaining the project to save the birds . Real nice \nOr if you like to just walk and check for some Kaka or other local birds.",
          "I and my husband visited zealandia in November 2019 we always remember haw was beautiful this place, really amazing.\nWe had a guide, Roy, and we want to say him thank you for his kindness helping us to discover a lot of nature in this wonderful country.\nWe never forget, always in our hearts.",

          "Beautiful place. So many walks that you can fell alone in the forest. Many birds singing in the early morning as well.",
          "Think Jurassic Park but for birds instead of man eaters. Beware they will search your bags and purses in case you're trying to sneak in New Zealand's most deadly predator... the common cat. Honestly worth the membership even if you go once. The beauty of nature preserved aside from good food and good sex what more could you want.",
          "Awesome place to visit. Would not recommend if you're in a rush. You really need to take your time to get the full experience. Staff was so friendly and the birds are beautiful. You can tell a lot of care and effort goes into this place.",
          "Pretty good. Has a shop. Has a cafe. Has elevators. And has a great sanctuary in general.",

          "Wonderful facilities and a great time had by all. Saw a hihi and saddleback for the first time and caught a tuatara sunning himself. Guided tour was excellent, guide was knowledgeable and despite the cold weather found us a host of birds. We'll be back again when it's warmer to see what is different!",
          "Absolutely an amazing experience:) loved it! Beautiful! So in awe of this beautiful sanctuary! Will certainly be back!\nGo have Brekkie on arrival! Awesome food and magnificent coffee",

          "We have been here during a rainy day but it was still an awesome experience! We booked the 2-hour tour and learned a lot about Zealandia - from how and when it was built, how the birds are protected and which birds to have a look for. I would absolutely recommend taking a guided tour, else you might miss a lot.",
          "Amazing achievement, especially in a capital city. So much interesting information and the guide was knowledgeable and made the tour fun. It's also free till July 19th 2020.",
          "What a truly beautiful hideaway for a family outing. The tuatara were my granddaughter's favourite. I loved the little signs pointing out exactly where the creatures & birds were hiding. Also it was brilliant having the rangers standing at specific spots to point out certain birds. An amazing memory.",
          "Very natural / tranquil /  beautiful reserve  \na MUST visit place in Welly. \nalmost no where else like this in NZ.  you can meet heaps of different type of birds in the bush. some of them even fly to you or sing their song near by you.  \nIt will be one of the last world without any contamination",
          "It\u2019s definitely worth a visit, but you do need at least 2-3 hours at a minimum to do it any kind of justice. We had a guided two-hour tour, which cost $55 per person, although it would have been just $21 without the tour (the tickets of \u2026",

          "Amazing walks. I cant get over how tame the birds are it's nice for kids and adults alike.",
          "Great place to check out native birds. Kids (and adults)  loved seeing the Kaka operate the feeding station",
          "A precious institution. It's amazing what they've done with this space. The tracks are well-maintained and nature abound - very much a birdwatcher's paradise! The canopy echoes with the constant cries of k\u0101k\u0101 and many threatened species can be readily sighted.",
          "Really great! You can get close to loads of native birds! Even the endangered and for a while thought extinct takahe! Totally recommend! Great walks!",
          "Awesome little garden of Eden in the city. Only issue is there is not enough time to walk the entire area in one day. Went back multiple times. Fell in love with this place.",
          "Very nice place. Perfect to walk and see the nature. Quiet and nice.",
          "We loved it. Would recommend to take the side tracks instead of the main ones to get a higher chance of spotting birds.",
          "First time we have been and really enjoyed it. Paths bit wet and muddy in some places owing to the recent days of rain but not too much to hinder progress.",
          "Beautiful half day or full day out! You choose.  Lovely staff and cafe too.",
          "Well worth going. Nice relaxing walk, 5 min movie at start was amazing and worth it for all ages. Inside display is really good.\nDifferent walking tracks well sign posted and rated by difficulty and time.\nNice view from the cable bridge at \u2026",
          "If in Wellington NZ, this is definitely a recommended place to visit. It is a peaceful oasis of native flora and fauna just outside of the city centre (Karori). I spent a couple of hours there, but you could spend a day exploring all the walkways etc.",
          "Awesome place to get to know Aotearoa a little more intimately. Great place to learn what plants are good for the birds and to see plenty of native birds too, all in a natural environment with no cages. Take the tour like we did or explore \u2026",
          "Beautiful park in the middle of Wellington.\nEasy walks and helpful guides. Really pleasant experience.",

          "A Wellington institution and well worth visiting just to contribute to ensure its ongoing success. Cafe has a nice view of the reservoir and there are a range of walks for all mobilities. Guaranteed to see native birds on even the paved 15 min walk to the end of the reservoir.",
          "Am absolute treasure. If I lived in Wellington I'd definitely have a membership.\nTheir staff was the friendliest I've encountered in all of New Zealand, even when we'd overstayed. (They'd closed, but we had no idea the hours and they \u2026",

          "Lovely  walk but bit muddy. Dont wear white shoes. Great informative mini talks by Zealandia staff",
          "Fantastic place and a great effort to convert the present area back in time to Zealandia. Take a guided tour or take a lunch and walk the many paths for several hours. Lots of signage and the introductory film is excellent. Just stop and listen to the bird calls. Unless you go at night don't expect to see a kiwi.",

          "Lovely walk along shaded paths, lots of bird life and bird song.",

          "We saw many Tuatara, Takah\u0113 and multiple types of parrots. We happened to catch one of the tours as well, and the tour guide was enthusiastic and knowledgeable. It was one of the highlights of our trip and is absolutely worth visiting!",

Not impressed with the cafe, granted it was late afternoon,but the young girl watched me looking at cakes  and as I went to place an order she said the cafe was closed.

          "Big sanctuary, with lots of hiking routes to choose from for a medium (2-4 hours) hike. The hiking paths are in a good condition, so you don't need to have hiking boots on a sunny day, but on a rainy day it is definitely advise able. \nThe \u2026",

          "Gentle hikes, so many saddlebacks (my favourite) and tui singing. When you buy a ticket, it is valid for 2 consecutive days so those visiting don't have to rush to see everything.

          "Love this place and really want to go back for a night tour. The day tour was informative but not a must. You can spot most of the birds just by following the map. I spend 5 hours here doing one of the longer tracks. Definately worth it!",
          "Great night guided tour with rare kiwi(2 sightings of same +1 other sighting) and takahe sightings. Guides are very friendly and helpful. However just 2 advices for guides. Firstly, not to particularly blame one neighbouring country for \u2026",

          "I\u2019d put this on #1 thing to do in Wellington. So many birds and tropical sounds in the forest. Pure tranquility taking in what Zealandia is restoring for species and their habitat in Wellington.",
          "A nature reserve on steroids; though not really anything radically different. I suppose a large part of the entry fee stems from the fact that this is so close to the capital city, yet so well preserved.\n\nThere's plenty of wildlife, \u2026",
          "So many cool animals and really interesting tours with knowledgeable guides",
          "Amazing experience. We did a night walk with Troy as our guide, he was full of knowledge and answered all our questions. Even though we were unlucky and didn't see a kiwi, I would still recommend this to everyone. Must do in Wellington and congrats to everyone working so hard to protect the native species!",

          "There are many things to do and different kind of wild birds.",
          "A fantastic place to get in amongst nature. We saw so many birds and they came right up to you without fear. We also saw rather large Tuataras so we know they are also taken care of well. \nDefinitely go far in to at least the upper dam. \u2026",
          "We saw 5 Tuataras loose in the bush behind their fence, Black Robins, Saddlebacks neither of which we ever saw before, plus plenty tuis and kakas at feeding stations in the bush. An exciting visit.",
          "Amazing must-see on the edge of the city. Plenty to see on a guided or self guided tour and an absolute tonic, even in mid-winter. There is an introductory video that runs in the main exhibition space on the hour and half hour - very good for kids too.",

          "Just lovely to be able to wander through bushland and see native flora & fauna living free from predators.",
          "This is a great place for bird watching with some feeding stations that will attract wild birds. There was also a tua Tara in the park. This the price is worth it as you're paying for the fencing to keep the dangerous mammals out from their local birds and tua Tara.",
          "What a great place, it makes me want to invest in preditor free fencing.",
          "Beautiful piece of bush to take the whole family to. Lots of different tracks for ppl with different amounts of time on their hands and different fitness levels . Tracks are well maintained . Beautiful listening to all the bird calls and very educational too",

          "We spent 1.5 hrs at Zealandia which was a good amount of time to walk to the upper dam and come back down over the swing bridge and through the wetlands. We saw kaka, tui, Saddleback, bellbird, hihi and tuatara which was pretty amazing in \u2026",
          "This place is spectacular. Hard to believe you're so close to the city. Loads of paths and an abundance of bird life that you can get right up close to, but not enclosed like in a zoo. It's absolutely a must visit if you're in Wellington.",

Unfortunately we did not see a kiwi, we only heard a lot of them. \nThe chance is 80%, so we were very unlucky this time.\n\nI would totally recommend the tour, cause you see a lot of other animals, gloworms, insects and at the bridge you have a great view on the stars.",
          "Excellent place to visit, for all ages.",

          "Highly recommended and a must do when in Wellington city! \nIts a beautiful peek to the past. \nIf you are already aware of New Zealand's wildlife, then I'd recommended exploring the place on your own, with your own time and pace, instead of opting for a guide. \nFree shuttle service to and from the city is an add on=)",

          "Great day out if you love walking. Lots of interaction for kids. The ticket gets you in for two days which is great as you'd never get round it all in a day. Also a fantastic project and well worth a visit. On site cafe does great food too!",

          "We had a lovely time here walking the park tracks. As it is a pest / rodent free enviroment the indigenous New Zealand birds thrive here. We have seen some of them, our favourite was the North Island Robin that came very close to us and stayed for a while. It was magical. We",
          "Fantastic day out when in Wellington beautiful scenery,great walks with well sign posted routes-rated by difficulty and time. You get the chance to see a kiwi on a night walk , as well as many other native birds. Zealandia is great for all ages well worth a day out there .",
          "Its quite an experience going on a twilight walk in a quiet environment such as this looking for a rare bird and seeing other local wildlife at this time. We had a very experienced local kiwi guide (ex Suffolk albeit a long time ago) who gave us a good introduction to what",
          "The sanctuary offers a pest/rodent free escape for the New Zealand indigenous birds. You will have ample opportunity to view and photograph the birds, which in most other reserves are more difficult to spot.",
          "A great experience to see native fauna and flora. The birdlife is amazing and a great number of photographic opportunities. This is a great day out for all ages and I would highly recommend.",
          "We took a 2 hour guided tour, which in our opinion is the best way to go. You watch a movie prior to the tour which sets the tone for a wonderful experience. By doing the tour your guide will be able to locate more species of birds than you couldon your own (unless you are",
          "Great to see that it wa san excellently run Nature Reaseve. We got expert Guide for the Evening Walk which was very good. 1st time seeing a Kiwi in the wild. Love to learn how the nature was destroy during 800 years of Human settlement and now slowly being restored.",
          "On arrival we were warmly welcomed and split into small groups to enter the reserve. Throughout the tour we were given loads of information, had wildlife and plants pointed out, encouraged to ask questions and generally well looked after. The tour was easy paced and apart from",
          "We had wanted to do the night tour but it was full, so settled for the twilight tour. In the end, so happy we did this because we like birds, the this tour gave us the opportunity to see so many birds (although not the Kiwi, which only comes out when it's dark). Our guides",
          "The scenery once you enter the area is stunning!! You would love to capture the view there at once! The green landscape is breathtaking! We were lucky to see 2 takake on our visit! They are cute! I suggest you to take the boat trip. We took that for 2 days. The 2nd skipper",
          "Pleasant walks. Great views of rare wildlife. Make sure you take the time to view the displays inside.",
          "We loved the peace and quiet here (except for the noisy birds which were a joy to watch). The trails are well marked. There\u2019s an excellent shop selling some lovely cards and gifts, most of which are made in New Zealand. This is a place worth visiting. It is very educational",
          "We took the walk on our own. Had lunch in cafe which was good and priced ok. It\u2019s a lovely walk with interesting information and history. I\u2019m not used to paying for a walk, but it\u2019s not too expensive, feels good helping a useful project and the free shuttle is the icing on the",
          "Pleasant and knowledgeable guide. Quite enjoyed the twilight tour although we didn\u2019t really get to see much more than what we saw when we visited Zealandia earlier in the afternoon. Price tag is a little on the high side but I suppose it\u2019s a cause worth supporting. Worth a visit",
          "Extraordinary and one of a kind. Highly recommend the guided tour or you\u2019ll miss many of the animals/birds/ plants",
          "We just finished a wonderful tour of the sanctuary - Robin was an amazing guide and very knowledgeable! I could have followed and listened him talk about everything we saw for an entire day. The sanctuary is beautiful and the preservation work they are doing is fascinating and",
          "What an amazing place! Beautiful views, various paths for different physical abilities, interesting and lovely birds. Loved the gift shop, too!",
          "A brilliant ecological sanctuary for the birds and some other animals. Very well maintained paths and boardwalks with excellent signage. You really need binoculars or zoom cameras to see anything as not many birds and animals are close to the paths. It\u2019s a haven for bird",
          "My husband and I went to the night tour and really enjoyed it. The tour guide was excellent very knowledgable and made the tour relaxed and friendly. We enjoyed seeing some rare ducks and an eel but the highlight was seeing a kiwi it was amazing. I would highly recommend a visit",
          "We had an awesome time walking through the sanctuary. We saw many type of birds and plants / trees. It was a relaxing walk and a great way to spend a cool morning. Would highly recommend!",
          "Great place to see these little lizards even in th day time. Huge variety of birds as well which can be see up close.",
          "We didn't know about this until we'd arrived in Wellie as part of our North Island trip. So easy to get to from downtown and felt transported to another world upon arrival. There is so much to see with a choice of trails and even a little boat trip back to base. We loved it so",
          "What an amazing get-away from the city but so close and convenient! We had an enthusiastic and knowledgeable tour guide (Gabriel) who taught us so much about the sanctuary and the birds. We loved this tour so much that we brought another couple there the next day! It was",
          "The pride New Zealanders take in their country, its origins and its nature are epitomized in this sanctuary.",
          "Lots of people skip Zealandia because of the price. I think this is a mistake. The bird life in Zealandia is extraordinary. Native NZ birds I have only ever seen in Zealandia due to the unique environment of a wall to keep out predators in the inner city. Thats its so close to",
          "Amazing that this place is so close to the city but makes you feel like your in remote traditional forest Full of noisy native wildlife who were keen not to be seen.. Well worth a visit",
          "This is a lovely rather leisurely walk around the sanctuary which is a gem. Our guide was very knowledgable and interesting and very dedicated to preserving the unique wildlife which has been threatened by predators introduced to NZ. I really wanted to see a kiwi. Using",
          "We were thrilled with our time spent at the reserve. To maximize time and get the best bird sightings we booked in advance the morning 10:00 tour with one of there excellent guides. We lucked out with Jim, an enthusiastic naturalists trained in a related field. It was like he",
          "The sanctuary is truly a delightful place to visit! There are birds everywhere and the place is so well looked after. Well worth a visit!",
          "You can see plants and animals that only live in NZ. It\u2019s huge and it takes around 3 hours to do half of it (the green and orange trail they recommend you to do). There is an interactive museum at the beginning where they explain everything. The entry costs 20$.",
          "This exceeded all our expectations. We saw so many different kinds of birds, and so close. But perhaps the most unusual part was the tuataras - so many, totally unconcerned about us being there.",
          "Although near the centre of Wellington this is an oasis of calm and beauty. Lovely spot for a leisurely walk and bird watching. Walks ranhe from easy to some being a bit steep. Staff are wonderful and extremely friendly and informative. Guided walks also avaiable.",
          "It was breath taking walking through the varied forest landscape high above Wellington. It is such a great conservation reserve looking after so many birds and so much effort is being made to keep all un-natural predators at bay. My only concern is that considering so much",
          "We would love to have had more time, but we only had 80 minutes. However, we did see lots of birds, and it was a wonderful place to hear birds, and see them up close.",
          "I have never encountered a nature area quite like this. I arrived taking the Funicular rail from downtown Wellington and then the free shuttle at the top to Zealandia. It sounds weird but is actually very easy and an adventure in itself. The compound is completely sealed and the",
          "I had missed the opportunity to visit Zealandia on previous visits to Wellington thanks to busy schedules of meetings, but having half a day to myself between meetings on my latest flying visit to the city, I decided the time had come to go. And I\u2019m glad that I did! I took the",
          "A great morning spent here, hiking and working up a sweat. You have so many choices on the activity level - from easy to more strenuous hiking. I recommend this place to visit and enjoy spending time in nature when in Wellington.",
          "What an outstanding way to observe indigenous and other wildlife close up! Our guide, Juliet, provided a very informed commentary on the various birds, insects, fish and other aspects of life at Zealandia. This Reserve is phenomenal. Towards the end of our tour, we were very",
          "An absolute must-visit when you are in Wellington. Not very expensive: there is a free (electric!) shuttle service to Zealandia from the city centre and your entry ticket is valid for 2 consecutive days. The centre at the beginning of the ecosanctuary provides a lot of",
          "We enjoyed a casual walk through the preserve; guided by an enthusiastic young lady who was very aware of our surroundings. She pointed out things we would have missed, had we journeyed on our own. The cafe was great for a tasty bite afterward.",
          "We were so pleased that we chose to visit this sanctuary. Fantastic value for money with so much wildlife and stunning scenery all around you. Allow plenty of time to give justice to this place. Close to the city with a free (!) shuttle service. Great value for money. An",
          "What can we say, except \u201cWow!\u201d Our guide, Gabriel, and spotter Lyn did us proud! We were each equipped with a red torch and an ear piece so Gabriel could talk to us without raising his voice. Starting off at dusk, we admired Kaka, fantails and shag by daylight before being",
          "This is a place at the core of the conservation movement in NZ. Best place around the capital to see NZ native fauna. I highly recommend the guided night tour",
          "You have opportunities to spot birds in their natural habitats, which means fleeting glimpses at a distance. To see the birds clearly, you need to see them close-up in confinement. Our guide referred to species in Latin, English, and Maori and I had trouble keeping up with his",
          "This nature heritage facility was designed and constructed to preserve and display the many unique animal, bird and plant species that are native to New Zealand. It has a nice mix of accessible and more challenging trails that lead one to see the many animals, birds and plants.",
          "I\u2019m very glad I did the 2 hour tour otherwise I would have not known what I was seeing most of the time. Regardless the scenery is beautiful and there are so many birds you can\u2019t help but to encounter several species.",
          "What a place! Zealandia is well worth a visit if you have the time while in Wellington. We were lucky enough to see Takahe, and the Tuatara were out in force. I would definitely recommend giving yourself as much time as possible to experience all that Zealandia has to offer.",
          "Great visit - but will try a night time visit next time to see all the birds and animals we missed calling in during the day.",
          "We did the night tour which was so special. Before the night tour starts you are allowed to walk around, and as we were walking around before the tour had actually started, a staff member let me top up the kiwi feeders! The night tour itself I would highly recommend. Our guide",
          "The guided tours may seem expensive, and the day tour may not be valuable to all if you can recognise a few calls or follow the guide pamphlet. That said, the evening and night tours are absolutely worth the money. Add to the fact you will most likely see the illusive kiwi you",
          "An amazing sanctuary so close to Wellington! The free shuttle bus to and from made the whole experience so easy! We would highly recommend doing the 2 hour guided tour, our guide was so knowledgeable and we saw ALL of the native bird species found in the park thanks to her",
          "We took the Zealandia bus from the iSite office. There is a great deal of work going on in Wellington at the moment and iSite office has moved, even the city guides directed us to the wrong place but we found it eventually and took the shuttle bus. It was well worth the effort",
          "We rode the free shuttle to this attraction from the top of the cable car. It costs $21NZ to enter for adults, and they do a cursory check of any bag that you bring in to try and prevent the introduction of any predators (mice, etc) to the sanctuary. Your ticket is good for two",
          "Well worth a visit. Surrounded by acres of native bush and fun spotting native birds, reptiles and plants. Fresh air and truly uplifting experience",
          "Great place to see birds and witness a real conservation triumph. Take a guided tour if you can. The guides are very informative and really help understand what you are seeing. Walking is on good trails and the surroundings are beautiful! A must do if you like the outdoors",
          "We last came here a couple of years ago and this time took a day time tour which greatly enhanced our experience. Our guide was excellent pointing out things we would have missed. The tour lasted longer than planned which made it even better value. We also had a nice meal in the",
          "We took the guided tour which I would recommend very strongly, The guides have so much local detail and understanding of the ecological relationships between birds and and their environment. Great range of birds seen and an some super photo opportunities",
          "We booked the night tour to give us the possibility of seeing the native kiwi bird. Our booking for the night tour gave us an extra entrance to the reserve the morning before or the day after our tour. Which for us was brilliant, it allowed us to make the most of the reserve and",
          "What a fantastic time we had! If this is your one and only opportunity to visit this place, don\u2019t even hesitate about paying extra for the guided tour because it is absolutely worth it. If we hadn\u2019t done the tour, we would have seen some birds for sure, but we would have missed",
          "This is not a must see place in Wellington but worth the visit if you have the time. You'll see lots of different birds close up and the star attraction in my opinion the tuatara which is a lizard like creature with ancient beginnings.",
          "This was an excellent tour that we managed to get on at the last minute. Zealandia is amazing the way it has created a protected natural environment to enable various species of birds and other wildlife to avoid extinction and increase their numbers. Our tour was lead by Summer",
          "This is a very impressive and interesting area to visit. Not being an expert in birds or the history of New Zealand it was especially helpful to pay for the small group tour at the entrance. I highly recommend the tour!",
          "My wife and I visited this wonderful place upon the recommendation of some friends who live in New Zealand, it is a great concept that should be repeated around the world, we walked along the path listening to beautiful bird song in their natural environment.",
          "Thank you so much Katy and Belynda! You\u2019ve made the tour unique! We were so lucky tonight and so not only one kiwi but 5!!!! We also had the rare chance of seeing to little ruru chicks, which was on my personal bucket list! But this trip didn\u2019t end here - we saw the K\u0101ruhiruhi",
          "I was impressed from the moment I got in the free shuttle bus how much people care about this place and how many volunteers support it. The site is lovely and we enjoyed walking round. We didn\u2019t see as many birds as we might have if we\u2019d joined a tour, but I thoroughly enjoyed",
          "We booked a two hour tour, not realising that it entitles you to a free entry the next day. Our guide was Robin and he was very good with just the right amount of humour. The two hours flew by, and so did many exotic birds which Robin pointed out to us. The park itself is a",
          "Every time we go to Wellington - we go to Zealandia. I see some unfortunate review talking to the fact that exotic pests have to be eliminated. There would be no Zealandia, if they didn\u2019t do this, we\u2019d have to put the animals in cages and call it a zoo and hope there was a",
          "Beautiful bush walks, lots of wildlife. Would have loved to listen to more of the talks. So close to city centre yet a paradise untouched.",
          "Well not exactly. Zoolandia had no stuffed animals come to life after sunset, but I loved the satisfaction of seeing brightly colored and chirpy birds in their natural habitat. I am of the mindset that walking through a forrest is much more satisfying that doing a treadmill so",
          "I wish I lived in Wellington so I could go every day! The best place to see wildlife in New Zealand. Bring your camera and gear for walking/hiking. Trails for all levels of experience. I highly recommend taking a tour or two and then returning to explore on your own.",
          "Fabulous nature reserve - so close to city centre. The unusual birdsong as we walked through lovely bush/forest paths was fantastic. We saw many unusual NZ-only species.",
          "We live locally in Wellington and can't believe we didn't do this tour sooner. The valley transforms so much through the dusk and into night, it was amazing. Our guide was friendly and knowledgeable. It's hard to guarantee seeing any wildlife because it's a sanctuary, not a zoo.",
          "We did the night walk in late December and and had an enjoyable and educational evening. The guides were friendly and well informed and were able to leave is with a sense of wonder at the special New Zealand environment. Highly recommended",
          "It's amazing to visit such beautiful natural habitat in the city centre. Without joined any tour, we were able to see many birds.",
          "My husband and I went by Zealandia not knowing much about what to expect. We decided to take a guided tour which we did not regret. We felt we got so much out of experiencing Zealandia with a knowledgeable guide who was able to point out and teach about the bird and plant life",
          "Zealandia is a beautiful sanctuary in the middle of busy Wellington. Only minutes from the city centre, it is like being in a forest a hundred kilometres from civilisation. A lot of work has been put into restoring and preserving natural habitat and it is a haven for birdlife in",
          "We enjoyed seeing how Zeelandia are trying to create a piece of NZ as it was before people came from other lands with different species of plant and animals came",
          "Overall I wasn't super impressed with this. Not having car, I spent money on ubers both ways, and did a quick walk through. Saw a few of the bird species as well as the reptile, but overall felt like I wasn't really impressed..more for bird aficionados, not someone trying to",
          "This place sounds like Rivendell from LOTR. I could've spent all day just listening to the beautiful birds that live in this awesome habitat. My husband and I just did general admission tickets. It was odd because we were told to walk out and stay on the trails. Well we went out",
          "We almost did not go to ZEALANDIA but what a mistake that would have been. We made the decision to get their early and that was the right thing to do - you have the place to yourself and less noise to scare away any of the wildlife. It is like no other sanctuary I have been to",
          "If you are wondering about the cost, don't! Your tour also includes a day visit the same day or the day after. What magnificent value for money. The tour was superbly run and we saw loads of interesting animals. There is a real commitment to making sure everyone sees whatever",
          "Great experience to visit this sanctuary. All the vulnerable balance between natural life and modern living is obvious. It should be mandatory for all motorists, travelers and tourists to visit.",
          "Our friends bought us tickets to the twilight tour for Christmas and I can thoroughly recommend it. We saw tui, kereru, a takahe, tuatara and a couple of kiwi! Really like the idea behind the sanctuary and the long term vision of the project. They are slowly replacing the trees",
          "Zealandia is well worth a visit. Even without a tour guide, there is plenty of information to enable the visitor to find various birds and fascinating plant life. We even saw the tuatara - a rare and endangered relative of the giant animals which used to live in Aotearoa. The",

          "We went to Zealandia on the opening day 19 years ago and didn't see much. We returned and was well impressed. Fantastic video about the history of NZ and how pests were introduced, then off for a wonderful walk. There are options for steep walks or gentle walks accomodating for",
          "We visited Zealandia as part of an organised cruise excursion and it was an inspired choice. Basically it is Jurassic Park in reality. A designated area on the outskirts of Wellington has been enclosed in electric fencing having been cleared of predators that are not indigenous",
          "Zealandia is a must see on anyone\u2019s trip to Wellington. Robin gave us a fantastic two hour guided tour of the area where we learned much about the conservation and restoration happening in the area. We were delighted to see many of the birds that Zealandia is protecting, and",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our night tour at Zealandia. It was fascinating to understand the history of New Zealand's landscape and wildlife and to explore the sanctuary, seeing the glow worms, lizards, eels and so much more. The absolute highlight was seeing a female kiwi, who came",
          "The 2.5-hour night tour of Zealandia is truly awesome. Unique fauna we saw included p\u0101pango, tuatara, takehe, titiwai (glow worms), Maud Island frog, and weta. We had a real treat when we saw two tuna (eels) biting and fighting each other, and later heard the magical sound of a",
          "We got to Zealandia by going up the cable car and then catching the free shuttle bus. I think you could easily do a self-guided tour and get a lot out of it, but we went with a guided tour. Our guide, Kevin, was great. We learnt about NZ before the coming of the Maori and then",
          "We had been to Zealandia on a previous visit to Wellington and loved it, and knew the tickets give you entry for two consecutive days, so we went for a short visit the first day to enjoy the inside exhibits. Next day we returned for a longer time and were delighted to see two",
          "Zealandia is trying to preserve nature and doing a great job of it. They also have a great gift shop. It is a pleasurable place to visit and experience nature in it's fullest.",
          "Zealandia is a must-visit. Just a short bus/taxi ride from downtown Wellington, it offers a haven from the bustle of the city. It is a unique place that allows one to walk through indigenous flora and fauna and watch birdlike at close quarters. It was particularly good to see",
          "We were booked into a night walk in the middle of Zealandia reserve, starting at 20:30. Two volunteers took us in charge. Louise was the one helping spot areas of interest ahead of the group. And Troy, oh Troy! He made our evening. His knowledge, passion and commitment to the",
          "Zealandia was an amazing place to visit. It was an inspirational place.The exhibition was educational. It was great to see the fore thought that has been put into the sanctuary as they are looking into the future 100 of years ahead. The displays were informative. I would",
          "We spent 3 hours at the Zealandia during the day. We would definitely recommend the experience. You are in nature with birds and lizards. Beautiful scenery.",
          "It's great that wildlife and the land in general are being conserved. However I was extremely disappointed to find out that animals like hedgehogs, mice and ferrets are killed here in order to keep up the bird population. Yes native birds are important but this form of 'pest'",
          "Beautiful site up on the hill from Wellington. Got to see kiwi birds in the dark house. Saw a lot of other birds as well. Good nature guides.",
          "This is one of the beautiful sanctuary we have a been two. It was breathtaking beautiful we saw so many different kinds of birds and we even saw in tuatara. We were there at least for two hours easy to walk through the beautiful forest when we come back to Wellington we would",
          "We went on a night excursion. It was exciting to see all the birds, insects, and wetas. We got tee which tasted very good at the end. Unfortunately we did not see a kiwi bird but the Chance is big if you take night tour. Warmly recommend to visit this place and Manuela our",
          "We did the night tour and it was from 08:30 pm-23:00 pm. The tour guide was really helpful and gave us loads of facts. We even saw 2 kiwis! At the start, they showed us a little video about the destruction humans have done to the wildlife and what we can do to help it. Everyone",
          "We enjoyed our tour of Zealandia. Booked a two hour guided tour as we wouldn't be able to identify many of the birds ourselves. Our guide was good at pointing out birds and plants to us and it's a fairly easy walk even if you dont consider yourself to be too fit. We saw lots of",
          "It was pouring rain the whole two hour walk. The desk provided me with a great raincoat and Joanne with a handicap scooter as her trick knee was acting up. Our guide was from Portugal and was one of the founding members. She really knew her stuff and did not let the rain faze",

          "Easy accessibility, so close to city, provides an excellent overview of native birds, tuataras and native bush in a compact easily walkable reserve. Much better than I expected - birds are so close!",
          "Beautiful place, great native birds, a clear focus on conservation. We had a lovely visit. And the cafe was good, too!",
          "Amazing to learn about the NZ wildlife and measures being taken to preserve it. We loved this place. Would have loved to do the night tour to see a kiwi but unfortunately didn't get time",

          "Pricey for residents ( whose taxes support this excellent venue) but really recommended for visitors. Rare birds, great educational media and a good experience makes Zealandia a highlight for any Wellington visit.",
          "We did the night tour of Zelandia and had a great tour. The guide was very enthusiastic and did a great job telling us all about the sanctuary and the creatures we encountered. The tour start with a short but sad movie about the demise of many of the indigenous animals that",

          "We chose to do the 2 hour Zealandia by day tour with a guide. So much better than just wandering on your own. Our guide Summer knew where to find the wildlife and tell us all about them. This is an eco-sanctuary built with high fences to keep the predators/rodents out. You have",
          "We came in as general admission, was there for 2 hours plus til closing and still did not finish the park. Saw a lot of birds, a guide may not be necessary unless you would like to learn a bit more on the birds. this is recommended for those who are patient with spotting birds,",
          "Just a 2km walk from the top of the cable car (clearly sign posted) or a quick ride in the free shuttle that departs every 30 min\u2019s (more frequently in the middle of the day) Zealandia is a beautiful piece of nature. The predator free fence is doing its work and many of the bird",
          "If you are going here, get here early and have good walking shoes. If you are adventurous and want to walk some of the more difficult trails I would recommend walking sticks. These trails are narrow with a lot of loose gravel. The views are spectacular but a hike to get to.",

          "I more quiet and laid back experience, as this is not a zoo type experience. The staff were helpful and polite, and we used the free shuttle bus from the cable car.",
          "Had reasonably high expectations given the $21 entrance fee. The walks around Zealandia are certainly very pleasant, but no better than many free walks around NZ, including in the Wellington region. We saw a single tuatara, which was pretty neat, but nothing else that you would",
          "We did the night walk through the valley. This is a must do. Hearing the day birds settle in for the night and the night sounds start up is truly magical. The glow worms just add to the fantasy feeling. Easy walking, even in the dark. Highly recommended experience",
          "although there was a cheaper self-tour option, we opted for the 2-hour small-group tour. we were not disappointed. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and added to the serene setting. there were a lot of highlights - feeding the kikiraris, being serenaded by the Tuis and",

          "We went to a walk together with a very nice lady who was very informative and she spoke very clear, with a broad knowledge. The walk would be 2h, but it was more like 2,20,he asked us if it was okey, of course",
          "This nature sanctuary contains native birds and plants etc so is a great place to visit. You need a full day as this is a large area. Binoculars and a good camera are essential.",
          "This is such an amazing experience and I would highly recommend the night tour. Our guide was really great and we saw so much - Tuatara, Glowworms, eel, loads of different birds and of course kiwis. We were lucky to see three kiwis. You spend the whole trip in wonder at our",
          "We arrived to wellington on a cruise ship - our third time to the city. On previous trips we rode the cable car, enjoyed the botanic gardens, explored the foreshore area and shopped in the city. We were looking for a completely different experience and found it at Zealandia. We",

          "Zealandia Sanctuary is a wonderful walkabout - many trails, paved or dirt to follow and see/hear the birds. That said, highly recommend booking the small group night tour (12 max) well in advance. Wonderful experience to see nocturnal Kiwi foraging at night, the incredible",

          "It was great to visit Zealandia again but from a different perspective (on a Zealandia by Night Tour). They run small group tours and our group had around 8 people. We saw a range of different birds and right near the end of the tour were lucky enough to see a Kiwi. Loved the",
          "Fantastic tour after hours to see native/endemic birds of New Zealand. The enthusiasm of our guide made for a wonderful walk. And we were most fortunate that he spotted a juvenile kiwi in the forest undergrowth. Highly recommend this tour to Zealandia!",

          "I loveeeeee my zealandia experience so much! Learned about my 2nd home new zealand a alot during the tour. Also, our tour guide manuela was very informative and awesome. In addition, the lady driver that picked us up in isite area was so lovely to give a little get to know",
          "Nice place to see birds in their natural habitat. Most of the tracks are nicely covered by trees, so you need a pair of binoculars to see the birds. Many locations during this walk will remind you of scenes from Jurassic Park. There is a boat ride from right side of the main",

          "We went here not knowing what to expect. We received an amazing 2hour guided tour with the delightful Paula. Paula's knowledge and passion certainly helped make our experience one we won't forget. We were also very lucky to see some of the very rare birds that have made home",

          "This is an other-worldly place in the middle of Wellington. It's like Jurassic Park - with things that won't eat you.Saw some birds; heard a lot more. I liked wandering around without a tour. If I had more time, I would have done the night tour, though. Definitely worth a few",
          "This was an amazing nature park with tons of native birds and other animals. We did the night tour, which I highly recommend. The guides were terrific, and since many of the birds - including the kiwi - are nocturnal, it's the only time you can see them. A great way to see the",
          "This is a must when in Wellington. Take cable car up to Botanical gardens and there is a free shuttle bus to Zealandia Sanctuary. The ticket is for 2 days so if you are unable to do all the walks there is a choice of the next day.",
          "A great place to visit to go a little off the grid. Gorgeous nature walks with bird wildlife. Very peaceful",

          "This was an amazing tour. Since many of New Zealand's iconic animals are nocturnal, the only way to really see them up close is at night. Our guide was wonderful, and did a great job explaining about the different animals and their habitats, and about why the sanctuary is so",

          "Zealandia was recommend as a 'must see' by an acquaintance. I don't think I truly understood the history of the place and the scope of what the founders were attempting until I got there. We only had about 1.5 hours on site and that was barely enough to get a taste of what was",
          "An amazing facility so close to a big city Staff are friendly and give a great overview of what to expect when buying tickets. Tickets are valid for two days. The electric boat only runs on the weekends. Our 4 year old managed the walk to the top of the dam without complaining.",

          "I hope my comparison of Zealandia to Jurassic Park is not interpreted in a negative fashion. Growing up in the era of those films that gave me a deep appreciation for our natural world as well as the unique talent of human beings to mess up that natural world, it was the first",
          "Zealandia was like NZ's own little Jurassic Park, unfortunately without dinosaurs but a lot of birds. All run by volunteers who are obviously passionate about conservation, it was a great place to see some wildlife and do a nice hike to the upper reservoir where the view was",

          "This was expensive and it was a nice walk but there wasn't much to see. I visited in January and was disappointed that it was essentially a bush walk (sure it's an eco santuary etc etc) but as far as sightseeing goes it was a non event. Good walk, but pretty boring to be",

          "The main thing about this place is that is easy to forget you're still in Wellington. It's a nice walk and the wildlife is interesting if you're a visitor to New Zealand. It has some some photo opportunities. A little disappointed that they feel the need to use speakers in",
          "First time visiting NZ, so we chose this over the zoo since it has more flora and fauna native to NZ. Glad we did. The place is huge! It's amazing how much work has gone into restoring this area to its' original beauty. It's buzzing with the sounds of birds chirping, which you",
          "Once upon a time, all was good. Wingless Moa birds the size of giraffes strode these lands, nature was as close to primordial as possible. Then came the blight of humanity. Natives hunted the defenseless birds to extinction and the European settlers burned the lands to make",

          "This attraction is quite expensive but please go at least once. Take your own picnic lunch as this will keep the costs down. There are wonderful places, high on the hill to go and eat, immersed in peaceful nature. Take time to sit in stillness, then the birds will come out and",
          "This is a beautiful idea. A closed ecosystem that showcases and preserves the native flora and fauna of the Wellington area. The walk can be quite challenging in places so wear your workout gear. It's worth setting aside at least half a day to explore the pristine environment.",
          "This beautiful wildlife reserve is a must-see. High cost for a ticket to get in but well worth it. Check out the \"parrot talk\" session they have. Lasts about 20 minutes but gets you a front row seat to some of NZ's most interesting birds.",

          "We truly enjoyed our visit. There are many trails to walk for all levels of fitness. You see many of NZ birds and how the country must have looked hundreds of years ago. Walking through the valley in the forest is almost surreal. If we had known beforehand the number of hiking",
          "We walked through the reserve at night with 2 guides using a red torch so as not to disturb the animals. Guides were knowledgeable and very enthusiastic about their work and we saw 9 Kiwis during the 3 hours. It was a magical visit and we learnt lots about saving endangered",

          "Was a nice place to visit but not a huge variety of birds there as of course they can come and go as they come lead. There are some off path trails to wander around and suggest you wear proper hiking shoes to make life easier. Nice place to kill a few hours and also see NZ",
          "What absolute fun roaming this bird sanctuary in the dark! While the trails make it a great day visit, the night tour provides the chance to see kiwi\u2014which we did. Our guide, Katie, was great at finding these rare, fluffy, nocturnal feathered creatures. And wandering through",

          "We arrived 2 hours before 5pm closing, plenty of time to enjoy the trails through Zealandia. Saw a variety of birds, heard beautiful calls throughout. Treated to fantastic vistas at the far end of the park. Plenty of shade for a warm day. Would love to come back and see a tour.",

          "To see a valley reclaimed within the city limits of Wellington and to see what they have done in 20 years in terms of bringing back the birds that urbanization had driven away was inspiring. We saw and photographed the saddleback, the kaka, the silver eye, the bell bird and our",

          "We were recommended by friends to take a look at Zealandia on our final day in Wellington. We were not disappointed. Our 4 year old son loved exploring the area, loved seeing all the different types of animals and birds and easily walked the distance from start to dam and back.",

          "Who could imagine fencing this incredible area to create an eco-sanctuary so close to the city? Fences designed to keep domestic cats out keeping nature & animals safe. The area resembles scenery from Jurassic Park. So beautiful and so well cared for. Flat paved walking tracks",
          "I'm a Wellingtonian so we visit the sanctuary a lot and have an annual membership. Annual membership is a good deal for locals and means that you can pop in for a quick walk or a longer one without worrying about the price. The bird life is amazing we always see tui and kaka up",
          "Lovely walk through protected parkland. Saw different NZ native only species - birds and lizards. Well laid out and easily accessible. Added bonus boat ride on lake - currently covered in algae bloom which is a shame .",
          "To experience a reconstruction of the original fauna to New Zealand and then just in the suburbs of a large city was an amazing experience. I think the people behind this deserves a huge praise for initiating this incredible journey. We just found ourselves lucky enough to see",
          "If you are in Wellington then you owe it to yourself to visit Zealandia. We were lucky enough to see a number of wild birds and reptiles, but the truly wonderful part was just being in among nature and listening to the sounds. Going up onto the dam and the suspension bridge is a",
          "We booked a tour of this sanctuary and were very happy we did. Without the guide, you would not really know where to set off exploring and what you should be looking for. Our guide was very well informed and walked us through a nice section of the sanctuary pointing out",
          "Been there twice taking younger family members, who are absolutely intrigued with all they see and learn from helpful volunteers at Zealandia.",
          "We enjoyed our fossick into Wellington Council\u2019s brilliant 500 year venture to reclaim the flora and fauna of Zealandia, to the state it was around 1100AD. Predator proof fencing, a lot of expertise and planning are just part of the strategies. A great walk on well maintained",
          "Easy walking over the main tracks. Lovely bush at the lower level and plenty of bird song, but you may have to be stop and be patient to catch glimpses of the more elusive birds, an exception being the kaka feeding stations. Bus loads of tourists crowded some areas.",
          "At first I wasn\u2019t sure what Zealandia was and why they existed but that has since changed after visiting them. Parking can be a little tricky as the one closest to the entrance is rather small. The one further away is good and there is a shuttle to assist guests if needed. The",
          "It is worth it to hike around this preserve for two hours. You get up close to wildlife and learn a lot about human impact on the environment.",
          "We did the twighlight tour, which was a nice way to see the park. It was very tranquil walkikng around at this time. We were treated to a very beautiful sunset. A lot of people on the tour had come hoping to see a kiwi, but the guide tried to manage expectations on this as",
          "We have seen more exciting sanctuaries but this one is still worth visiting if you have a couple of days in Wellington. Make sure to take the included boat tour around their lake. We thought it was the best part of the sanctuary and the boat driver was the only nature",
          "Kiri was our tour guide and I found her to be very knowledgeable about the sanctuary. We got to see a lot of birds, and a few up close was just awesome. I found it interesting just watching bird life at a close distance where they were seen minding their own business and just",
          "Had a great walking tour with an enthusiastic guide! We saw some rare birds and were told about this protected environment. It was most informative and very interesting.",
          "We visited in a wet cold day, but this didn\u2019t dampen our experience. The tracks are easy going and we heard and saw plenty of bird life. We also had the luck to spot several tuatara! Our device breed kids enjoyed the walk and looking for wildlife, and the walking was mainly",
          "Bird song galore, birds everywhere, a close up encounter with a tuatara, beautiful bush. A sort of sad reminder of what has been lost, but an impressive reminder of what can be regained with effort, and right close to a city too",
          "I was amazed at just how big Zealandia is, the walks range from brief to all day with a variety of terrain. The tuatara are really cool to try and find in their natural habitat too.",
          "Visited Zealandia today and I loved. Such an amazing experience to see New Zealand wildlife up so close in their natural environment. Seeing Kakas feeding and a tuatara sunning himself was just the best. Some of the walking tracks were a bit muddy underfoot so definitely wear",
          "Loved walking through the indigenous plant life to come across native birds and reptiles. It\u2019s a (mostly) predator free wildlife sanctuary so you get to see a lot of rare birds. Well worth the visit if you can afford it. If my children were any older, we wouldn\u2019t have been able",
          "We had a really interesting evening tour by torchlight. We set out with Troy as our guide at dusk as the birds were preparing to roost. Great to hear as well as see. We were taken around the site and Troy explained how and why Zealandia was established. Very encouraging and so",
          "What absolutely amazed me was how up close you get to see the birds!! Rare and endangered species come and sit near you within meters. I had expectations that this would be birds in cages - but there was none of that. Nature and humans coexist without fear. It was like entering",
          "We took the free morning shuttle van on Wakefield Street (across the street from the Info Centre) at 9:30am. We paid for two regular admissions (no guide) and entered. Instead of following the red route counter-clockwise as shown on the map, we took the left turn and headed-up",
          "Went on a beautiful night in November. Saw a variety of bird life, glowworms, tuatara, fish.. insects, plants, no kiwi on the night. Our guide was a wealth of knowledge. Fascinating work they do here and I wish them well for their 500 year vision. Good equipment- torch and radio",
          "Visited Zealandia both daytime and with night tour! Love the place and what they have done! Marvellous animals and beautiful nature! Saw all the birds except the rare Takahe (it had a chick and its area was therefore closed as not to disturb their breeding. The night tour",
          "The night tour is the opportunity to see some kiwi. I think we were unusually lucky as we saw 5 (including a pair), but there are also other indiginous nocturnal animals on the itinery - so you are likely to see something you won't otherwise see outside a cage.",
          "I have not visited this place in the daytime but during dusk and night time (8pm to 10.30pm) it\u2019s amazing. We had a brill guide who managed to find a number of creatures to view including Kiwi. The glow worms just lit up the forest like a bunch of fairy lights. It\u2019s fab. You",
          "Usually bush walks, while offering beautiful nature experiences, are often also connected to inconvenienes such as leeches, mosquitos and lack of modern bathroom facilities. Zealandia therefore offers a nice bridge for people who would like to experience the beautiful without",
          "Fabulous experience, we saw and learned such a lot. It was well worth the visit. Knowledgeable volunteer guide was a bonus.",
          "What a beautiful reserve to walk in and observe native birds close up but in the wild.Short walks or longer tramps, something for everybody.",
          "Loved loved loved Zealandia. I only wish we had more time and also that we had been able to take advantage of a guided tour.",
          "First time to Zealandia and it was impressive and beautiful. They have done a marvelous job of creating a native type habitat for many different bird species and, of course, the Weta! We saw a Weta, but no Kiwi... It was still great and the kids loved it. the trees and",
          "The night tour was excellent as you experience a variety of wonderful things, however, we had a little difficulty keeping up with the group who were going at a very steady pace and our guide tail ending did get cross with us!! We weren\u2019t chatting at all or loitering along, but",
          "Go up the cable car to the Botanic Gardens in Wellington NZ, for a great view. Then catch the free shuttle bus to Zealandia. Join a tour group or walk through the sanctuary yourself (we did the latter) - it is well sign-posted and you can take as long as you like. The founders",
          "This is a great place to visit to hear and see the birds and the bush. It is very easy to get to from town. The walking tracks are well maintained and there is something for everyone - bush tracks and a wide sealed flat path. The cafe is a nice place to stop and have something",
          "This is another great place to go and the whole family can enjoy it. The area of 1 square mile is totally fenced off to keep pests like rats, cats and stoats out. The site is as pest free as possible to help ensure that birds can breed safely. There are numerous paths that you",
          "Night tour was great, helped by excellent weather and a knowledgeable guide. Just keep in mind the place closes at 5 so between then and your night tour time, there\u2019s nothing to do and nowhere to wait really. Your ticket is good for daytime entry before or up to a week after,",
          "Incredible way to spend a couple of hours right on the City doorstep to see how they\u2019ve transformed into wildlife sanctuary. Free shuttle bus runs from the cable car every 10 minutes and you can have either guided or self guided walks around. You are guaranteed to see wildlife",
          "Nice place to have a coffee and hike to see beautiful birds. We were lucky enough on the day we visited to see Taratuas, Kaka birds and Tui birds, along with parakeets. This is a wonderful place for the whole family. I strongly recommend this bird sanctuary.",
          "If you love to walk in a bush setting, this place is great. I visited this place with my family and my teens international student last August 12, 2018. I only gave 3 stars because I did not get a good customer service. I left my picnic bag at the boat and would like to",
          "We visited Zealandia as we love our native birds and are lucky enough to have our own garden full of (some of them)\u2026 what an absolute treat. We saw every bird, except the Takahe, as the pair are mating and needed some quiet, which will hopefully result in a healthy chick this",
          "Very tranquil and worth the mini bus down from the top of the cable car station. Completely natural and peaceful. Sighted birds however need a bit of time to ovserve. Guides available however we chose to meander along the paths. Worthy of support to help preserve native",
          "Allow two hours minimum to maximise the experience! Our guide was DON who was excellent! He set a good fast pace to make sure we managed to see all the current highlights! Underfoot terrain is generally good paths. However, to fully explore the site one will be off-road on",
          "This is a must see for any visitor to Wellington. Zealandia Sanctuary is a highly protected nature ecosanctuary. It is surrounded by a high and extensive 8.6km predator proof perimeter fence to protect our precious birds. You will be required to go through security gates that",
          "It was lovely to see indigenous birds in their natural environment and it's definitely a place to visit - you need at least 2 hours to enjoy the peace and tranquility of the place - along with the amazing bird song!!",
          "I took the night tour in hopes of seeing a Kiwi in its natural habitat and was not disappointed. This was truly a spectacular tour and well worth the $85 NZD. Our guide was extremely knowledgable and passionate about consevation. I saw all kinds of special wildlife and",
          "With the Night Tour, you start by entering the santuary going through security gates that make you think of Jurasic Park. The evening starts with viewing of birds, then night descends and armed with red flashlights we see strang lizards, Eels and more birds. For us we saw two",
          "It is hard to believe when you are in the valley that just over the hill is a busy city. Well laid out paths give an easy walk round this lovely reserve. To make the most of it you MUST pay the money for a guided tour which will point out and explain birds, animals and plants",
          "We took a night tour. It was an interesting tour with a knowledgeable guide pointing out various birds, insects, eels, and more. He also described how the fencing works and how the animals AND birds came to NZ. We all had red light flashlights to see. The tour lasted 2 1/2 hours",
          "We visited Zealandia during our trip to New Zealand and did both a night tour and a day tour. We enjoyed them both very much. We were lucky enough to see a kiwi which was an added bonus. It was out in the open on the lawn near the entrance. It was so cool!!!!!! The way this",
          "Take a guided tour of this wonderful sanctuary. The guides are passionate about the work that is being done to develop this special area and the amazing birds and creatures that are thriving in it. Well worth a visit.",
          "Had a great afternoon here walking with a friend. Wonderful to see so much birdlife and that is just a part of the biodiversity thriving here. Wonderful example of native Bush\u2019s and fab walks. Bring your friends and family and enjoy a sanctuary in a city",
          "Zealandia is a visionary positive living example of what we can do to repair the environmental damage that we have caused other species. An appropriate fence which is dug in to the ground to prevent feral animals burrowing in and designed to prevent other mammal pests from",
          "Walked from Cable Car and then enjoyed a lovely, tranquil walk amongst all the wonders that Zealandia offers. Lots ofceducational information as well.",
          "I know that this is a place of wild creatures and they're unpredictable but after the hype of this place, that continued throughout my entire Wellington trip, I was sorely disappointed. I didn't even see a sparrow there and the closest I got to seeing anything was the taxidermy",
          "Wow! Saw so much endangered wildlife. Went on self-guided walk. Be attentive, quiet and just soak up how NZ must have been before we arrived.",
          "Spent 3 hours on a leisurely walk round Zealandia, the views are breathtaking. We walked round on our own and were not expecting to see much nature, however we were pleasantly surprised, saw lots of birds and even got to see a Tuatara",
          "Very nice day spending there! The ambience and all the information given are amazing! The little movie to the beginner was really good and I loved the different treks! We also see a lot of birth! But the cave was close",
          "I did the guided tour - the groups are kept to a maximum of 10 so just a nice amount of people. Our guide Paul was absolutely fantastic and had amazing knowledge of both the flora and fauna in NZ and the reserve. We was friendly and conveyed the information in an interesting",
          "This place is amazing. We went early on a beautiful sunny day. Firstly the staff are so nice, interested and helpful. You can tell they love their jobs. Then there is the wildlife. We saw lots of wonderful birds, too many to mention as we walked round. The paths are so easy",
          "We went with a group of friends. It was our first visit and it hugely exceeded our expectations. The native birds are amazing but I did not expect to see tuataras as well. We did the entire walk to the upper and lower reservoirs and had lunch at the cafe which was very busy.",
          "This is an exceptional place\u2014a sanctuary for plants and animals unique to New Zealand where they are trying to reestablish species which are threatened with extinction. This is achieved by fencing in an area 3/4 the size of the New York Central Park and removing all non-notice",
          "I was privileged to have a one on one tour of Zealandia with an incredibly knowledgeable guide called Grant. The whole experience was an absolute treat with the highlight being a show of territorialism between one tieke trying shoo off three determined hiihii from drinking the",
          "This is truly a great resource and well done to those forward thinking people who came up with the idea. A place like this also wouldn\u2019t survive if it wasn\u2019t for all the volunteers. It has certainly given a real boost to the bird life around Wellington. Let\u2019s establish more of",
          "We had a recent trip to Zealandia with our 3 children aged 4-7. The location is so close to the city, we got a free shuttle from the top of the cable car. The park is so nice to wander in, lots of native plants, animals and beautiful birds that you would never normally get the",
          "This nature reserve used to be the city's water reservoir but now its a nature reserve. It is a star turn. There is all the nature and wildlife of New Zealand. Wonderful birds and very peaceful.",
          "What an awe inspiring vision becoming a reality. To be surrounded by native birdsong so close to the capital city was such a delight. We made the most of the location by riding the cable car up the hill, catching the free Zealandia shuttle and joining a 2hr guided tour. After",
          "All members of the extended family from toddlers to grandparents enjoyed the visit. We visited the old gold mine and cave wetas, the takehe and walked up to the dam. We also saw tuatara. Our grandson loved the dinosaur movie at the visitor centre and insisted on watching it",
          "Let me preface this by saying that Zealandia is one of the coolest attractions that I have ever been to. One square mile of fenced in urban wildlife sanctuary is a wild achievement in and of itself. All guides were passionate and well informed about the initiative. We",
          "We visited Zealandia twice in the last week. we wanted to photograph Kaka, Sadlebacks and HiHi. Although we saw several of these birds, getting photographs is another thing.",
          "We did the 2 hour tour. Our guide was Paul and he was fantastic. Very knowledgeable and friendly. The tour group is kept small. Beautiful grounds and we saw heaps of birds.",
          "A fantastic project. Get off the main drag through the sanctuary to appreciate the birds. Wear a good sturdy pair of walking shoes.",
          "We had a lovely family day in Zealandia. We saw takahe,saddleback, kaka, tui, robin, grey warbler and many more, The area is beautifully landscaped and is a pleasure to walk. As Forest and Bird members we were surpised that we did not receive a recognised discount. However we",
          "A 500 year project to return 500 acres of land to its pre-human state. We took the cable car up from from central Wellington and were met by the free shuttle bus. Bought our tickets and had a very pleasant afternoon wandering around the site. There are lots of information",
          "I did a Zealandia by Day tour, and found it very interesting. The guide was very knowledgeable, and pointed out animals I would have been unlikely to see on my own. I would definitely recommend taking a tour.",
          "In search of the fabled Kiwi, we took a day excursion here on our own but returned in the evening for a guided tour. In order to appreciate it completely, we recommend doing both as we did. It is lovely scenery. Very dense woods in most of it with babbling brooks/streams",
          "Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys rainforest walks and encounters with wildlife. We spend about 4 hours exploring the sanctuary after taking the free shuttle bus from the top of the cable car on a very cold September day. Next time we visit, we will do a night time or",
          "A beautiful location and lovely walk. Lots of birdlife. We felt very lucky to see a baby tuatara in the wild. Easy to get there and back to the city with the free buses from I-Site.",
          "A good place if you like nature and bird. Just normal hiking for me and my partner. Still some good spots to take photos.",
          "I will not forget this , I hiked and walked through very narrow roads that has. nothing more beautiful than nature , fantastic views .",
          "A perfect sanctuary for wildlife just out of the CBD. Great to see volunteers and staff talking to the public and answering all of our questions knowledgeably.",
          "My grandsons and I had a great afternoon in Zealandia. Wandering through the park and stopping to get close to takahe, north island robins and tuatara not to mention tui, Kereru , kaka all around. The displays and information in the entrance areas are very informative and",
          "This former reservoir has been converted into a wildlife sanctuary. A predator-proof fence keeps introduced mammals out and allows the native birds and reptiles to flourish. Go for a walk in this sanctuary and stop to look and listen. You will be amazed at the beautiful birds",
          "My visit to Zealandia was pleasant and definitely will go back. It's very calming and relaxing, take a minute to look around through the trees not just the track itself, be careful when walking though. My last visit was a while ago and it just keeps getting better every time I",
          "Really impressed by what they are achieving at Zealander, reintroducing endanger species onto mainland NZ and also providing a entrancing nature walk and learning environment at the same time. Very low key as you stroll around the 2 lakes which takes a couple of hours as you",
          "We had an excellent Zealandia by Day tour guide. We were fortunate to see many beautiful and rare birds and a few reptiles as well. It\u2019s a must see activity for anyone interested in nature.",
          "This is a tranquil, fully-fenced area of some 200+ hectares on Wellington City's outskirts where visitors and locals alike may appreciate abundant fresh air and warm sunshine as they stroll quietly through its natural landscape and watch a variety of native wildlife that fly,",
          "What a fantastic initiative and within walking distance of the city. A magnificent conservation project and although it will take many more years the wildlife in the sanctuary is already doing quite well. We loved the walk around listening to the many bird calls and enjoying",
          "Just 5 minutes from downtown Wellington this is an amazing oasis for wildlife. We did the night tour which was very interesting but with the ticket you can visit the day before or after. We arrived at 3pm and stayed until they closed at 5pm. Saw about 12 different birds -",
          "Definitely take the tour. You can wander at your own leisure afterwards. Our outstanding guide, Paul, was full of really interesting and far from boring information. He was always on the lookout for absolutely everything that he thought we might be interested in and enjoy. The",
          "Wow! What a beautiful sanctuary!! Get your moderate exercise in for the day and explore NZs bird life up close. Will definitely be back next time I\u2019m in Wellington!",
          "This is a very relaxing place to visit, take your time to walk around and you will be very suprised by some of the wildlife that you will encounter.",
          "If you like nature, Zealandia is a must see in Wellington. We took a day tour and a twilight tour in the same day, and both of our guides were outstanding. Both tours started with a historical perspective of how New Zealand\u2019s native species evolved, and an interesting",
          "This is a great place to spend a few hours and shock up some nature in a very relaxed way. You can keep to the main track which is an easy walk, and see tuatara, takahe and our other native birds. Then if you\u2019re feeling like a slightly harder walk, take some of the other tracks",
          "This place is magical! So much love for it, highlight for me was the Weta Hotels (where you can see inside a weta's home! Also love the fact that you can avoid the crowds by taking the longer paths",
          "Mum and I spent 3 hours here just doing our own thing. Once we got away from all the prams and small kids, we were able to hear and see so many different birds, it was incredible. The air was so clean and the views were insaaaane. Do recommend :)",
          "We only had a couple of days in Wellington and wanted to do something really special. We went on the night tour of Zealandia and it was awesome! Our guide Andrew was friendly and informative, and helped us spot not one kiwi in the wild, but two! Zealandia has such a special and",
          "I loved this place! My daughter is attending school in Wellington and we bought her a year pass to Zealandia. During our short stay in the area we went three times. Twice during the day to hike and explore the natural beauty and daytime flora and fauna and again at night.",
          "What can I say. If you love peaceful walks while listening to birds this place is ideal. Wellington treated me to a gorgeous day to do this walk. I loved it. Nature at its best. Loved the scenery and the birds and reptiles I saw. Would do it again definitely",
          "I really enjoyed visiting Zealandia. Saw and heard many birds. Nice walk that takes about 1 1/2 hours and is a great way to learn and enjoy nature in the middle of the city",
          "This place is magical, full of fresh green air, lush forest, and unique combinations of bird sounds no matter which corner of the reserve you are in. The walking trails are good, there is a mixture of difficulty and lengths to choose from. We did the main Red loop (recommended",
          "One fine day in the midst of a wet weekend saw us Aucklanders visiting an amazing sanctuary in Wellington. 15 years ago someone made a start to create a wonderful sanctuary for our birds. Our friend who took us there explained that there had been a noticeable increase I Tuis and",
          "We anticipated to see a lot more than just few WETA and birds (not KIWI). But still it's pretty refreshing nature for walking exercise.",
          "I have to be honest - it was harder than I thought it would be to see the birds. I kept hearing birds, but not seeing them, and in the end I saw probably about eight in total. Having said that, I was glad to support the sanctuary's objectives and there were some beautiful,",
          "When on a recent anniversary trip we decided that we would visit Zealandia from Central Wellington e took the cable care to the top to wait for the free shuttle but we were rather early so decided to walk. The walk was long but well worth it and made easier with the painted",
          "I finally managed to visit Zealandia after many trips to Wellington. The free shuttle makes it easy to get to from the CBD. The lady at reception was very helpful and informative. The sanctuary was an absolute delight to visit if you enjoy birds and bush.We saw birds we haven't",
          "Congrats to all of those who made this happen - and the Labour Government for big funding I recall, as it is fantastic. Friendly boatman. Great walks. Super popular with locals and visitors alike.",
          "My wife and I visited here as part of a day-outing exploring Wellington, what a delightful sanctuary right in the heart of Wellies. We caught the cable-car to the top and then the free Zealandia shuttle bus to the sanctuary. Check their website for the shuttle timetable. We saw",
          "A unique place to drop into when you next visit Wellington, plenty of tracks to take you away from the hustle and bustle of the city, loads of native wildlife to see (mainly birds) and terrain for all abilities. We took a couple of hours out of our day to do a few bush walks",
          "We only had 1.5 hours to walk through the park, but we got to the end and made it through the suspensions bridge. Watch out for steep paths when muddy, but we made it down without falling. The park is so amazing and plan to stay there for a few hours. I could\u2019ve easily walked",
          "There are many different tracks that you can take within the Sanctuary and these range from easy (can take a pushchair) to difficult (only attempt if you have moderate fitness). Walking up to the Dam provides you with really good views of the bush on onside and houses and bush",
          "An absolutely beautiful day out, Zealandia is well worth a visit when you're in Wellington (and they have a great Cafe!). Enjoy the variety of walks Zealandia has to offer - if you're really into walking you can easily spend a day here as there are multiple tracks. The main walk",
          "The visit to the Zealandia Sanctuary was magic. The night tour was special and the guides were knowledgeable friendly. Good walking shoes or boots required. Cameras okay for daylight visit, No flash photography or auto-focus lights on night tour.",
          "We arrived early, paid the $20 entrance fee each, watched the introductory video recounting how the sanctuary came to be in anticipation of the abundance of creatures we were about to discover, however... The most exciting part of the morning was checking our bags at the parks",
          "Amazing what they have done to create and maintain a beautiful natural bushland within a short distance of the city centre. Well worth a visit and allow about 2 hours to soak up the tranquility during an easy walk. The electric boat ride is so peaceful too.",
          "I took the cable car up the hill- you can walk but wanted to experience the cable car. Zealandia has a free shuttle mini van that will take you there and back with really friendly drivers! Nice. I arrived too late for a tour which I think would have been a great experience.. so",
          "We took this tour off our cruise ship and it was superb. We are not \"birders\" but our guide was so good the trek was informative and interesting. We saw Takahe and Kaka birds, the Tuatara reptile and the Giant Weda tree boring insect among may other species of fauna. This under",
          "Zealandia is simply a great place you need to visit when in Wellington. It is one of the best experiences so far. The serenity it has, sounds of nature, and seeing birds live happily in their natural habitat make your inner peace grow stronger. Thank you for the management for"

The winding hill paths of the Garden are a popular spot for Wellington residents.  It is used for walking, jogging and taking children to the playground, and tourists enjoy meandering through the Garden's many collections via the downhill path to the city.\nThe Gardens feature a large Victorian-style glasshouse, the Begonia House, the Lady Norwood Rose Garden and the Treehouse Visitor Centre.  There is a large children's play area, a duck pond, and glowworms visible some nights along paths in the Main Garden \u2013 there are monthly tours during autumn\u2013spring (the Garden is otherwise closed at night). Large sculptures and carvings are located throughout the garden.  These are by artists such as Henry Moore, Andrew Drummond and Chris Booth.\nThe Wellington City Council organises events during spring and summer months, such as free concerts in the Sound Shell.\nThe Wellington Botanic Garden is home to several organisations, including:\n\nCarter Observatory, the National Observatory of New Zealand\nWellington Cable Car Museum\nMeteorological Service of New Zealand\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Garden was established in 1868. It was initially managed by the New Zealand Institute (later named the Royal Society Te Ap\u0101rangi) and its manager James Hector until 1891. The New Zealand Institute planted conifers as part of a programme to import plant species and assess their potential for economic benefit to New Zealand. The first Map of the Garden in 1875 by John Buchanan also included the compilation of a list of all plants growing there, and a survey of native plants indigenous to the Reserve.Some animals were kept at the Botanic Gardens prior to the formation of Wellington Zoo in Newtown in 1906, this included the \"City Emu\" which died shortly after being relocated to the Zoo from the Gardens.The Wellington City Council began managing the garden in 1891, developing various parts of the garden such as:\n\nLady Norwood Rose Garden (1950)\nBegonia House (1960)\nTreehouse Visitor Centre (1990) in conjunction with the World Wildlife Fund\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBotanic Garden Visitor Information\nWellington Gardens website",

          "We rode the cable car up to visit the gardens. The pathways and beds were well marked to indicate where to walk and what was planted. We managed not to get lost! We didn't make it through the entire garden as we double-backed and rode the cable car back down. It was a lovely",

          "...after the visit to the Beehive. The view from the top, overlooking the Rose Garden, was beautiful on a sunny day. It was early spring, so no roses - but the view of the sparkling blue waters in the horizon made up for that. I espied a cafe near the Rose Garden but had no time",
          "I would never have thought that I would write about a botanic garden... but that's what I'm doing now because this place is just like heaven. The plants, trees and flowers are just fascinating and so beautiful. The tree-house is a good information centre and from the wooden deck",

          "Our visit to these lovely gardens was sadly too brief as we didn\u2019t realise how much there was to see. From the moment we pulled up in the parking area by the rose garden, we could tell this was a wonderful place to visit and has a very welcoming caf\u00e9 which we have already",
          "My friend and I took the cable car up to the top and walked down. While it was smaller than the map made it appear, the gardens were full of beautiful little spots. I especially loved the fragrant garden which was full of amazing scents, even in July! These gardens are an",

          "After having visited gardens in several cities, I don\u2019t feel like Wellington\u2019s were at the same level. The gardens are in a very hilly area which leads to some uncomfortable walking. The bush walks were nice but the gardens were not as extensive as I expected.",
          "You will have a nice time there, it\u2019s so near to the city yet you feel you are in a peaceful area. Take a one of the oldest trains to the TOP and enjoy the garden. It does have something for the kids to learn about science.",

          "Went round here after getting to the top of the cable car, and it was worth the wander round. A good all round view of the city, with some good vantage points. There is also a space centre to visit and some history of the defending of Wellington. Worth a quiet couple of hours.",
          "Parts of the walk around the gardens are pretty steep but once you get to the playground on the rise of the hill it is really worth it. The playground is suitable for all age children and safe. The rest of the Botanics is an interesting outting, pack a picnic or ride the cable",

          "Having hiked around the North Island, I found the botanic garden underwhelming. If you have the time to do it, sure, why not, but I would not categorize it as a must-do in Wellington. The views from Mount Victoria are MUCH better. At least the entry is free. We received mixed",

          "Botanic gardens are not my speciality and this was another one. My wife's the one with the interest in gardens and this garden is situated adjacent to the cable car in Wellington so you could do 'two birds with one stone'. Also good for photos, both of the gardens and over the",

          "Gardens are on a hillside so the path goes down to the town from the cable car. The way it is designed shows off really well and you stroll thru the colour coded pathways. Follow the coloured arrows or look on the pathway for imbedded signs. Take the cable car up and walk down.",
          "Ride the Wellington Cable Car to the top for one of the garden entrances. One of the main reasons to enter here is that most of the garden is downhill from this point. This is a nice leisurely walk. At the main entrances and exits to the park you will find individuals wearing",

          "The walk was nice, not a lot of plants to see (other than the roses at the bottom), but the history of the place is marked out and is interesting. The cemetery was quite amazing with headstones back to the early 1800's - this was a nice walk which eventually let to Parliament",

          "We enjoyed our walk from the Cable Car down to the Lady Norwood Rose Garden. Views from the visitor centre are interesting, too. You'll see Giant Sequoias - they're the \"pine\" trees with limbs sticking straight out or slightly down.",
          "Walked through during the summer evening, very lovely, lots of fragrant areas, well kept garden beds and lots of pathways, quite hilly in areas, not a problem for us but might be if mobility is an issue for some, would be lovely place for reunions and catch up picnics etc.",

          "Take the cable car up and walk down to the city through many many gardens....This is really nice, gorgeous and informative. The rose garden is lovely, as is the Japanese meditation area close by. This is a nice break from \"touristing\", and at the bottom you will be in the city.",

          "Okay, not much flat land in good old Welly, so its small and hilly. Get fit and walk the trails or stay near the rose garden on a hot day and cafe. Cold in late evening and winter as sun goes down, best hit this place early in the morning, while the dew is on the roses.",

          "WE tried to hear the Otou Bird calling and had such fun, as the birds were visible, yet not chirping!! These Gardens are beautiful and well worth a long walk around, just to wind down and perhaps see the museum and cemetery also. We were lucky to have a lift there - you can",
          "It covers a large area, which takes a fair amount of time to get through all corners of the place. It has a beautiful area close to the treehouse, and a great cafe at the rosegarden. It's SO easy to get to from the city with the cable car, and offers some of the best views of",

          "I had a wonderful opportunity to visit Wellington, New Zealand. Since this was my first visit to this beautiful city I wanted to see as much as possible. I spent my first day exploring the wharf and the area surrounding Lambton Harbor, but when I heard that there was a botanic",

          "Now, I will confess I was severely hung over on this vist. So for me to think this place was wonderful is probably a wonderful indictment on the place. Perched on a hill, with winding paths, different gardens styles, magical European styling with lamp posts straight out of",

          "Having just come from Perth and the iconic Kings Park we didn't think Wellington's Botanic Garden would even be comparable, but it is in a more compact and diverse way. It was wonderful experience to get the cable car up the hill, then we walked the entirety of the park and",

          "Such a nice place to take a walk. Great playground & a duck feeding pond for the little ones & the cafe is really nice in warmer weather particularly when you can sit outside. Inside can get a bit crowded & noisy. Hot house attached the cafe is good to have a look through.",
          "One of the most boring gardens ever visited. Nothing much to see. Unless you are very interested in plants, a nice stroll is all you can enjoy",

          "Best small Zoo in the world! Love the layout and facilities. Good eating options too. Well worth a visit!",
          "Absolutely amazing place to go for a few hours and hangout with your family. The Kea exhibit is absolutely a 15/10 must see if you're going to the zoo. It is a bit hilly (but it's Wellington, what can you expect?) so that's the only thing I'd recommend you be prepared for (:",
          "The zoo was pretty great, and free for the month which was amazing.\nLots to do and see. If you have the time I recommend spending 2 hours here to get a good chance to see everything, that being said a few exhibits were closed so maybe a bit \u2026",
          "A most enjoyable experience for the family. Enjoyed getting to see the giraffes and monkeys, as well as the grassland cats. A bit disappointed I missed lions, tigers and bears, but that was probably more to do with the time of day it was by \u2026",

          "Loved it. Circled back a few times to some enclosures to have a second shot of seeing some of the animals. This is my second visit to this zoo and did not see any of the lions. A lot of them were hiding today. The zoo was very neat, clean \u2026",

          "What an amazing urban zoo. So much to see and some unusual animals. The tasmanian devils were enjoying some blood ice lollies and were so active. Missed the talk at the Nest the vet area which was a shame as the facility looked amazing. This is a must for any animal lover.",
          "Thankyou for our free tickets. Greatly appreciated.",

          "It might be one of the best zoos that truly care for the well being of its animals. For animal lovers, you can really feel the difference. U know what I am talking about... although low diversity, it offers one of the closest encounters a visitor can have! Close to a kiwi! How not to compliment it!",
          "The enclosures here are pretty good and they're always improving. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly. The shops also pretty good if you're looking for a souvenir. We bring our son here often and he loves it.",

          "Well set out, family friendly, school trip friendly, staff are friendly, very much a place to be treasured.",
          "It was a better than I thought experience. I can't compare to those famous Singapore Zoo. But this is the first time I was able to look at a Kiwi bird so closely. The kiwi exhibit is amazing. Others kids friendly zones are really \u2026",
          "Really awesome place to go lots to see the staff are really engaged in what they do ,the animals are just a wonder would highly recommend going,great for a family day out",

          "Great facilities & family friendly",
          "So great to see these beauties up close",
          "Nice layout, good signage. Struggled walking up hill, maybe a design feature that was unavoidable considering location. I am lazy, not disabled.",
          "Well designed and good flow. Missed the lion and tiger. My 13 year old opined that they may be sleeping.",
          "Lovely walk around the zoo - beautiful greenery and wonderful animals to see",

          "Good place to visit. They separate section for there own animals.",
          "Cool zoo which has some unique and sometimes crazy looking animals on display. Everything appears to be well cared for.  Animals were a bit quiet during peak times so I suggest going an hour or two before closing to get the best chance to see the kiwi as they don't appear to like the tourist influx coming through!!",
          "The otters are well looked after. All the animals seem very happy.",
          "Very great, have many animals and insects. I wanted to see lions but didnt have any. My favorite one was the meerkat! \nPaths are steep and twisty, It goes in a loop. Didnt get the chance to go to the cafe but it looked expensive. Had amazing resting area but all the seats were full.",
          "Great day out... Go early... Be prepared for lots of walking up and down hills.\nGreat rest areas and water filling stations... Fun for all ages pick a nice sunny day.",
          "Good price and large assortment of animals.\nAlthough recently there have been an increasing amount of animal enclosures which don't have any animals in them.",
          "Great kiwi house. Never been to a kiwi house where you can get so close to the birds",
          "Beautiful day, much more involved experience with animals. Saw the Kiwi bird\ud83d\ude00 we booked to go into enclosure with a lemur, the were so adorable.

          "Amazing day. Good value great for family's. Loved the chimpanzee exhibit.",
          "Good to see all the animals, great fun,but the grazing post is not great for food, best to bring your own.",
          "Mum dad & teenage daughter decided to take a look at the zoo while staying in Wellington for cheerleading competition. We had a fantastic time got to see majority of animals & got some great pics & footage...a beautiful day weather wise \u2026",
          "Big walk for little legs.\nSaw plenty of the animals. Loved it.",
          "Was great fun and we will be back one day",

          "Superb day out, lovely zoo",

          "Great value entry fee for what you get, really well set out and the animals are great and easy to get close to",
          "I was immediately struck here by how large and leafy many of the animal enclosures are at the zoo, which was nice to see. Like many Wellington attractions getting around involves walking steep hills ! I particularly enjoyed the big cat and red panda exhibits.",
          "Great variety of animals, reasonable entry fee, not to crowded.\nThey would benefit for a slightly larger cafe as it was very busy and full of people waiting for food and to order.",
          "Loved the visit, loads of animals to see.",
          "Quaint, if a bit small, but enough to keep the kids (and the big kids!) entertained.",
          "The animal enclosures and the grounds are beautiful. The animals are cool, but go on a nice day. Many were hiding out of the wind",
          "Pricey but fine.",

          "Really good zoo. The animals are well cared for and housed in habitats, not cages. Staff are welcoming and very friendly (knowledgeable too). There's no question a revisit is on the cards.",

          "Iy was better than I expected! Very cool and cute zoo.",
          "Love this place all the monkeys are just so cute. And the giraffes are absolutely beautiful. Get up close to the kiwis as well awesome.",

          "Lots of cleaning taking place so not as many animals ( be good if they said what's not available). Kea talk was great.",
          "Wellington Zoo is a medium sized zoo with a fair collection of animals. So set your expectations accordingly - there are only a few small eateries and a modest souvenir shop. Each species typically have one animal each, which gets stale \u2026",
          "Great day out with the kids but lacking animals half the enclosures you couldnt see anything and when we went to get an ice cream there was maybe 10 left of 3 sorts in the freezer and $9 for fries seemed a little excessive",
          "Awesome Zoo, friendly atmosphere and staff are helpful.",
          "Such fun going with my grown up animal loving daughter \n. Many improvements since I was last there in 1998.. awesome \u2764",

          "Well kept Zoo,with not so animals ,However the big Thumbs up for more prestine and forest like an Atmosphire ,more like a jungle look ,and the best you see Willington city from the top of the zoo too\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "Great day with my toddler. We saw lots of the animals today like the tigers, sunbear, chimps and the cheetahs. Lots of hands-on activities to keep my 2 year old interested and active.",

          "Really Great zoo. Love the conservation focus",
          "It may be smaller than many but it is incredibly well laid out with easy winding paths between animals, and themed play areas for children that relate to the animals they have just seen. The staff so obviously love the animals, and there is \u2026",
          "Loved the animals but some of the enclosures seemed small. But lovely place",

          "Modern zoo with creative enclosures. A must see",
          "What a fantastic zoo great for the whole family",
          "Great place for the young and the old. Recommend going early to have time to attend the sessions and highly recommend going behind the scenes to have the animal encounter. Ideally it takes about 2 1/2 hours to walk through. Add extra time \u2026",
          "Nice place would be great for kids",
          "Nice hiking zoo with lovely Australia (Neighbors) exhibit with wallabies and emus.",
          "Coolest little zoo in the world.",

          "Did the stay over visit. Was very good.",
          "Beautiful environment...natural settings. Was surprised at range of animals.  There was no formal tour but the map handout listed \"talks\" by zoo keepers on an assortment of animals. \n\nThese talks coincided with feedings so you were sure to \u2026",

          "The layout is very good .. was very impressed!",
          "Great spot for families and city visitors! My partner and I got in early and we\u2019re lucky enough to see a few of the early feedings for Meerkats and Otters.\nRecommend good walking shoes. \nStaff were friendly, and the cafe was a little expensive but expected.\nToilets were clean.\nAll around a very good experience.",
          "Such a cool place very awesome to take kids! \nGreat view from the zoo as well! Spent hours here.",
          "It was fantastic...lovely helpful staff and all the animals put on a great display for us...thoroughly enjoyed it \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Very lonely zoo with a hefty price. Aucklamd zoo price is $24 while wellington is $27 as of posting. While auckland zoo is a bit boring but it is way livelier than wellington zoo.",
          "I always go to the zoo but I had an amazing experience at Wellington Zoo! The staff members were very kind and taught me a lot about animals and protecting wildlife!",
          "A fun day watching animals in their habitat \nAn excellent experience for young and old alike.\n\nYou can get guided tours and watch Animals being feed.\nMake a day off it and take a picnic lunch. \ud83d\ude00",
          "Really great zoo however take in to account on a very hot day that many of the animals will be sleeping or hiding inside their enclosures. Don't forget sunblock water and a snack as the snacks at the shop can be quite expensive. Just be aware, entry price is quite high at $25 per adult.",
          "Amazing place, we had lots of fun and the kids learned a lot about the animals. The staff were very friendly too.",
          "A great family day out.  Lots of interesting animals kept in a very empathetic surroundings.  Just remember it is in Wellington and the site is very exposed to the wind!",
          "Very clean, well organized, had a lovely time walking through the Zoo. Spent about 3to 4 hours going through the entire zoo, kids played on the very well placed play areas. Saw all the animals but the best was probably the baby kangaroos.",
          "This is a great zoo. Along with the great variety of animals there are also lots of places for kids to stop and play.",
          "It's been a number of years since I was last here, so turned into a fantastic outing",
          "Not a zoo, really.  Beautiful, native, out of control bush everywhere but is this what a zoo would aspire to exhibit?  All set displays are old and uninteresting.  A very costly family outing to a place that lost its way and does not seem to be managed that well at all.",
          "Nice to see the otter's the lions and monkeys , All the staff were really nice and I feel that they do there best to look after the animals . And thank you for my coffee and food served by those who also loved the animals as well. God Bless all.",
          "Kids absolutely love it!!!",
          "Absolutely stunning, this place is amazing. Definitely come here for an hour or two with family. I would do 10 stars if I could!",
          "Really enjoyed all my visits... and glad to see that animals got lot of space to roam around.... clean  and easy to guide yourself through the entire place..if you are lucky you will be able to see lions as most of the time, especially when its not sunny, they are hiding somewhere \u263a.",
          "Excellent zoo. Plenty of well cared for animals, lots of awesome encounters, heaps of volunteers and keeper talks, and several 'free roaming' animals for close encounters as well.\nThere's a half decent cafe at the entrance to grab a coffee and/or cake to wander around with too.",
          "Great place to visit when the weather is good! They got good coffee too. Haha",
          "This is a wonderful Zoo and their Animal Experiences are the best.  I have been on the Cheetahs, Meerkats and Capybara visits.   The animals are allowed to participate or not, they are never forced.  And you learn a lot about these \u2026",
          "Most of the animals like lions and sun wolves were not to be seen  but nice environment. Disappointing for my grandson because he wanted to see the lions.",
          "Best to go early morning,  go in the mid afternoon and a lot of animals are napping and hiding.",
          "Had a great time wandering around with the kids looking at the different animals. Lots to see and do along with plenty of educational activities to keep the kids occupied. Maps given out when you pay have the times for feeding and animal discussions. Plan to spend the better part of the day here",
          "Love the Wellington Zoo. So much for kids to do.  Very interactive and lots of play areas. Always spend a good few hours here.",
          "Great family day out place",
          "Cant rate accurately, only dropping passenger off. Been a while since I visited. Should be excellent",

          "Friendly staff, super clean, great day out for the family!",
          "Wonderful place with lots to see and do.",
          "A bit disappointed, we didn't get to see the sun bear, tiger and the Kangaroo... loved watching the chimpanzee swinging and some relaxing, a selfie with the tall Giraffes, Nyala and Ostrich was awesome.",
          "It was amazing the animals were so cute and you got to go up close to the animals",
          "We love this zoo! We are here weekly. It's really small and the perfect size for children. The animals are loved and very well cared for and there are great play areas for the kids. Adults love the zoo too! There is a big hill though but it's not too noticeable because of all the things to look at along the way.",
          "Amazing zoo with some extremely special close encounters if you have a bit of extra cash! We did the Cheetah Close Encounter and it was one of the coolest things either of us have ever done. The rest of the zoo is beautiful with lots of interesting animals that seem pretty happy.",
          "Awesome zoo and we'd love to go back",
          "A mixed bag. \nThe animals are impressive, but half the time they cannot be seen. \nFor what you pay, I'm not sure it's worth admission, unless you want to see a tiger's bum far away shrouded in the dark trees. \nFor specific reasons \u2026",
          "Beautiful zoo set amongst trees. Very natural feeling. Nice enclosures for the animals. Good way to spend half a day",
          "Natural enclosures and lots of information and presentations during the day. Beautiful grounds, a really good zoo,definitely check it out if you are in Wellington",
          "So friendly and the improvements to the walk is perfect",
          "Well kept wild life awesome place",
          "Comfortably spent 4 hours here, be sure to take advantage of the feeding/talk times, as sometimes the animals might not otherwise be around when you stop by. Staff are definitely knowledgeable and open to questions! And feel free to take in a picnic/feed of your own, there are multiple places to sit down and eat.",
          "I have found if you go on a cloudy day more animals are out, if it's a sunny day most of the animals will be hiding and trying to keep cool! Theres a bit of uphill walking involved to get around the Zoo so make sure to bring appropriate footwear and a pram for younger children :)",
          "Spent two hours looking for animals. I saw very few and this sentiment was voiced by many others involved in looking at areas that did not allow us to see the animals in question. Expensive for a walk only.",
          "Very cool way to spend an afternoon for the whole family",
          "We took 4 grandchildren between the age of 3 and 10 to the zoo.  It was a lovely warm day with just enough wind to keep you comfortable.  The 3 year old wanted to see giraffes, the 4 year old otters, 6 year old kiwi and 10 year old the red \u2026",
          "A few exhibits empty but overall very fun and entertaining for a day. Quite expensive so wouldn't go often but loved it none the less. Good date idea.",

          "Nice Zoo - loved seeing the Kiwi and the Chimpanzee",
          "Excellent value for money and a great place to entertain children, young and old :-). Loved seeing all of the animals, especially the Lions. Also enjoyed the spectacular views of Wellington City that we got to enjoy while we were visiting the Zoo.",
          "This zoo needs closing!\nOld decrapped with unkept boring enclosures. \nOnly animals that could be seen or found were the Australian animals and the depressed meerkats. Feel sorry for the animals. Wish I could give it a 0 star rating. It \u2026",
          "I love the Wellington Zoo it is constantly improving itself! We come back once a year and there is always something new to see. The animals all look happy the enclosures are secure and look like great places to live. The talk times are interesting and informative. Wellington Zoo is a must do in the capital city.",
          "Well set out and lots to see",
          "Beautiful zoo. Great views of Wellington also",
          "We filled in half a day with our 2 youngest grand kids they loved the place and Zoo staff very friendly and had great talks about the animals at set time's",

Animals look well cared for and enclosures always well kept and well catered to specific animals requirements. Staff very knowledgeable and really seem to enjoy being there which really makes for an enjoyable and entertaining experience.",
          "I came in on a cold and dreary day so most of the animals were trying to keep warm. However, zookeepers were friendly, helpful and informative. Parking is free (when I was parking anyway). The Kaka were fun birds to watch :)",
          "It's always a great day when visiting Wellington Zoo!",
          "Zoo staff were extremely accommodating in retrieving my hat from the capybara enclosure.",
          "This is a very nice Zoo on New town Wellington . Tiger , chimpanzee , giraffe and lion are a wild life in a open place in Zoo.\n.",
          "I was in a lower leg cast while visiting and relied on a knee scooter to help me get around. There was a $25 door charge for a single adult. The staff member who served me was helpful and gave me a map with gradients on as well as the \u2026",
          "Lovely family day out. Plenty of places for photos of the kids. Got to see most of the animals. Keeper talks are great. One steep hill.",
          "The zoo has a wide veriety of animals, both exotic and domestic for people of all ages to enjoy. Some of the exotic species include giraffes, cheetahs, red pandas and various monkey species. There is a wide range of invertebrates including \u2026",
          "All about animals   if you like nature  want to be a vet why not go and visit",
          "Wellington Zoo is definitely great. We especially enjoyed the Talk time because we learned a lot about our favorite animals and we also saw them being fed.",
          "We took 4 grandchildren between the age of 3 and 10 to the zoo.  It was a lovely warm day with just enough wind to keep you comfortable.  The 3 year old wanted to see giraffes, the 4 year old otters, 6 year old kiwi and 10 year old the red \u2026",
          "Fairly reasonably priced for entry but food is insanely expensive at the internal cafe. Can get a bit crowded but lots to see and do. Very informative and has a well priced gift shop at the end. Good for a family day out or a date.",
          "It was fantastic to be there in the evening, seeing the animals at a later time of the day. Great idea to extend the hours on a Friday for a while. It was a fantastic way to end a work week.",
          "Very fun. Good for the family and it friends. Only bad thing is walki g through due the hills can be difficult.",
          "Great for kids although there are some hills to get the whole way around so if your kids are young <2 and struggle with walking for an hour then I would suggest a pram. It always feels a bit warmer here than it is at home so I\u2019d say pack a \u2026",
          "Great selection of animals and things to do",
          "Awesome zoo with a variety of animals and a focus on conservation \ud83d\udc4d\n\nPlenty to do here, you can easily spend a good portion of your day here. Looking forward to coming back again.",
          "Yeah, as far as zoo's go it's pretty good.   Some interesting spins including the vet clinic with glass walls and intercom to talk to the vet. There's even operating rooms, not sure if they are ever in use during opening hours.\nGo between 12 & 2 as that's when most of the feeding times are.",
          "its a really good zoo. but i recommend that you could make the space bigger for all of your zoo animals so they can have lots of space to run around and swim. because they looked cramp including the lions. i'm not hating,  its just a thought",
          "Fantastic. The Zoo is amazing. Such a great walk around with lots of things for all ages, especially kids.",
          "We did the capybara close encounter and it was so much fun! The keepers were friendly and knowledgeable and made sure both human and capybaras were safe throughout the whole encounter. I was slightly disappointed we couldn't touch the capybaras though",
          "I love this zoo. The zookeepers really know their stuff when you have a question. \nI love that the place is set up to teach you about the animals and conservation.",

          "It's a great walk but would be better during the school holidays",
          "We loved The Australian House area, Red Panda, the cheetah and the capybara and the giraffes and otters. We enjoyed the farm section. \nAll the staff we met were friendly and informative (and not bossy!). We also like Hero HQ. The tarantulas \u2026",

          "Had always been told it was great.it was just okay.nothing like Auckland zoo",
          "Got a life time ban 20 years ago for repeatedly getting caught feeding oatmeal cookies to the sun bears. Fair. More than fair, actually.",
          "We had a great time at the zoo. I found price wise it was quite expensive in comparison to other zoos we have visited. \nThere was a cool area where they had the clinic and you could see procedures being done and ask questions.\nWe were unable to see the sunbeams, but all in all the kids enjoyed themselves.",
          "Maybe not the best zoo I've ever been to but definitely worth a visit. You can get very close to the kangaroos and the emus. I also really appreciate their conservation work and the recycling initiative.",
          "Have loved this place for ages. Great small zoo with a range of animals and a layout that means you won't miss anything. Always working to make the environment the best for animals. They are also serious about protecting the wild counterparts and educating people on how they can help.",

          "Awesome day out. Good for a few hours",
          "We had a lot of fun here. If there are animals you really want to see, be sure to check the times of talks and feeding. Not only are the talks interesting, but you're most likely to get to see the animals then. Some of them are really good at hiding. Be prepared for lots of uphill walking!",
          "Cool day for everyone plenty of animals",
          "A lovely small zoo. We spent approximately 2 hours there. Many animals. The Apes were incredible. Their outdoor area was under construction. Once that is opened up it will be great for a re-visit. Excellent place to come while you are in \u2026",

          "Our first time here, a little disappointed. Didn't really see many of the big animals.\nThey were either in another area of the zoo?? or maybe it was a little too hot for them to come outside. Nice big zoo, plenty of space, beautifully presented just a little lacking in animals",

Still a good place to visit with our young grand children and there are some good picnic spots and things for children to climb on as you go around. Very enjoyable.",
          "Easily one of the nicest Zoos I've been to.\n\nThey genuinely seem to care about the animals and most importantly, the impact we all have on these beautiful creatures.\n\nI ended up having a team day here which was a very well run day and even included a chance to feed the giraffes!... An amazing experience.\n\nHighly recommend the place!",

          "Great day out at the zoo. Friendly well trained informative staff, heaps of animals to see. Recommend going to feeding times to learn more about the animals. Priced accordingly, well worth the visit.",
          "On Feb 23, the zoo euthanized 4 healthy baboons because you could not provide an environment stimulating enough to keep them peaceful and happy  with each other. Several times the zoo reiterated how this was the humane solution. Funnily \u2026",

          "Coming to the Wellington Zoo was a fun and enjoyable experience. Seeing everything from Chimpanzees, Kia, Kangaroos, and even Kiwis (if you look hard enough in the dark)\nThis is a must if you plan on coming to Wellington.",
          "Definitely worth the visit, the kangaroo encounter was lots of fun.",
          "Great green space now 100% improvement from the fifties when I leave bed close by",
          "Value for money. Staff are outstanding and are not afraid to answer questions.",
          "Very well laid out, super kid friendly but caters for everyone! Being Wellington you do have to walk up and down hill but they have broken it up well with lots to stop and see and do along the way.",
          "But recommend to go there not in hot weather.",
          "Beautiful enclosures with all the kids favorites. A very interactive and friendly zoo where you can learn about native animals as well as endangered species from around the world. The staff are very happy to answer any questions about the animals and there are lots of opportunities for close encounters.",
          "While I appreciate the animals are there to perform you at least expect to be able to see them even if they are asleep etc, bern 3 times now and have never seen a lion or sun bear very hard to explain this to kids who think they will see these animals.",
          "Pretty neat zoo",
          "Was brilliant, very clean and well looked after. Great exhibits and that staff talks and feeding time were enjoyable. Because it was a week day visit we had the place almost to ourselves. My favourite was the red panda. It was so cute.",
          "The exotic animals were cool and all, but imo Joan Stevens Hall is a better zoo experience if you're in Wellington.",
          "Such an amazing place. You definitely need to plan a whole day with a picnic. They staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. Lots of good information on all the animals",
          "Visited the Zoo recently. Last time I visited was in the early 1980s. I was very disappointed with the new setup. Too much up hill walking.  Not wheelchair or baby buggy friendly. Some of the animals looked sad. A positive was that there were plenty of places to rest and some colourful play areas for the children.",
          "We visited the zoo and had a pretty good time. The chimps were absolutely funny. They were well worth going to see on there own. Plenty for the kids to do there as well. Just be prepared for a lot of up hill walking which I didn't mind. And \u2026",

          "When my grandfather asked if I wanted to go to wellington zoo for the day I was reluctant to go as I have been many times before and it is always the same. I went anyway and was delighted to see that they have extended and changed many \u2026",
          "A fantastic zoo experience. I particularly love the kea enclosure. Those cheeky birds are so much fun.",
          "Pretty average, I guess most of the animals are hiding from the cold, lots of refurbishment going on so will be good for summer I'm sure",
          "Rip off by mojo cafe, 45 mins to make a smoothie as the guy decided to make all coffee first. In a spirulina smoothie there was no spirulina. Don't go there.",
          "I loved it that we've spotted the kiwi. A highlight ood the day. Staff is extremely friendly and they recycle the zoo map by reusing them. Perfect. Parking is free of charge if you are I  time. \n\nI just ran into many cages where I did not spot any animal at all. Also, a lot smaller than I expected.",
          "What a fantastic zoo! We had a great day (Dad, two boys 4 and 1). We walked the whole site in the day with loads of time at some animals. We had a lovely play on the playground, saw all the animals bar the tiger (Dad saw him hiding in the \u2026",
          "Smart KEA bird",

          "Great place to take the grandees. Lots of educational info. Changes regularly. Loved it.",
          "Great day out.",
          "You can get an up close experience with the animals",
          "Zoo is really well done. Don't expect a flat walk, however: you'll be up and down hills, but nothing too difficult. Great for kids. Parking can be a bit hard to find on busy days i.e. public holidays etc.",
          "Love coming here, it\u2019s so green and is unlike a the usual zoo with cages and concrete pits. Beautiful setting and great views of the city. Staff are lovely and love all the residents, even if they\u2019re sleeping/hiding or being naughty.",
          "A great experience as always - the staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and clearly love the animals they work with, the habitats are well planned and looked after, and the animals are happy and healthy. They stress the importance of conservation at every talk, and they're truly committed to protecting animals from human activity.",
          "nice talk time for animals at certain time. friendly zoo keepers.",
          "Good zoo we loved it.",
          "Not too busy. Inexpensive to get too. Great Cafe at the entrance. Very intimate viewings of the animals.",
          "Only been to three zoos in Nz, this is the highlight, closer than Auckland zoo to the animals like Hamilton zoo, but bigger than Hamilton without losing the hands on feel, you can easily pay for encounters with the animals, but every day there are free talks with the animals, a full day is easily spent here if you take your time.",
          "Food wasn't great... and a little overpriced with the upper eatery closed early. Lovely informative staff. The zoo is on a steep hillside so be aware that your calves will get a work-out. Most of the enclosures were clean and animals seemed very happy. Animal encounters run throughout the day so there's always something going on.",
          "Fun for the kids! Nice day out!",
          "Interesting zoo with lots for everyone  !\nPlenty for little kids to do with a huge focus on conservation",
          "Love going here. It is never boring. The kiwi enclosure is so well done. Great for a day out.  A good size zoo",
          "With fine weather the animals come out to play... kids loved the trip and the entry fee was better than it has been in the past...",
          "Loved it and will recommend to go I'm going again",
          "The best zoo I've been too, the animals look happy with plenty of free space and the zoo is set up really well. Very very impressed. Well worth a visit, but it is a little expensive.",
          "Its an awesome place on a sunny afternoon in Wellington",
          "A great zoo right near the centre of Wellington. Has a farm area that allows kids to feed pigs, pet sheeps and see chickens run underfeet. Good open spaces for animals. Some parts can be quite hilly though but still wheelchair and stroller friendly. Options for lunch is only limited to a cafe in the middle of zoo and the entrance.",
          "The Zoo is one of those places I have visited many many times and there is always something interesting to see. The kids love it and it gives you a good workout thanks to the really steep hill that it is perched on the side of! Just wish some of the enclosures could be bigger for the animals.",
          "I like the zoo very much. Though it is small, it is very nice. You can have much interaction with the animals. And they have very good and artistic designs there.",
          "Fantastic zoo. Would recommend the Keas show they are great fun!",
          "Just watching these beautiful creatures is amazing.. but then you can pet a kangaroo or chat with an emu . A wonderful afternoon.",
          "Excellent place to visit",
          "Great place for kids. Very interactive",
          "Wonderful small zoo.  Only problem is some of pathways are very steep uphill climbs, probably not good for seniors or others who might have trouble walking.  But they DO provide a map of where paths are steep.  They also might consider \u2026",
          "My family and I love this zoo a lot. Every time we come to Wellington to visit other family we visit this zoo. Always a fun time with awesome animals.",
          "Zoo is a good place for young and old to stroll around with more to see and hear with feeding times!",
          "Fantastic place to visit, haven't visited for a long time and was so impressed with the zoo, great enclosures, animals seem so chill",
          "Absolutely understandable entry price. High to some, but all this quality experience doesn't come cheap. Vets, special diets, staffing. And holy cow what an amazing visit today! From the front entry to the end, the Rangers, Keepers, and \u2026",
          "Great walk around seeing the animals, and coffee at Mojo cafe afterwards",

          "Taken children to zoo Labour Weekend... quite pricey yet staff didn't disclose majority of enclosures were empty!!  Hadn't been to zoo for about 4yrs, there was plenty of animals of all kind.\n\nSuch a disappointment, waste of time & money...",
          "I just had an overnight stay at the zoo with my son on his school camp. What a cool experience! Shame it poured with rain this morning but awesome none the less",

          "The zoo is well set out and accessible.  However take your own food and drink. That supplied in the cafes is of poor quality and very expensive for what it is.  The rating I have given relates to the zoo and it's layout. If a rating was offered for the on site cafe I would be generous in giving it a one star",

          "What a great zoo! Me and my friend had a blast walking through it! I saw a kiwi bird!! Although I don't have a photo of it to show all of you. But it was an amazing experience! I will highly recommend this. The customer service there was really helpful as well! And a cute gift shop.",

          "Don't get me wrong, the Zoo is good but you need to plan your timing carefully. First thing in the morning didn't seem to work out. Most the main attractions (being lions, bears etc) were no where to be seen and after talking with someone \u2026",
          "Great place to take the kids. The giraffes are amazing!",
          "Good place for family picnic. Animals seem well treated and happy. We didn't see the tigers and the bear.",
          "Love this place. It feels so natural wandering the paths and coming to exhibit after exhibit where the animals seem content in their environments. Have previously done 3 of the close encounters (cheaters, lemurs and red pandas) and they were stand out life experiences!",
          "Had a great time at the zoo. Particularly enjoyed the sun bear - had a great view of the male bear from top lookout when he was being feed",
          "Zoo's are funny things, I'm often unsure of the worth of them. They take up a huge amount of inner city space in an age when people are really struggling to find homes. But a first trip to the zoo with a child is a singular experience \u2026",
          "We visited during the zoo open days - $2 each for entry - and they had even convinced the kiwis to come out to play in the kiwi house (amazing with the number and noise of visitors passing through).  The lions were also cooperating, sunning \u2026",
          "Was awesome nice people! Kids all loved it! Just make sure to take your own food and drink along as the food there is very limited and sooooo expensive.",
          "This is a really beautiful Zoo, and will make you feel far removed from the city thanks to its lush natural environment. It\u2019s very large and provides a great walk and has an amazing array of animals that all have lots of space. Once you get to the top you\u2019ll enjoy stunning views of the city too!",

          "Nice little zoo. I definitely recommend doing one of the close encounter experiences",
          "The highlight of our visit to Wellington zoo was the Kiwi and the chimpanzes. The animals are kept in very good conditions and you can see their unique habitats. Definitely worth a visit when you're in Wellington",

          "Nice to see some animals that you would not necessarily see anywhere else... I think the zoo would be much better if there was a lot more interaction like what you see at staglands.",
          "It's awesome!",
          "Great for the land they have, good for little ones, went in the afternoon which meant lots of the animals were snoozing",
          "We had a pushchair, so the hills were a challenge. The enclosures actually concealed most of the animals. So for $27 each per adult we were disappointed. Giraffes were our highlight.",

          "Awesome to see animals in their natural environment. But because they have such a good home they are hard to see. Go later in afternoon they get fed and come out. It is steep walking so bit tuff for elderly or wheelchairs",
          "decent enough zoo but quite hilly to walk around, particularly if pushing a pram. Some of the enclosures make it hard to see the animals, but otherwise worth a visit. parking can be an issue",
          "We enjoyed our day at the zoo.. we had wonderful sunny weather which was a bonus. Enjoyed the talks and walking around to see the animals.",
          "They have so many cool animals. My boyfriend and I went at the perfect time where the place was not over crowded and all the animals were very active! Great date spot!",
          "First time visit to Wellington Zoo. Small but well-looked after gardens. Loved the chimps and the kids enjoyed the junior vets experience. A little tricky to see the animals at times, it may have been a little hot for them to come out. Entry and also the cafe inside was on the",
          "I was booked on the Red Panda Close Encounter and loved it! The red pandas walked across our laps as it ate from our hands. The zoo guide was very friendly and told us stories about the red pandas. Definitely a cool experience and thing to do, just be sure to book in advance",
          "We went to Wellington Zoo for a nice days outing and also for the wife and daughter to have their private zoo experience with the resident cheetahs. All organised online in advance , on arrival we went straight through the admission area and collected our close encounter tags",
          "Took my 3 grandson here at the start of a day visit to Wellington. Excited to start they rushed in. So much to see....they loved the live animals and each one had one favorite animal they liked more than others. They loved looking behind little doors exploring what was there.",
          "Unfortunately the weather wasn\u2019t great so our visit couldn\u2019t be long. But as it turns out Wellington Zoo is a perfect place to visit if you have half a day to fill and if you like zoos. Given a map at the beginning we were on our way. The giraffe feeding was so much fun and",
          "Reasonably priced and spot-on size-wise with approachable rangers and a wide range of animal environments this zoo is great in every way for kids. Take a full day and a picnic ( the food is great here but over-subscribed leading to lunchtime queues). There are water-fountains,",
          "I was here on a work trip, unfortunately. And I will never return. The enclosures are very clearly much too small for these animals. I'm not sure how this could be considered conservation. These animals don't need to be at the Wellington Zoo. Whatever work is being done there",
          "Stunning animals, beautiful view in the mountain tops. Was a great walk through the park. Wish there was move availability in terms of cafes in the park",
          "Paid a visit to the Wellington zoo. Unfortunately the day was very windy and after an hour at the zoo the rain came down. There were not very many people about and most of the animals seemed to be sheltering from the weather. There have been lots of changes to the zoo since I",
          "Caracals and servals, sun bears and cheetahs, chimps and otters... and so much more. This zoo will easily fill a whole day for a family with young children.",
          "The zoo has the potential to be a lot better. The location is great but we didn\u2019t get to see all the animals that supposedly reside there. Perhaps we didn\u2019t look hard enough.",
          "I first visited Wellington Zoo as a child, in the days of Kamala the elephant and have been back a few times over the years. It has been great to see the transformation from concrete enclosures to much more spacious 'natural' habitats. The one downside to this change is that the",
          "The team that welcomes you on arrival is very friendly. Take a map, fine out when times special times with the different animals are, and plan your visit. I take my granddaughters and find it is an excellent experience for them. My only negative comment is that it is quite",
          "Nice Zoo, small entry fee with student discount. The animals are kept in nice places and very friendly staff are always around to answer questions.",
          "It was ok I guess, but as expected it's pretty expensive. To benefit from the family rate, you need to have more than 2 children which I thought was a bit rich. There's not a whole lot to see, but some areas are decent. We saw the gorilla talk which was the highlight - probably",
          "Needed maybe a more experience keeper, less anxious, & willing to let meerkats climb on people as others have reported in their experiences. The meerkats were interesting to watch but the keeper we had was most focused on getting them to the eating platform when friends who had",
          "Was looking forward to seeing the Zoo. The talks they have during the day were pretty interesting. Just short introductions to the animals, but it\u2019s nice to get to know them. Especially the stories of the injured animals that are living in the Zoo. I think I had a bit of bad",
          "Mum,dad & 16 year old daughter off to the zoo! Got to see the majority of animals! Lovely surroundings & grounds. On sight cafe for the family & was reasonably priced admission to the zoo. Would definitely go back! :-)",
          "An enjoyable Zoo experience for the whole family. Informative talks during the day aimed at all ages. Friendly staff and volunteers met along the way. Plenty to see and do and well worth the visit.",
          "Wellington Zoo is quite small, but has lots of animals to see and was a nice place to walk around. The highlight for me was the Kea feeding. The staff were awesome and were happy to answer questions and have a chat. Most of the enclosures were spatious and well maintained.",
          "Animals shipped from other continents to be kept in enclosures is NOT conservation, no matter how much a zoo claims to educate customers. Children are able to learn about dinosaurs without seeing them up close, so there is no need to keep cheetahs in a New Zealand zoo. You",
          "After reading earlier reviews I was pleased that they were not our experience. Helpful staff, with children in mind, especially as it was school holidays. Gave my grand daughter the options for seeing various favourite animals. It was windy so many animals not visible but those",
          "The zoo has a great plan and was way to navigate Although it was school holidays there were no queues and the zoos keepers talks were good Great afternoon",

          "Very disappointed at the lack of animals we saw given the price we paid. Most enclosures were completely empty. Kids were very disappointed and bored of looking into empty enclosures. They soon stopped looking for animals and started counting the Animals back soon\u2019 signs. I",
          "Animals are meant to live in wild, so it was sad to see them in captivity. Got to see meerkats, Emu and red Panda for the first time. It take whole day to see all the animals.",
          "I love that this zoo has exotic animal encounters such as the red panda and the cheetah! As if it wasn't good enough, the price is fair and part of the proceeds goes to the conservation of the species! The zoo itself was ok. It is pretty small, but still enjoyable.",
          "Kinda disappointing and over priced. Many animals weren\u2019t around. Probably not worth the money. The grounds could be nicer.",
          "Had the pleasure of coming face to face with a kangaroo and learning a ton about kiwis and many other creatures.. Wednesday\u2019s in the summer is Half off:) great way to spend some time in this unique city!",
          "I visited with group of Thai nationals the entrance fee was in excess of $200 which I consider exorbitant considering the number of closed and empty enclosures. I feel that there should be seasonal pricing for when refurbishment is underway. I will not be back.",
          "I was immediately struck here by how large and leafy many of the animal enclosures are at the zoo, which was nice to see. Like many Wellington attractions getting around involves walking steep hills ! I particularly enjoyed the big cat and red panda exhibits.",
          "The 30 minute Capybara close encounter went beyond my expectations. Glenn, my zoo guide was friendly & knowledgeable and his passion for these delightful rodents matched mine. I chose to visit on a Monday during school term time & this turned out to be perfect - just Glenn,",
          "I've spent nearly 3h in this zoo, had a look on TripAdvisor before, read some comments saying that some animals were hard to see, ect... Actually I've seen a lot of them ! Was really happy with seeing beautiful keas, chimpanzees, bear, tiger and a real kiwi ! (Tho he was well",
          "A great array of animals. Yes, there were a small number not visible but the majority were. The chimpanzees were extremely entertaining with one particular youngster causing mischief. We could have stood and watched them all day! Also got to watch some sick and injured birds",

          "We had a wonderful visit to the Wellington Zoo, maybe because the forecast was rain and we ended up with a beautiful quiet Sunday. We really lucked out and were just in time for the little blue penguin talk. They are so fun to watch! It was interesting to learn about the",
          "The animal areas look a little in disrapeare and the zoo is no designed for guest to see animals unless active, couldn't see the bears, Tiger, Monkeys, Cheetah, only about a third of animals we got to see with huge hills and so much walking made it not very enjoyable",
          "A lot changed since our last visit. Where have the baboons gone? Always love the Giraffes and liked the new look for the Locals section.",

          "This is a small zoo.It is well laid out.You get the bonus of good exercise due to the hilly terrain. Children under 12 love it.A better alternative than the movies.",
          "The sun was shining so we decided to take an Uber up to the zoo. I was a little disappointed but can see the attraction. We saw a few animals, there are definitely some decent enclosures but other areas seemed neglected and quite small in places. Like most things, I think it",
          "We love the Wellington zoos because the animals do too! They have a great array of side-attractions that never fail to be both entertaining and educational.",
          "Spent the day at the Zoo and saw a wide variety of animals in eco friendly environment. Even saw a red panda in a tree.",
          "We loved our visit to Wellington Zoo, it was a beautiful day and the animals were all out sunning themselves. I felt that the food and nibbles we purchased at the zoo was reasonably priced. The animals looked really healthy and happy, it was a great day out and worth every",
          "Probably the best zoo we have been to. Why? It may be smaller than many but it is incredibly well laid out with easy winding paths between animals, and themed play areas for children that relate to the animals they have just seen. The staff so obviously love the animals, and",
          "First visit here and honestly thought it was a bit boring, a lot of walking and a big hill to walk up so might be issue if you have mobility issues. A few animals to see but also a lot of empty areas where the animals weren't out so not that much to see, wouldn't come back here",
          "My friend and I visited during the weekend. The lovely weather made our exploring an enjoyable one. We had a close encounter with some of the animals and it was amazing! The place is clean and well kept. The animals are healthy. There\u2019s a good parking space and a cafe outside.",
          "Wellington Zoo is an informative & entertaining day out. Make sure you are at the feeding times of various animals. Usually in the afternoon. A passionate zoo staffer tells you about the animals that are the subject of our attention. The highlight for me was the giraffes. You",
          "We found it hard to get a car park, but once we were in the zoo we had a lovely time. The zoo is kept very clean and is very easy to find your way around. The animals are up close and personal. Loved the giraffes, merecats and the otters especially. Well worth a visit.",
          "I don\u2019t enjoy seeing animals in cages so this isn\u2019t my favourite place to visit however it is a great day out with children. There is plenty of walking and lots to see. The animals are well looked after. The area is well maintained and neat and tidy and the animal talks really",
          "My highlights are always the chimps! Amazing, fun, well looked after group, could watch them for hours. And don't get me started on how cute the otters are! And meerkats! And the red pandas! The zoo itself is a lovely place to go for a walk, regardless of the animals, really",
          "No the nicest of days but plenty to do, & see & with a little one always action. Great 1/2 day out. Animals seem happy but most keep inside in a wetter day!",
          "We loved Wellington Zoo! We visited on a rainy Sunday and the zoo had very few crowds. We were entertained by an array of animals which most notably included giraffe feeding, kiwi and Kea encounters and some playful otters. We spent two hours wondering around the different",
          "Wellington Zoo is absolutely worth a visit when next down south. We spend the day and still did not see all. Parking is a bit of a challenge but for the rest, excellent",
          "This is the oldest zoo in New Zealand and it shows. Some of the enclosures were pitiful to see and also many of the animals could not be seen for whatever reason. This included the sun bear, the tiger, penguins, tasmanian devil and the dingos. Disappointing. On the good side,",
          "Defeinelty worth a visit and would be heaps of fun for the family. I would recommend this attraction to anyone, and it is perfect for both families (teens and young ones) and just a day out with friends. Now, I would love to give this attraction 5 out of 5, but due to the angry",
          "Some of the animals were let to hover around the paths. They are all friendly and lovely. It seems like they have been looking after well.",
          "We did see some of the animals and birds, but most spent their time indoors. Highlights were seeing a Kea, bent on mischief, stalking an unsuspecting man, the Kiwis in the night house, a Serval wandering, and Australian animals wandering freely among people. It is good to see",
          "Worth a visit but was a little bit dissapointed. The talks were extremely boring, the staff just spoke the same words, very little passion or interest. The wild creatures talk was almost painful to watch. Take lunch with you as the cafes were very.... simple. Im all for healthy",
          "In Newtown suburb a few km from The city centre. Easy accessible , easy to find with transport that can take you to the front gate. Great for children and extremely knowledgable and friendly staff if you need to know any information regarding the animals. The view is also",
          "We did a close in counter with the Meerkats, and it was amazing! they are adorable and friendly. They jumped on our laps and even stood on my shoulder. Our guide was adorable and knowledgeable. She told us all about them, and played with them too. One was very pregnant and she",
          "What sort of Zoo has no car park? Arrived at 9.15am so 15mins before zoo opens. No on street parking and no parks next door. Absolutely ridiculous. Very disappointed. Wouldn\u2019t recommend if you are driving a car. We had to take the car as we had to cross on the Ferry that morning",
          "One of those quiet little zoos best suited to school trips but for the tourist there are far more informative sanctuaries and nature trips available.",
          "We had a couple of hours free before our ferry to Picton and figured visiting the zoo was a good way to spend time. It was a good choice; small; yet well maintained, we saw the Red panda and Kiwis and a multitude of other animals and birds both of New Zealand and else where.",
          "During our second trip to Wellington, we also made our second trip to the Wellington Zoo. We are big zoo aficionados and the Wellington Zoo does not disappoint. There are many different types of animals (our favorites being the small clawed otters, lemurs, red pandas, and",
          "On world standards this zoo would be rather small, but the quality is enormous. The animal carers are just so dedicated and very friendly to visitors. Animals seem very well cared for and happy. Zoo very easy to get to by car or bus from the CBD.",
          "They had a great zoo, the animals were mostly easy to see. I had never seen a porcupine as large as the one they had there. The kiwi house is worth a visit too.",
          "Small, and exposed to the windy elements, Better to choose a day when the animals don't hide from the wind!",
          "Danielle was a student at the school I work at and she has carved out a successful career at Wellington Zoo as the carnivore keeper. She had the time to show us around and explain lots of things about the workings of this magical little zoo. She presented her Sun Bear show and",
          "I brought my husband a Red Panda experience at Wellington Zoo. It was the most amazing experience. The keepers who took us through were very knowledgeable and made sure we got the best from our experience. We got there in enough time to have a look around the zoo and it was a",

          "We went primarily for the Red Panda Encounter which was definitely worth it. It was unique and memorable to be able to be that close to them in a small group! The rest of the zoo was a bonus, but this zoo is relatively small.",
          "Have been many times but never written a review. First things first, if you're not a fan of going up hill, or can't, this may not be for you. I don't know if there is any kind of assistance. Pushing a fully laden pushchair can be heavy going in some places. Other than that,",
          "My son absolutely loved the otter display and watching the otters swim around. Seen all the big cats but the Sunbear could not be seen. Also tried multiple times to see a Kiwi but just seen lots of mice in the Kiwi enclosure, one of the pests that is the reason for such low",
          "Although we\u2019re local we hadn\u2019t visited for a few years. Was a great day with so much to see and even though it was busy it didn\u2019t feel busy inside the zoo. The chimps and giraffes were particularly engaging. Food kiosk inside the zoo not well stocked or coping with numbers",
          "So the title became a running joke with me and my partner during our visit to Wellington Zoo. Obviously we saw a few animals but for a while we went from enclosure to enclosure and saw nothing. I can understand this isn't really the zoos fault but it was just a little",
          "My partner and I enjoyed a great trip to this zoo. We were greeted with smiles and helpful staff to start, followed by a lovely afternoon seeing all of the animals in healthy enclosures. The empthasis on the environment-friendliness was definitely appreciated and earned our",
          "We found the zoo easy to find - we got a bus from the city centre to the hospital for $4 each. Although we could have waited on a bus to take us directly to the zoo we decided to walk. It was a leisurely 20 minutes - uphill, so it was much easier to walk back to the bus stop",
          "Unfortunately we have been spoilt by Auckland zoo and found Wellington zoo very underwhelming. There was a distinct lack of displays. Luckily the chimpanzees had a new enclosure which they were enjoying and a fantastic talk was presented by the keeper.",
          "Great day put with the kids. Beautiful play areas and beautiful animals. Gotta love the monkeys they are so cheeky. Was very sad to learn the sun bear had recently died he was always my favorite. This time I brought my 21 month old who had a ball pointing at all the animals.",
          "Really good small zoo with good quality habitats for the animals, so much so that most of them were hiding the day we visited. Still a good place to visit with our young grand children and there are some good picnic spots and things for children to climb on as you go around.",
          "My first visit to any zoo in years. I didn't get to see the lions or the tiger but on reflection I was happy about that. The animals had enough space to have some needed privacy. The enclosures were great as we're the viewing spots. We really did have a great experience and are",
          "A lovely small zoo. We spent approximately 2 hours there. Many animals. The Apes were incredible. Their outdoor area was under construction. Once that is opened up it will be great for a re-visit. Excellent place to come while you are in Wellington. There were many families out",
          "Something for all ages, from all walks of life. At a minimum allow 2 hours for a good walk around the zoo, may take longer if you listen to some of the scheduled talks/feedings. We arrived just after opening and even though it was raining we were warmly welcomed when we",

          "This was a highlight for us on our three week trip through the north island of New Zealand. We decided to do the red panda encounter and it was a once in a lifetime experience if you're an animal lover. My husband and I, along with another couple and the zookeeper, got to go in",
          "I was rather desperate to see a kiwi when I was in NZ and the zoo was my best opportunity. On my third pass through the nocturnal house, I was lucky enough to spy the rather large critter! The rest of the zoo is nice but fairly standard. Worth a visit to see a kiwi though!",

          "My favourite part of the Wellington zoo is actually the theatre where you can watch the vets treat injured native wildlife before they are released. I have also done the meerkat and red panda experiences, both definitely worth it and great as a gift! Also the general entry fee",

          "Smaller than expected but well set up. A guy was \"blowing\" massive bubbles in front of some of the animal enclosures - didn't like that as it seemed to upset some of the animals (not sure why he was there and why it was being filmed). Otherwise good family fun!",

          "Visited the zoo while our cruise ship was in port, $69 for the family was good value. Spent half the day there. The kids loved it and there is a nice cafe at the entry / exit to enjoy a coffee and lunch. Keep up the good work.",
          "We love taking our grandchildren to Wellington Zoo. They enjoy it all from the New Zealand farmyard to the Australian animals you can get up close to and the African animals. A lovely place to wander and take a picnic lunch. Young children lived climbing on the animal sculptures",
          "Not a great zoo experience at all. We couldn't see many of the animals as they dont really have much in the way of platforms for viewing or well placed windows for looking into enclosures. No penguins to be seen and no signage explaining why. Maybe they were in another part of",

          "This zoo is well organized and amazing to walk through. The live encounters are totally worth the money- you get time to see a wild animal in a safe way and know they are treated ethically and with love. The blue penguins are adorable! Would highly recommend. Just avoid the",
          "The zoo surprised us with how big it was and how well the animals were being looked after. The entry costs are significantly lower than most zoos ($25AUD Approximately). As with most of Wellington it is a bit hilly so wear comfortable shoes. The Australian section was",
          "Not easy to get too, parking a bit of a nightmare. Built in the hills so not an easy place for pushchairs or wheelchairs but is do'a'ble. Take water with you as you will need it and not easy to access once within the Zoo.",
          "I always take my son to this zoo. Great for sunny weekend. Great for birthday parties or any special events.",
          "Always love to visit the zoo, so much to see and do. I especially like the monkeys. All the animals look happy and healthy too",
          "Really nice place to take the family on a sunny day. Lots of places to stop and have a picnic and relax",
          "We took our two grandsons out for the day and had a great time visiting the zoo. The boys handled the uphill walking easily. The animal enclosures are well spaced out with good viewing areas. All the staff are helpful and friendly. On a lovely Wellington morning where else would",
          "The zoo was so much fun! I loved the kea keeper talk and getting to see the kiwis! They were so close to us and didn't even care we were there! We spent the whole day at the zoo and had a great time! The sun bear talk was also amazing!",
          "Great Zoo, there is a bit of climbing so not great for the very elderly. Our girls are autistic and we were given free admission as their caregivers which was very generous as we also had our 2 teenagers with us and was going to cost around $120. Staff were lovely and our kids",
          "We visited the zoo on a lovely Monday morning. School was in session so it was not crowded at all. We also purchased passes for the lion encounter. For the price (about $100 NZ), it included our encounter and admission into the zoo. We got a discount in the little shop when",
          "I love this zoo. we spent a good 4 hours here and saw everything. it is so well maintained and so much thought has gone into the design of it, I was very impressed. Shame there was not a bus to your door!! but it was well worth the walk.",
          "Very small zoo, but the animals, design and view of the city make up for it. Make sure to see the chimpanzee exhibt. Loved that I was able to see them so close up - tick off the bucket list. Make sure that you have a slight fitness level as very hilly and steep to get to some",
          "Very good zoo in Wellington, great for families, couples and groups. You can pat cheetahs or stay the night. Recommend for tourists and locals",
          "Great for adults and children alike. Suggest you avoid when a Southerly wind is blowing as can be rather chilling. Take a cut lunch and have a picnic on the lawn.",
          "We bought an annual pass for the zoo, so we go all the time. The kids love running around to see the animals but also enjoy the few play areas dotted around. This zoo has a few big hills to walk up (not so easy pushing a stroller) but there\u2019s plenty to see and do for a",
          "This was our 2nd time at Wellington Zoo. Its a great Zoo with lots to see. Follow the feeding times around to see the most anmials",
          "Wellington Zoo is always evolving. I haven't been in about a year and the changes to the zoo are great. Very educational focused for the kids and they love exploring. This zoo is built on hill so might not be ideal for pushchairs although plenty of them there.",
          "What I like about Wellington Zoo is that the animals obviously come first. And if you have not done a close encounter, then you need to. I have treated my neices/nephews/exchange student to meeting the meercats while my sister and I visited the Lemurs. Absolutely wonderful.",
          "Nice afternoon out and well thought out Zoo. Not too far too walk from Wellington (up hill) or bus, taxi or drive. Make sure you don't go when it is too hot as you won't see much. Feeding time probably best as well.",
          "We visited Wellington zoo yesterday and from the outset, I was so impressed with the lush, perfectly landscaped gardens, the zoo layout and the enclosures. We went during the week (not during school holidays) on a fine winter day and we almost had the zoo to ourselves, although",
          "Had a great time doing the Cheetah, Meerkat and Red Panda experiences here. They're a 'Must do' in Wellington. Geri is an excellent guide/keeper. Thanks to all staff.",
          "A relaxed and interesting place to visit. Kids love it. Quite steep to walk in places. I was interested to watch the vet clinic through a glass wall.",
          "It does not matter how many zoos you would have seen in your lifetime, the Wellington Zoo is a must see. Its a nice cosy small zoo which make the experience wit the animals even more special.",
          "All age people (animal lovers) would love this place. See lot of happy animals and huge range of animals. Visited several times and still keen to visit again.",
          "Wellington Zoo has its exhibits planned out so that the animals feel comfortable using and exhibiting natural behaviours in guest view. Often the animals were seen relaxing and napping in hides or resting areas where they were close to the guest viewing areas - this showed that",
          "Wellington Zoo is a niche zoo, and the main attractions are Giraffes, Cheetahs, Meerkats and Sun-Bear. A great place to wander around, especially with children.",
          "The zoo is always a good day out. Really love how you can watch animals getting a check up or go along to a talk about a certain animal subject.",
          "OH, We were SOOO,,, HAPPY with getting close encounters with the animals at this Zoo. We were blessed to get to have a RED PANDA in our laps, after we got up CLOSE and personal with the male LIONS at this Zoo!! We got to hand feed them, feel them. The staff was superb at",
          "This zoo is one of the best I have seen. You can get right up close with the animals as the zoo has been so well designed it appears as if the animals are roaming around freely.",
          "Take a picnic and relax with the kids. Interactive displays and all the classic animals. Great day out.",
          "I went to the zoo with a 2 + year old boy and twin girls of 8 months. The animals were very interesting and seemed well cared for. The chimpanzees looked less than cheerful and were obviously rather bored with life. There were plenty of play areas and my grandson enjoyed the",
          "I went there yesterday with a bus load of elderly ladies and gents - not a kid among them! We all had a whale of a time. Nice, friendly staff. Fairly small, but lots of variety - we all fell in love with the capybaras! The monkeys are great fun. Two of us went into the kiwi",
          "This is a small zoo but makes up for this by letting you get really close to the animals. There are keepers through out who are very helpful at answering questions or helping you spot the animals. Kangaroos come up to check you out and giraffes come up to the fence to see who",
          "My first time in the zoo ever. I am looking forward to see the kiwi bird but apparently they are hiding. I've got to see my all first time with the animals. They are very organized, with cafes and places to snack. This place is one I will never forget.",
          "Enjoyed our visit to Wellington Zoo. Spent some time watching the vets working in the hospital, a routine checkup with X-rays today - commentary and able to ask any questions throughout. Enclosures appeared suitable for the animals, pleasant surroundings for them and us. Some",
          "I have been to quite a few zoos around the world; this one comes among the top if not the best. Lots of small and cute creature; main attraction was koalas bird and kangaroos. One can touch and feed them too. Make sure you spend quite a bit time there.",
          "If you are in New Zealand it\u2019s a must to visit the Zoo. Lots of cute animals to see. The price is good to enter it. Sometimes they allow you to touch the Koalas sometimes not. Depends on their healthy conditions. You can see also the kangaroos and you can touch and feed them.",
          "This is awesome. We were able to pre purchase our tickets online and put in our community service card/student i.d to get discounted entry. Well worth doing to get the saving. I recommend getting there as the zoo opens, because then you can have the full day joining in on all",
          "Spent a lovely afternoon at the zoo while visiting Wellington. All animals looked very healthy. Easy to walk around the zoo and each exhibit was easy to view. Fascinating to be able to watch the vets working through the glass windows. Very clean and a great environment for all",
          "This was probably the smallest zoo we've ever visited (size wise) but it certainly packed in a lot to see! It didn't feel as though anything major was missing and it was quick to get around. It was cool to see the sun bears, which we didn't even know where there.",
          "Finally made it to the Zoo after living in Wellington for a few years! It's actually quite close to Newtown, so it's so easy to catch a bus up there. We were both pleasantly surprised by how relaxed and \"in nature\" it felt, with spacious enclosures and heaps of animals to see. A",
          "I liked the zoo it was a good location and all. But the half hourly talks were not good all we heard about was the animal and then never saw the animal. We saw some animals really up close which was really cool. I would recommend to anyone who was capable at walking long",
          "The weather was borderline but we decided to risk it. We weren\u2019t disappointed! We were treated to feeding the giraffes (a highlight for 4YO daughter), watching the chimps be fed and seeing a great range of animals. Growing up in Wellington I\u2019ve been many many times but not in",
          "This spot is one of my absolute favorites in NZ! The Wellington Zoo is lovely and worth spending a day just walking around, taking it all in. They have experiences you can purchase, where you spend time with different animals - I surprised my husband got him the Cheetah",
          "The Zoo,wow,what a cool place this is, a disparate range of species and layout. There is a lot of steep hill walking ,but the end results of all climbs never fails to delight. As usual all the big cats were snoring,but the other animals were up and about,except the Tarantula's",
          "Really enjoyed taking our 3 year old here. Heaps of walking including hills. The onsite cafe was fantastically priced (average food). Loads to do for all ages. Gift shop expensive. Entry fee a bit pricey.",
          "A well laid out zoo, the enclosures are of good size for the animals, who all look contented. The staff are informative with their talks and feeding sessions. A pleasant day trip out.",
          "The Zoo has had a re-vamp since I last visited, very pleasurable to walk around and especially liked the information displayed throughout the Zoo. Animals appeared to be well looked after which was pleasing to see",
          "It was fun to watch the otters playing in the water and the giraffes eating just a few feet away and the zoo is spotless and the employees and volunteers were friendly, but we could not find the monkeys and other animals in more than half the enclosures. My son and his family",
          "We spent the best morning experiencing this zoo. They offer a variety of intimate encounter packages, we booked the lion package which offers you the chance to hand feed lions (it's through the cage but you get lion licks on your hand, pretty cool!) The zoo is small so you get",
          "Well kept and happy animals, staff very friendly, nice layout and especially good for children, lots of viewing areas for little people.",
          "Spent a fascinating afternoon here. Often overlooked with Te Pa Pa National Museum right down the road, this place is a local gem. Excellent historical timeline display of the last century in Wellington with dozens of interesting stories. The Wahine shipwreck exhibit was also",
          "Very pleasantly surprised by this little gem! Very helpful staff and great place to catch up on the NZ critters you have not been able to see in the wild! Be warned however that the zoo is situated on a hillside so there is a lot of uphill walking, it\u2019s worth it however!",
          "We came in on a Monday, and there were a few other familys visiting as well. Fair ticket price, and expensive cafes on site. Good dispkay with lots of info. Our young family enjoyed the 2 hours there.",
          "It was a Sunday and didn't have anything planned and I recalled that Wellington has a Zoo. So, I looked a way to go and find out there is a local bus that takes you to the same entrance of the Zoo. After a ride of 25 minutes or less, I arrived at the Wellington Zoo. My first",
          "Had not visited the zoo for some years and it was a very pleasant surprise to see how much the place had changed for the better. Nice cafe at the entrance opposite the gift shop. Some nice shady paths to escape the heat and wind while walking around. Also some excellent views",
          "As a Wellington local I try and visit the zoo at least once a year. I'm always amazed by the improvements they have made in between visits and have a fantastic time every visit. Great selection of animals and lots of interactive education type things. I think it's one of the",
          "Loved how clean and well presented this zoo was! Been to a few around the world and this one is definitely one of the top ones in my book when it comes to how well kept it is. My partner was also very impressed with the vibrancy and life that was in all the signs around the",
          "There is much to do in Wellington, and I believe the zoo is sometimes overlooked. But don't! It is easily accessible via bus and only costs $3.50. The collection is impressive, but none more so than the kea walk through enclosure. Get up close and personal with the world's",
          "Perhaps age has caught up with us but the zoo seems to have lost some of its appeal since our last visit many years ago .The only new feature seems to be Our Neighbourhood which is great for kids . Luckily my old favourite chimp enclosure is still there .Despite the protests of",
          "What a lovely zoo. The animals are gorgeous & kept in such beautiful clean environments. Very hilly but easy to get around. Just need to take it slow. Allow yourself a few hours. Gorgeous view over the city from various parts of the zoo. A gorgeous farm animal area that is great",
          "Come rain or shine, the Zoo is where the fun is at. They have kiwi in the dark house and a new 'Meet the Locals' area where you can walk among the sheep and pigs and chckens. Lots of spots good for photos ops, too, and the cafe inside the Zoo is a godsent when you've done a",
          "Excellent Zoo well worth the visit. We went as a group of adults with no kids and still enjoyed the experience. Animals looked well cared for with large enclosures. Allow at least 1 hours if not longer as takes a while to walk around all the animals",
          "My kids loved the animals being it was there first time but Auckland has more to offer. Great for the kids tho.",
          "A very nice zoo. The animal talks were great and you can see many animals very closely. You can get there easily with the bus.",
          "I\u2019ve been to a few zoos that are much, much bigger but the Wellington Zoo is by far the best, despite its smaller size. What makes it so great is the interactions that are available. You can get much closer to the animals and really appreciate their beauty. They don\u2019t have too",
          "We went went the zoo opened at 9:30am. Highly recommend this as we were there until 1:00pm which surprised both of us! Two adults, no children, thoroughly entertained. Cafe attached is ok, but expensive. Make sure to take in at least one of the \"talk times\" which can be",
          "Clear, big and interesting place I'd never seen before sun bear, giraffe and red panda They are so cute! Would recommend to take a map and visit animals during food time!))) Also we were lucky - we saw kiwi bird Nice to visit with child's",
          "The zoo have almost all the animals into natural habitats not cages. There are 2 interactive areas where you can walk through and touch some 'locals'. Very interesting to be able to look into the Vet hospital as well. Of course the Kiwi house has to be a highlight!",
          "Our daughter enjoyed the trip to the zoo - saw most of the animals (although the tigers preferred to hide out in their enclosures that day no matter how much the keeper called them). Was quite hot so make sure you have sunscreen on, as you have quite a bit of ground to cover to",
          "Most enclosures are good Didn't see the kiwi! In a great part of town Totally recommend the Close Encounters tours",
          "Visited Wellington Zoo on a brilliant Summer's day taking a 23 Bus from the Lambton Quay which stopped right outside the Zoo. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout the visit. Some steep hills to negotiate but otherwise a good walk around. The Zoo is well kept and the",
          "This is a very small zoo. But has a nice set up for the animals. Good place to spend an afternoon with kids. Easy to get to. You can leave the zoo and also go walk around the botanical gardens",
          "This zoo is well laid out with beautiful plantings. A highlight for us was seeing the Tasmanian Devil undergo a health check at The Nest.",
          "There's plenty to like about this zoo, even on a hot, humid day. It's best to get here early, when temps are lower and animals are more active. Doors open at 9:30, but the adjacent Mojo coffee place gets going at 9, so you can enjoy a jolt of caffeine and get a jump-start on the",
          "It was good but we went on a hot day and all the animals were put away so we didn\u2019t get to see the sunbear the nest is cool \ud83d\ude0e",
          "This is the best zoo I've ever been to! I did the red panda encounter with my husband which I highly recommend. The red panda was adorable, sat with us and ate fruit from our hands until he got bored (or we ran out of fruit.) It was really a once in a lifetime experience to be",
          "Have been here before and that went well. But this time it was an extremely hot day and it seemed the animals were also feeling it! Not that it\u2019s the fault of the Zoo, but not much to see this time, so was a bit of a costly waste of time!",
          "an excellent facility clean efficient and well run We really enjoyed the interactive displays and the children loved every minute Thanks Wellington council a credit to you",
          "Enjoy a lovely stroll through the zoo. See the red pandas and the chimpanzees all while listening to the lions roaring loudly from their enclosure. Family fav on a sunny day.",
          "Our family party of 12 all loved our day at the zoo...ranging in age from 18 months to 60 years .The design of the zoo is amazing, with the animals grouped in their countries of origin. To enhance this they have an African village, an Australian area (with some free range",
          "I love the environment. It's a beautiful zoo, lovely to walk through, tidy, attractive, clean, great displays...",
          "We had the absolute best time at the Wellington Zoo. It's very spacious and didn't feel crowded and offered lots of shade for a hot day. A great variety of animals from lemurs to lions to kiwis. The best was the close encounter meerkat experience though! Kerry Anne was a great",
          "We visited the zoo with a two year old. The zoo was well set out with lots of helpful signs and a map was handed to us when we arrived. It was a hot day but we appreciated the plantings around the paths and there were many shady places to sit. We were able to fill our drink",
          "A great little zoo. They run various animal talk through out the day - very informative and enjoyable. Kids totally loved it too! Very educational for them as well. Zoo staff so passionate about their talk & what they do.",
          "We went to to zoo to meet the Red Pandas, we were not disappointed and most of the time was discussing how to smuggle one home! The ranger was fabulous, knowledgeable, and could answer any question. Fabulous day, the rest of the Zoo was wonderfully laid out and easy to get",
          "This is a great zoo with variety of animals including farm animals, local animals, and the \"big\" ones like bears, tigers, and giraffe!",
          "Enclosures were good but most animals were hiding from the summer heat. Cafe way overpriced especially if you are feeding your family. Wellington zoo on a hill so good for fitness.",
          "This is a really beautiful and well kept zoo. They also do a lot for conservation efforts worldwide, so by visiting, you\u2019re supporting conservation efforts for cheetahs, sun bears, lions, and countless other animals. I highly suggest doing one of the close encounters. I\u2019ve done",
          "Loved the keas and the pigs looked very happy. Lots of different animals to look at. You can easily spend many hours here. We took the bus from the centre of town without any difficulty.",
          "Great zoo. Good animals, good size enclosures. Good price for what it is, 24 dollars for adults. My wife and I took our time and spent around 3.5 hours there. Tip, go to the giraffe feeding (you can feed them yourself) at 12 o'clock then the chimpanzee feeding at 12.30.",
          "Up there with other zoos. Pity we didn\u2019t see many animals tho as it was a very hot day and they were taking cover in the heat",
          "We loved out trip to the Wellington Zoo. Well looked after and all of the animals look well cared for. The Kiwi exhibit was a highlight of our tour. We stayed there for over 30 mins watching the kiwi bird wander round so close to us. amazing!",
          "We stayed at the zoo from opening till around 3pm! What a day it was! Definitely the highlight of our trip. The park was clean and tidy. The animal talks were very informative and the animal carers were very passionate about what they do. The animals are amazing, and the range",
          "This is a lovely zoo. The animals are well cared for and appear content. Good variety of animals in very natural and pleasant habitats. Layout is good, some sections are steep/hilly. Cafe is very good. The gift shop is well stocked with quality items and priced reasonably.",
          "A nice well maintained zoo. We got a 2 for 1 entry from the Wellington advent calendar which was great. Favourites were the otters, penguins and kiwis (although no guarantee you will see the kiwis in their dark habitat). Highly recommend you get to the animal talks which are",
          "This zoo has a great pedestrian traffic flow, making it easy to see all of the exhibits while also keeping it from getting congested. There is a decent variety of animals, including those that are native and exotic.",
          "I have been to this zoo many times over the years and seen it develop into one of the best little zoos in the world. It is large enough to offer great variety but small enough to see the whole place in a few hours. The range of animals is great. The enclosures are all modern,",
          "Third visit to zoo just love it we got to feed the giraffes it was fantastic they are such beautiful animals. Recommend this if your ever in Wellington",
          "A really good zoo with conservation at its heart. Lots to see and good way to spend the day with children.",
          "Loved this zoo! Definitely recommend the animal encounters! Such a unique experience, lots of native and exotic animals",
          "Great day out for the family not to good for older people that have mobility troubles as you have a lot of hill climbing. Has lots of good information on the animal and they seem well looked after. I think it is great for the kids lots to see we were there for two hours and",
          "A good small zoo. The animal enclosures are good for the animals and good for viewing. Good information for kids. Only negative is that it is a bit pricey",
          "Cute little zoo, but be warned it is on the side of a hill with a lot of steep paths. We loved the Giraffes the most. The staff were all very friendly. For people like myself who are mobility impaired it would be very handy if they hired out mobility scooters or small golf",
          "Great zoo, very fun for all ages. Educational and informative. Admission is very reasonable. We spend a good few hours their. Keepers are very friendly and are very open for questions.",
          "A very nice zoo not huge but plenty to see. Steep way uphill among the various animal areas and then then same steepness going down ( in a different route).",
          "This is obviously a must do for anyone visiting Wellington, especially if you have a passion for animals or kids. The park is beautiful, big and well laid out. Unfortunately on our visit, most animals were in their caves/nests/habitats - so we didn\u2019t see much of them.",
          "The Zoo is quite small and the animals don\u2019t have very much space. The entrance is quite expensive. Not a must-do.",
          "The Otters we definitely a highlight could have watched them for hours. The neighbours section with the Australian animals was a big surprise, they have emus, and wallabies and kangaroos just wandering about around you, the signs and jokes in this area were very funny and well",
          "OK so it's a zoo and in the city with a wide variety of animals. Reasonably priced and easy to get to, take a bus to Newtown.",
          "Sadly we were disappointed with our visit. Lack.of parking at the very start. Feel we paid $72 for nothing. Poorly kept enclosures and dirty untidy grounds. We hadn't visited for over 15yrs but it has certainly down graded. Would not go back.",
          "Arrived at the zoo ready for fluff, cuteness and big teeth and was pretty much shocked out of that by the entry price. Expectation were high from this point. Firstly....the tiger walked out into its enclosure picked up lunch and hid where nobody could see her...20 sec that",
          "not expensive , a beauty , lot of local animals , the scenery in in the nature , a total natural site .Very interesting and a beauty. Things to know , parking is difficult to find , you may have to turn around for a while . This is a must to see. Do not miss the Australian",
          "Went to the zoo today. First time since I was a kid and first time to Wellington zoo. Was amazed with the experience and the staff were friendly and helpful. Learnt alot about a few animals too. Saw so much and was happy with the adventure around the zoo. I love all the",
          "Our family of four visitors from Christchurch spent a very nice couple of hours here. The tiger was sleepy but the lions and giraffes were more \u2018on show.\u2019 The capybara were a surprise ... like huge guinea pigs! Fairly pricey but a good experience.",
          "The zoo is very nice, decent size. It was very tidy and clean which made the experience better. There's a good range of animals and especially loved the kiwis and sheep! Staff were all very friendly and would definitely go back again.",
          "Nice zoo. Small . More animals please. Friendly staff. Bit of uphill climbing. Places to have picnic.",
          "The zoo has improved a lot since i last went many many years ago. A lot more enclosures and different animals to see. Lots of information. The animals look happy which is good to see. Love the Meerkats, will be back to visit them again",
          "Very nice family friendly zoo. Some parts of the pathways are very hilly, tho we managed very well for a couple in their mid 60s. Zoo is very attractively done with lots of foliage and nice buildings. Did find the price of admission on the high side however. It was a",
          "Well worth a visit. On the plus side there were animals that we do not often see in our local zoos such as chimps and sun bears. Although well laid out, the site is rather hilly and could cause mobility issues for some. The cafes could do with updating. Nevertheless a good day",
          "Love this place and geting gs better and better.seei g the tiger stand up was great to see at feeding g time",
          "Most of the enclosures were empty Very Hilly for older people or people with disabilities Front Caft Staff were miserable, rude and dis interested, Caft inside the Zoo, shocking, Chili I would not touch and not much else",
          "The Zoo is amazing now. So different from when I was growing up. We love to pay a little extra and do the Close Encounters. We have been up close and personal with the Red Pandas, Meerkats and Lemurs. Must book ahead for the experiences. Take good walking shoes for the hills",
          "While the keepers and staff were friendly and helpful we found the zoo it self pretty average and to visitors like ourselves that are of average to below average health and fitness quite daunting seeing as the majority of the zoo is steep and tiring. The price of food is also",
          "This is actually the only pace in New Zealand where I saw Kiwis! Also the rest of the zoo is very nice and enjoyable - not just for children.",
          "Awesome upgrades since we were last here... great experience. Loved watching the apes and chimps and we actually saw the lions up close! Giraffes are georgeous... and even the farm area was worth a visit. The kids area is great, and like how they provide seating under cover for",
          "a prison for animals, the poor things look bored and need more room like a large paddock for the wild cats and giraffes. i was expecting so much more but it is just a zoo. on the plus side the penguins that need less room were well cared for and beautiful little creatures, also",
          "This place is fantastic and i learn/have a new experience every time i go. The staff at the talks are always to give you time for silly questions and getting interaction with the animals. I could probably quite happily spend the entire day just sitting in the kea enclosure. And",
          "We had been recommended to visit Wellington Zoo by friends and were not disappointed. The family entrance fee of $69 we felt was great value for a truly world class attraction. Yes, the zoo is small and doesn't have a vast array of exotic animals but the whole complex is",
          "So much fun! The close encounter experiences are a must, you'd never regret it. You get the feeling here that the staff really care about their work.",
          "Small , Pettit zoo to roam my kids never grow tired of visiting we\u2019ve had family passes for almost ten years and it\u2019s changed so much during that time. Good options have improved and animal encounters are great",
          "Love this little zoo. Great place to fill in a morning or afternoon. Staff are friendly and informative. Most exhibits are very modern and up to date.",
          "I can only liken this to being somewhat of a cross between Willowbank and Orana Park in Christchurch. There were nicely tended grounds, with well laid out pathways. The enclosures for the animals were artfully decorated new the viewing areas and overall it was a pleasant",
          "When in Rome .... or so the saying goes. Another tourist attraction to visit while on our visit to Wellington. I was very worried about the hills - who decided Wellington was where we should go on holiday??? I had heard that the zoo was spread over the hills of Wellington. I",
          "We love Wellington zoo, and the great kid friendly zoo map and signs that empower our kids to find their way around. Our family favourites are the giraffes, chimpanzees, and Australian section. The main cafe at the entrance has great coffee, which is a bonus. We have an annual",
          "I love this Zoo. It's an adventure and well laid out. The giraffes are the highlight and feeding them a privilege I won't forget. Finding the kiwi in the dark is challenging but exciting.",
          "It is a nice zoo with a collection of creatures from New Zealand, Australia, Africa etc. I enjoyed my visit.",
          "Wellington is really interactive and busy...the first Zoo we've been too where the animals are actually awake and also visible not sure if that was due to the time. Parking can be a hassle but if you don't mind walking then there's no problem, enjoyable day at Wellington Zoo",
          "Popped down to make the most of the Winter Wednesday promotion they were running, and hadn't been for years. Clean, and well designed park, with lots of really interesting Animals, Birds and Plants. Great written captions on the enclosures to learn a bit about what you are",
          "I visited this zoo 6 years ago and found it quite depressing. This time however the environment was hugely improved with lots interesting little buildings, signage and things to do. The enclosures were large and some newly updated. The zoo offers several close animal encounters",
          "All the staff were fantastic but especially the lady with purple/blue hair who was absolutely wonderful with her talks about the different animals. Thank you so much.",
          "Grand Kids loved it and (so did grand dad just quietly) Starting to show its age in places but still a nice day out and great company with the family",
          "Gorillas are always my favorite. Lots of walking and I am very unfit but I handled it. Animals appear happy enough and the zoo and cages were very clean and tidy. Good variety of animals.",
          "It was relatively quiet and we were lucky to see the animals up close (behind the safety barriers) especially the tiger that was pacing back and forwards behind the glass just a few inches from our heads - our grandson was really thrilled. This felt very strongly of a well",
          "Wow, I forgot Wellington is all on hills. Felt very sorry for the animals not having flat ground, especially the cheetahs. Food outlets are minimal and not very good. Take food with you. We took the bus from town which was very good.",
          "The animals are clearly well looked after with great sized enclosures but well set up and positioned so that you can see them still from multiple angles/sides of enclosures. We did the Cheetah experience for a belated birthday present and it was amazing. They are just like",
          "What an awesome zoo. Nice and compact (animals had plenty of room tho) and so tidy and thoughtfully displayed. Great for kids; old and young and definitely recommend. Good variety of animals and you can get up and close.",
          "We got to see a kiwi and the spiders were very fascinating to my toddler. Quite hilly, which makes a great workout. Finding parking was a mission.",
          "Every year we visit the Wellington Zoo and always have a lovely time. I have been going there since I was a child and now my son gets to enjoy it too. The layout is easy to access and the variety of animals to see is awesome too. Lots to see and do there and very educational for",
          "This is a great place, we went early morning , but the best time is 11am to 2pm this is feeding time, cheap to get in and great for the kids",
          "This was a very nice place to visit in Wellington. The zoo has some nice enclosures where you can see kea's, little blue penguins, kiwi\u00b4s and lots of other animals. We visited on a weekday, and had most of the zoo to ourself, you can also book encounters with various animals, we",
          "The zoo in Wellington is quite small by international standards but it has a great variety of animals, and is compact enough for people with young families to make it round without complete exhaustion. The dens and displays are well thought out for the animals as well as for",
          "Went on an open day for tigers but found it no different to other days. Welly zoo is looking a bit tired with not a lot of variety in animals. A bit boring for adults. Rather expensive for what you got I thought but lovely setting and views back to the city.",
          "It's a long time since last at the Wellington zoo and what an improvement. Well done, staff. While the tracks are steep in places they are well formed and easy to negotiate with a pushchair or wheelchair and a firm set of arms. In most places the animals and birds are easy to",
          "The Wellington Zoo is small but has a great range of animals that seem well cared for. I'm not sure this is the reason why, but the animals didn't seem to shun away or hate being near people - we got great views of a lion and sun bear. The information provided is really well",
          "My family and I had a great time in this zoo. it is huge and has lots of beautiful animals to see. The children got amazed with kiwis. We had a really good day!",
          "There is a lot to see at Wellington zoo. They have all types of animals and they also have talks during the day to tell you a bit more about the animals. The chimpanzees even decided to do some adult business right in the middle of the talk we had today. It was absolutely",
          "Very exciting encounter with the kiwi birds. If you would like to see one, Wellington Zoo is the place to come. The kiwis are active and come up very close! They also have a variety of wildlife displays and interactive talks about each of the animals at different times. Prices",
          "really good Zoo we saw almost all the animals we looked for . The Zoo is set out well with an easy to follow map and the viewing platforms for the animals mean you can pretty much see them wherever they are",
          "Very enjoyable, even though it was chilly, we all enjoyed our visit to the Zoo. Possibly would be good to have a food station at top end of Zoo, as we did get quite thirsty, but had to wait until we got back down near the botton befire we found a food station.",
          "Miss 9 loves a day out at the zoo. The walk around is pleasant but hilly. The information talks are really informative and aimed at young people with a chance for questions too.",
          "A very well managed small zoo with great exibits and I'm sure the kids will absolutely love it. Reasonably priced entrance fee and some decent eating and watering holes for those sunny days.. if you get one \ud83d\ude0b",
          "After many years of seeing animals as distant specs, often hidden behind dense foliage, it was wonderful to get up close with the critters. Practically head butted a tiger through glass, stroked an emu, and actually saw red pandas playing. (The Hamilton ones seem much more shy).",
          "There were about 32 of us, 21 children ranging from 5-13, several leaders and adults from the River Valley Girl Guiding NZ group. We had the opportunity to look around the zoo at night, sleep over and then revisit in the morning. The lions, monkeys, kiwis, tigers and giraffes",
          "Love this zoo! Everything is so open and well thought out! The animals seem happy and I couldn't believe how close you can get to some of them. The staff are so friendly and all of the zoo keepers are approachable and happy to talk to you about the animals. We took a packed",
          "I joined as a zoo crew member after last time I visited the zoo as membership for a year cheap option if you visit more than twice a year. I went early in the morning and a lot of staff zoo keepers around who were happy to chat give information and very friendly. I prefer to",
          "Our kids love this place. Great walking tracks around and looks of interactive info. The monkeys are the best.",
          "We visit the zoo at least once a year usually with family and grandchildren but you don't need kids to enjoy this well presented zoo. Some of our family would go monthly and always enjoy it.",
          "What a lovely little zoo, not massive but great for a morning out. the weather was beautiful when we went so the animals were all out to be seen, they have a lovely little Kiwi enclosure. Very good informative staff and the whole zoo was clean and tidy, great aussie exhibition",
          "Always like to visit a zoo and Wellington did not disappoint. It's not a big zoo so we only spent 3 hours looking around. The most exciting part for us was The Nest. It's the area where the zoo vets work and there's a big glass room you can sit outside of and what them",
          "I was looking at tge map and noticed the size of the zoo. Which when compared to other zoos is rather small. However the range of animals and things to see could keep an average family busy for the whole day looking at animals. The zoo is well maintained, clean and the animals",
          "One of the nicest little zoos I've been too, with all the friendliest of people that Wellington has to offer. Brilliant keepers who are full of information are never too far away and there are lots of keeper talks on throughout the day. Perhaps the best part of our visit was",
          "I visited this zoo recently with my family which included 2 children, 5 & 8. Driving through Wellington I couldn't but help wonder if we had the right address as the zoo literally seems to spring up out of the suburbs. Such a wonderful zoo. The layout ensures that you are",
          "Spent a pleasant day here, in a lovely setting, and with some excellent talks by the keepers. Not the biggest zoo I have visited, but they do focus on some endangered species and the place is well laid out and attractive.",
          "Clear evidence of conservation through education and facilitation by way of The Nest, an animal hospital that works with other organisations like the Department of Conservation and Zealandia to nurse and release animal populations that have been injured or are sick. The zoo it",
          "Having last been here 12 years ago, I was astounded at the remarkable transformation from a bleak, tired old zoo into a modern, beautiful interactive zoo. The enclosures are so accessible for public viewing and offer environments for animals that are spacious, natural,",
          "A well planned and executed zoo which is also a hospital and sanctuary for New Zealand wildlife. There are red pandas, blue penguins, ostriches, emus, giraffes, a sun bear, a tiger, a porcupine, wallabies, ottters, spiders, lizards and meerkats as well as kiwi, sheep, pigs,",
          "Big zoo with a wide variety of animals, who are well looked after. With friendly staff and nice food, this is a great way to spend the day for the whole family.",
          "My son and I have an annual pass and we visit at least 10 times a year - one of our favourite places. It is quite steep in certain places, so you need good walking shoes, and it would not be appropriate for people who cannot walk long distances or have difficulties in steep",
          "We visited the Zoo during it's open weekend I had a fabulous time there's lots to see and plenty of interesting facts to read. I stood for what seemed ages admiring the baby giraffe and being entertained by the Kia and having to be very quite walking in the dark trying to spot a",
          "From the time we entered the zoo which we caught the numer 23 bus from Cuba Street to, we were impressed with the gift shop there. Something for everyone. Opposite is a cafe if hungry and another like ice-cream shop further around the zoo area. Plenty of picnic spots to have",
          "This is a great family day out. The zoo has changed so much, animals seem to out more than in the past few years and there are some walking/roaming around. Lots of cool stuff for the kids to make their day enjoyable and activities for them to engage in. Entry fee and cafe are",
          "The Wellington Zoo, is located in the city suburbs, is an amazing site.May be Filled with animal species from around the world, the zoo is a great destination for any animal lover \u2013 especially those with children in tow. Make sure you keep your eyes open. I could not enter zoo",
          "We visited the zoo specifically for the red panda encounter, and absolutely loved it! Our host, Bonnie, was so lovely. She made sure we were comfortable, told us what to expect and kindly took lots of photos for us as we were hand-feeding the pandas. She patiently answered our",
          "I love this zoo. There is room for you and for the animals. I like the new enclosures with the Australian animals and the locals the kiwis one. Very child-friendly as everything is at a low level.",
          "We visited the Wellington zoo over queens birthday weekend and were very impressed. It's a very clean tidy and well maintained facility that provides easy access to all animals with sealed paths that are great for buggies and wheel chairs. We found the animals to be very",
          "Our son had fun seeing all sorts of animals and we even had a close encounter with an emu, who just happen to be walking around with tourists. The place wasn't too big so we weren't too exhausted after our visit. We still had time to see other spots.",
          "We came here on the day where it was $2 entry and had a bunch of fun! They have a lovely selection of animals to see and they're all very cute. Unfortunately we arrived at the zoo about 30 minutes from closing time and most of the animals had gone to sleep, but it was still a",
          "As the title eludes to, Wellington zoo is a great place to take the kids. It's was a stunning day, picnic in tow and a great outing seeing all the animals.. while the onsite food was a little expensive it's great food. And if u plan it right watch the surgery at the nest as the",
          "They have completed a big upgrade which is tonnes of fun for the little people. They can build tepees and climb through the bush, the barn with the sheep and bees is interesting and fun to interact with. Easily spend a day up here. We came in about 1230 and managed to see 3",
          "We visited the zoo and had booked a meerkat encounter. An amazing privilege to be able to get up close and personal with these lovely wee animals and have them sit on us. Great staff and good variety of animals. Only negative was he parking or lack of.",
          "We have a yearly zoo pass so we visit quite a lot. Its an amazing place, and all the animals are well looked after. I love the feeding times and talks, you get to know the animals a bit better. Its got a good cafe which do a really tasty punnet of mixed fresh fruit, which I",

          "I loved our visit to Wellington Zoo - such a gem with gorgeous enclosures, great gift shop, happy animals and staff and amazing views of Wellington from all over the zoo. Catch a #10 bus from Burger King on Cuba Street in the Wellington CBD. The bus drops you at the front door",
          "So lovely that you have an encounter where animals and visitors are without barriers and able to interact. However it was disappointing for our children to be told off for very calmly and under our supervision patting the kangaroos. There was no signage to say that they couldn't",
          "Visiting the zoo is an enjoyable way to spend the afternoon. The price is right. The zoo is smaller than some but big enough to wear a person out.",
          "This was a great place to visit I would go there again for sure! The shop was really good and the raccoon I got is so cool.",
          "The wellington zoo is one of the best zoos I've been too and i really appreciated the time they took to show paroa school around some of the zoo, it was amazing I recommend this for small groups of children or adults or all ages",

          "A great little zoo and a tick off my bucket list of seeing all the world's zoos. The only detractor here was the fact that after spending a while in the kiwi house adjusting to the light and finally spotting the kiwi for. split second, a zoo employee entered with someone else",
          "Wellington zoo is the not the best zoo ive been at, but it was quit fun for the class i Especially liked th baboon",
          "Wellington has many animals but be sure to head straight down to kiwis but I won't tell you why or you will hear them roaring at a certain time of day but then if your not interested in them keep climbing up the hill and you'll come face to neck with well you know what.",
          "The wellington zoo is a great place for Adults and children alike to visit and explore the diversity of animals. Although the lack of containment of some of their animals is dangerous. Emus, kangaroos, wallabies did not have a fence around their enclosure and the sign saying not",
          "Not as great as the photos I went the still very good but very good other wise very nice just a suggestion get the meercats going",
          "wellington zoo was awesome because you could see all the animals that you will never see just walking around",
          "This was an amazing zoo with tons of animals. I thought was brilliant that the animals had so much space. It was also cool how in neighbours (Australian animals) that some of the animals such as the emu did not have a cage and were just wandering around. It was the best thing we",
          "Not the best zoo we've been in but unique in its own way. Small enough to do in 3-4 hrs. There were groups of school age children having a zoo day. First time we've seen a capybara, red panda, emu just roaming around as no enclosures for them, Tasmanian devils. Other animals",
          "Wellington zoo is a great place for families and tourists. The animals are very interesting and cute.",

          "Went there with a kid aged 2. She loves the tiger, so the tiger talk at 11am is always a big hit... the animals seems to have enough space to roam around, even tho I would love for them all to have even bigger enclosures. No elephants or rhinos but they have tigers, giraffes,",
          "Hadn't visited the zoo in over 7 years so decided to see what had changed. I was shocked at how much it had changed. Everyone was so well thought out bit the highlight had to be the kiwi enclosure where you walk through \"the middle of the bush\" set up inside with a fenced",
          "this is a beautiful zoo with a chance to see the Tasmania Devils, wallabies, etc. An emu walks around and is very friendly. There is a small shop as well.",
          "A very well laid out zoo with interesting walks amongst the animal cages. Cages well planned so that they are separate areas and not just row upon row of \"supermarket style\" cages. Lots of interesting facts about he animals. A lovely play area for the kids for distraction.",

          "I have seen zoos all around the world and this one is excellent. Great for kids and adults The zoo is not too a big an area to cover. Minimum time needed is an hour but you could easily spend 2,5 hours there. Wonderful coffee shop on site.",

          "What an amazing zoo. We were very lucky to see the red panda and also hear about the tazmania devil. Unfortunately the zoo encounter to cuddle the red panda was booked out along time in advance, but we did get to see one of them. Not as many 'food' places as Auckland Zoo, but",

          "The zoo was very very small. Took us about an hour to get around the whole thing. It was $25 admission for adults to go. In a lot of the enclosures we couldn't see the animals. I was happy that I got to see a bear for the first time. They have a small sun bear. The animal are",
          "We love Wellington Zoo. There are lots of activities and the kids 'farm' area is very good for the kids to interact and have a play on the way around. There are lots of good lunch spots throughout if you bring your own snacks and picnic. The cafe is OK, not much variety but",
          "This must be the world's coolest little zoo in the coolest little capital of the world. We took our grandson to the zoo on Anzac day. Spent about 4 hours here and he loved every minute of it. Got to see the lions, tigers, giraffes, and otters being fed. Loved being able to walk",

          "Wellington zoo is great now with the improvements it's had over the last few years. Have to say though I miss a lot of the animals, why no zebras! And a total lack of bird life now too. It's expensive to get in ($66 for 2 adults and 2 kids). Both cafes are very overpriced and",

          "As someone who has visited quite a few zoos around the world I was impressed with this one. The displays are well spread out and, by and large, the animals had good areas and seemed happy. There were a couple of really excellent areas for getting close up - the kiwi house was",
          "Well maintained and good collection of animals. Some great enclosures like chimps, meerkat , giraffe etc. Lot of families with kids on weekends and public holidays.",
          "I am in love with this zoo. I was expecting to see some unique New Zealand species, but I was very amazed by how close a view you get to see of the animals. I went on a rainy day and it wasn't crowded, and many of the animals will come right up to you, especially the chimps.",
          "We spent 3 and a half hours walking around the zoo. I haven't been there in about 4 years it's changed so much it so awesome you can now actually interact with some animals now it's great. On another note someone needs to definitely do something about the horny emu. Not even",
          "Great zoo, get close up to the animals. Feed the chimpanzees, cuddle a meerkat and come face to face with a tiger. Lots of interaction with the animals here, educational and fun. Highly recommend this attraction.",
          "This is a new review for a place visited before, but with a magnificent new Kea exhibit that highlights these intriguing birds beautifully, and a new area showcasing Australian animals, further review is warranted. This is a fairly compact zoo, but what they do with the space",

          "Great place worth a walk around. It is a great place for the family. Lots to see and you can have some hands on experience!! I really recommend this place if you want to see some NZ wildlife and get up close and personal with some other animals like lions and tigers etc",
          "Wellington zoo is fab and the lion feeding is a must. not only is it a very cool experience, the money payed goes back into conservation projects (probably not all of but some) they are not tame so you really get to understand their importance and power in there own kingdom",
          "This zoo is brilliant! With only a few animals of each species, you get to see how well cared for these animals are unlike a number of zoos I have visited. I loved it! Look out for the one legged kiwi and the one winged blue penguin, animals who wouldn't survive in the wild have",
          "We went to the zoo last week on Saturday. It was really good despite a few animals not being there. We really enjoyed how open the zoo is and how close you can get to some of the animals like the kiwi, the penguins and the meerkat. It seemed a bit run down but that's probably",
          "Generally, I don't find zoos very pleasant to visit, as they are mostly a rather sad sight to behold: the animals are confined and don't look cared for, everything is human-oriented... The Wellington Zoo, however, made me reconsider. It is very well maintained and clearly sets a",
          "Wellington Zoo does a great job within the constraints of of NZ's Biodiversity protection policies and current NZ social attitudes towards zoos and conservation in NZ. An opportunity to see Kiwis and other indigenous birds if you are a bird lover. The mammal collection is",
          "The zoo is not huge, and does require uphill walking. We found it to be certainly worth a visit and glad we spent some our days in Wellington there. There is what we think to be unique in the Kiwi house. It is dark as the kiwis are nocturnal. However if you take time for",
          "My partner and I went here this week and did a close encounter with the cheetah's. It was awesome would highly recommend. Its not everyday you get to pet a cheetah and the zoo look after there animals very well and do a lot of good work with the animals and around the world very",
          "Great zoo to visit for all ages. Very animal friendly all so easily seen and lots of information about the animals. The highlight for me would have to have been The Nest which is a working animal hospital. While we were there 2 vets were operating on a Kea. Although they were",

          "The zoo was awesome, heaps of different animals and lots of information about each one. Saw the talk about the sun bear and she was beautiful and got alot of information about her. Well designed zoo and I recommend you visit if your in Wellington.\u263a",
          "The day we went it was abit rainy and cold, but it was still a really great day out. Mid week was quiet but that may have been because of the rain. Lots of different animals to see and read about. Some of them were hiding out of the rain but most came to say hi.",
          "We got here early so it was very quiet. The talks are well worth the entry fee. We got to feed some sheep and the giraffes. Absolutely brilliant.",
          "This isn't the biggest zoo around but It was worth a visit. There's a good selection of animals and a regular schedule of talks throughout the day at some of the main attractions. The enclosures are fairly large to the point that a couple of the smaller wild cats managed to",
          "This is a great zoo! It is so lively and happy. The staff are great and very knowledgeable. The new New Zealand and Australian sections are great! I have been several times and every time i see nearly if not all the animals!",
          "It's obvious the staff have been well trained in customer service. They all make a effort to say Hello and be friendly. There was plenty of animals to see and feedings to attend. We killed 3 hours here but could've stayed longer.",
          "The new Kea enclosure is amust see. This recent addition to the zoo gives us an up close personal experince of our large gorgeous parrot. Entering through double doors you enter the aviary and just standing still for a few moments you see these guys freely and real close.",
          "Always fun at the zoo. All enclosures are nicely kept with no visible risk. The layout is very good and there are range of animals which are not easy to view when you are in NZ which has almost zero wild animals. Fun times with family and kids. Must do when in Wellington",
          "I love Wellington Zoo - I've been several times and really enjoy going back. Every time they seem to be developing a new area, enhancing the experience. I've done the \"Feed the lions\" experience and am just waiting to do the Red Panda one too. For what you pay, it's great. You",
          "We had a lovely afternoon visiting Wellington zoo, all the animals looked very happy and have lovely enclosures. We especially enjoyed the Neighbours (Australia area) where we could walk through the animals. The zoo also has good various play equipment for the little ones.",
          "Our main attraction in Wellington was to come to the zoo. We were not disappointed, it may not be one of the best zoo's in the world but definitely worth spending a few hours here. I didn't get a chance as I had a toddler in toe but it would be worth getting a one on one",
          "Wellington Zoo is home to different animals.Besides seeing lions,tigers,bears,giraffes and the kiwi of course and also other animals,you can watch vets at work saving native wildlife.Perhaps meet some of the amazing tuataras right up close.",
          "Unfortunately the animals were rare on Sunday. We saw very few. I appreciate that zoo's cost a fortune to run and have to be animal friendly but there is little point going if most of the animals are hidden away. Comparing Auckland entry to Wellington entry Wellington's entry",
          "I found myself here by chance and was lucky enough to go on a guided tour. There's a nice mix of local animal residents and more exotic types. A little bit of narrative from staff is good though - being someone who is a little sceptical about zoos I found it helpful to be able",
          "A very good Zoo. Animals are happy and usually very easy to see. The zoo keepers are very friendly. A few animals are out in the open with us including the kangaroos. A cafe in the main entrance area and a little cafe in the Zoo itself.",
          "If you want a great day out whether it be 2 people or a family then definately head here. We spent 5 hours in here last week and loved it. Great enclosures and lovely habitats for the different species they have there. The chimpanzees were so entertaining. They also do talks",
          "You'll love the setting, the layout, the design, the information, and the variety of animals. The zoo sits in a forested area of Wellington, only 3kms from the city centre and has a wonderful variety of animals. The emu walking around in the Australian setting is a hoot (and I",
          "Lots of animals native and not to New Zealand, wasn't many that we didn't see up close. Saw Kiwis scurrying around in their enclosure, otters swimming in the sun, giraffes, tigers, lions, kangaroos, birds, ostriches, emu, a great day out. As the zoo is on the side of the hill,",
          "It's been over 30 years since my last visit. The Zoo has kept up with the times, with the enclosures more open and natural settings. My timid 2 year old loved petting the docile wallabies and wandering emu",

          "A wild life you can see in front of you here only . Organised and just keeping all the animals well maintained.",
          "I am a great fan of zoos but only when they offer an appropriate environment for their animals. The giraffe enclosure at Wellington zoo is, in my humble opinion, way too small for the number of animals it contains. The tiger, lion and cheetah sections are also too restrictive",
          "As zoo's go Wellington's may not the biggest, it may not be fanciest but it is the coolest little Zoo in the city. It is all hills so walking is mixed with mountaineering but the views over the city are awesome. If your adventurous recommend doing and animal encounter, feed",
          "We went on a terrific sunny day which makes a difference, although the Zoo can be sheltered on a cold southerly. There are a few new enclosures such as the bee and sheep one. this was nice and factual and hands on. I love the zoo design aesthetic. Someone clever is in charge of",

          "This was a well planned zoo with creative displays. We spent the whole day here, going to the keeper talks which were really interesting. My partner and I did the Lemur experience which was amazing and highly recommended!",
          "Loved this place. The animals are well looked after, and protected and rescued. The hi-light was seeing the Kiwis. But amazing variety of animals. Lovely coffee shop. Highly recommend!",
          "It's a smaller zoo, quite hilly so pace yourself, amazing for children and beautifully presented and kept. The enclosures are amazing for small animals but still think larger ones like lion, chimps and giraffe in particular need to frolic freely unrestrained. But saying that,",
          "Great venue for a wedding - loved the location. Blue Carrot catering did a magnificent job of the food and we loved hanging with the animals - especially the giraffes. Well done Wellington Zoo!!",
          "We had half a day before our ferry and decided to visit a zoo in New Zealand. I am very glad we decided to as the zoo was lovely. Really clean and well layed out they really looked like they cared for the animals and their welfare. There wasn't that much parking but once we",

          "Weather was great so was nice to visit the zoo and see the animals with our family. Thought the signage could have been a bit better to direct you through. I know you are given a map but nice when arrows direct you to the best route.",
          "I had a great day out at the zoo amongst all the parents & grandparents, and holiday clubs trying to keep the kids entertained during the holidays (I'm a solo traveler). Being a cooler day there were some animals that didn't want to show their face which was a bit disappointing.",
          "I am not really a fan of animals in captivity but the animals here seem to have great areas to roam around. Some amazing areas to walk where the animals a free to roam around you, kids as well as big kids will love being so close. Be warned the zoo has some nightmarish hills",

          "We visited the zoo on an extremely windy and very overcast day. While there isn't a massive range of animals, there are some interesting exhibits. It was great to see a kiwi and the chimps were entertaining. The staff and volunteers were helpful, enthusiastic and without",
          "We hadn't been here for years. Really enjoyed taking our grandchildren. A lot of hard work has gone into our Zoo. Well worth a visit",
          "An amazing experience feeding 2 very cute and friendly red pandas. Highly recommended chance to get close to incredible animals. Zoo staff were wonderful. Proceeds from tickets go to protecting red pandas environment. Need to book ahead as they only offer 4 spots a day.",
          "Great day to be had at Wellington Zoo, unfortunately we didn't get there early enough to see all the talks on the animals. Could do with doing a couple of talks for each animal throughout the day instead of one. Otherwise a great day out with the kids.",
          "We got lucky with the sunny calm day. My nephews had a hard time pushing my wheel chair haha. But lucky we asked for one. Be ready to walk up well paved hills. But this Zoo is far better then Auckland Zoo. Very much recommended.",
          "Decently priced zoo. Has native kiwi birds and lizards plus animals such as tigers, baboons, monkeys, kangaroos, Lot of animals were sleeping. Found the vet examination at the onsite vet clinic interesting and information. Parking was tricky during school holiday period.Cafe and",
          "What I like about this Zoo is that it is clean, tidy and the animals look well loved. Wellington Zoo is quite a small zoo but enclosures have been upgraded exponentially so it is very aesthetically pleasing to the eye, and easy to see most the animals when they're out and about.",
          "We saw a kiwi bird!! :D It was on our bucket list, and sure enough, we saw 2! Very happy. Spent the rest of the afternoon looking at penguins, monkeys, big cats and all range of amazing animals. :) Great diversity, so many fun and hands on activities for younger kids, awesome",
          "Had a great day at the zoo! Lots of see, was really good! Easily accessible for everyone! Would recommend",
          "Great little zoo for a half day outing. Enjoyed my time there and the animals seem to be well looked after, although I did notice one kiwi that seemed to be under some stress and was pacing compared to the other kiwi I saw. Will be back again with my family.",
          "we had a very good time here. well maintained, very attractive with many programs available to attend. saw kiwi for the first time.",
          "I grew up in Wellington and have been to this zoo many times. However when we visited yesterday, I realised how long ago it was since I have last been! So many things have changed! While there is always sadness associated with change, many of the new exhibits were so much fun",
          "Ok its a bit expensive, but what an awesome zoo. There is lits to see and do, we have managed to spot the Kiwis a few times. Highly recommended this zoo",
          "The Wellington Zoo is a great place, it's like a zoo incorporated in a botanic garden , it's clean and most of the animals look happy. The kiwi inclosure is the best I've seen, you are just 1 meter away from the birds without a windows screen between. There is also a part",
          "We booked the 9am tour and got to see all of the animals enjoy their breakfast. Our guide Bex ensured our tour was full of cats and she did not disappoint. At the end of the tour I sat by the window next to a lioness eating her breakfast, it was amazing! We got to play with the",
          "Wellington Zoo has a nice variety of animals, was particularly excited to see their Caracal as you don't see many of them in zoos. All enclosures were nice and seemed to be well maintained and meet the animals needs (wasn't sure 100% of size but thought the tiger enclosure might",
          "Wasn't too strenuous to walk around like some other zoos in the world are. Wellington Zoo has been nicely upgraded and landscaped over the years. Best attractions are the lions, giraffes, ottos, chimpanzees, and kiwis. And of course, the free bird shows. It was a nice pleasant",
          "Had a great morning seeing all the animals at the zoo. It was great getting to be so up close to the giraffes and learning various facts about the different animals. Wellington zoo is definetly worth a visit.",
          "We caught a bus from the city centre, only $3.50 each way, not to far (as you can tell by the bus fare) freindly and helpful bus drivers and pulls up outside the zoo, I thought it was very reasonable to enter price wise, you can also get a yearly subscription, lovely to see the",
          "I have always loved the Auckland Zoo but this was a full day with so many experiences that kept my boys wanting more till I finally begged them to go home. Every hour we had another interaction with the animals and heard all about each animal. Best day ever.",
          "We visited on a wet and windy day, but had a brilliant time. Had the opportunity to get so close to many animals because the zoo was quiet due to wet weather. Staff were fantastic. Animal talks were informative. Spent over 4 hours here.",
          "Absolutely loved our giraffe encounter during which we were able to help feed these lovely graceful creatures and able to ask questions from the very knowledgeable manager. We enjoyed our entire visit to the zoo but being able to spend this time with the three female giraffes",
          "I was given a Meerkat Encounter as a gift and honestly loved it. The staff were friendly and helpful. Getting up close to the meetkats was amazing, feeding them worms and trying to keep up with them was so much fun. I can't speak for the whole zoo but judging from my experience",
          "My husband, son and daughter visited the zoo before Christmas. They thought it was a pretty natural zoo, a great size to wander in a couple of hours. The enclosures were naturalistic, which is much less stressful for the animals, something that we truly value. Their close",

          "We went to the red panda experience for my birthday and absolutely loved it. The guide was fabulous and being able to feed the red pandas was amazing!",
          "For those with active kids, this zoo is the right size, not too large and a little bit of everything. Kiwi exhibit was perfect. Saw and photographed live kiwi. Even recorded its call. Red pandas were cool too. Can't beat emu in the petting zoo. All the animals appeared",
          "Nice little zoo with a lot of the main species you expect to see in the zoo. The talks are interesting but not a must, apart from maybe the tiger. Makes a great activity for a family day out. Not as many shaded areas as I expected, so bring a hat on hot days!",
          "Along with a great number of beautiful animals, the scenery really takes you out of the day to day life and transports you in the animal kingdom.",
          "No amount of praise is high enough for the Red Panda Close Encounter experience. My teenagers (2) had an amazing time holding and feeding two red panda. The keeper was very warm and generous with her time, information, and ensuring people had great photos on their devices.",
          "Perhaps I have visited too many other zoos locally and internationally, or I am still reflecting on the considerable downsizing of animal varieties that were present some years previously, when I last visited. Whatever, the Wellington Zoo appeared to offer nothing more",
          "Great variety of animals, interesting facts written on signage and zoo well set out. Loved the giraffes - got amazing photos really close up. Monkeys put on quite a show and otters cute as. Looking forward to another visit with maybe more time to spend here. Highly recommend",
          "I love going to the Zoo....not only for myself, but as a parent sharing a wonderful activity with my children. Every time I come to Wellington Zoo, there is always something different to see and interact with. We love it!",
          "We booked to have a personal encounter with cheetahs at $150 per person. I was a little disappointed that the cheetahs were more interested in the keeper than us. And unfortunately I didn't get a look in with them as there was another person with us who was sat nearer to the",
          "I had not been to Wellington zoo. It is not to far from town you can get bus. This zoo is on hillside so need flat walking shoes and water. You can take packed lunch if your that way inclined. What I liked about this zoo as you can get quite close to animals. You also can feed",
          "Took Master Seven and Miss Five on a half day visit, which gave us plenty of time to view all of the enclosures and enjoy a wonder lunch at one of the onsite cafes. Half way through our visit, the heavens opened, but this only added to our experience as most of the shelters were",
          "A very good zoo with excellent choice of animals for all ages. You can also visit the Vet area to see how they look after the animals,Assess by bus or vehicle transport, approx 15-20mins from Wellington city",
          "I last visited Wellington Zoo about 5 years ago and was quite disappointed. Many of the cages were empty and it was looking run down. I decided though to take my niece and nephew a few weeks back and what an improvement. We all really enjoyed it and some great improvements have",
          "We were given a couple of close encounter vouchers - which we were keen to redeem. After discussion we decided to go to the Cheetah's and the Lemurs. Both of which were excellent. My younger daughter and mother in law got 30 minutes in each enclosure. The zoo staff were",

          "This is worth a visit, whether you are a child or adult. The zoo is well maintained and I liked the information signs with the interesting facts. The otters were so cute, with a couple of them working on making their nest - very amusing to watch them move straw and twigs back",
          "This was so special and you got to stand right under them as they came and stood in the cage. Oh what big tongues they have, you see it all as they eat the food out of your hand.",
          "My family and I had an amazing time. Even though we visited while they were experiencing a 1 in 5 year weather event. There were only 1 or 2 other visitors that we noticed at the park so it felt like we had it to ourselves. The animal keepers were great. Very informative and",
          "We have visited the zoo a few times and we find it to be a good day out for the kids. You need 4 Hours or so to get around the zoo and get your moneys worth.",

          "Loved the zoo, it is so well done with lovely, clean and tidy enclosures and very lush and green, everything was immaculate. I was really impressed with the whole place. The farmyard for kids was so bright and and I loved the the Australian Neighbours area. Wellington is",
          "A great family day, or anyone interested in NZ native animals. Don't miss the daily Vet Hospital procedures, you can view the actual operations etc through a huge glass window at the hospital, called The Nest. The keepers do 'talks' at the animal enclosures which are",

          "The Wellington Zoo has had such an amazing transformation over the past 10 years. The Africa section is especially great to visit as the incredibly open and shared enclosures give you the chance to look at a wide variety of African animals all at once. I'm personally not a fan",
          "I am not a zoo person. We often travel to Wellington and each time seek out a new experience. This time we visited the zoo. Travelled by bus which dropped us outside. It is a very interesting zoo, rather small compared to our local zoo, but when there we were able to watch a",
          "This is the best Zoo I have ever been to. The range of animals, the types of enclosure, the staff and especially the encounter options. We did a cheetahs encounter, I can't explain how amazing it was, 3 rangers and us sitting while the cheetahs came in and they chose to come",

          "This zoo has a surprising number of different animals. I'm not sure there is enough space for them all, but they seem happy in their enclosures. Try and go at feeding times as it's much more interesting.",

        "wiki": "Mount Victoria is a prominent hill 196 metres (643 ft) high immediately to the east of central Wellington, New Zealand. About 4 kilometres due south is a spur named Mount Albert and the two are linked by a ridge. Mount Victoria's residential area is on its north-western slopes.\n\n\n== History ==\nMount Victoria's original M\u0101ori name is Tangi Te Keo, though Matairangi is also used. The first name derives from a legend in which two taniwha tried to escape from Wellington Harbour which was then an enclosed lake. One taniwha became stranded and died, and its spirit turned into a bird named Te Keo, which flew to the top of the mountain and mourned (tangi). The second name translates as \"to examine the sky\".It was settled as, at its foot, Wellington's Te Aro filled with commercial activities. Residents needed to be close to the city but wanted more comfortable surroundings. For a long time it was one of Wellington's sources of fresh milk from its dairy farms.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Town belt ===\n\n\n=== Greek community ===\nA strong link was forged between Cretans and New Zealanders during World War II. New Zealanders left behind in the retreat from Crete were hidden from the occupying army by Cretans at great personal danger and they were able to harass occupying forces.  A commemoration of the Battle of Crete is held each year in May.\nLloyd Street which is the site of the Greek community centre and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral was renamed Hania Street after Crete's old capital. Wellington's Olympic Football Club was established by Father Ilias Economou for his parishioners.\nAbout 65 per cent of Greek New Zealanders live in Wellington and in the decades following World War II they were concentrated in Mount Victoria. The greatest concentration is now in Miramar and around half of Greek weddings are now with other New Zealanders.\n\n\n=== Boundaries ===\n\nThe suburb is almost entirely residential with commercial activity along Kent Terrace on its north-western boundary. The houses are on the north-western flank of the ridge above the southern end of the Wellington CBD, Te Aro. Adjoining suburbs are Oriental Bay with Roseneath, Newtown to the south, Te Aro to the west beyond Kent Terrace and Hataitai on the far side of the ridge beyond the town belt.\n\nWaterfrontWhat would seem to be residential Mount Victoria's frontage to the harbour is now technically a one-building-wide strip of Oriental Bay. The houses in Roxburgh, McFarlane, Hawker and Moeller Streets are all in Mount Victoria. The houses below those streets front onto Oriental Parade which is defined as Oriental Bay. The old monastery is in Mount Victoria. Palliser Road is in Roseneath.Wellington College and Government House, official residence of New Zealand's Governor-General, are beyond the southern boundary to the south-east of cricket's Basin Reserve. Beyond Government House is Newtown's Wellington Hospital.\n\nHouses\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Lord of the Rings connection ==\n\nMount Victoria was used twice as a location in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. The very first footage on the project was shot off Alexandra Road on 11 October 1999, called the \"Get off the road\" scene, followed by the \"Escape from the Nazg\u00fbl\" scenes a few hundred metres to the North. Later an old quarry at the top end of Ellice Street was used as the Rohirrim camp at Dunharrow.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary schools ===\nClyde Quay School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of 242 as of March 2020.St Mark's Church School is a co-educational Anglican private primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of 244.\n\n\n=== Secondary schools ===\nWellington College is a boys' state secondary school for Year 9 to 13 students, founded in 1867. It has a roll of 1780 as of March 2020.Wellington East Girls' College is a girls' state secondary school for Year 9 to 13 students, founded in 1925. It has a roll of 1113.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFull Moon Silhouettes The Mount Victoria Lookout during moonrise\nMt Victoria Community Website\nMt Victoria Historical Society",

For photography this is really good as you can stay for a long time and with the changing sun you can keep getting lot of shots. Nice panoramic view of the entire place.",

On a clear day you can see for miles and the best thing is you can drive, cycle, run or walk, oops nearly forgot the bus. Lovely place that overlooks the city.",

          "It was well worth the hike. We tried the southern walkway and lookout walkway to get to the top.  Check the weather condition particularly the wind chill/speed and go when it's sunny. There's also a bus going to the peak or you can drive but I'd recommend hiking as well.",

          "Just an amazing city view. I doubt there is another better view of a capital city anywhere on earth. Popular with \u201ctourists\u201d, but plenty of space to take those obligatory stunning pictures",
          "Part of our tour of the city, coach up then 72 steps to get to the top, fantastic views over the city and the bay. Well worth the effort to get to the top.",
          "The best way to get a panoramic 360 view of Wellington. Free parking. A must if you are in the area. Spectacular views",
          "It is a fair hike up the hillside to get there, or perhaps a bus tour would be a more sedate approach. We drove up being locals and the road is narrow and winding. The views from the top were worth the effort though.",
          "A bird's eye view of Wellington- this is what one can see from here. In most major cities around the world, usually one can see the panoramic view of the city only from a manmade high tower. Not here. Beautiful sights, natural & fresh breezes. Best thing is it's a short drive",
          "360 degrees views of the city. It\u2019s nice to look at the planes landing and departing from the airport. You can get there by car, bus or walking (the way up is steep and lots of steps), and at the top there is some interesting information about the history of Wellington",
          "We were lazy I\u2019m afraid, we drove up the top, most people seem to walk it, apparently 30 minutes from the bottom up, but it was hot afternoon, and we were running out of time, so ashamedly drove, But either way it\u2019s a great way to see the city, and to give you an idea of how the",
          "We visited this place on an afternnon with good clear weather. The view was panaromic as is to be expected from any high point overlooking a city. For us it was a short drive after visiting Museum of NZ Te Papa Tongarewa. It helped that we were able to drive up to the top.",
          "What a fantastic place to see Wellington and it's surroundings, 360\u00b0 views for as far as the eye can see Rewarding views for plenty of pictures",
          "What a view, but to drive up in a car is an Extreme Sport in it\u2019s self, my advice is to take it very slowly.",
          "Best feeling coming up here on foot. The hike was great - not easy and not hard either. I was able to complete the trek up and back in two hours. This is casual walk, multiple stops for photos and just taking my time. It\u2019s a satisfying feeling walking up and a feeling of",
          "What an amazing 360 view from the top.. Get up there. If you dont have a car either walk up there or hitchhike if will for sure be worth it..",
          "We did the walk up early in the morning and it was a great way to start the day with some exercise. The views all around from the top are fantastic. I would imagine it is also spectacular at sunset. A walk up to COS about 15 minutes.",
          "We were on a tour from a cruise ship and came to the top of this mount after parking ( there is parking if you drive your own car or come in public transportation):you can climb about 70 easy steps to the very top viewing area. From here you can get a great 360 degrees viewing",
          "It is a good place for hiking for different people. For family or hiking beginners, just follow the normal trail would be fine. it isn't too hard to walk. you only need about 1 hour to reach the view point to see the city. I won't say the view is stunning but worth to go. If you",
          "Must do activity in Wellington. Beautiful scenery. Easy climb and especially beautiful for sun rise and sun set.",
          "Worth the ride from the waterfront to the lookout over Wellington. Views of the harbour and ranges and valley.",
          "Sublime views of Wellington. It was a beautiful day and the water and coastline looked pristine. We drove up and parked but I\u2019d love to come back and walk up it one day. Steps to the main lookout are easy to navigate and while it was busy when we were there - there was plenty",
          "A pleasant walk from the city which can be made into a traverse using lookout road and returning along the coastline. Takes 1 - 2 hours.",
          "We drove up the windy road to this viewpoint over the city. It is a good place to become familiar with the layout of the city and to also watch planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport. There is also a large sail-shaped multi colored sculpture near the summit that is",
          "We walked up to the lookout from Oriental Pde - via steps and switch back footpaths past beautiful houses and then up steep trails. It was quite the work out. The 360 degrees views are fantastic! Well worth the effort. Go the few extra steps to the Centennial Lookout for",
          "The view is fantastic, but very crowded - and most of them are not interested on the view - just on the selfie-background. Take your time to walk around and use the information tables telling about what you see and the history.",
          "If you get up here, you will not regret it. The view is amazing. Be sure it is a clear day. We drove up, but I suppose if you are willing, you can drive. There are interpretive signs to clue you in on what you are viewing, but frankly it was fun to just look out 360 degrees.",
          "It took 3 tries as the weather was very overcast but the clouds cleared our last day and we were thankful. The view is amazing to say the least. A highlight of our visit to Wellington.",
          "You can drive right to the top of Mount Victoria and there is a ddcent sized car park. A walk up appx 50 steps gets you to the viewing platform. The panoramic view is fantastic. We took some binoculars which helped us pick out The Beehive and the Zealandia boundary fence. There",
          "The last time I checked out here is a rainy very strong windy day, I almost got blowed off the mountain 15 years ago. This time, it\u2019s sunny, great view, hot, and a lot of traffic! We drove to the top front the north side, the road are very tight with many local residential cars",
          "Short walk-15 minutes will take you to the top. Small ascents with amazing views of the top. Highly recommend.",
          "Drove to the top of Mount Victoria - an interesting drive! Great panoramic views from the top including the old radio mast.",
          "Great way to have the view of the wellington. Worth going up. Wind are strong. Stroller and wheelchair not assessable to the top. Spend ard 15mins take some pics and can leave. Unless u really like to stand there enjoy the wind and the view.",
          "We must confess -- we were there to search for where Frodo told the other hobbits to get off the road. And we found it, along with a few other fans who had made this a bit of a pilgrimage destination. The park itself earns the right to call itself Mount Victoria so be prepared",
          "The scene was panoramic and in particular the view of Wellington and the airport was wonderful. A very windy day but well worth the trip",
          "We drove to the top of the mountain, the view over Wellington was outstanding. But it was so windy, but very pleasant. Reasonable parking, was fascinating to watch the planes taking off from the international airport in the distance",
          "Great 360 views of Wellington. Tricky drive up narrow, twisty roads but worth it. Some information given to help you. Can be very windy so be prepared.",
          "Great view of course! Even on a rainy day. 300m downhill to toilet from the lookout and 300m up steep hill back to lookout carpark. Bus no 20 stops at top near lookout, takes 10 Min from Courtenay Place.",
          "Great way to walk off any excessive indulgences. Steep walk to the top but very rewarding 360\u00b0view at the top.",
          "The drive up (and down) is a little nerve wracking with cars parked on narrow streets - but worth the effort. Magnificent views over the city in every direction. Good luck for a windless day!!",
          "We visited as part of a lord of the rings tour. Enjoyed the views and parts where the movies were filmed.",
          "Offering 360 degree views of Wellington City, the inner harbour and cook strait Mt Victoria is a spot I always take visitors to the city. There's good access for cyclists and the area is criss-crossed with walking cycling tracks.",
          "We did the loop track from Marjorie Banks Street, to the summit of Mt Vic and came back out on Oriental Parade. Lovely to be in the bush yet so close to town, plenty to climb and explore enroute. Beautiful views of the city at the top. (Also it\u2019s possible to drive up if you",
          "Great place to see the whole city. The views are spectacular . Hang on to your hat on a windy day and there are many in Wellington.",
          "The only place in Wellington with 360 views of the whole city. The views (on a clear day) are spectacular. If it's cloudy, it's not worth going up. Parking is available at the top and you can usually get a space. There is a large viewing platform and several information boards.",
          "A must visit whilst in Wellington. Great for getting a 360 view of the city and surrounding areas. You can drive quite far up but it's then steps to the main viewing platform.",
          "The road going up is narrow so you have to be careful driving up there but the view from the top is spectacular, so the drive up is worth it.",
          "Worth visiting - great panoramic view and nice gardens to walk through. Nice to walk back down in to town.",
          "Fantastic for taking photos. You can get a great vantage point up here. It is easy to drive to, and easy to walk around.",
          "This area offers great views of Wellington and the area but unfortunately smoke haze reduced visibility. Still worth the visit",
          "There are some awesome views of Wellington to be had, on both the city and Evans Bay sides. Lots of walking tracks to get up there from sea level and good mountain biking too (the world mountain biking champs were held here a few years ago). It is something you should do if you",
          "We went up this viewpoint on New Year\u2019s Eve and it was very pretty. You get 360 views of Wellington and the stories on the information boards are very interesting and informative. We originally went to see the Hobbit hideout but thanks to a map there we found out that it is at a",
          "Fantastic views from here over the city, harbour, airport and surrounding mountains. The best place to get a view of Wellington",
          "Great view of the city and surrounding countryside. The walking paths to the top are one way to go or take the bus or drive.",
          "This is an exceptional lookout and should be experienced. One has a 360 degree view and it is very magnificent, at the top of a mountain.",
          "The 360 degree views from the top are fantastic. We were lucky enough to have a bright, warm day with no wind. Looking down on the city / airport and sea gives a fantastic view.",
          "..the views over Queensland were exceptional and despite not being as high the views here were very good - helped by the very clean air..not over crowded despite our visit on a major holiday..360 degree views of the entire city..",
          "It\u2019s easy to get to, either by car or on foot. The views are great but it\u2019s very windy up there so it\u2019s better to have some warm jacket even on a sunny day.",
          "We walked up to this Mount Victoria lookout and did enjoy the great views of Wellington as well as the 360 degree view of the region. There are many walking tracks in the Park leading to this lookout and they are very worthwhile doing. In fact, we did encounter lots of",
          "If possible, go to Mount Victoria. From here you have a beautiful 360 degree view of the city (the harbor, the center, the sea, the surrounding hills). Walked myself from the center to the top of mount Victoria. A nice walk with a few steep sections. At the top you will be",
          "It's not easy to reach the summit but it worth the efforts. I started from the Oriental bay, on a scenic route, very well signaled. The route itself was also a treat, allowing for beautiful views and an immersion into the city luxuriant vegetation. Getting on the top of the",
          "Be warned, if you're going to do this walk from the harbour it is very steep in places and not all paved. Wear sturdy footwear. That said, the views from the top are well worth the climb when you get there. There are no facilities/shops etc at the top, so you might want to take",
          "On a warm day this was a tough uphill walk but the views from the summit meant that it was worth the effort. There are fine views over the harbour to the city centre and the hills beyond where the Botanic Gardens are located. In the other direction there are fine views past the",
          "This is the best place to see it all from the top of Wellington and worth the hike. Start from the streets at the bottom and follow the path to the top. You will be greeted with 360 degree views of the harbor, downtown and the lush hills that surround the city.",
          "We visiting mount Victoria on a tour from a cruise ship. The views at the top were simply stunning and as an added benefit for us, we also got to see a number of the sites where Lord Of The RIngs was filmed. Well worth googling beforehand if you are a film buff",
          "Spectacular views, 360 degrees almost. Can be windy at times, but well worth a visit. If you can find the time, walk up and down, so you enjoy the old and new architecture of the houses perched on the side of the mountain.",
          "If you want aview of wellington this is the place to come.i was impressed with the fact that someof the houses up here have their own fenicular rails to get them up the steep gradients.also how short the runway is at the airport.really worth coming up but drive carefully.",
          "It is a long confusing trek to the top of Mount Victoria. The streets are clogged with parked cars. In saying it is long and confusing it is well worth the trip for the view of the city and harbour.",
          "We took cable car to top of Mt Victoria. Had very nice coffee at restaurant at top and visited the very cute cable car museum. Free. Then walk through the amazing botanic Gardens where huge trees from many countries around the world are growing to huge heights. Must see if in",
          "You can drive very close to the top so walking up will not be difficult if you have mobility issues. There are only stairs to reach the top though. The view is truly great.",
          "Beautiful vistas over Wellington and Cook Strait. Be prepared for strong cool winds though when you visit even in summer",
          "cold day but great views from above rainy and wet also did short walk of extensive gardens cable cars often",
          "Standing stop Mount Victoria is a memory I will never forget. You get a wonderful view of the city below!",
          "Easy to get to on hop on-hop off bus. A fairly demanding walk otherwise from city centre. Choose good weather as views are spectacular and it gives an appreciation of Wellington in all its sprawling glory.",
          "Dress for a windy experience on top of the mountain. But expect great views of the CBD of Wellington, the harbor, the airport and other areas around the southern tip on North Island. We strongly recommend you bring a jacket with a hood even if the weather at sea level is",
          "Mount Victoria in Wellington offers some spectacular views of the surroundings. A great place to click some nice pics. Certainly would very highly recommend visiting the same to any tourist in Wellington.",
          "On an extremely windy day, most tour participants climbed the steps to the top. Instead, I examined the pyramidal Richard Byrd Memorial (Byrd used New Zealand as a base for his Antarctic expeditions for 27 years). Looking south, you have an unobstructed view to Antarctica",
          "We walked up to the top using the path at the top of Majoribanks street. Easy to follow signs but there are some steep sections. Well worth the claim even on a very windy afternoon. Stunning views.",
          "We drove up there before we got into Wellington. And it was a good idea. From up there you get the big picture. You have an unobstructed 360 degree view of the area, and this puts Wellington on the map.",
          "We rode up on hired bikes. A steep climb, but the views from the 2 look outs at the top were well worth it. The climb was narrow, and tricky for passing traffic, not such an issue on descent as it was easy to keep pace with the car in front.",
          "Mount Victoria is a \"must visit\" when in Wellington. There are a variety of hikes in the local park, ranging from easy to difficult. The views are some of the best on Earth.",
          "A trip to Mt Victoria is a must for a 360 degree view of Wellington. Spectacular day or night, it really is a \u2018must see\u2019 if you are visiting Wellington. Landmarks give an overview of the city for contextual reference.",
          "Beautiful views from Mount Victoria, we had excellent weather and a clear view of our great big cruise ship docked at port. Wellington was a lovely city and will definitely be on our list of places to explore further when we do a drive tour around New Zealand in the future.",
          "Decided to drive up to see the view from the top should have gone yesterday when it was a beautiful still day. Still worth the visit alot of visitors and bus loads. A place to visit if your not from Wellington or if you haven't been up in ages",
          "A must do when in Wellington. Stunning 360 degree views, gives great context to the area. Lots to do too.",
          "Well worth a visit. There are great 360 degree views so I highly recommend making it to the top. Best to use transport to get there!",
          "We loved the walk uphill. It is a medium grade walk to Mt Victoria lookout. The views are totally worth it.",
          "360 degree views of a wonderful harbour and coastline. It was a overcast day and the mist was sitting low but we had a great view despite that.",
          "Once you get to the top a terrific 360 degree view of Wellington, harbor, airport, and maybe South Island on a really clear day. Almost guaranteed to be windy. Public bus does travel to apex but you will still need to walk up another 80 steps to the top. Taxi/Uber is an option",
          "The view is amazing but it was raining , but I could still see lots , the drive up was also amazing I am not one for height and the road is narrow but the view is worth it",
          "A view's a view but it is a pretty spectacular one. It took us two attempts to appreciate as rain and mist scuppered the first one, do a weather check before you set off.",

          "In Wellington over long weekend and had to be a cloudy very windy day the day we went up but enjoyed it and glad we did it.",
          "Mount Victoria view point is pretty accessible. The walk is easy and offer some view point to discover Wellington differently. You can also go there by bike or by car if you prefer.",
          "Amazing to see so much of Wellington and to learn the history. I would visit Mount Victoria again. Breath taking!!",
          "Some views are jut so-so. Not this one On a clear day we felt we could see forever. Each aspect bought something different to view - all with a story from our local host. Not overly crowded and even if it was popular on the day there is still more than enough room to walk",
          "Was a windy day but worth it for the breathtaking views Worth a trip up the hill and the views along the way up to the top",
          "Great view of Wellington although it was windy. But still beautiful views. Saw alot of people running or cycling up even though we were too cold and drove up. Has bathrooms and great spots for a photo",
          "We stopped here to see and take photos. It is lovely and the weather was good. I wish we could have stayed longer.",
          "It's well worth the steep walk up here. The views are fantastic. You can see the airport and the Miramar part of Wellington in addition to Wellington itself. There is a track (half way between the Mount Victoria Lookout & the Radio Tower) that takes you back into the City a",

          "Mt Victoria gives you a good view over the city. The road up is quite steep, narrow and windy, so drive carefully and keep an eye out for other cars, bikes and pedestrians. I would have liked more information boards on what you were actually looking at.",
          "You can see all of Wellington, personal preferred to drive, but you can cycle ,walk or run up. If driving take the Airport side to drive up save yourself the heart attack with the narrow roads.",
          "Drove up here today, great view even though it was a howling gale. A lot of information, couldn\u2019t get my wheelchair up to top so gutted about that but still in awe of the view",
          "Windy Wellington didn\u2019t disappoint when we visited recently with 35-45km winds most days. We caught the hop on hop off bus up to Mt Victoria and hopped off for a few minutes to enjoy the view and take some family photos. Amazing views of Wellington- which is a beautiful city. It",
          "Spectacular views from the top. Tip: go to the lookout to the left, following the street. It has a roof and it\u2019s usually much quieter, with same quality for the views. Amazing to go during night (bring a light of some sort).",

          "This is a must. The 360 degree views are just Amazing and simply are a must do in Wellington. Wasn't even windy !",
          "I love this suburb. Such a quick walk to town, to the beach and to restaurants and bars. The Edwardian villas really make this suburb special. The view from the lookout at the top is the best in the city, and there are walks and mountain bike tracks too.",
          "Well, we went to the top of Mount Victoria, but unfortunately, it was fogged in the morning we went! Wasn't able to see much in the fog, but the drive up the mountain was interesting anyway.",
          "It's a short walk up through the town belt to enjoy wonderful views over Wellington's CBD. You'll find that most visitors will have cheated and driven right up though. ;)",
          "To get a beautiful view of the city, you should definitely walk up Mount Vic and if you don\u2019t want to walk because you\u2019re lazy, you can drive up",
          "Totally worth the walk. Nice running area as well. The view get's prettier by every step you go up and it gives you a whole picture on the harbor and the city.",
          "Mount Victoria affords a 360 degree view of Wellington and with explanation from the guide on the hop-on,hop off bus, we understood how and why the city grew. We were also there in New Zealand's early spring and the flowers and trees were all blooming.",
          "Exceptional 360 degree views across Wellington and, at least for the visitor, well worth doing. You can drive all the way to the top where there is parking or alternatively a great chance for some exercise. Either way, and especially on a clear day, the views are simply",
          "We chose the trail to get to the top. It was a good hike. The view was awesome! Wellington city and harbour at 360 degrees view. Do not forget your camera or mobile phone. There\u2019s a lot of photo opportunity up there. It is also accessible by car if you don\u2019t want to walk. Do not",
          "Worth the scary drive around windy narrow road. Found a better way back down. Fabulous views over Wellington. Note there is a climb up stairs from the car park to the top look out.",
          "Visited Mt Victoria lookout during an excursion from cruise ship stopover. Very windy day could not mar the information on plaques etc as well as the views at different sites around the lookout.",
          "Lovely views. Scary road going up and down, but worth it. Make sure you take your camera. Pick a nice clear day and you will get some great photos.",
          "If I lived in Wellington, I\u2019d come here every day. I thought it was breathtaking , spiritual and incredibly beautiful.",
          "We did the walk up from the city. Lots of locals use this pathway. Thankfully, the day we went was mild and sunny, so it was worth the effort when we arrived at the outlook point. We then walked down via the pathway to Oriental Bay, to have a look around this location, and then",
          "A perfect place to take in the city and it's environment. Very good information boards. A public bus will get you up the hill and a nice walk back to the city centre is an option.",
          "Nice place to visit .360\u00b0 view of the city available from this point. Situated in the heart of the city itself.Watch both cricket stadium, harbor ships sailing.",
          "Great views of Wellington and Wellington airport from the top. Only down side is the coach loads of tourists. Great walk up to the top and going down even better",
          "We walked up from Majoribanks st at courtnay place. A gradual ascent became a steep one once the road ended and the park started. Follow the trail markers to the top. Good walking shoes recommended. Medium fitness required otherwise drive up.",
          "360 degrees of awesome! From the cityscapes of downtown Wellington to the pristine harbor to the bustling airport, you can see everything. I especially enjoyed watching planes buzz up and down the runways, getting larger and larger as they approach the lookout point.",
          "Drive up the narrow windy back roads of Wellington getting a great taste of Wellington living. At the top you\u2019ll have to walk up a few steps to get the best views of Wellington and across the Cook Straits to South Island. If you can\u2019t walk don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll still get a",
          "Ample parking and easy to find this lookout is a must. Great views of the airport and city. We had lovely weather and took some unbelievable pictures.",
          "Loved coming up here just to get such amazing panoramic photos. Do come if you have time and are able to walk up lots of stairs and steep inclines.",
          "My partner and I had been travelling together for more than a month at that point and needed a day apart. I'd also been hoping this trip would help me get some more exercise and lose a few pounds. So what better than walking up Mount Victoria and soaking in the sights? A",
          "It doesn't feel like a trip to Wellington unless I head up here. A great place to orient yourself for first-time visitors, but always offers a lovely view of the city.",
          "Beautiful views day and night. Lots of parking space and I believe busses head up there too. Its windy so make sure to take warm clothes! And if you're driving up, be careful as the roads are VERY narrow and have many peoples cars parked on the side of the road. Bonus on your",
          "Drove to look at the views. Such s beautiful clear day. Awesome views from different directions. Interesting seeing the water/ harbour, airport, and all the interesting buildings and houses. A must see if you visit Wellington",
          "Found the access easy for a vehicle (with a Navman in the dash). Great views and good signs, Easy access on foot to the top from the carpark.",
          "Always magnificent 360 degrees views. Love this place. Good to get out in the fresh air and get some exercise.",
          "This is another place one must visit to have a scenic view of the beauty Wellington. You can see the nature at its best.",
          "We did manage to go up to the lookout on this awful day were unable to see anything will have to look at someones photos to see what we missed.",
          "Took a lazy Saturday morning to hike up. It was about an hour walk up from the Warf at Wellington. There are two trails to go up/down. One that goes straight up from the town by the sign (see pics) and another that you access by going further to the southeast of the town up",
          "From 200 metres up, you can see 360 degrees. Best view of Wellington. Can be very windy. Great if the weather is good.",
          "Excellent view on a clear day. Really easy to get up there via bus or uber or walk if you're keen. Definitely worth the visit",
          "It's a short drive up the hill to Mt Victoria look out. There are a lot of tourists that go there. On a clear sunny day you can get amazing photos of a 360 degree angle from Wellington City to the airport and surrounding suburbs. Definitely worth going to have a look and get",
          "Go by car, bus, motorbike but not on foot or bicycle as the roads are very winding and can be dangerous if unfamiliar. But the result is worth the climb.",
          "It was already a nice and easy drive up to the top (parking spaces available), and the view over Wellington and the nearyby coast is truly worth the drive (or walk) up to the summit.",
          "Incorporated our visit with the walk from Island Bay to Mount Victoria. Viewing platform at the top.",
          "We decided to walk up Mount Victoria from Oriental Bay. This is a very steep climb with lots of steps and to be honest if I had realised that you could get a bus to the top I probably would not have done this walk! I would say that you do need to be moderately fit to do this",
          "We decided to walk up, which took a good 40 minutes and gave us a good work out. Great views from the top",
          "The person at the desk when we collected our hire car suggested this as something to do while in Wellington. The drive up the mountain via some steepish twisty roads was well worth the effort for the fantastic views from the summit.",
          "Mount vic lookout isnt too crowded and its a great view of the city. The best views however, are those where you just go up any hill (remember that Wellington is made of hills) and climb through parks. The views are terrific. The climb up mount vic is a good one! One way to get",
          "We always find visitors appreciate starting from here before exploring Wellington. On a sunny day it is a magical place and so easy to orientate Wellington with its surroundings. I recommend all visitors to begin their visit to Wellington by coming to this observation point and",
          "Mount Victoria in Wellington, New Zealand is a lovely lookout point overlooking the town and port of Wellington. It has very good views from this site.",
          "Not a bad hike if you\u2019re reasonably fit 20-25 mins. Or you can catch rhe no. 20. bus. Incredublr 360 degree views of Wellington.",
          "We climbed Mt. Victoria twice during our visit to Wellington. It is a nice hike for about 30 minutes (moderate difficulty) and the views at the summit are great. We climbed it on a cloudy, windy day and it was awesome. We climbed it on a lovely, clear, sunny day and it was",
          "Super windy, Wayne drove our tour bus and pointed out the funiculars each house uses on the mountain. It also has the scene from LOTR where the Hobbits must hide from the black rider. VERY COOL!",
          "We got a taxi up to the top and then walked back down. It\u2019s pretty steep and you\u2019d want it to be a dry day as it\u2019s basically a mud and gravel track. Well worth it tho. The views are beautiful and the walk back down takes around 20 mins.",
          "If you want a nice walk and relaxing hour or 2 this is for you. I walked from low ground but you can also drive or bus to the main view point. The views as you will see in my pictures are stunning. It\u2019s also a nice walk into city from the high point if you have the energy",
          "We took my brother and sister in law up to the lookout, what a fantastic view of the whole city, it was even better as there was no wind. The lookout is greatly improved with lots of information for you to read.",
          "When in wellington, how can you miss Mount Victoria.Its just few min drive and close to central city area. Good 360 degree city view from the hill. Night visit is also good one for both who want some city light photography as well as those who want to see it. During winter time,",
          "Our panoramic bus trip brought us all here to the lookout point. Mount Victoria is a precious gift from the founding fathers circa 1841 for the purpose of public recreation. It is set in the \"green belt\" up on top of the hill. From here, city and water views are incredible.",
          "Mount Victoria is a mostly natural Forest park. Mount Victoria is 196 meters or 643 feet high and is east of the Wellington city center. It was used twice in Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings Trilogy. A tour to see film locations is highly recommended or you will miss a lot of",
          "This point affords spectacular 360 degree views of the city, accessible by road or cable car. Lovely gardens and restrooms as well.",
          "Incredible view from Mount Victoria. We went with a group, so not sure how you\u2019d get up there, but do it. Great views of Wellington!",
          "Rented ebikes and rode up to the lookout. Great 360 degree views of the city. Harbour all sparkling with sunlight. A must see.",
          "Wow, wonderful panoramic views of Wellington from Mt. Victoria. Our guides, Darryl and Stella were awesome, and explained a lot about historic areas and others of interest",
          "If you want panoramic views of Wellington whilst your there, Mount Victoria is the place to go!! Id recommended getting a taxi to the top as the incline walks are very steep and challenging. But if your able enough, the walks are very nice too!",
          "We walked from our hotel to Mount Victoria. We walked up the Southern walkway from the bottom to the top. It\u2019s a 1.5 mile walk with an 800 foot ascent. The terrain is up and down and the path is both tarmac and natural. It\u2019s not a smooth walk. You need to have a level of",
          "Lovely day with our private tour with utours. This was such a beautiful spot. Clear day and we wondered around taking some spectacular photos",
          "If your looking to see the best views of Wellington in New Zealand, look no further then Mount Victoria .",
          "Easy to find the pathways that lead to Mt Victoria...nicely done council. Its a challenge but worth the view. Great information at the top too.",
          "From my perspective, if you have limited time in Wellington, this is the one thing you must do. As part of our Wellington city bus tour, we visited Mt. Victoria for wonderful views of the harbor & city below. It\u2019s quite windy so hang onto your hats; I almost lost mine! What",
          "A must do. We got there via the hop on hop off bus. Suitable for everyone. Our guy was very knowledgeable about geology",
          "Parked at the carpark on lookout drive, was fairly busy on a Sunday but most people only stayed about 10-20 mins to take a few photos so the turnover was quick if you had to wait for a space. I walked down the road into the woods. Was geeking out big time when I found the spot",
          "A trip to mount Victoria is a must when visiting. The views are 360 degrees and you can see what seems like forever. At the top there are a number of interesting displays. Highly recommend a visit and the drive up is very enjoyable also.",
          "wow the views are amazing ,Wellington is a gem in any weather but on a clear day quite stunning. Mt Vic is a great spot to check some of the vistas out.",
          "Easy drive to the car park at the top or if you are feeling energetic you can park at a variety of car parks on the way up and walk. Is obviously a tourist place so there are coaches and lots of people at peak times but it is lovely up there with lots of walks around the area so",
          "Would recommend the short walk up to the top (you can drive also if you prefer this option but I don\u2019t know if you have to pay for parking). There is a good viewpoint from the top which gives you a view of the city and the sea, in a clear day apparently it can see across to",
          "Wonderful 360 degree views of the whole area, from the airport to the city and beyond. Enjoyed especially on a clear and non windy day our experience was a wonderful introduction to the Wellington area.",
          "Went up here as part of a trip to WESA, omg the views were amazing and our guide on the trip was brill .Thank you Ray.",
          "Go up. Breathe hardly. Sweet much. Get cramps. At end smell fresh pure air. See green and blue. Highly recommend for everyone. Many ways to go there. Bus , taxi walking, bicycle, car.",
          "We walled along steep tracks up to the Mount Victoria summit. Rising 196m above the city, the Mount Victoria Lookout is a Wellington must-do. Head to the lookout and be rewarded with stunning panoramic views of Wellington city and harbour, and beyond.",
          "The views from the top are outstanding and let you see the whole city and harbour in their proper context. The is also a memorial to an antarctic explorer.",
          "This is well worth a trip up to the top. There is a great viewing platform not only giving you a 360view it also has a great view of the airport and the landing strip that has the water at the end of it. A bit of a drive but worth it.",
          "Yes, as a tourist, I get the irony. It was busy. However, the view was still spectacular. Everyone was respectful. We came up Majorbanks St from Wellington. From the top of Majorbanks St, it was not clear to me which way to get up (tip: turn left after coming up the steps).",
          "Called in here on a City Tour, well worth the stop to get a fantastic panoramic view of Wellington, its harbour, airport and its surrounds.",
          "We visited here several times over our visit. It seemed every time we went up there the clouds kept closing in. Often really busy with no enough parking. But still worth it for the views, especially at night. Beware it gets really cold and windy up there",
          "Mount Victoria is well worth the drive to the top for the panoramic views of Wellington. Not overly crowded the day we we went even though it was on a clear warm day.",
          "Great way to see a 360 degree view of Wellington. It was a little windy but the weather was great. You can see how short the runway is too.",
          "Well worth the effort to visit. The views from the top, taking in the whole of Wellington, its harbour and the whole surrounding area, are superb",
          "the Mt victoria look out is for free and you can look in the direction of the city and to the airport, its highly recommendable",
          "Drove to the top of the hill, parked in a no parking zone, but was in the middle of a weekday afternoon. The skies were clear, a beautiful day, and the views from the top were awesome. The best part was it was free.",
          "It is definitely worth climbing the steps to the top, as the views are much better from here. The information boards add a little humour, especially when you read about this very windy city.",
          "Mt Victoria is only a short drive from Central Wellington. The view is magnificent especially on a fine day preferably without wind, which could be a problem in Wellington. Cant think of a better place to get a good overview of this lovely city.",
          "Take some 3-4 hours to enjoy one of the best views of Wellington City from the Wellington Lookaway. It is a very nice treeking from CBD to reach the top of the Mount Victoria.",
          "This is a must visit site. The panorama cannot be equalled from any other point around the city. A great place to begin your tour and gain an appreciation of the history, development and how the land lies. Take your time, the views are breathtaking.",
          "It\u2019s a short drive out of the city and well worth the drive to the top of the hill. It is very windy up at the top so plan appropriately.",
          "Do this walk up to Mount Victoria at sunrise or sunset. Won't disappoint. And, it offers vistas of one of the most beautiful cities in the world.",
          "Great view from the top, very refreshing air and just enjoy quitting walk among beautiful trees. Lots of gardens with colorful flowers. You can get on the top with great cable car, or just walk and enjoy the greenery.",
          "Take your camera, take a friend, take children. (pretty sure you can take your dog too). You can drive most of the way up to Mount Victoria, and then take a few steps up the peak to enjoy the views looking over the bay and Wellington. If you come to Wellington this is a must",
          "amazing 360 degree views of Wellington city, harbour right around to the airport and Cook Strait. Great view of the South Island on a clear day.",
          "It is worth the drive, bus or walk (if fit) up to the lookout. You get a 360 degree view of this wonderful city. From the airport up to Petone, Mt Kaukau and Brooklyn. There are quite a few stairs from the car park but they are manageable. You can get a city bus from",
          "I have been to Wellington maybe a dozen times over the past 5 years but this was the first time I visited Mount Victoria. Incredible panoramic views so close to the city - you can literally walk there from Courtney Place. Definately recommend a visit",
          "Mt. Victoria is not too far from the city. An excellent hike during summer. On a clear day, it will give you the full view of Wellington. If you prefer to bike, it sure is within reach. The guide at the top of Mt Victoria helps give context to what you see.",
          "It's a beautiful hike, fairly easy but rewarding. Once you get on the top, the views are fantastic. One thing I really liked is the playgrounds nearby. They are made from natural wood and look so attractive - I couldn't fight the temptation and actually tried them out.",
          "Had coach drop off for pictures and you get a super view over all the city. Not too crowded and plenty of trails to walk up or down. Road is steep and narrow in places",
          "Friends took us up to Mt Victoria on our final day in Wellington. What an amazing view. I wonder how many other world capitals can be seen in its entirety from one look out spot? Quite a few other tourists were around but the lookout was not uncomfortably busy. If you are in",
          "Have fun when driving up here as there is the steep and narrow road up to the top. There is not enough parking lot provide and also not much shed for summer. Not suit for stay long just a quick photo shoot would be the ideal.",
          "Walking up Mt. Victoria through the forest is a very pleasant short hike. If you happen to take the right track, you can see one of the Lord of the Rings filming locations too! The view from the top is 360 degrees over Wellington and absolutely spectacular. This is why tourist",
          "We were lucky enough to be taken by car up the steep Mount Victoria. Even from the smallish car park there were some steep steps up to the summit, though handrails are provided. We noticed some hardy types bravely walking up the steep pathway without the use of a car. The view",
          "Enjoyed a fairly strenuous walk up to the lookout point. May have felt worse than it was as I had spent an hour in the gym before setting off! Well signed. Came down a different route. Loved the trees and birds so close to the city. Great that this space is protected.",
          "Went up at night and it was great. Lights were amazing. Few steps to climb but worth it. Quite a narrow road to get up there so campervan may want to think twice before going up if your not a confident driver.",
          "There are several ways to get to the look out point. Easiest but still challenging is by car. The road is very narrow and a lot of cars are parked. There are also a couple of tight corners. Easier, but only possible during weekdays is the bus. Leave it to the bus driver to",
          "We went up as part of an excellent Hop On Hop Off bus tour, which I have reported on separately. That is an easy way to do this as it is not otherwise easy to get to I would imagine. The 360 degree view is great and gets you to appreciate the whole of the area around.",
          "We fluked a car park after an interesting tight drive up, but rewarded with a beautiful 360 degree view.",
          "Mount Victoria lookout offers stunning views over Wellington and the harbor on a clear day. It\u2019s definitely windy up there - and can be cooler - so be prepared if you are planning on staying for a little while. There are two small car parks up there, but beware of tour buses",
          "great views of wellington 360' well worth ther trip up there get a pic or 2.. airport, out to sea,stadium, city great lookout...",
          "Caught the 20 bus to mt Victoria for $4 each way. No shade or much seating. Could of been a shorter walk from bus to top. Had to go all the way down driveway the up lots of layers of steps. Not accessible for wheelchairs. Could of been better. Quick visit as next bus coming in",
          "Worth the walk to the top though you can drive up to park and walk to top, to enjoy the spectacular views over Wellington",
          "Unfortunately, it was very cloudy when I climbed up to see the look out. So all I got was clouds. The climb up was great exercise I suggest going through the lookout walkway versus the road route, I would just have to go back again on a clear day to see what I missed. Although",
          "This is a must visit location in Wellington. Suggest doing early to get a good understanding of the overall layout. Great perspective of the whole city.",
          "Once you get here at least the adventure is free but there\u2019s not a lot to do when you get there. However, the views were lovely and there were some great photo opportunities (albeit that it was very windy and hard to hang on to the camera at times). Once you get there it\u2019s only",
          "It was recommended by a New Zealander that we go up Mt. Victoria since the weather was good, and there is a spectacular view at the top. We got a taxi to take us, and were glad we did. I would not want to drive. It is a steep winding road, which is supposed to be two lane, but",
          "My suggestion: start in Newtown and take the Southern Walkway up to Mount Vic; enjoy the pleasant view. Walk down to Oriental Bay for some ice cream. A perfect afternoon!",
          "No trip to Wellington would be complete without a trip up Mt Victoria. The 360 degree views from the top are absolutely spectacular. There are a few stairs to get to the top from the parking lot, but this shouldn\u2019t be too difficult even if you are elderly. My only gripe is the",
          "Views from up here are amazing! We were fortunate to have a nice weather day - if the weather was poor or it was cloudy, this might not be worth the trip. But, on a clear day, this is not to be missed!",
          "This is a must see in Wellington. You can walk or drive to the summit and enjoy 360 degree views of Wellington and the surrounding areas including the airport and runway. It\u2019s free with lots of information boards and plentiful free parking.",
          "You are able to walk up to this viewpoint, but as we were time restricted and with a baby we chose to drive up and make use of the car park. we had to wait a few mins for a space to be available and then walk up quite a few steps, but its a fairly short and easy climb holding a",
          "Whether your a tourist or resident its worth taking in the stunning view a top of Mt Victoria. You can get views over the city and then back towards the airport All intermingled with great walks up and down/around the Mt.",
          "The view is truly amazing. A bit windy but worth the walk to the top & not hard to achieve. Fully concreted with railing. You can admire Wellington from the top in all directions.",
          "a great place to go and its free,can be a bit tricky on a windy day as when it blows in wellington it really blows.",
          "We took a minivan up the winding narrow streets to the top of Mount Victoria and were rewarded with a great view of Wellington and Wellington Airport (yes it\u2019s fun watching the planes land sideways at windy Wellington). It\u2019s a great location to view sunrise and sunset. Not a",
          "this view point is one of the most beautiful spots in Wellington to see everything, on a clear day you can see for mile and miles. it well looked after and is clean and safe. a must see on your trip",
          "We had an amazing clear day no wind when we went up Good pictures taken and stayed for quite a while taking it all in",
          "Great place to experience the wind and whatever other weather is bing dished on the day. Get a great view of harbour and the layout of the greatest little city in the world. Stop reading reviews and get up there.",
          "We were unfortunate with the weather once we had reached the top which marred the views across the bay but welcomed the exercise getting to the top given the amount of time we had spent travelling in the car.",
          "Took a quick drive up Mount Victoria on a clear and sunny day. Amazing view with a nice chilly breeze. The wind turbines in the distance was a nice plus coming from a place where there aren't any. Our driver explained what was where and a brief history of each place which was",
          "Great 360 degree views of the city of Wellington and surrounding areas. Seemed to be a great place to walk/ run humans & dogs as well.",
          "We took half a day tour with Viator where mt Victoria was part of it $42 each for 2.5hours The highest viewing point has 79 steps Windy but view absolutely worth it No wheelchairs",
          "Quick and easy drive from the CBD. You can drive straight up to the top and enjoy the views. Worth a visit",
          "Lots of beautiful trails for hiking to the summit and back, just watch out for mountain bikers. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it on a stormy day, it can get windy up there.",
          "There is a little bit of a climb up the stairs but my Mum who has breathing issues still managed to make it up to the top. There are platforms in between the stairs up to rest & absorb the views until you get to the top. Well worth the visit.",
          "We drove up Mount Victoria, but it took us a while to find the right road leading up. There are limited car park spaces, but the wait if any for the car park space is quick. The wind is quite strong, and it offers a great 360 degree view of Wellington. You can see the",
          "Great place at the top station on the cable car from town centre. Beautiful views. Steps away from the Botanical gardens - well worth a visit.",
          "Took the number 20 bus from Courtney Place to Mount Victoria. The views from the top are breathtaking.",
          "Rode bikes up to the summit; not for the faint hearted but so worth it...recommend perhaps locking bikes at bottom and just walking to the top if you're not that fit or dislike sharing the road with buses...lots of tour coaches head this way and it's narrow",
          "Walked up here on New Year\u2019s Eve. It is quite a steep trek up from Oriental Parade but well worth it when you get to the top. There are panoramic views over Wellington, the bay and the airport. Well worth the trek if you have the time!",
          "We went to Mount Victoria Lookout by cars. There are few parking spaces free of charge but people park by the side of the road too. We saw no 20 bus at the top so if you were to take public transport it should not be a problem. On a clear day it would have been great but with",
          "Climbing to the top of this overlook gives you a wonderful 360 degree view of the city, harbor, airfield, and the other portions of the city of Wellington.",
          "On a clear day you can basically see all of Wellington... we were not this lucky but it was still a stunning view. The perspective of the harbour, city, airport and beyond is really something to be appreciated. Parking is limited but the people seem to turn over pretty quickly",
          "Visited this location on an overcast and windy day but still a great place to get 360 views of Wellington. If you have a car it is a very easy place to get to and for those who want a scenic view of the city this is the place to go.",
          "From the Wellington city seashore, driving the car on a narrow road crossing some of the houses aside we reached the destination. Lot of cars parked on the way... Mount Victoria is a prominent hill 196 metres (643 ft) high immediately to the east of central Wellington, New",
          "It is interesting to get to the top of the Mount and see the city panorama. A winding climb by car, with narrow streets further narrowed by cars parked by residents on the road.",
          "A lovely windy road up there. Sometimes a bit thrill seeking when you drive a minibus around the corners and the locals on the other side of the road know every corner ;) It's a fantastic view from the viewing platform. Overlooking windy Wellington our guests got an amazing",
          "Its a free activity with a great view ALL AROUND. Nice place to sit and chill and have a picnic for sure. Roads are quite narrow so be careful.",
          "Take the municipal bus to the top of Mount Victoria for stunning views of Wellington and the area around it. The bus is very inexpensive especially if you purchase the senior day pass (62 and older) for only $2 NSD. It actually takes two buses to get to the top from city",
          "I recently visited this viewpoint and it was a good experience. The hike up the side of the hill from either side of the city is pretty vigorous (you can also drive or take the bus up). The viewpoint provides great views of Wellington city and the surrounding bays. There are",
          "Our guide, Ray, of Flat Earth, made the most of this visit by gearing it to the weather. It is a spectacular view of the city and surrounds. Not to be missed.",
          "If you don't fancy a steep and winding ascent through Mt Vic/Roseneath via Palliser Road then try the more gentle gradient above the back of Newtown along Alexandra. You won't get the north facing city and harbour views this way - or the thrill of meeting other traffic on",
          "We caught a clear day and the views all round were stunning. We went to the second lookout to see across to Lowry Bay & Eastbourne too.",
          "The road up is tight and might challenge those from North America driving a rental. Terrific 360 viewpoint and a few information plaques. Certainly worth the effort to visit, if weather cooperates.",
          "Not much here (ie no cafes or toilets) but the views were panoramic 360 degrees. Probably not the place for a rainy day visit, but even with clouds we could see plent from harbour to inland. Was easy parking and had some great little tidbits of info to read. If you like a",
          "Great place to get wonderful views of the city and surrounds. Also a great place to stretch your legs and get plenty of exercise",
          "At the top of Mount Victoria, one will get 360 degrees views of Wellington which are unparalleled and the best. I would very highly recommend visiting the top of Mount Victoria to any tourists visiting Wellington. One can get to the viewpoint either by car/bus or even steep",
          "I experienced a perfect Monday morning in early December up here and in the early summer sunshine the views were both sublime and extensive. There was so much of the City which could be clearly seen and photographed!",
          "Took in Mount Victoria during a private tour. Thankfully we had a very calm day and the views across the city and beyond were spectacular.",
          "the top spot of city, offers an amazing view of the city, airport, lake, and more. its great walk from city to the top and any time of the day is good to get there.",
          "We took a trip up to Mount Victoria from the cruise ship and the tour included multiple stops where the movies were actually filmed.",
          "Mt Victoria is very accessible from Wellington cbd. I approached it from a series of quirky laneways and streets passing wooden houses along the way. The views from the top are terrific.",
          "A really nice hike to the top of Mount Victoria where you get a 360 degree look of all of Wellington. It's not a difficult walk at all and you'll be glad you make it to the top. Plus, you get bragging rights!",
          "I was lucky enough to be staying near this hike and did it several times while I was in Wellington. The trail markers made it easy to navigate and the hike was challenging but not impossible and the view from the top made it completely worth it. I did it several times while I",
          "Whether you walk, ride or drive to the top of Mt Victoria, there are impressive views over the City of Wellington as well as across the Airport.",
          "Great views of the city and surrounds. Good and well signposted walks just a short walk from the city. Great for photos.",
          "This gives a wonderful view of the area and is also an interesting drive through the suburbs surrounding the city.",
          "We went up Mount Victoria and a cloudy day and still the views were spectacular. There are some very good information panels at the top.",
          "This is the place to go to get views of Wellington! You can either drive or hike up this mountain. Can see planes land at the airport from the mountain as well",
          "beautiful scenery but it was a hard way to go up the mountain especially in evening. many cars were parked on the road and the road was narrow and steeped with sharp corners.",
          "The day visited this place was extremely windy. We couldn't stand still without holding on to the rails. But this place gives a great view of Wellington. Worth visiting.",
          "We had a great afternoon stroll to the top from the centre of town. We had lunch on our way up, took snaps of the views and giggled at the bumblebees buzzing round the wildflowers. Then, on the way down we treated ourselves to afternoon tea at our favourite peanut butter cafe on",
          "This place is not far away from city central. Accessible by car or coach tour and has a great view from the top platform looking down the city and its harbour.Seeing the skyline will mesmerized you immemsely without doubt.",
          "If you have a car it\u2019s worth a stop in for the view and to take some pictures. It will only take you about 15 minutes. You need to climb 72 stairs to get to the top. There is free parking towards the top near the bottom of the stairs.",
          "Well I struck an amazing day to visit mt Vic lookout. More often than not Wellington doesn't turn on the weather, however today was an absolute stunner. Not a cloud in the sky and hardly a breeze.. hard to believe this was Wellington! And as it's Tui breading season, they were",
          "Lovely place to come and see all of Wellington and beyond. Took our Japanese home stay student up to take some pictures of the city and harbour.",
          "You get a great view from the city up here! Even half way up you can get great views of the harbour. There tends to be quite a few people up here for sunset up it is worth it. Take some fish n chips and have a wee picnic",
          "Whilst the views from Mt Victoria were good, I didn't find them particularly spectacular, although the Antarctica memorial at the top was fascinating and that alone made the climb worthwhile. I walked up and followed the footpath and signs for the 'walking' path.",
          "It\u2019s no ordinary lookout, because you will be looking out in the direction of Antarctica! Yes you read it right. Antarctica. And you stand there imagining when you can do that and what does it take... keep imagining! This place has a car park so very easily accessible by road",
          "Quite a hike to get to the viewing area however the number 20 bus drops off and picks up if you feel like cheating. Great views all around Wellington area on a clear day. Take a windproof as it can be a few degrees cooler up there.",
          "Despite the howling wind and the cold temperatures, the view from the top is stunning. At night it shows Wellington in a gorgeous glow of lights. All the major sites are visible and easy to recognise from the lookout. Watch out for incoming flights to the airport on the drive up.",
          "We went on a blustery night (seems to be the norm in this city) and the view was spectacular. The other travellers in our group were freezing so we had to cut our visit short. I would imagine that a clear day would yield superb viewing.",
          "You can\u2019t go to Wellington and not drive/walk up mount Vic, today was exceptionally windy (flights cancelled) but this just added to the appeal. The views are fantastic and parking was easy (probably helped that it was so windy most would have stayed away).",
          "Great overview of a great city, nice climb up. Need to go on a clear day though. Would recommend to do first",
          "What a nice climb up, not too long about 30m. With lots of spots to stop and catch your breath whilst soaking up the incredible view of Wellington \ud83c\udfd9 A huge expanse of green with lots of space to relax and read a book or have a picnic. A lovely day out \ud83c\udf3f",
          "We didn't hike to the top because we have just arrived in Wellington after a road drive, however the views are phenomenal! It is a bit of a steep hike but worth it. There is also a spot where the shot some scenes for the LOTR so something to check out if you are a fan.",
          "Must do for LOTR fans, walking around in the woods feels very magical and it's easy to find the Hobbit's Hideaway. It's a fairly easy walk to the top and there are some amazing views of Wellington and the surrounding area. There's also a heap of different walks to choose from so",

          "The best way to look around is to get to the highest point! Mount Victoria sits in the middle of Auckland and has a 360 view all around. You can see the orderly houses built in and around the city in contrast to the the eclectic houses built in the hills. The view point has",
          "A great activity to fill in an hour or so on your schedule -- try to go on a clear day as the views are absolutely spectacular. You can see for miles in every direction. If you're a tourist and going by car, please note that the road up to the lookout is quite treacherous.",
          "From the summit you can see all over Wellington. We visited on a clear day and could see for miles. We also visited the Hobbiton Woods area from the Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Rings. Well worth a visit!",
          "Amazing views of the entire wellington city and surrounding seas.. a must go!! Simply amazing on a sunny day or sun rise/set!! Could be romantic should you bring a picnic and wine",
          "It is worth the effort to get up to the Mt Victoria lookout for the 360 degree view of the city of Wellington. Getting there independently is easiest if you go by car. Public transport buses go near, but then you need to walk a fair distance to the lookout (Note: public bus",
          "This is a good place for a view around Wellington. The view is great. You can go day or night. I wouldn't go out of my way for it though. The main point of this place is that it is a vehicle accessible viewpoints. I would only spend about 10 mins here to take some photos and",

          "Breathtaking in many ways, from the walk, because of the wind and of course the amazing 360 degree views. Well worth the effort. The young ones marched on ahead and it burnt off some good energy, building up a strong appetite for lunch. Pick the right day though becaus it\u2019s very",
          "My daily walk takes me to the top of Mt Vic and let me tell you no day is the same. On those rare, still, blue sky days you can see out across all of Wellington it's breath taking. And those more common southerly days you can see the rolling waves of the harbour. If your",
          "The views from the top were nice, even on a cloudy day. The drive up was a bit scary though. Very tight roads, and very twisty. There was plenty of carspots at the top luckily!",
          "Well worth the drive, walk or bike up. Stunning views over this very beautiful city. Best on a fine day with minimal wind.",
          "Good view, especially on a sunny day. 360 degrees view. Over the airport and of all parts and harbor of Wellington. Easy to take an Uber up or walk. The park is big and has several routes to offer!",

          "The hike up Mount Victoria is very easy and takes you along many beautiful Victorian style homes, green fields, and provides some excellent views of Wellington. It's peaceful, lush and very verdant. I would follow the route provided by the Wellington maps which can be found",
          "We decided to drive to the top instead of walking as the weather was not ideal. At the top, even on a bad day, you could see across the city for miles. I imaging the views are wonderful on a clear day.",
          "Great views of Wellington from the top. Though you'll have to dress warm to prepare for the wind. Would be good for people who likes to hike or jog in the trails.",

          "On the day before we headed back to the states, we drove up to Mt. Victoria on the recommendation of someone who lived in Wellington. Since she'd sent us to some amazing places we went and boy were we glad we did. It's quite something to see from that height the beauty of the",
          "Beautiful! You have breathtaking view of the city , port and the bay. A must do in Wellington , together with the drive on Owhiro Parade for beautiful coast line view .",
          "The walk to the top is well worth the effort as the views of Wellington are superb. The tracks could be better marked and if you are safety conscious then don't take the \"Other Tracks\". Another tip for travelers is to make sure you take a very warm coat. The lookout is exposed",
          "On a clear day the view is amazing, you can see everything for miles around and beyond.well worth taking a look at.",

          "A fairly easy climb with super rewarding views at the top. Time it right and see the planes coming into land. Watch the fountain, the boats coming into the harbour and enjoy the sunshine. There are barbecue places at the top too should you wish to have a picnic. These Kiwis",
          "Beautiful view of Wellington and the Harbour. Hike up and down if you are able. It's well worth it!!",

          "Everytime we have friends or family visiting Wellington this is a must do. It is amazing on a good day and you can see a 360 degree view of the whole city. On a cooler or windy day make sure to wrap up warm but it's still worth the trip up.",
          "Views, gardens, bush walk, cafe, museum, playground and lookout old gun installation. This is worth exploring. We caught the cable car up and spent the afternoon exploring. Remember to grab a map because it is easy to get turned around and lost. There is also a space museum",

          "Please take time to go to the Mount Vic. Wether walking up or Ubering it is worth it. The views are spectacular. Sunset or sunrise would be gorgeous. Afterwards walk down through Alexandra park to see the native plant and trees as well as some of the hobbit filming locations.",

          "It is a bit of a steep walk to the lookout at the top of Mount Victoria, but the views are certainly worth it. We walked up a path through the trees instead of walking up the road, and the walk itself was beautiful as well. There is a walk for Lord of the rings fans which takes",
          "So, it\u2019s one of those views you just have to see. But car or walk - that is the question. The answer is try to walk it if you can. We approached from Marjoribanks Road. It\u2019s relatively steep but if you take it steady you get your reward. The woods are dark and mystical",

          "We walked up from Oriental Bay, a tricky route if you don't have good shoes and are fairly fit. Paths are somewhat marked although if you head up hill, you'll get to the top and going down head downhill! Ask locals on the downhill trip so you end up in the right area of town you",

          "If you like a view this is the best and most convenient in town. The walk up is steep but offers much to see. Trail marking leaves much to be desired but it is easy to navigate if you have a basic understanding of the layout of Wellington.",
          "It's well worth a drive (wouldn't even think about hiking up!) to Mount Victoria to see the wonderful views of Wellington and experience the fresh air. Nice photo ops! You do need to climb a staircase to get the best views, but it's worth it. Interesting to see a monument to",
          "Great place to have lunch, we got lunch from the Greek Food Truck and had lunch up here. Good view of the city but would be not so enjoyable on a windy day. Wouldn't pay to do a bus tour up there though.",

          "I love it up here, I used to walk up every weekend, it's hard to find the time now but I do enjoy the views very much. You can see almost all of Wellington",
          "Views from the top. Good place to go for a walk if you don't want to spend money in Wellington, but the views for me weren't not so beautiful.",
          "Great place to go for a spectacular view over Wellington, and the walk down is a fun activity. Need walking shoes though.",
          "It\u2019s a pretty quick walk from the city to get to the summit of Mount Vic. Although it\u2019s steep in places depending on which route you take. The view at the summit is AWESOME. You will see a panoramic view of Wellington, from the airport round to Hutt Valley. Would highly",
          "Me and my husband were in Wellington and wondered where mount Victoria lookout would be any good but it was lovely!! We were above the clouds which was a lovely scene and then once they\u2019d moved a little you could see this wonderful view of the city through the clouds, it was",

          "Mount Victoria will give 360 degree views of the Wellington area. Watch the planes land and take off from the international airport or watch ships come and go. The drive up and back is very interesting with great scenes at every corner.",
          "It can be a little bit of an adventure to get up to, but provides the best vistas of Wellington city. Perfect photo op!",
          "This is a great spot to view all of Wellington on a good day. You can see for miles and on a really cloudless day you can see the South Island. Always take a jacket though as the wind can be cool.",
          "well worth the walk up the steps for the great views & photos - we were lucky it was a nice day but it could be very windy up there!",
          "We went up there on a sunny clear sunday arvo. Absolutely great 360* view over wellington area and the ocean. Water fountain at the top, right next to the carpark. You can also drive up, but I would recommend to park the car next to the harbor and hike up to the top. Takes you",
          "If you want a panoramic view of Wellington make sure you head up to Mount Victoria. You will embrace 360 degrees of Wellington! Definitely a must do!!",

          "Awesome views at Mount Victoria. A little windy but worth the look. A lot of steps to climb. No wheelchair/pram access unfortunately. I have bad hips so i was hurting a little when i got to the top.",
          "Stunning all round views of Wellington from here. Brilliant view but bit windy up here. We went by car.",
          "From the lookout stunning views of Wellington and it is a photographer\u2019s Mecca. Be careful if it is windy. There are steps and a short climb but even the elderly on our tour managed it. Many information boards explain the viewing spots. A good way to get your bearings of the",

          "This is the perfect spot to get a great look at the whole city and the shores and ocean. Great photo location.",
          "I walked up Mt Vic lookout from Oriental Parade. It took about 40 minutes. Parts of the track were quite steep, slippery (due to all the pine needles on the track) and not always clearly sign posted...there are a number of tracks that I think people have created themselves so",
          "From there you will have view of Wellington and others. Also you can visit Lord of Rings locations. Can\u2019t leave the city without visit it",
          "There is an explanation of wind chill up there but we were lucky to be there on a very still, mild morning. We drove up but there were plenty of people who there who had come by foot. The view is excellent and there is also a great tribute looking south towards Antarctica to",
          "We did morning walk from our hotel on oriental bay and went up to the summit. It has panoramic view of the city and harbour. You can also take bus.",
          "We recently visited Mount Victoria lookout, which was one of the inclusions in a Celebrity Solstice cruise ship shore excursion. When we visited, it was very crowded with many busloads of people. However, the views from the top are quite magnificent. There are quite a few",

          "There's views a-plenty in Wellington, but the aspect from Mount Victoria is pretty stunning. On a fine day, or even with changeable weather, it's a lovely spot to stop at.",
          "It's a slog to get there by walking from the harbourside, but it's worth the walk. For others less active, you can drive up there. You are rewarded with panoramic views of Wellington and out towards the Cook Strait. Very definitely one of the things to do at Wellington.",
          "We climbed to the lookout point from the seafront. The views of the city and its surroundings were spectacular.",
          "The viewing area is very crowded with many tour buses visiting. Having said there it is quite a large area and there is space for all, except the people poking selfie sticks in your face, so annoying. Great views with loads of photo opportunities. Essentially you can see all of",
          "We had the best weather, no wind at all and it wasn't too busy. Great views of the city and surrounding areas.",
          "Birds eye view of Wellington with mesmerising views. Would recommend driving right up to the top and parking at the topmost car park to avoid the uphill climb!",
          "First of all, don't try to hike to the top of Mount Victoria right after a 26 hour travel day and four flights from Florida (United States). We tried to hike it after checking into our hotel, but we just could not make it after not getting enough sleep. It was also very hot,",
          "The best place in Wellington to appreciate the size and scale of the city. On a good day the views are stunning, however be warned it can be windy at times. I loved being able to see the ships and planes entering and leaving the city. On a fine weekend day, parking (which is",
          "over all a nice place to view the city and you can almost reach out and touch the planes coming in from the north as they fly inbetween both penninsulars. only a $2 bus ride from oriental bay to a halfway point, walk the rest 20mins. drive from city 10mins, drive from airport",
          "We stopped here as part of our hop-on-hop-off bus tour. Very windy up top, but beautiful views! Tour guide gave great info about the history of the area while pointing out different points of interest that we could see from the top!",
          "Great for all round views of Wellington on a clear day. Accessible by walking up the hill, cycling, car or bus. If you are waiting to pick up someone at the airport you can see their flight come in if you are tracking it then it is about 10 minutes drive to Wellington Airport.",
          "It was a bit of an interesting drive to the top (quite narrow with winding roads) but the views of the city were great! Be prepared though as it can be super windy!",
          "Mount Victoria, although not the highest mountain around Wellington, is easily accessible by road for those individuals who don\u2019t wish to climb the trails to the summit. Great monument at the top to Antarctic explorer and signposts as well if you are interested in history. For",
          "always a beauty weather you walk to the top from MajoriBanks Street or drive up through Roseneath. 360 degree uninterrupted views of all of Wellington and the Hutt Valley. Plenty of room for everyone on the viewing platform. If you walk it is steep and tricky in places so not",
          "My wife and I are both 67, and we managed this hike without too much difficulty. Nice views on the way up and down, and, of course, beautiful once you get to the top. If you're looking to stretch your legs a bit and be handsomely rewarded for your efforts, this is for you.",
          "I was staying in a CBD hotel and had an afternoon up my sleeve, so headed up Mt Victoria. It is a relatively easy walk and well worth the effort. The views are stunning across the harbour and central city. A must do if you have some time to spare. Take your camera of phone with",
          "Steep but relatively short walk up the hill. The view rewards the effort! I totally recommend the walk.",
          "Stretched our legs and walked around taking in the panoramic views of Wellington - we\u2019ll worth the journey up !",
          "Stunningly set city with steep hills coming down to the harbour. This lookout is very worthwhile for a great overview",
          "You can reach Mount Victoria by cutting vertically through the streets - it's a steep & sweaty half hour walk. At the top you are rewarded with great views of Wellington in all directions.",
          "Mt Victoria provides a 360 degree view of Wellington, the harbour and surrounding area. Parking is available nearby.Probably the best view of the area available anywhere.",
          "There are many ways to the top, walk, drive, bus but we actually were very short on time in Wellington and took an Uber to the top, cost around $10 each way otherwise we would have missed out. Parking at the top is fairly limited if you do drive. The views are spectacular but",
          "Definitely a must visit in Wellington. I walked up to the lookout from my hostel in the city centre and it took about 1.5h return. Not a difficult walk, and the views from the top were really rewarding.",
          "Walked from city up hill good workout. Good all round views of Wellington. Luckily clear sky very little wind which seems to be the exception. Can get busy. Also good if you like plane spotting with views of the airport.",
          "If you are bringing visitors in from the airport for their first look at Wellington, take them straight to the Mt Victoria lookout. it is a great view for them to appreciate the coolest little capital in the world. And some nice walking tracks and a great bowling club further",
          "It was a nice breezy, a little cold short 20 minutes hike up to the top for a gorgeous view. But nothing much other than that.",
          "We visited Wellington in early February and made the long walk uphill to the Mount Victoria lookout. The walk takes around an hour from Central Wellington but is well worth it as you are rewarded with some of the best 360 degree views over Wellington. You can drive and park near",
          "A coach stop off on our 50 day tour,which may need more coach parking space as it's a popular visitor spot. Fantastic views all around Wellington from the windy heights.",

          "This was beautiful and best on a nice day - possibly if raining the view wouldn\u2019t be good. The drive up the hill though was a bit tight. I\u2019d advise caution if your not use to narrow driving up a hill.",

          "If you have time, take the drive up to Mount Victoria. On a clear day the views are stunning. There is a map, kindly provided, in part, from The Rotary Club, explaining what you can see. Well worth a trip.",
          "The lookouts provide excellent views over the city and the bay. You can drive or walk up to the summit. Lots of people during peak times. I recommend walking up through the forest trails, where you will see the occasional reference to LoTR sites or even warnings about alien",
          "We went to Mount Victoria as part of an all day tour of Wellington and it was one of the highlights of our tour. It's a beautiful panoramic view of the city and well worth the drive and walk to get the best views. It is pretty windy up there - Windy Wellington!",
          "Great views of Wellington from the top of this lookout. An uphill walk unless you have transportation but worth it. There is also a Lord of the Rings film location close by (where Frodo says to his fellow hobbits \u201cGet off the road\u201d).",

          "The museum was great and the receptionist was lovely. However, a 5 star rating was ruined by a condescending woman on staff who worked in the office near the stairs at the entrance. I was trying to assist an older woman with her umbrella \u2026",
          "Very informative and interesting.  Best way to know about Wellington city. Highly recommended if your visiting the city.",
          "Super kitsch spot with all the quirky facts you never knew you needed to know about Wellington. Great for all ages.",
          "You will see here things you cannot find in Te Papa, the history of New Zealand commerce, Maritime industry, Wellington business history and the like. Visit it you will not be disappointed. \ud83d\ude0e",
          "The smaller cousin of Te Papa museum. We took the kids here and they had a great time running around. The lions in the attic were a big hit and well worth the visit. Lots of interactive things to do for kids.",

          "This is an excellent museum, everything we hoped it would be. A few helpful comments though; we could have done with a few more places to sit. Being elderly, we found that some of the captions were either too high or too low to be able to read everything, but made up for by the informative content.",

The shop and small museum are enjoyable on their own but booking a tour into the back where they have tons of props from their many films and talk to you about the process is truly wonderful. Great first stop on our way up to Hobbiton.",

          "Being able to go back in time and be a child again it's something that all of us should be doing from time to time anyway. I know it's hard! But being here, at the Weta Cave, helped a lot! Thank you guys so much for the amazing experience!",
          "Great guides and a wealth of detail for any movie fan. This is not to be missed. Just did not know how many productions owe Weta so much for their design, production values and CGI. Worth thee12000 mile trip to NZ alone!",
          "We enjoyed seeing the statues, props, and replicas. We also quite enjoyed the shopping. I had no idea some of these things were available. I couldn't help buying The Gates of Argonath diorama. The staff are always friendly here which I can't imagine being difficult. The best thing is that it's free to see.",

          "Awesome experience for anyone who is a movie buff and/or a creative person. Superb work being done in our small country which everyone should know about. Waiting for Avatar 2 guys . \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "The tour did feel a little short, but it is a shop, not a museum. It was amazing to see the actual props and the tools that made them. I would highly recommend anyone with a creative spark visit as it's nothing but inspirational!",
          "Awesome place your was great the guide was outstanding",
          "Excellent tour. Our guide Stephanie was funny, knew the material and was a lot of fun. The props and insights into effects and film were great.",
          "Fantastic tour of Weta Workshop. Amazing to see how long it takes to make the props, and also how the company expanded.",
          "We did the workshop tour, well worth it to see how film props and costumes are designed and made, and the huge amount of effort that goes into creating things by hand. Our guide was friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Even just the \u2026",
          "Awesome tour, 3rd time there. Highly recommended. \nOnly negative point is I felt the movie merchandise for other movies they work on was a bit lacking.",
          "Love love love this 2.5 hr tour. Didn\u2019t know which one to pick but this was the perfect time/length. Sue the driver was so amazing and incredible at driving. And the toot tooting in the tunnel cracked me up. I was so embarrassed but it\u2019s a \u2026",
          "Great to visit even if you have no tour backed, as they have a lot of cool stuff to look at. Must visit if you are Lord of the rings fan",
          "Amazing, nice to see beyond the scenes stuff. The work they do in the studio is marvellous.",
          "Weta workshops was absolutely wonderful. The amount of detail they have gone into creating the movies they have worked on beggars belief and it is all on display. If you visit just one cave in New Zealand make it the Weta cave",
          "The miniature and workshop tour are more than worth it! Loved it",
          "I saw a lot of the movies that used the handcrafts of weta cave. is an art museum from my point of view. I wish I could spend more time looking at the art pieces but the time in some showing rooms is limited",
          "We did the there and back tour, a bit overpriced I think. It was interesting but half the tour a video.",
          "Looking at the models was very cool to a lord of the rings enthusiast but it is boring at some stages of the park. I definitely recommend going to the thunderbird section aswell as the models there are pretty awesome. I also appreciate that they use recycled materials to make some of there bigger models. Overall 4/5",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the Weta Studios tour. I am a film critic and this was an absolute thrill for me - growing up, it was the behind-the-scenes stuff that made me love movies, the magic, craftsmanship and hard work of special effects, props \u2026",
          "Went on a tour of the workshop which was fantastic. Really cool to see all the hard work that goes into making movies. I wish we could have seen more of the artists actively working on their props, but I understand that is a copyright thing.",
          "Well worth a visit! Awesome NZ talent showcased here in the movie industry with worldwide achievements.",
          "If film special effects and enjoying films is your thing then I would highly recommend you go and check out the Weta Workshop.\nI did the full works with the bus pick up from the CBD. Loved it all. I would even consider going again if a different exhibit is on other than the \"Thunderbirds are go\" tour.",
          "As someone who rarely watches movies and hasn\u2019t seen LOTR, I enjoyed this tour. I attended both the Weta Cave Workshop tour and the Miniature Effects Tour for 48 NZD. The workshop tour included lots of information about prop making for \u2026",
          "Had a great day here ! It is a must see for people who like lord of the rings ! The tour was great and the guide told us all about how they make props and about the movies.",
          "Amazing place, seeing the props and models was fascinating, and hearing how they were made was really interesting. Recommended!",
          "Heaps of really interesting stuff to see but it's quite the tourist spot so you don't get a great chance to really look on the tour. You're constantly being moved into the next section. It's worth a visit but be aware it's not really a place to browse and take a good look at the props etc.",
          "Just did one part of the studio but it was so interesting and amazing to see the ancestor of miniature studios !",
          "Very cool and highly reccomended. Our tour guide was full of fun facts about all the items on display. Lots of very interesting pieces of movie memorabilia.",
          "The Weta Cave itself is nothing more than a big store with small area with some.models to look at, I wouldn't recommend unless you were doing a tour. \n\nTo get the best out of it you need to book a tour we did the Weta Workshop  and the Thunderbirds tours they were both great.",
          "Absolutely the best place, ever. We paid for the lowest price tour but I would definitely recommend trying to spend as much time there as possible. Great gift shop too. A lot more than LOTR and Hobbit on the tour",
          "We went on the behind the scenes tour and really enjoyed it. Very informative and held your interest.",
          "It need to buy the ticket if you want to experience what they are doing.  However, if you just want to take a look around the shop, experience the mini museum in the shop or take some pictures outside, it's free. Also, there has free parking just at the side of the building.",
          "It was a fantastic experience. One that we would repeat again Ext time we are in Wellington. Highly recommended the staff are very knowledgeable and friendly.",
          "Great experience to see the \"behind the scenes\" workings of some great movies. Our guide was so informative and kept our group engaged with facts and cool stuff the whole time. Do the combo and see the thunderbirds tour it was really cool!",
          "Fantastic experience, even if you aren't a complete Peter Jackson / LOTR geek. \n\nWe bought the \"There and back inc lunch\" tour and had a complete blast.  The driver (Craig) was a great was informative and generally a really nice guy and out \u2026",
          "The Cave itself is pretty small, but if you are a fan or someone aspiring to work in the industry, it is worth it to do the tours. You will learn alot and the tour guides are industry professionals who can answer all your questions.",
          "Amazing behind the scenes tour. The Weta Workshop and model your are both worth a trip. From Lord of the Rings to the Thunderbirds remake they've been involved in more than you realise. Just out of this world",
          "An amazing look at the magic behind so many loved movies. Well worth the tours.",
          "An absolute MUST for film fans, cinematography fans, or just fans of Lord of the Rings/anything Weta related in general. We did the extended tour and can't recommend enough! Our tour guide (so sorry we missed your name:( but he was from \u2026",
          "Recommend visiting here to see some props which were used in movies! There is also a free video you can watch about the history of Weta Workshop and Weta Digital which is fascinating. It\u2019s rather amazing how big the company has grown and how successful it has become after starting off in little old Wellington!",
          "Really interesting tours, also very cool seeing the actual props from movies! Will be back for another tour soon",
          "Small unassuming building on the corner of what could be any street is the jewel of Weta studios \"The Weta Cave\".  Always popular with tourists and locals alike.  Worth a look you will no doubt be surprised by what's inside.  Entry is made \u2026",
          "It's a must see. Better than expected. Didn't realise how many projects they are working on currently, and what they have been involved in over the years. A great insight into the process.",
          "If you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies or just interested in the whole process of modern movie making - this is a must. Fun and informative from start to finish - it's worth taking the longer tour if you have time.",
          "It was the best, very interesting and the staff there are so helpful which made my experience even better - just need to have patience finding a car park",
          "Great tour and especially tour guide (man from Hawaii sorry forgot your name :( ) learnt so much about all different techniques and history and all explained with passion. Also loved learning about the tinfoil modelling technique at the end",
          "Great. Brilliant tour guide. Lots of street parking. Limited toilets",
          "If you are a fans of LOTR, Avatar, etc, you have to come here and join the tour which will show you how the weta studio creates the props for the movie. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to join the tour, you can also stop by for couple of photos with the trolls and souvenirs shop. \n\nPs. There\u2019re 3 trolls in total. Try to spot the other 2!",
          "Great that I could take the kids to at least see some weta stuff for free! I particularly loved the video",
          "What an absolutely amazing place! You get to see where the costumes, props, creatures, special effects make up and digital effects of some great movies from the last two decades were made eg Lord of the Rings, Hobbit, King Kong, Avatar, \u2026",
          "Fantastic experience. If you like films and special effects this is a must visit place",
          "The gift shop and free documentary are definitely worth a visit to the Cave, but the Weta Tour and Thunderbirds Tour are 100% a must-do if you're into movies or model-making or anything vaguely related. So interesting!",
          "For a shop it was very interesting indeed.",
          "So worth it going here, it was very fascinating seeing a bunch of movie props (lots of lots of the rings props) and how they were made. Way more time and effort goes into making the props we take for granted while watching a movie. Another \u2026",
          "Amazing and the staff was fantastic. Thanks for accommodating our big group",
          "A great place to get an understanding of Weta's body of work. The mini museum is inspired.",
          "Had a fabulous  time, our tour guide Reece was great, very knowledgeable,funny and passionate about what he does  highly recommend this experience.",
          "This is a must visit place when you are visiting Wellington. You will come to know how creative and top class people are working behind all those out of the world movies we are watching from last 35+ years. When you know the story and see \u2026",
          "Absolute must see, even for those who aren't LoTR fans.",
          "The tours were all fully booked when we came, so we just take pictures with the life-sized sculptures and looking at Weta Cave shops and wander through the mini-museum which are all interesting!",
          "Informative tour with a hands-on look , touch and feel of some of the amazing creations.  Well worth a visit.",
          "You have to stand long time and listen to a very boring tour person! The rooms are tight and groups are big. It is not worth to go!",
          "Awesome tour and LOTR props! The dual combo tour is worth your time and money!",
          "Very nice behind the scenes. Wish you could take more photos and more free roaming.",
          "Amazing history of special effects, armor, weapons, and really cool stuff.",
          "Having been to Hobbiton, it was a must see to go to Weta cave. We booked up two tours, the first to see the props for the making of the Hobbit films. Unfortunately no filming is allowed in the area. The story and production was really \u2026",
          "A nice little souvenir shop, although the souvenirs I wanted cost more then I was presently ready to pay.\nHowever I had the guided tour, which was really great, the tour guide was excellent, great that is actually someone working with the suff doing the tour.",
          "If you love movies you'll be enchanted and inspired by the Weta Cave. We took the combo tour and enjoyed every second of it.",
          "A must do when visiting Wellington.   I have to say,  I though the tour would be a little longer but was fascinating all the same.  Amazing stuff here. I would love a bunch of it at home.",
          "The WETA cave is beyond our wildest imagination and expectation! Being the LOTR and Hobbit movie trilogy freak, it is simply not to be missed. Staff we met on the guided tour and the sales at the shop, especially a tall pretty lady and Rex are so friendly and helpful which makes the trip even more extraordinary.",
          "Absolutely amazing to see how they make the movies we all love, an absolute must see!",
          "Very nice the combo tour and our guide Kevin was the best we\u2019ve had so far. Thank you",
          "Hmm I don\u2019t know what to say about it... I think I was expecting more... I mean... probably it\u2019s just a little shop to sell tickets for their tours... that are not expensive... we didn\u2019t do any because we didn\u2019t have the time. There was not \u2026",
          "This is the start of the journey of discovery. For all movie buffs and dreamers. Then we went on the tours. It was a nice 2 hours of fantasy.",
          "Very nice place. You can see figures if The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and other movies of the studio.",
          "Did the combo tour.  In the Workshop, see a few props and costumes and hear how some physical effects are made and used (cannot touch or photo/video majority of the displays), spend a few minutes touching non-studio pieces, and if lucky see \u2026",
          "Highly recommend! Great if you're interested in movies and movie making.",
          "If you enjoy any of the movies they've been a part of, you'll enjoy the tour. Really enjoyed seeing their blacksmith at work as well as movie-used props.",
          "Came up from Christchurch for the day to do one of the creative workshops. The girls loved it and the scars they constructed were so realistic that I didn't want to look at them, let alone photograph them! Would love to do more workshops \u2026",
          "Great tour but don't bother with the Combo unless you're a huge Thunderbirds fan.",
          "If you're a movie fan you need to visit & do the tours. Interesting & enjoyable",

          "What can you say. The place & people responsible for all the props in LOTR & Hobbit movies. Great place to visit.",
          "Omg i love this. We bought a combo tour and it is worth it. Their artwork is pretty amazing. It is not just 'lord of the ring' fan but you should see their artwork with your own eyes then you will know what i mean.",

          "This place is amazing.  Don't forget to look at the halo warthog",
          "We especially loved the big trolls outside to take photos with. There was a great range of things on display inside which you can see for free in their museum. They also had tours which you could pay for to view the workshops. The shop also had insignia for sale, including models, pins, posters etc.",
          "Excellent attraction brilliant commentary from gracious knowledgeable guide .",
          "Amazing insight to the Weta Workshop for close ups of the many props, costumes and more!! And Weta Digital for the visual effects. Well worth doing the popular combo tour which included seeing Thunderbirds Are Go. Just loved the old \u2026",
          "Parking is difficult. On  a corner so cars everywhere. Tourists buses also.. We parked 5 blocks and walked. To be expected with such a large number of people going there too. We didn't buy anything. It was good to visit but didn't think we need to go back.",
          "Very cool place to see studio production work",
          "Has all the souvenirs you could want from the movies, and a tour of the workshop.\nDon't forget to get a free selfie with the trolls outside, and the staff are really helpful.\nHandy to the #18 & #18e bus terminus.\nMost popular item is the one ring.",

          "Awesome experience to learn about movie making. There is of course a bit emphasis on Lord of the Rings, but the tours also highlight other films which Weta worked on. The tours are fun and interactive. It's most interesting having the \u2026",
          "Great fun to see this iconic movie production location!",
          "Awesome place to visit for those keen to find out what goes into making those movies and TV series. Make sure you book in advance if you want to go on one of the tours. The shorter movie intro to Weta you often don't have to book for.",
          "We had a fabulous experience at the cave, however, we found everything very expensive, the merchandise is very expensive and to get any memorabilia pinches the pocket. A must visit, I would highly recommend anyone in the vicinity to visit.",
          "You will learn that simple thing can become great ,if your mind is creative.",
          "These guys get all the attention for their work on LOTR, which was awesome, but I was so surprised to find out on the tour that their work goes back way further. \nFrom making a single prop for a movie, to making full on sets at various \u2026",

          "Awesome, we all enjoyed it, the craftsmanship excellent!!!",
          "Got a tour from Isaac. He was so knowledgeable about the SFX and VFX industry as well as the film industry itself. Weta was amazing and highly recommend a visit.",
          "We did the weta tour. It was pretty short but amazing. It's a little details around how they make the costumes and gears.",
          "Didn't know about the history and WETA. Great place to learn about how to make movie sets and stuffs. Interesting.",
          "It was OK, but it could be bigger & better, it's a major part in the entertainment industry and its going to get bigger.. my expectation of the Weta Cave was high but it fell below expectations, it was small, tight and only i number of \u2026",

          "So, there are many types of tours here, you can match it with your available time. Props and authentic gears from your favorite movies are here to see and awe. No pictures allowed to be taken along the tour, except (spoiler) at the end of the tour you can take a picture of this gandalf and orc from lotr.",
          "I love Lord of the Rings. This was a definite place to visit when I came to Wellington. I'm a little sad that I was only able to see one troll. But the rest of it was awesome. I bought my gold-plated tungsten version of the One Ring here. \u2026",
          "Rather small location,  mainly selling LOTR products. Nice.",

          "I love some Weta films and was very excited to do the workshop tour. You don't actually see the workshop, just a guided tour of a museum within the workshop showing stuff they've made and the process of making them. It's good, but not what I expected. They do make amazing stuff but it's not really a workshop tour.",
          "Very interesting place!",
          "We debated if we should do this or not and we\u2019re so glad we did. It was fantastic and we loved it. So interesting and fun to see how the magic is made. Don\u2019t climb on the trolls out front (unless you want an awesome photo!!)",

          "Loads to see here! The cave is a free entry mini museum with film props and costumes. Theres loads of collectibles and souvenirs to buy too. I did both the paid tours too which I thought were awesome! As a creative person I got a lot out of the few hours I spent here. Defo worth a visit!",

          "Love it.",
          "Weta people are soooo creative, never thought the foil paper can be part of the concrete sculpture, they are amazing. Also, the tour guide loves to interpret how do they design and make each part of module. I touched fake nose, its so real, exactly the same as human body.",
          "The famous Weta Cave.\nThere are certainly some wonderful sights to behold here, and the tour offers a great insight into what is done behind-the-scenes.\n\nThe tour however, is quite short, and doesn't offer a REAL lot of variety.\nYou're \u2026",

          "Great place to tour!",
          "Great place",
          "Weta Cave brings into reality the visions we've seen on the screen. Descriptions were vivid. We were able to view and touch many props. We were able to see three craftsman working on current projects. Staff and craftsmen were knowledgeable and answered all our questions.",
          "Really like the renovation & the one way system. Our guests learn a lot about the industry from the free video film. We go just after 9am to avoid the rush of tourists. Be warned - parking is usually scarce so take the bus if you are visiting in the middle of the day",
          "Good to go",
          "Thoroughly recommend the paid tour of the workshop, the \"cave\" is OK for a 30 min peruse but quite small and very busy, some props but mostly souvenirs. Tours are run by staff of the workshop who are very knowledgeable and passionate. Cool \u2026",

          "Super friendly team here and great fun.",
          "Amazing props",
          "Learned some interesting things, but I thought the tour was pretty short and the area compact. I was hoping to see larger models and a whole bunch of different movie miniatures like from blade runner, but that wasn\u2019t the case. Still interesting but I wish there was more.",
          "Very impressive!",
          "Richard and Tanya Taylor have achieved some magic here - all with raw talent. If you're in the Wellington area - this is one place you should definitely take some time to see. You will be amazed at the modesty and enormity of what these amazing people have done... Highly recommended.",

          "The place took me into the story.",
          "Just did the free \"shop\" visit, which was pretty cool if you dont have time to do a full tour. They run a 'about us' video every hour or so, which is really well done, just ask at the reception for free tickets to this.",
          "What expierance",
          "Tour was great!! A few rules - don't touch and no photos - but they explain why and there is a section you can touch things and take photos at the end. Even the cave itself without the tour would be worth visiting! They do show a 25min doco \u2026",
          "Great tour",
          "Lovely tours with great hands-on interaction with movie props. Enthusiastic tour guides who actually work in the workshop. Nice gift shop with models, t-shirts and other small things.",
          "The workshop tour is recommended & early booking is essential. Sure, the tour is over a 20 x 20 foot display workshop, so movie and props fans will appreciate. Our guide Daisy was passionate and knowledgeable since she works there as an \u2026",
          "Well worth a visit",
          "Loads of items to purchase. But make sure you save for large items",
          "Detail introduction on movie and TV production. From molding to 3D print. Most areas are no photos but there's always a room with photo opportunities in each tour. Thunderbird behind the scene is incredible, how they preserve the antique feel if the show is also attention to detailed.",
          "A must do for a Lord of a the  Rings fan. The shop is amazing with a huge display of props and figurines. The staff knows a lot of things too. The tour is really nice and even if you can take pictures it's amazing they will show you how they work and how they make props (not only for LOTR)",
          "Enjoyed but kind of expected more. could be better to be honest. No Weta magic shame \nCould have had green screen etc  shown how it's done well as insight anyway.",
          "Not to be missed by tourists!",
          "Amazing tour -- we especially loved the Thunderbirds tour as my kids are obsessed with the show.  Matt Hopkins was a PHENOMENAL tour guide - very informative and really good at tailoring the tour to our specific interests.  Thank you very much WETA!!!!!!",

          "NZ should be very proud of Weta. This is one amazing tour and a must do when in Wellington. I am a huge LOTR myself and was quite emotional to see the care and craft they put into the movies and everything they do. Amazing! I did both the \u2026",

          "Couldn't find any Wetas",
          "Great place to learn about how the props are made. The workshop tour for $25 is very interesting, you get to touch many of the props and can talk to different staff members and ask questions. The fanshop is very nice as well and there are a mini museum and a free 15 min video to watch. ",
          "Loved this place! An amazing little shop with extremely good quality goods and movie replicas. The workshop tour is a must do for everyone as it gives a great insight of how much weta workshop has been involved with some of the biggest movies in the world and how they go about making props and scenery. ",
          "It's everything most people would imagine.  Loved how unassuming the surroundings were, it's brilliant to see where they started and still build from.  Mind blowing that so much can come from this place and just how much Weta has had their \u2026",

          "Cool tour of the magic behind movie making (LOTR, district 9 etc). The shop has plenty of LOTR merchandise too. If you attend the additional miniature thunderbirds tour, you can get to see all the cool set pieces used to film the thunderbird tv series.",

          "Amazing place",
          "Amazing tour around this studio, so much to see, informative and friendly staff, lots of cool stuff and they're alright with you handling some of the props and getting right in there. Just remember, no pictures inside the workshop, they're serious about that and will call you out on it. Definitely worth the small fee to get the tour",

          "I have just finished the Weta Workshop Tour, and my first impression is frustration. The tour is 45min, which is way not enough to enjoy each room. The guide is \u00ab pushing \u00bb you forward to go in the next room, and everyone is like staring the most things he can like in the race,",
          "Great trip. Saw some great pieces and followed it up with a visit to the Gallipoli exhibition at the museum",

          "Amazing experience, collected from the city centre and only a short 15 minute drive later we were at Weta. Well worth it a highlight of our trip to Wellington.",
          "The Weta Cave Studio Tour Is pretty disappointing. I have done the Harry Potter world in London and expected something similar but not as large. This was very tiny and disappointing with not that many props. It was cool that there was an area to touch different props to see the",
          "My wife and I visited the workshop (and did the double tour) in mid-December. Positives first - the energy of the staff and the clear enthusiasm they have for what they do. Moreover, there is clearly a lot of skill that goes into the work there and that was impressive to see.",
          "Weta have worked and collaborated on many films and this behind the scenes tour is well worth it. We did the combo tour, which shows you mainly the behind the scenes prop making for Lord of the Rings to start with and also the Thunderbirds tour, which gives you a great",
          "A very exciting and informative visit to the Weta Workshop. To see the way they actually create backgrounds, etc in a movie is so creative and clever. Works of art!!",
          "How amazing! Do not miss this informative tour. The studio was a highlight for me. To see how they actually make the scenery/back ground for the filming is unbelievable and extremely inventive, so very clever.",
          "An excellent tour in an inspiring location! Our guide had so much enthusiasm that it was contagious, it's so obvious to see that this is a great place to work. We got to see so many items used in WETA productions, and also glimpse into the processes used to make movie",
          "We went for the Combo Tour of about 90 mins, led by a guide. Apart from slight disorganisation due to different tours starting it followed on very strongly with real enthusiasm and knowledge from our approachable guide. The creativity of the team working here is mind-blowing,",
          "Visited the Weta workshop for the first time with 2 young children - probably better suited to kids 10 or older, however the guides are fantastic and the staff there are passionate about what they do. Amazing props and getting to see them work on actual things while on the tour",
          "I dragged my wife here off of a cruise ship and it turned out she loved it. I really liked the gift shop but I don't know how I would have gotten the $900 Gandalphs staff on the plane. There are some smaller gifts but a lot of expensive stuff. We just took a cab from the Isite",
          "Was absolutely amazing and awesome how much detail there was in all the movies created. It was great to get some funny and exciting photo opportunities",
          "We very much enjoyed the Weta Cave tour, being able to see props and costumes from recent and current movies, led by a person who actually worked on some of those movies. The tour was interesting, informative, and fun. As well, we were able to see props being worked on for a",
          "I really enjoyed the guided tour in the WETA cave and loved seeing the costumes and props from a lot of well-known movies like Avatar, Mad max, I am Mother and LOTR. The makeup class was fun too although not a must for me personally (probably fun with kids though). Could have",
          "Whether you are a Lord of the Rings fan or not, you will definitely appreciate the work (and workmanship) that goes into making all the sets, special effects, characters, accessories, and paraphernalia of making movies. This has several layers of tours available - we chose to",
          "This is not just for Hobbit fans. Just visualising the work involved in making the realistic props is an eye opener. Visiting the set of Thunderbirds are go was fun.",
          "A must for all fans - casual or hardcore. I would absolutely adore going back and getting to see the props and hearing the stories again.",
          "I design sets for middle school productions and LOVE movies like Lord of the Rings, Hobbit, And Avatar for their amazing creativity in costuming, color- use and detail to set design. While visiting New Zealand\u2019s North Island on a 2 week bike tour, discovered the Special Effects",
          "This was the second time I have been to Weta and I loved it even more. I experienced the weta cave tour and the miniatures tour. As usual it opens my eyes to how they did there movies and made the magic we see on screen. Everyone was very friendly and happy to answer questions.",
          "We loved this tour! After having done Hobbiton we did not expect to hear much new information about the lord of the rings films, however we were wrong! The workshop tour had so many interesting props and a lot of interesting information and we were even allowed to touch some",
          "We're huge LOTR fans, sister not so much (has not read the books or seen the movies). Knowing that, she had a good time...may have converted her. Start off with two of the (huge) trolls out front, let your imagination flow for the photos. If you are a LOTR fan this place is",
          "An amazing experience for any film fan. Our tour guide was Reece who not only leads tours but works at Weta. He was amazingly knowledgeable, passionate, and truly the best tour guide I have ever seen. Totally worth the experience and more! Thank you Reece & Weta!",
          "Forget any preconceived Disney type ideas. This is real working sfx workshops! Pay extra and do thunderbirds as well! This was the highlight for me. Remember that cameras can only be used when advised. The gift shop is pricy, but for weta nerds, they will be like the proverbial",
          "We had a very interesting tour here led by the very knowledgeable and friendly Isaac. As huge lord of the rings fans we found this absolutely fascinating and I highly recommend it. The tour lasts about 45 mins and you get to see so many real life props from the films, it's",
          "The workmanship and level of detail it amazing. Not just a hobbit tour, although the are a big part of it. Add on the Thunderbirds tour if you want to experience set design and model making at an unreal level. No strings attached.",
          "We went here as my 18 year old son is attending the QLD School of Film and TV in Brisbane in 2020. He was blown away and it has made him even more passionate about what lies ahead. Thank you to the fabulous staff at Weta Cave for the inspiration they provide.",
          "If you come to Wellington you just have to visit weta workshop. We had a full tour with pickup in central Wellington and return trip. The driver Sue so marvelous, funny and a good driver. She told us many great stuff about peter Jackson. To see props and how they do stuff for",

          "We really enjoyed our tour at Weta Workshop. It was great to be in such small tour groups and get up really close to real movie props and models. Our guide Anthony was fab and really knew his stuff. Being able to chat to one of the design team at work on the stage was fantastic",
          "Many friends have mentioned the Weta Workshops and we decided to have a look. Well worth the visit plus value for money did not realise how many movies they have been involved in and the props they have made.",
          "Enjoyed this behind the scenes look at the film industry. We took the first tour of the morning and I recommend getting their early. We had a small enough group that we were able to see and interact with the exhibits easily. After our tours the gift shop was packed with",
          "We love films and learning about them and booked a tour from our cruise ship which took us here and to some of the Lord of the RIngs film sights on Mount Victoria. It is a really fun and interesting place to visit. Our tour guide was also very knowledgeable. The tour however",

          "We did the combo Weta workshop and miniatures tour. Our guide was great, lots of interesting info. Our 11 and 9 yr old stayed engaged and interested the whole tour. It\u2019s a great experience, and much more then just LOTR, Hobbit. There is a room where you get to interact with some",
          "Our group of 31 teenagers had a very interesting tour, full of inside information and knowledge of how special effects are done. They were able to feel several props and to also watch a short movie. No photos are allowed. Many of the costumes were original. We were taken through",

          "We had already been to Hobbiton, so the visit to Weta Workshop on our visit to Wellington was extra special. We saw how props were made, met some of the clever folks who created the objects and got to see some of the actual props used in films. If you can, make sure you include",
          "We did the tour and learned many things about the process of special effects, got to hold some prop weapons, armor, touched a wax face, among many other things. If you are in Wellington, this is a must. We did the two our tour and time flew by! Most picture-taking is not allowed",
          "We took the drive out to have a look without doing a tour. A good range of trinkets and models on display. Free video session. Most people were taking tours. Half hour to go through the free section will do it.",
          "Very interesting. Also did the prop building tour which was informative. The cafe on the next corner has the best food and is a must to add to your visit.",
          "Our expectations of this tour was that it would only be about the Lord of the Rings movies and while there is a large part of that it covers many other movies as well. We were surprised just how many movies, going back a number of years, had involvement with this workshop. The",

          "We had a great tour of the weta workshop you got to see a lot of behind the scenes costumes and props and we had good explanations of the process behind everything. However, we had a lot of people on our tour and the first two rooms you could barely move around or hear the tour",
          "Picked up by a lovely lady who gave us a jolly talk on the local area and where a lot of the film stars lived whilst filming for Lord of the rings and important landmark around Wellington. You have to have seen the films of Peter Jackson to get the real flavour of this tour. I",

          "The tour takes 45 mins, during this time no photography allowed. Viewing of real props in major Broadway movies can be seen such as halo jeep, power ranger helmets, lord of the rings weapons. Explanation was given on how these props has been made and process workers have to go",
          "This tour was one of our main reasons for visiting Wellington. We did the regular tour (not the combo one). It was fantastic! Our guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. You get a chance to see so many amazing things that Weta has made over the years. I would recommend this",
          "We did the Weta Combo package. Fantastic day, great guides - informative and good fun. Did not know they have been involved in so many films! Absolutely fascinating to see behind the scenes. Leave plenty of time to get street parking and walk to Weta Cave.",
          "As an avid Lord of the Rings fan, Weta Workshop was at the top of the list for my visit to Wellington. After reading some reviews, it's always best not to have super high expectations of something you've dreamed of seeing. With that in mind, I went on the full day There and Back",
          "A very very slick operation. They tell you turn up at a certain time- and your tour starts 30 minutes later. So you have to mill around and wait in the hideously expensive gift shop. Our tour guide, though very friendly was a novice and not a native English speaker. So with her",
          "Did the excursion to Weta and was blown away by the exhibits. The guide was really knowledgeable and you could imagine the scenes from Lord of the Rings and other movies as he explained how they did the scenes. A worthwhile visit.",

          "I am blown away by what this workshop has been able to accomplish, and seeing it in person was a privilege. It really wasn't overpriced in my opinion, compared to some of the stuff we've paid good money for on our NZ trip only to be left wondering where the value was. I was",
          "My Australian partner is a huge fan of LOTR and was excited to visit Weta Workshop which is his dream place to work. The tour was very interesting and there was lots of cool things to see. Photos arent allowed because some of the stuff backstage is for current projects.",
          "Our tour guide was great. She's an artist and Weta and really knew her stuff. She was great (but I can't remember her name). Although we enjoyed seeing all the props and sets and other memorabilia from Lord of the Rings and many other movies, the tour was still a bit of a",
          "Enough said. If you are a big fan (or not) of the movie Lord of the Rings, you should go to the Weta Workshop. They will let you see what they have done for the movie, and a LOT of other movies as well. I am not a big fan of the Lord of the Rings, but their works really",

          "The visit is very interesting, the guide being a staff from the workshop himself and thus having both extensive knowledge and passion over the different topics. The place is a small workshop, what makes it amazing is Weta work, truly fabulous.",
          "We did the leather and chain-mail making workshop, along with the Weta Workshop tour. We had a lot of fun crafting and making our own keyrings, as well as hearing more about the creative process that goes on behind the scenes at Weta. A tip for finding the crafting location",

          "After visiting Hobbiton and seeing the gorgeous vistas of New Zealand that embody the world of Tolkien, I was thrilled to be going to the Weta Cave and Workshop, where all the magic happened. This ended up being one of the disappointments of our trip, however, not without some",
          "Interesting tours. Guide very enthusiastic. First tour a little overcrowded really. Would have got more, if there had been less people. Sometimes difficult to hear the host, and hard to see. But interesting never the less. The second part was the thunderbirds tour. This was",
          "Did the four hour tour and found this whole trip so enlightening and amazing. Did not have a clue that so much of this stuff goes on in NZ. Amazing and incredible place. Loved the Avatar, Lord of the Rings and Thunderbirds displays etc. Really amazing.",
          "It was OK, I wouldn't go back again. I would rather spend more time in the other places around Wellington. I enjoy the movies but not that much.",
          "We did the \u2018There & Back Again\u2019 shuttle for the Half Experience. It was the best 2.5 hours we have experienced and well worth every cent! The shuttle driver was so informative on the journey there and back and the actual tour at Weta Workshop was incredible! Knowledgeable and",
          "Weta are involved in so many movies because they do damn good work. Was great to see some of the props up close and hear about it. They said parking was hard to find but it was no issue for us on a rainy weekend in the school holidays with all tours full.",
          "This is great if you're interested in how things are made for the movies. It's not so much a studio tour, but very informative and interesting. You can't take many photos, but there were some fun photo options at the end. Really enjoyed this.",
          "A tour of the Weta Workshop gives you an insight into the movie making process, with a specific emphasis on props and effects used in films such as LOTR and Avatar. We had a very knowledgeable guide who explained many processes involved in making costumes, props and set pieces.",
          "Really enjoyed learning about Weta and how it grew from humble beginings to now. Loved being able to play with some plasticine at the end too",
          "This could be so much more! The shuttle from the centre was great, driver was friendly and informative and then you're dropped off at the cave. What you then get is an overpriced shop, a short self-promoting video that you'd normally get as a blu ray extra and an incredibly",

          "We booked just the visit to the Weta Cave and it was so worth it. The display of how things are made and being able to handle items like real chainmail compared with what they made the chain mail from. Fascinating. The life-like characters and a wonderful shop where you can buy",
          "A good tour for adults who are interested in how movie props are made. The tour guide was informative and interesting.",
          "Our tour guides name was Matt (from South Africa) he was absolutely fantastic! He was such a chill dude, cracked a few funny as jokes and made us feel really welcome! He definitely deserves a pay rise and I think a roller coaster added would be awesome!! My friend and I both",

          "I decided on doing the combo tour to get a good sense of what the Weta business is all about. It was worth every cent. The tour guide was friendly and knowledgeable and threw in the humour as well. The exhibits were amazing. I can highly recommend this for any movie geek!",
          "The Weta Cave Workshop Tour was amazing! Not just for LOTR or Thunderbirds fans but also for any aspiring artists! Lots of amazing works and how they are made. Pretty lucky to have a personal tour and my guide was informative and great! Thoroughly enjoyed it!",
          "These tours have been running for years now so today we went along to experience them ourselves. We got the combo of the Weta Cave tour and the. The Miniature Thunderbirds tour. They were both very enjoyable and we particularly liked the Thunderbirds tour, where we got to see",

          "I love movies and getting a tour with real movie props and explanations on how everything is made is super cool. You get to discover how the hidden parts of filming are while still feeling the wonder and magic of cinema. I loved it!",
          "I expected more from this place. The tour guides are great and engaging. You will see many movie props, sets and hear many interesting stories. However, knowing the capability of what goes on here I really felt that the Weta Workshop experience was lacking and as a result,",
          "Thank you to our guide Reece for such an entertaining, funny, and informative tour! I love that the guides are artists/designers themselves so you can see the passion they have for the work displayed and also know firsthand all of the hours and hours and dedication that goes",
          "We caught the Metlink bus from town across to Miramar. So easy and cheap. Visited the cave first (shop) and booked a workshop tour. The guides were passionate and it was like a mini museum to the things they have created and are continuing to create. Great for Peter Jackson fans.",
          "I live in LA, I work in tv production and I was slightly disappointed by this tour. I felt like I could have skipped it and watched a behind the scenes feature on one of the LOTR dvd's. I think I would have preferred to have gone and seen actual sets or film locations than this",

          "We did the workshop tour and the Thunderbirds tour, it is well worthwhile doing both.Weta Workshop tour was very insightful in howcthey make props and the history of Weta. Thunderbirds tour was very good as you could walk around the models and sets they are still using to film",
          "The whole family really enjoyed the tour. The address all fans of the lord of the rings and the hobbit, but weta do so much more from Narnia to district 9. Tour guide was funny and informative. Wonderful to ar so many props close up. We're also duds the Thunderbirds tour which",

          "We had a wonderful time on the tour seeing how they made the props for the movies. The staff was great and let us try out some of the props. We also got to see the old Thunderbirds set, which brought back some old childhood memories.",
          "Artisans at Weta Workshop have created models, props and settings for hundreds of films. The tour showed us how much attention to detail goes into every creature, tool and weapon. From the moment we were picked up in the city, we learned about the incredible film-making",

          "Paid NZD88.00 for the full tour, which includes a pickup and drop-off in downtown Wellington. Reading some other reviews it is possible to get this cost down if you UBER to there HQ. Our tour got off to an inconspicuous start due to an officious Weta worker who had absolutely no",
          "I wouldn't rave about is, but I found it interesting and at $48 for a 2hr tour was pretty good value. Basically you are lead through several rooms of props and sets from various movies that Weta have been involved in; and there are many movies . Tour guide was informative. Good.",
          "I went here because a friend wanted to. Just a couple of things bothered me about this tour. First off it\u2019s WETA, they make a ton of money, and the tour isn\u2019t cheap. The \u201ctheater\u201d for the documentary could be improved upon. For a company that does such amazing creative things,",
          "The Weta workshop is where some amazing stuff happens for some great movies. Unfortunately most of it is protected intellectual property so photo ops are limited. It\u2019s worth it to see the breadth of Weta\u2019s work and to hear about some of the projects but i was a little",
          "This is well worth the money (didn't get picked up, arrived by ourselves, so it only cost 28 NZD each). While this isn't really a LOTR tour, there are enough trolls, dwarves, and orcs to satisfy a fan. I highly recommend this tour. It's short and very informative. The gift",

          "Our family of 5, with 3 pre-teens/teenagers, loved both of these tours! The guides were brilliant, interesting, informative and fun. The props, set, etc you see are amazing! It's a little cold in the set studio in the middle of winter so make sure you dress warmly.",
          "This is definitely an experience. We did just one of the tours that included transport from the CBD. Amazing to see behind the scenes and hear how they do their work. Very clever artistic people.",
          "We took the 'there and back tour: which picks you up near the iSite in the city. Our bus driver Ray, was entertaining and informative and as kiwis we learnt heaps. Cam was a great tour guide at the workshops. We now have an appreciation for what Weta has achieved and continues",
          "Our family took the combination tour of the Weta Cave and Thunderbirds miniatures. I did not find the latter very interesting and personally would recommend it for enthusiasts only. The Weta Cave component was moderately interesting but, like a recent reviewer, I was left",
          "We decided to visit Weta Workshop and took the combo tour. This includes the Weta Workshop tour component and the miniatures tour of the Thunderbirds are Go tour. ($45 total). Both quite different and most interesting. Lots of complex modelling and design techniques for the",
          "I wasn't sure if this would be of interest to a 50-year-old + woman but really really enjoyed it and appreciated the artistry and innovation used by the designers.",
          "If you want to visit a place like a Museum and see a couple of Video\u2019s for $100+ feel free . The guide was very knowledgeable. I could have gone round Te Papa for a tenth of the price. I do not recommend, very,very disappointing",
          "Loved out WETA tour, great tour guide who really knew her stuff. Wonerful seeing all the props and how they are put together",
          "This tour did not disappoint! Travelling with a small group of teenagers all interested in creative arts, this tour was just perfect for them! Reasonably priced, informative and interesting from start to finish. The bus driver was just brilliant as was the workshop tour guide.",
          "Took your from Wellington central to wets... Amazing tour guide, funny and very informative... Film on history was great, the tour fantastic.... Only drawback was had to hope on bus could have done with more time to take photos",
          "Very interesting tour of company history, and insight to props, CGI, and special effects in the film industry. Blown away by how many other films than just JRR Tolkien, this company has done.",
          "Good hour spent here on the main tour, good tour guide with plenty of knowledge. Shame you can't see much going on in the cave itself, but might just have been a quiet day. Certainly better than last time we went when it was little more than a shop.",
          "Expected the wow hit but it didn\u2019t come. Also expected to see more staff hands on but instead we were shown exhibits we were not allowed to touch. If u r a sci fan or lord of the rings u won\u2019t really care what u see, but when we found the Thunderbirds R Go, more informative and",

          "Really enjoyed this Tour - been a big LOTR fan . Picked up on time and given a friendly commentary en route to he Weta Workshop The young guy who took us around was so full of passion for his work, and the work done here at Weta. What a fabulous place to work at and with such",
          "Stunning, dazzling, entertaining in its own right, this tour is a fascinating insight into the fun side of movie making. Isaac, our guide, was knowledgeable and enthusiastic, sharing anecdotes and information in a thoroughly professional way. Highly recommended.",
          "Like a few others I used public transport as I was staying in the city without a vehicle. Easy to find. Well organised. Tour started with them asking who would like to carry a sword and immediately I was hooked. Some things you can't touch but when you can make sure you do it's",
          "Basically the Weta Cave is a movie studio that provides costumes, special effects and props used in movie making. Once you find out how many movies this little studio has been involved in, you will be impressed. The tour explains and shows some of the processes involved which",
          "The actual Weta Cave doesn't offer much to look at but if you book one of their many tours (ranging in price) you get a more close look at their current projects.",
          "This was good fun. Not nearly as pricey as Hobbiton, and you are introduced to the wide range of projects that the Weta team have worked on. It was great to hear that the Weta team hire their staff on an ongoing basis rather than just project by project - so awesome to see them",
          "There wasn't really all that much to see. Not worth the price of admission or the time spent to get there.",
          "This is a little smaller than the workshop tour but in some ways even better. there are more props to touch especially if you like LOTR and Hobbit. I went on it as part of a conference tour and was really impressed. This is top marks from me and is the best tour I have ever",
          "I took my family to see this one a short holiday in Wellington. My daughters were a bit reluctant but I was keen and had already been to the Weta Cave tour on a conference. (the tours aren't the same). The workshop tours was really excellent. We have an informed guide who took",
          "Really enjoyed this tour. The time went so quickly because our guide was interesting and knowledgeable. There are some things to touch and look at but most of the exhibits were not to be touched. Guides are all members of the team and so they know their stuff. Loved hearing",
          "I love this cave but I wish the retailers wore costumes and were involved more, but also enjoyed the little movie in the beginning. It is a pity it is not fully themed.",
          "What great work you all do and very interesting informative tour. I couldnt believe the involvement of so many movies from Weta.",
          "What a amazing morning we spent at the Weta Cave and Thunderbird Exhibition. We did the Weta Cave tour first followed by the Thunderbird tour. Both tours were taken by Matt who was amazing, really knowledgable and engaging. My inner geek was throughly enthralled. This is a must",

          "Went on the tour, was very interesting. Didn't realise how long it has being running for. Shame we didnt have longer in the 3rd room we went in. The one where your allowed to pick up and inspect/feel everything. Felt like I missed so much in there. But on the whole it was well",
          "This is not like Movie World or Universal Studios so don\u2019t go in with those expectations. This is a small look into the what Weta do - which is impressive. We did the combo tour which was the behind the scenes tour and Thunderbirds. The behind the scenes is a short tour but so",
          "Great place to get an insight into how big Hollywood studios make cool and different films for our enjoyment! We did the Thunderbirds are go! tour and we loved it (including two young kids 6 and 9 years old), the whole family thought it was great fun! Our tour guide was",

          "Absolutely have to visit Weta Cave. Our excellent guide took us behind the scenes and showed us how the extremely talented people at Weta build figures, animals, monsters and set pieces for the movies and exhibitions. Fantastic! Combine this with the Thunderbirds set as well. A",
          "We took the shortest 45 min tour and it was ok. Nothing spectacular. The shop was overpriced but thats normal I guess and everything is available cheaper online. Staff is very friendly and that's the norm in NZ, everyone is quite nice.",
          "I remember the first time I heard about Weta Workshop. It was during the production of Lord of the Rings when a good friend of mine told me to check out Weta Workshop and especially Weta Digital, as he knew my interest in computational design and fabrication. On a recent visit",
          "if you are a fan of the \"lord of the rings trilogy\" and the \"hobbit trilogy\" then this would be one of the places you should visit. they will show you the details of how they make the crafts for the movies. really interesting.",
          "The friendly guides show you around the tours available from Weta Cave and then the cave has tid bits of the magic woven elsewhere in the Weta buildings. So creative and done with such a driving passion, this is a must see attraction in Wellington.",

          "If you are a lover of all things film AND stare in wonder at the screen at how animatronics and CGI have made it so very believable then you CANNOT afford to miss this tour. From Lord of the Rings, to King King, Planet of the Apes and Avatar, WETA has been involved as the",
          "When we arrived in Wellington we had to see Weta so we headed there straight from the airport! We went on the behind the scenes tour and were able to see some of the models and techniques used in the LOTR movies as well as others. Nice to see even if you aren't a fan and the",
          "We did this on our arrival day from USA and we had a great experience! We got hung up in Auckland due to long security lines and missed our connecting flight, meaning we would miss our tour. We emailed them and they were able to move us to the last tour of the day. Our leader",
          "My inner LotR nerd was screaming. So very interesting and well put together tour of the behind the scenes look of Weta workshop. Loved been able to get up and personal and to see the ideas/ designs and props. If you are a Ghost in the Shell or Halo fan - you will get something",
          "An interesting half day. We did the Weta Cave tour followed by the Thunderbirds tour. We found the Thunderbirds tour a little dry with its cultural relevance lost on our 19 year old son (not us). However the Weta Cave tour is well worth it.",
          "Such an Amazing place to see, a workplace of talented and knowledgeable people. We did the Tour of the Workshop, well worth the time for a visit, and Thunderbirds = OK.",

        "wiki": "Otari Native Botanic Garden and Wilton's Bush Reserve (Otari-Wilton's Bush) is the only public botanic garden in New Zealand dedicated solely to New Zealand native plants. It is located in Wellington's suburb of Wilton.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nOtari Native Botanic Garden and Wilton's Bush Reserve (Otari-Wilton's Bush) is the only public botanic garden in New Zealand dedicated solely to New Zealand native plants. \n\nThis unique plant sanctuary and forest reserve consists of 100 hectares of native forest, and five hectares of plant collections. Some of Wellington's oldest trees are here, including an 800-year-old rimu.\nOtari\u2013Wilton's Bush is classified as a Garden of National Significance by the New Zealand Gardens Trust. It is also one of the Founding Gardens of the Trust.\nOtari-Wilton's Bush is owned and managed by the Wellington City Council.\nEntry is free, and is open daily between sunrise and sunset. The Te Marae o Tane Information Centre is open 8.00am - 4.00pm daily.\nLocated only 5 km from the city centre, at 160 Wilton Road (between Gloucester and Warwick streets).\nYou can either drive from the city and park at the main public car park is at the Wilton Road entrance, or take the No 14 Wilton bus from Lambton Quay to Otari-Wilton's Bush. Public parking is also available off Churchill Drive.\nWheelchair-friendly paths run from the main carpark to the Information Centre, over the Canopy Walkway, and to Cockayne Lookout. A step-free path runs from the Churchill Drive carpark along the Kaiwharawhara streamside to the Troup Picnic Lawn.\n\n\n== History ==\nOtari-Wilton's Bush was originally covered with  podocarp broadleaf forest. The name \u201cOtari\u201d is M\u0101ori for \u201cPlace of Snares\u201d. The forest was a good place for bird hunting. When the region was colonized by Europeans, trees were removed for timber, and to create farmland.The first part of the reserve to be protected was a 7 hectare area of forest that was fenced off from stock by a far-sighted local farmer, Job Wilton, in 1860.\nMany parts of the current Otari-Wilton's Bush reserve have been designated as reserve by the New Zealand government and Wellington City Council. \nThis includes most of the remnants of the mature podocarpaceae forest that once cloaked all of Wellington and the surrounding hills.\nThe forest area holds native trees that are hundreds of years old, like matai Prumnopitys taxifolia and rimu Dacrydium cupressinum, as well as tawa Beilschmiedia tawa, rewarewa Knightia excelsa and kohekohe Dysoxylum spectabile.The plant collections that now form the native botanic gardens, were the brainchild of eminent botanist Dr Leonard Cockayne, who started developing this collections in 1926.\n\n\n== Native Botanic Gardens ==\n\nThe Otari-Wilton's Bush plant collections contain about 1,200 species, hybrids and cultivars. The collections include plants from New Zealand's mainland and off-shore islands.\nAlmost all the plants have been grown from cuttings or seeds collected from their original habitats. The collection has the following roles:\n\nConservation: Seedlings of threatened species are raised and either kept in the gardens as a conservation measure, or returned to the wild in plant conservation recovery programmes.\nResearch: Scientists use the plant collections for studying plant ecology, economic potential, and classification.\nEducation: Plants are labelled to help visitors learn about their names and characteristics.\nRecreation: Otari-Wilton's Bush is a great place for locals and tourists to escape urban life and appreciate New Zealand's unique flora.The plant collections were started in 1926 by eminent New Zealand botanist Dr Leonard Cockayne. He aimed to establish a collection of solely New Zealand native plants, displayed in family groups or as re-created ecosystems representing different areas of New Zealand.\nThe plants are arranged in distinct collections, including an alpine garden, a fernery, hebe and flax cultivars, a large rock garden, grass and sedge species, and a coastal garden.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nIn the Native Botanic Gardens are many New Zealand plants that are threatened in the wild. Some of these are raised and either kept in the gardens as a conservation measure, or returned to the wild in plant conservation recovery programmes. \nHuman settlement has caused many plants to disappear from New Zealand's forests, wetlands and coasts. Major losses are blamed on industries such as agriculture and forestry, and the introduction of animal pests and invasive weeds.\nSeveral New Zealand plants are already extinct and over 180 plants are classified as severely threatened.\n\n\n== Forest Reserve and Restoration ==\nThere are 100 hectares of forest made up of original and regenerating podocarp broadleaf forest. It includes a stand of original bush, 17 acres set aside by Job Wilton in 1860, and a much larger area of regenerating bush.\nThe original bush has some very large trees such as rimu and rata, which are estimated to be between 400 and 800 years old. Large conifers (podocarps) such as rimu, totara, miro and matai can be viewed from the Canopy Walkway or the Nature Trail. \nAbout 150 species of flowering plants, conifers and ferns can be found in the forest. Epiphytes or perching plants sit high in the branches of mature trees. Climbing plants, including the New Zealand passionfruit, supplejack, and rata occur throughout the forest. Kohekohe, rewarewa, tawa and mahoe trees dominate the upper slopes and merge with forest remnants of old rimu and matai. In the wetter areas, tall pukatea can be seen with their buttressed roots.\nOn the high south-facing slopes, scrub is dominated by introduced gorse and Darwin\u2019s barberry with colonising native plants such as mahoe and rangiora.\nNative birds include tui, kereru, fantail, silver eye, kingfisher, grey warbler and morepork.\nStaff and volunteers have been planting thousands of trees since 2001, in an effort to accelerate the process of forest restoration in and around the scenic reserve. Targets are \u2013 among others \u2013 to improve the biodiversity and to encourage native birds and insects. Much of the work is done by volunteers associated with the Otari-Wilton's Bush Trust.\nThe regenerating bush started in the gullies and now covers most of the reserve, working its way up to the tops of the hills on the far side of the valley.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\nThe Information Centre, \u201cTe Marae o Tane\u201d provides information about New Zealand's flora (and fauna), and provides further information on Otari \u2013 Wilton's Bush as well. The Information Centre \u2013 Te Marae O Tane \u2013 is open 8am\u20134pm daily and contains displays, information and seating for visiting groups. The small lecture room can be booked for horticultural and educational purposes.\n\n\n=== Canopy Walkway ===\nA 75-metre-long canopy walkway, beginning at the Information Centre, links the two main garden areas.  It is 18 metres above the forest floor.\n\n\n== Forest trails and walking tracks ==\nThere are walks and trails within the forest and gardens to suit a range of ages and abilities.\nGood walking footwear and appropriate clothing for the weather conditions is recommended. Walking tracks can be slippery after wet weather. The walking times provided are a guide only.\n\nCircular Walk - a walk through gardens and forest.

The reserve holds interesting species of fishes and amphibians. Weta are also present.\n\n\n== Otari-Wilton's Bush Trust ==\nAlthough owned and managed by the Wellington City Council, the Otari-Wilton's Bush Trust has been contributing significantly to the organisation via education programmes, marketing initiatives and hands on volunteering.

          "Had a lovely picnic with friends as our other location was going to be too windy. It was a lovely spot for those who wanted a longer walk to those who wanted to play other games on the grass. A real little treasure in Wellington. A good amount of information and you can join",
          "We only managed to do the short loop on this visit. Perfect weather made it a lovely walk. There are also longer walks you can do and a picnic area not too far from the car park. There are plenty of birds and insects around to keep the nature lovers happy.",

      "name": "Space Place at Carter Observatory",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Space Place at Carter Observatory (or simply Space Place) is housed in a historic astronomical observatory located at the top of the Wellington Botanic Garden in Wellington, New Zealand.\nThe site was originally home to the Wellington City Observatory (nicknamed \"The Tin Shed\"), established in 1924. This was demolished and replaced by the Carter Observatory, which officially opened on 20 December 1941. Space Place is now managed by Museums Wellington, which is part of Experience Wellington, and is a public museum and planetarium with a focus on space and New Zealand astronomy. The Observatory houses a digital planetarium as well as an historic 9\u200b3\u20444-inch Cooke refractor telescope, through which evening visitors can observe a variety of Solar System and deep-sky objects.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe original name, Carter Observatory, commemorates Charles Carter, who gifted his estate to what later became the Royal Society of New Zealand for the purposes of establishing an astronomical observatory in or near Wellington. Parliament established the Carter Observatory in 1937; it opened in 1941, following some delays caused by the beginnings of World War II. It is regarded as the fifth observatory in Wellington, and was built on the site of the previous Wellington City Observatory nicknamed \"The Tin Shed.\"\nOver the following decades, Carter Observatory became a base for astronomical research in New Zealand. Research began with solar investigations, and when new staff joined during the 1970s it expanded to variable stars, galaxies, comets and asteroids. The Observatory ran formal research programmes and assisted amateur astronomers in performing their own research.\nThe Carter Observatory became New Zealand's National Observatory in 1977. In 1991, the Golden Bay Planetarium was relocated from Civic Square in downtown Wellington and incorporated into the Carter site. This merger also resulted in the establishment of a new visitor centre and gift store, which helped to diversify the Observatory\u2019s facilities and improve the visitor experience.\nThe Observatory\u2019s role eventually shifted from a focus on scientific research to public education about space and astronomy. Parliament officially repealed the Carter Observatory Act in 2010 and transferred the responsibilities of the site from the Crown to the Wellington City Council. It is now one of four institutions run by Museums Wellington as part of Experience Wellington.\nA digital fulldome planetarium system was installed during a refurbishment of the facility in 2010. Museums Wellington re-branded the Carter Observatory in 2015 to reflect its role in public education and tourism. It is now officially known as \u201cSpace Place at Carter Observatory\u201d or \u201cSpace Place.\u201d\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nSpace Place houses two telescopes within its main building, as well as a planetarium. The Thomas Cooke telescope, a 9\u200b3\u20444-inch Cooke refractor, serves as the primary telescope for public observing sessions. The Ruth Crisp telescope, a 16-inch Cassegrain reflector, arrived as a donation in 1968. Not far from the main building, Space Place also manages the Thomas King Observatory, previously used by the Wellington Astronomical Society. The historic Dominion Observatory is also located nearby, but this is not operated by Space Place.\n\n\n=== The Thomas Cooke Telescope ===\n\nThe Thomas Cooke telescope is the main telescope in regular use at Space Place. It was manufactured in 1867 in York, England by T. Cooke & Sons, and originally installed at an observatory near Halifax, West Yorkshire. The astronomers Edward Crossley and Joseph Gledhill used the telescope over the course of several decades for their astronomical research.\nA Grubb & Parsons clock drive was added to the telescope in 1879, and this still serves as the telescope's mechanical tracking system. The telescope\u2019s original lens was a 9\u200b1\u20443-inch achromat, which was replaced with a 9-inch Cooke photovisual objective in 1896. In 1896 or 1905, a 5-inch W. Watson & Sons guide scope was added alongside the main scope.\nAfter Crossley\u2019s death in 1905, the telescope was purchased by Reverend Dr David Kennedy and shipped to New Zealand, where it was installed at the Meeanee Observatory at the Marist Seminary near Napier. Kennedy used the telescope to take photographs of Halley\u2019s Comet during its 1910 approach.The Wellington City Council purchased the telescope for \u00a32000 in 1923, and the telescope was shipped from Napier to Wellington. It was later transferred to the care of the Carter Observatory under the Carter Observatory Act (1938).\nAt the Carter Observatory site, the Cooke telescope was used for solar astronomy research as well as flare star and double star monitoring programs over the following decades. In April 1968, Carter Observatory was one of the observatories involved in recording an occultation of Neptune by the Moon. This was part of an international project in which U.S. Naval Observatory astronomers used photometric and visual data provided by New Zealand, Australian and Japanese observers to derive an improved value for the diameter of Neptune.\nDue to degradation of the lens over its one hundred years of use, the photovisual objective was replaced in December 2001 with a 9\u200b3\u20444-inch aplanatic objective.\n\n\n=== The Ruth Crisp Telescope ===\n\nThe Ruth Crisp telescope, a 16-inch Cassegrain reflector manufactured by Boller and Chivens, was donated to the Observatory in 1968 by New Zealand writer and philanthropist Ruth Crisp. Once used for research at the Carter Observatory's outstation at Black Birch in the South Island, this telescope was later moved to the main premises in Wellington.\nA grant from Pub Charity allowed improvements to the installation in December 2005: the Observatory had the dome motorised, and the telescope\u2019s primary and secondary mirrors were re-aluminised.\n\n\n=== Planetarium ===\nThe Golden Bay Planetarium was incorporated into Carter Observatory in 1991, with the Wellington Planetarium Society gifting their Zeiss planetarium to the Observatory Board.\nA Sky-Skan digital fulldome planetarium system was installed during a refurbishment of the site in 2010. The nine-metre planetarium seats 66 people, and is equipped with DigitalSky software running across six 4K projectors.\n\n\n=== The Thomas King Observatory ===\nThe nearby Thomas King Observatory is also managed by Space Place, and was last refurbished in May 2001. It housed a 5-inch Grubb telescope (manufactured in 1886), and this was used for both night observations as well as solar viewing through a hydrogen-alpha filter.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nThomas King Observatory\nDominion Observatory, Wellington\nGifford Observatory, also located in Wellington\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpace Place - official site\nCarter Observatory's old website\nExperience Wellington",

          "Loved it and upgraded to a year long pass.\nTelescope is out for moment due to maintenance, but we'll go back when it's up and running and again. Planetarium show was best - was worried that 45 mins would be too long but kids stayed seated \u2026",
          "Really enjoyed taking the kids through here, great information and activities to take part in. Always something new to learn & discover.",
          "Great museum, great observatory, however our presenter for our Planetarium experience spoke with a thick Asian accent, and I could barely understand half of what she was saying, especially when she wasn't pronouncing the words properly \u2026",
          "Went in late last night with my friends and the staff were really nice. We had a look around the museum portion (it would be cool if they could update it and add more things) and then we went to the show. It ended up just being my friends \u2026",

When we were there we able to view several of the planets through its eye piece (the 150 year old telescope did not have a digital sensor). A great experience overall.",
          "We watched the one hour video on quantum physics(only option available at the time slot) and after twenty minutes couldn't keep up with what they were saying. The visual effects were cool but they could have explained it in more simpler terms. The commentator spoke very fast.",
          "Great place to take your kids. Or even on a nice chill date if you're someone like me who's into this stuff. A lot to explore. I spent 2 hrs + alone on just the first floor and I still didnt see everything. I Would definitely go again.",

          "So I'm coming off a 25 hour flight from Sweden, and had a hard time staying awake through the Valentine's Day special presentation... But! It was still informative, fun and well worth it.",
          "A wonderful find when wandering around the Botanical Gardens. Make surely to book a night show at the planetarium, then you can take advantage of the telescope, if the sky is clear, and not too windy. The displays are informative, and generally a nice addition to your cable car trip to the top.",
          "It's a shame the big telescope isn't in use for the public but they have smaller portable ones that can be taken outside for viewing the night skies.",

          "Ok, I'm a science nerd so this place sold me before I arrived. Obviously catering towards a young family audience, what made this place great for me was the connection of space and exploration back to New Zealanders with the bios of kiwis \u2026",
          "It was a very interesting look at our place in the universe.\nUnfortunately our experience was not what it could have been - our observatory guide could hardly be understood due to her Asian-accented English.\nWhy not have a home-grown speaker/guide?",
          "A great place to visit. Sit back and relax and drift off to outer space. Great crew. Check out the human sundial and the garden to the right of the entrance represents our solar system.",
          "The museum portion was tremendous. Sadly for me, I chose a day with little or no sleep the previous night and feel asleep during the star presentation. :(",
          "A gimmick, fundamentally. It's certainly novel to have a 180-degree field of view(ing) experience, but most of the seats put you in an uncomfortable position anyway. Hardly an experience that you couldn't have with an app on your phone and \u2026",
          "Had an amazing time, the guide was informative and very friendly.",
          "Great place with plenty of science. Slightly more child-oriented but good value for money, definitely. Check out the shows' specially \"We Are Stars\".",
          "Great place best planetarium I have visited",
          "Great for the family. Interesting, fun",
          "Super cool space centre with observatory and a space museum! The space show was really informative (they run a few different ones every hour) and the guide took us a bit extra and showed the sky as we would see it that night!",
          "$5 adult entrance fee.  Very good.  Great displays.  If we had stayed there long enough we would have spent a lot of money watching videos  which are presented by the staff followed with question time.  Many possibilities but $12.50 each person, each event. We only stayed for 1 presentation.  Then a look at the displays on the wall.",
          "Great fun",
          "Very cool place, always learn something new and exciting about space. The planetarium has some terrific viewings.",
          "Great walk-through exhibit, fantastic \"movie\" about the Apollo lunar landing!",
          "Great experience. I can see ring of saturn!",
          "It was okay. The show was the best part and the museum was meh",
          "Small place. Nothing much to offer for $14.",
          "Quit disappointed and don't feel I got value for money compared to other observatories I have been to. To some extent this is also due to a misleading website where the general entry is stated but not that every show/ movie costs extra \u2026",
          "U like space... its great!",
          "Set in the most beautiful botanical gardens high above Wellington city with a view of Wellington Harbour.  A must see for all the family.",
          "The planetarium was way better than I expected and well worth the money",
          "Pay to watch the show they have running, it was really cool!",
          "Good place to learn about space with interactive activities for the kids. Pity About one rude staff member who almost reined our time there on the 19th July",
          "Ticket $14/per. I think too expensive, just some information inside ,but use old telescope is pretty cool!",
          "Awesome place at the top of the cable cars. Saw a lovely show in the planetarium, the little man loved it",
          "Fascinating place. Excellent staff. Lots to learn.",
          "It was awesome a must and do thing  very impressive.",
          "Its ok. If its cloudy then you can't use the telescope (makes sense)",
          "We visited the Observatory as part of a school field trip. We had an incredible day. The astronomer Becky is a fantastic tea her and just wonderful with small children (age 5 -6) The rest of team made the day fun and interactive too. Great educational outing.",
          "We went to the movie \"We are Stars\" with our   2.5 yo and 7 mo. Our toddler was a little frightened by the dark at the start but then enjoyed the show. Very interesting from an adults perspective too and not to long for the kids. We payed for the adult tickets only.",
          "Very cool place to visit and explore space. If you can take in a show at the planetarium.",
          "The video about space travel was very good ,interesting historical facts and the visuals were informative , I thought the facilities were very good.",
          "Amazing. Good to get a view on the stars in the southern sky. Very good show \"... stars\"",
          "I liked the artillery piece they had",
          "Went  with a group of preschoolers. Very good programme for the age group",
          "Great place to visit. Make sure you see one of the shows.",
          "A great facility. Easily spend a couple of hours here, came to look through the telescope but it was too cloudy. Nice views of the city from the entrance. Good.",
          "Entry fee 12.50 for adults. Something  for everyone. Cafe nearby and cable car views.",
          "love this place!",
          "Interesting, loved it...",
          "Fantastic experience, educational and fun for all ages. Allow at least a couple of hours to explore everything.",
          "This is a must see for every traveller that stays in Welly for 1 or more days! You should combine it with the cable car ride, cable car museum and the botanic garden :-).",
          "The location was in the midst of a botanic garden with stunning views atop a perfect hilltop. Unfortunately, the observatory was closed during our visit but the many botanical examples featured were exotic and in full bloom.",
          "The telescope is worth it. The museum is small with good info. The shows were very good. The staff was very engaged and friendly. Good for any age if u love looking up stars",
          "Went there with my partner to watch a movie about early space exploration. It was cloudy so we only saw the moon, but we had a great time",
          "Many virtual education videos to watch.  The astronauts show was fantastic.",
          "Worth the $12.50. Exhibit was very interesting and enjoyed all the interactive displays.",
          "Some great educational shows for adults and children. Great staff and good value.",
          "Cute museum. It was really interesting to learn about the history of space exploration from the point of view of another country (we're from the US).",

          "Great education, great for kids.",
          "Cool",
          "Watched a few of the Sunday film screenings here in collaboration with Aro Video . Strongly recommend it. Also a great view of the City up there",
          "Came here because my little brother is into astronomy. Was quite cool. Mainly happy because my bro is happy",
          "A good fun place, with a good entertainment planetarium. Not a traditional planetarium, but still good shows. There are educational exhibits and you can still see the old telescope.",
          "Good day out",
          "Closing but still full price",
          "Wow....such a good experience",
          "Some really cool shows here to feed your interest",
          "Very cool and very informative. Lots of fun for all ages !!!",
          "Absolutely fantastic place has great planetarium shows and a cool museum attached.\n\nThe main attraction however was the telescope, well worth waiting for a clear and starry night to get the opportunity to gaze at the planets, and stars through such a great piece of historical gear.\n\nWill be going back next time I visit!",
          "Some cool exhibits, and an excellent film and guided intro to astronomy in their planetarium.",
          "Amazing afternoon trip in Wellington and very informative. Rather bring a few hours with you because there is a lot of information about the Universe.",
          "Awesome place, got watch the show..unique experience",

          "Enjoy science! Planetary films are very good for all ages.",
          "Friendly staff, fantastic show, educational and interesting exhibits and amazing gift shop. We really wanted to see thru the telescope but the night we visited the wind did help. The kids loved it - visiting with 4y and 7y olds.",

          "It was hard to turn my brain off and just enjoy the show \ud83d\ude03 Loved shearing a topic that I enjoy with my partner.",
          "This was an AWESOME place to visit on our holiday to Wellington. Our 2yo and 10yo both loved it here and there was plenty to keep them interested. We saw the \"We Are Stars\" show which was perfect for kids but still good for adults too. My \u2026",
          "The planetarium show is always good to see",
          "An awesome place to take kids, even as young as two. Lots of things to see and do but not too much. If you are a parent and need a break the 45min movies that show can keep kids occupied while you rest.",
          "We watched 'Matariki Dawn' with the kids. Master 5 was intrigued, Miss 3 was scared at the beginning but soon loved the rest of the show. I thought the show was great.",
          "Loved every minute. Great for adults and kids",

          "Educational and exciting. Great quality.",
          "Loved it!",
          "I love planetariums! Good museum, takes about an hour to see it all, or a quick 15 minute walk through if you don't have time. Excellent planetarium shows, but watch out for changing schedules, they change with the school terms.",

          "Looked interesting but closed when I visited.",
          "Fantastic way to spend an evening! The planetarium feels new with fun multimedia displays and a huge variety of shows for all ages in the dome. Clear nights also allow telescope viewing of celestial bodies, which was a lot of fun.",

          "Fun planetarium shows, many of them especially designed to appeal to children and those in non-science fields. Exhibition is geared towards similar minds, showing off aspects of rockets, satellites, earth, planets, and other solar system bodies. ",

          "This was our first time at the Space Place and my 8 year old grandson and myself thoroughly enjoyed it. The displays were great, very interactive, and we watched the Astronaut show. I would highly recommend this for a visit.",
          "Went here with my partner for a special occasion, there was a viewing of some sorts, and it was absolutely beautiful and stunning!",
          "Loved visiting this place I didn\u2019t realise it was even there until the lady from the cable care museum mentioned it. My youngest especially loved it. I did think the price was a little steep for 1 adult and 2 children but all up it was a good visit.",
          "For a family of 4 we spent $45 to get in. We were informed that the price is the same whether you watch the 25min video offered or not. We didn't have time to stay for the video. I think there should be a different price of you don't want h the show. There were a few interactive",
          "Great for kids or anyone who has a passion for space. Located at the top of the cable car route, it is very easy to find. Not quite as large as I expected, but great for our 4 year old who LOVES space. After dark on nice evenings you can use the telescope - we were too tired",
          "Went today and seen the telescope but didn't get to use it, it says you can look though the telescope but not today not really worth $14 to view a few displays. Website doesn't really give details on how to access the car park for disable people.",
          "I recently visited space place with my two children 8 and 12. What an incredible place, we saw a film called we are stars it was great for the kids to learn about the universe, and then looking at stars we can see in our night sky including Matariki was cool. We were also lucky",
          "This made my daughters entire day, she loved the experience. Wonderful staff. Just short distance from cable car, and easily accessible.",
          "Good place to learn about space, especially for the kids. Nice to learn about Kiwi rocket sceintists, such as Pickering. Show was a bit boring, but the talk that followed (like finding where the Southern Cross is) was great!",
          "Very friendly staff. I enjoyed the documentary presentation and the displays. You need to go there on a clear night though.",
          "If you want to learn more about the solar system and particularly the Southern Skies this is for you. There is a mock up of a rocket module where you can \u2018travel\u2019 to another planet. It\u2019s meant for children but still fun for us big kids! It is only a short walk from the cable",
          "My 8 year old son loved this place. The museum had lots of information and he loved opening the cupboards in the space station section and learning about life in space. We watched the Apollo show and learnt a lot. Would totally recommend doing a show. Would love to come back at",
          "It was a lovely experience to walk through the observatory Great explanations about planets in the solar system etc it was also you could be a commander of a spaceship going to Saturn that was fun. The meeting room was interesting with all the old books I wish I could have a",
          "We came here on a Tuesday night to go through the museum part of the building and to see one of the shows in the planetarium. We missed out on the first session as it was fully booked but got to see the 9pm session. The first half of the show was about the impact of climate on",
          "Saw the \"We are Stars\" Planetarium show - very well done. Show will help you those from the Northern hemisphere locate the Southern Cross. Lots of hands on exhibits for kids.",
          "We had a lot of fun exploring the different hands-on exhibits (even if I am in my mid 30s), learning about the solar system and space travel, and the Maori names for different solar objects. The video in the planetarium was pretty cool, although we did get a touch of vertigo",
          "I did enjoy my visit to the observatory, i thought it was well laid out and has something in there of interest for everyone. I was there on a Sunday morning and was there for one of the shows in the planetarium and I have to say it was very enjoyable and is was approx 45 mins.",
          "Our visit to the space place was informative and enjoyable. We wandered through the various exhibits, watched a movie on the domed roof, then looked at the planets Jupiter and Saturn through a 150 year old telescope. I was thrilled I could actually see the rings around Saturn",
          "We took the cable car up to the space place specifically to see through the telescope at the night sky except it was broken. So we chose to enter and watch a documentary. We weren\u2019t disappointed, so informative. My 8 year old love it. We then looked through the exhibits. Then",
          "This place was rated in the top two best places in Wellington for our daughter (Te Papa being the other). There were many interactive experiences that she could explore. She spent a long time playing in the rocket ship. The free show that was included in our entry ticket was",
          "It is always a pleasure to visit an observatory and here is no different. The observatory offers many out-of-this-world displays (literally) that we really liked. My friends and I went to the dinosaur show included with your ticket (I can't remember the name) in the planetarium",
          "Kids really enjoyed their Space Place visit. Lots to see in the museum. Shame weather was cloudy so telescope was closed. Saw the We Are All Stars show in the planetarium. Would highly recommend it for the whole family. Staff were really helpful.",
          "Had family down and the ages varied from 7-14 yrs old. Good show and the talk afterwards was informative and it\u2019s good to know the names of some of the stars or where planets are.",
          "Our children really enjoyed the Observatory. They particularly liked the short film about dinosaurs and we all found the talk about the night sky (and how to find various stars in the southern hemisphere) really interesting.",
          "It's a fun day out for kids. Check out the planetarium show schedule so that your little one can make the most of it.",
          "We took the cable car to the botanical gardens and walked around and saw the Space Place so went in to see what shows were on. There were different things available concentrating on different aspects. We went to the 8pm show which was about star formation followed by a look at",
          "I can't believe we waited so long to go here! Once for a kids birthday party - really well organised and friendly / fun staff to run it. So many informative, fun and interactive exhibits packed into such a small space.",
          "Let me start with the movie, some are designed for children and some for everyone. I chose one that wasn\u2019t specifically for children but although parts of it were very interesting, a lot of it was very child-like in my opinion. The museum was great, really interesting with a few",
          "We took the Cable Car from Lambton Quay up to the top. We had a look around and then went to Space Place. Absolutely fantastic if you have kids that are interested in the Earth, Solar System and the environment. We stayed for the 9pm show narrated by Liam Neeson and we then went",
          "A great place to learn for young and old. My son is 4 years old and he loved it just as much as me. We watched a film of the stars and galaxy on a ceiling cinema, it was amazing. Was like looking up at the real sky",
          "We had an afternoon to kill in Wellington and saw signs for this after exiting the cable car. My kids wanted to go, and we had a really nice time. There are a lot of good exhibits on the solar system, stars, Maori cosmology and you can see the old telescope. My kids also",
          "Arrived in time to see \"We are Stars\" in the Planetarium, which was well done, interesting and informative. Accompanying verbal commentary was science-made- easy flavour targeted at children and OK for adults. Around in the main display area, the info was presented in lots of",
          "This is one of the best things to do in Wellington, especially with kids. Make sure you book into their show, takes about 45 mins and was incredible! We learnt so much about space as we lay back in the chairs looking up at the show. I couldn't recommend more.",
          "Very well laid out displays with lots of information and cool stuff to see. You get one planetarium show included in the price, but it was inexpensive to add a second. The \"We Are Aliens\" was good but the \"Dinosaurs at Dusk\" was excellent - my 7 year old thoroughly enjoyed this.",
          "The museum displays are imaginative and well laid out. The planetarium demonstration was a bit disappointing as the commentary was aimed at children although the larger portion of the audience was adult.",
          "The Plantarium show was very good and clear and this was topped off by a student very credibly talking through what can currently be seen at night. We thought the museum exhibition was also. very good & clear. For once the presentation had not been dumbed down too much for",
          "This is a great place for adults and children alike. There is so much information about space and the planets and a lot of hands on activity. There are very informative short films in the museum part of the place and then there is the main feature film which lasts about 20",
          "Took my 17yr old teen with me to visit the Space Place. An unexpected little gem! One of my favourite excursions of our whirlwind trip to Wellington. We took the cable car to get there which was far more convenient for us than driving and finding parking as the cable car",
          "A bit pricey for whats there - would have loved to looked through the telescope at night but sadly weather didnt play ball :(",
          "The observatory is no longer in use but performs a dual role of museum and planetarium. A good place to take kids as it has interactive exhibits & displaye, the planetarium shows is very good - get seats at the rear closest to the operator for the best viewing. An enjoyable",
          "Had a great time one night here. Watched a show and checked out all the exhibits. Had a clear night which was great but even at 7pm it took me a while to find the observatory from the carpark!",
          "Cool activity at night to take the kids to, especially if it is a clear night and they have the 100yr old telescope open - a work of art in itself. Lots of interactive displays and the dome theater is great with educational talk at the end looking at the night sky.",
          "Very cool place to visit for adults and kids alike. Our 8 year old had a monster of a time and hasn't stopped talking about it since. There are various films to catch in the planetarium and you can learn heaps about our solar system and more all while reclining in pure comfort.",
          "This is a fun spot on the cliff park overlooking the city. There are interactive exhibits for adults, young adults, and youngsters. The telescope is beautiful, even if it isn't open the night you see it. Definitely make time for a movie, though. We chose to show up to watch",
          "We adopted a binary star - 2 stars that look like 1 in the sky but through a telescope are actually 2 side by side. It was a gift from me to my fianc\u00e9. We explored the museum and watched a movie in the observatory theatre. They have a very large beautiful telescope that on the",
          "It was a bit hard to sort out the parking but once we found it was worth the effort. Well priced experience.",
          "We took a ride up the cable car which was an easy way to get up there. Was a cool video and informative look at the night sky. Bit sad the telescope was out if action but the rest of the place was great. The kids loved it there, would definitely recommend bringing kids her but",
          "Had never been here even though I lived in Wellington for 10 years! But was very glad we went on a recent trip. My daughter (11) and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit - and learnt so much. Loved especially the information about the birth of the universe and life on board the space",
          "I\u2019m not sure who really wanted to go in our family. The husband or the boys. I think the former. It was $40 for a family with up to 4 kids. This included the space place centre one short film and a brief presentation from the astrologist. Having visited the museums in town, I",
          "Excellent place to visit and learn. Shows are a bonus! only one negative comment - after being asked by the presenter not to use phones during the show I had two young girls next to me who couldn't stay off their phones it was most annoying so I just had to say something to them!",
          "We all enjoyed our visit here. It was a cloudy night so we couldn\u2019t use the telescope. Plenty of other stuff to look at though. Will visit again next time we are in Wellington. Thank you.",
          "Went to see \u2018Bella Gaia\u2019, very visually beautiful show. The museum here has a lot to look at and is interesting for kids and adults alike. Great gift shop and lucky dips \ud83d\ude0b",
          "Sat with head cranked up in planetarium, watching southern stars, we got lecture from native style navigators, crews learning navigation were there as part of their schooling. Beginning , during and end native language, then English, traditional and navigation chants. Museum is",
          "I could have spent all day there. So much information to take in, so much information I had no idea about. Do yourself a favour and take the kids.",
          "Not bad, but I can\u2019t rave about it either. Nice exhibits and theater experience, but it definitely needs an upgrade to digital or HD. Went during the day, but my guess is that night viewing would have too much city light. Glad we saw it, but couldn\u2019t really recommend\u2026",
          "The reasonable entry price includes a planetarium visit of approx 1 hour and plenty to learn. The level of information provided would be of interest to most ages with topics including early explorers and navigating by the stars, to planetary information and daily life in space.",
          "We dropped in whilst walking through the gardens when a shower threatened with the intention of just a short visit. In reality we were there a couple of hours and it could have been longer. The movie and the trip through the night sky are superb and totally absorbing and time",
          "This small museum on astronomy offers a large selection of multimedia shows with interesting information about the Universe. Particularly interesting was the Maori view of the origin of the Universe. The scientific information presented in the museum is accurate, the facts are",
          "The video in this cinema is great! The museum is so informative, we just loved it. Could stay here for many more hours! The money worth to come here! Go on a walk through the botanical garden first and then go to the observatory in the evening!",
          "After getting off the cable car, we took a short walk to the space place (about 5 mins) with the kids, great little space museum with lots of interactive exhibits to keep the kids interested. Lots about the maori and their relationship wiith the stars which was cool. Checked out",
          "My daughter (in her 20's) had been here before and loved it and seeing as it was such a nice night we went to the last show of the evening at 9pm. Due to it being summer, any star gazing wouldn't happen until 10pm. However there is more to the Space Place than just the awesome",
          "Surprisingly, we learnt about the Space Place from an article in Australian newspaper, but saw very little advertising of its whereabouts in Wellington. If you didn't know about it in advance then you would probably miss its entrance adjacent to the Carter Observatory. It is",
          "The exhibition is really cool and very interesting. We just walked in at about 7pm on a Friday night and were lucky that there was a planetarium show on soon. The movie we watched with Liam Neeson as the narrator was really cool and good value for money. The young lady who did",
          "I absolutely loved my visit to the space place. I was fortunate enough to have my own personal guide show in the dome theatre. A great animated film called we are all stars - so cool - if i had been shown this at school i would have got into science i think for sure. then the",
          "went there with my son and he goes crazy. he was pointing this and that he was so amazed as he really like the solar system! he was telling me that some of the stuff are wrong so i was covering his mouth and giggling.(not sure if there is really something wrong but i bet",
          "Excellent entertainment for children aged 8-12 years and the Gallery next to it is excellent too. The staff are excellent to communicate with which makes it so easy as a grandmother with 4 grandchildren to look after. Because it is by the Botanical Gardens there are other",
          "We are a family with kids aged 7 and 9. We were in Wellington for two nights and had decided Space Place might be a good place to visit in the evening. We hopped aboard the cable car after dinner on a Friday night - the tunnels were fabulous at night as was the night view over",
          "What an outstanding experience, worth every dollar, highly recommended. You won't be disappointed - $12.50 well spent.",
          "This was a smaller building then I was expecting and the best thing about it was also the worst: it was designed for children. I could easily imagine my nephew and elementary enjoying this. However, I went on a Tuesday night and there were twenty some elementary age Boy Scouts",
          "The Space Place Museum is focused on the planets that circle our sun and the galaxy that surrounds us. Exhibits were educational and interesting with thought provoking insights. The observartory show presented the Maori stories of the various constellations and stellar events.",
          "Asked the staff about the age the show was pitched at... No help there. Took my 4 year old in... she almost died...concepts and language way above her. I would say 8 yrs at a minimum... the space module was cool though.",
          "This is well worth a visit by someone of any age or solo or families and couples,. The interactives are well worth doing as well is looking at the educational material and playing the.games to teach kids and adults about space, planets and the universe. The show was 3D and all",
          "A great little museum with colourful, interesting displays. The two real jewels are the telescope itself, which is a fantastic old piece of kit and the star dome, which allows you to recline back and see projections of the night sky overhead. Also check out the events held often",
          "The space place was one of the most excellent experience that we had in wellington or at least that's what I thought",
          "Hadn't been to an observatory before and so was slightly disappointed with the presentation which seemed more suitable for children. However, the guide knew what he was talking about and kept us all enthralled.",
          "Space Place was awesome because there is a commit and part of the moon to touch I think you should definitely give it some time to think about it.",
          "The carter observatory (aka space place) is a great way to learn about the thing we call space I highly recommend watching the documentary in the dome. it's an experience I won't forget!",
          "Space Place is a cool astronomy place. I liked the theater room where you got to learn about stars and constellations. I also liked learning about the temperatures of each different planet.",
          "my girls are 11 and 12 years old they loved it too!! so interesting the digital show in the dome was amazing and we learnt so much about the stars and how things started we all loved it a lot and the price was so reasonable for a family, well done guys would recommend this to",
          "space place is amazing it is so cool I was the sun in the tour room and I had to hold 8 rings on my finger for all the planets",
          "space place was very good because you can watch videos about space and planets and how space works IT IS FUN",
          "It was a cool place but not as cool as I thought but the monitor was really cool and the videos were great please take this in thank",
          "I grew up with a planetarium in Minneapolis and I loved it so much. This is a great museum, very informative and. Ow overwhelming. We saw a great 45-minute video on Astronomers and then a tour of the southern sky. it was great! So glad that children of this are have this",
          "space place is very cool. i learnt lots of new stuff. the games that you could play there were awesome.",
          "A wonderful experience. Small planetarium but nice shows. Definitely worth it if you want to know more about the wonderful views of the various Stars and planets you see in the Southern skies",
          "We happened to be in Wellington on a night when Space Place was open in the evening so we took the cable car up the hill (note: they have fun colored lights on the cable car at night!), took some photos from the great viewing point then walked the short distance to the",
          "Being from the northern hemisphere I was keen to learn more about the southern hemisphere night sky and was not disappointed with this very well presented observatory.",
          "The space place has a great planetarium which shows exciting featurettes. The museum itself is beautifully assembled and has loads of interesting facts to absorb. I would say this is a good pace for families (some of the planetarium shows are aimed towards kids) but its also",
          "Located at the top of the hill in the Botanical Gardens. We loved the educational experience as you lean about the earth and the big bang of creation, how the galaxy and planets formed and why black holes are not so scary. This educational experience is great for young and old",
          "We had an evening visit to the Observatory which I can highly recommend. We attended an interesting talk about different types of Aurora and then went to the main event about the stars in our sky. It is very comfortable and lovely looking up to the dome and watching as you are",
          "When you get out at the top of the cable car, go right - at night it isn't necessarily clear which way you should go, and the GPS on a phone doesn't always help! The observatory has a number of shows in their theatre - check them out before you go. I saw Bella Gaia, which was",
          "Nothing like I've ever seen before! Was just amazing. Learning and looking up at the stars and planets. After we got to look at the telescope and see the stars.",
          "At the top of the Cable Car area near the cable car Museum. Small fee to enter, they are open late, better to visit at night when stars are out so you can enjoy what they are best at.",
          "this seemingly small museum has information that will keep you entertained for hours, not even counting the planetarium itself!!! would go again :)",
          "45 minute show with film about earth's climate followed by tour of night sky. Not as detailed as some previous visits but good value at $12.50 for adults and trip up in cable car works. Just made last trip down after show.",
          "Loved the film, loved the museum, loved the planeterium, the film and the commentary.. Fascinating for sure",
          "I cannot wait to come back!!! Amazing staff, it's out of this world awesome! It was too cloudy to use the big telescope but I will be back \ud83d\ude00. Thanks guys. That was the highlight of my birthday x",
          "This is definitely a gem at the end of the cable car ride. For the cost and minimal advertising I'd seen I was overwhelmed and entertained by this place. The staff are friendly,helpful and informative. The \"show\" was outstanding and interesting. Great for kids and adults",
          "I learnt so much about the Stars and where to look for certain constellations.... there was so much information to be had and made me want to learn more!",
          "If you or your kids like space then this is a great place. The show is stunning and the displays are hands on and interesting",
          "A small but informationally packed observatory. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. They gave us a lot of pointers on how the southern sky is different from the northern sky, what to look for in the skies this time of the year, etc. In addition to modern scientific exhibits,",
          "We were looking for a kid friendly activity on a wet day and the Space Place did not disappoint. While parking was a little tricky, the short walk was well-worth the effort. The museum displays were varied interesting and informative as well as being thoroughly engaging for",
          "We were walking in the Botanic garden and saw the space place, paid $39 for 2+2 and got to see a show about about space and stars. It was ok but not great. There were a senior (in the 75-80) from Europe standing in the ticket line in front of me, he wasn't permitted the senior",
          "Many interesting stuff there. Very educational. As myself being very interested in astronomy, I recommend this place to everyone.",
          "Was a great place to visit, had alot of fun If you are an astronomer, probably not the best place to visit, but for those who what to learn a little, then certainly the place to go",
          "We saw the sign to the Space Place when we took the cable car up the mountain and it is just a very short walk along the path. I love anything to do with outerspace and were pleased to find it open due to the school holidays' extended hours. There are very good information",
          "Great for kids in terms of interaction. .lots to touch and see .. adults get the education though ..a great destination in the wet",
          "If you are interested in space in general, this is a good trip as it presents lots of information about our own solar system as well as what lies beyond it. We went to the viewing of Dynamic earth, narrated by Liam Neeson, and it was interesting but unfortunately some panels in",
          "Unfortunately we arrived to late to see the planetarium but still had to pet full price to just go and look through the telescope. That said it was really good and the staff really accommodating and good at describing what we were looking at and the facts about the 150 year old",
          "Brought a European visitor here after a trip up the cable car on a Friday evening. Was impressed again by the astonishing array of displays of both cultural and scientific bents. Our 3 year old particularly loved the gravitational field demo with the rubber balls and the funnel.",
          "Great place, lots of information in the museum section, and they've done a great job with the displays. The planetarium was great too. I was sick when I came here so unfortunately I couldn't stay for the late night telescoping or the Tuesday talk which sounds like a treat.",
          "Ok I'm married to a geek. Space is right up his nerdy alley ... we both loved our visit here it had just as much information as each of us needed ( me less him more) .The planetarium shows are excellent. .. could have stayed all night happily star gazing ... alas we visited on",
          "The shows are the best, absolutely fascinating. I watched one and walked out the book for the next (with a discount). I could go back and watch show after show.",
          "I've also ways been fascinated about astronomy. Hence this was in my bucket list of places on my trip to Wellington. This is located on a hill top near the cable car museum and the Wellington Skyline. So if you are planning to visit any of these places or the Welling ton",
          "Hopped off the Cable car and walked up to the observatory grounds for more pictures of the view. Decided to visit the observatory and we were so pleased we did. It is not a large exhibition but it is well designed and very engaging. Standing on the platform that allowed you to",
          "This was well worth the expense. Several hands-on exhibits which the kids loved especially piloting the space shuttle to Mars!",
          "I took my 5 year old and 3 year old to this in the school holidays. The 5 year old loved it and would like to take her back again. The 3 year old was not interested and was a bit scared in the show, even though it was targeted for her age group. I found it on the $$ side so",
          "The Carter Observatory is a must for people into science and space exploration. It is not free, BUT I would advise that you take it on a clear Tuesday or Saturday night where they open up the Telescope in good weather and allow you to view the stars and the moon. A real bonus",
          "This was affordable and quite a surprise. We learnt a lot and plan to take our grandson next time. So cleaverly done, fun and educational!",
          "Been to a few observatories and this would have to be one of the best. Fantastic commentary and exhibits. Kids loved thier time at space place. Now I want to take the rest of the family.",
          "Great place to visit for families set in great grounds. You can even learn something at the same time. Staff very pleasant would be good for anyone although might be a little difficult for pensioners due to location.",
          "Well curated collection for science buffs and space lovers. We had no idea how sophisticated this educational gem was. Heaps to learn , see and do. Look out for special events at regular intervals.",
          "We went in the evening, the museum/exhibition was good and the show was informative too! Staff knowledgeable and helpful. Careful to choose show carefully as some are for kids - staff can advise. We went on a clear evening and this was a treat because the telescope was out, and",
          "Interactivity is a really good way to help understand something so complex as the universe. Space Place offers mediocre engagement with the exhibitions. The planetarium includes the latest in cinematic systems and the shows are contemporary and very interesting. Further",
          "The demonstration and activities we did were incredible aswell as the displays and explanations. The displays we looked at and experienced were awesome and the planetarium was the best. The way we watched the film in the planetarium was viewed at a whole new perspective. It was",
          "space place was boring but i could be fun for little people but i only enjoined the movie thing at the end it was BORING.",
          "You need to come here!!! The space place is so cool!!! The film was awesome and made me dizzy a few times, which was fun!!!",
          "Awesome love it. out of all planetariums this was the best due to the way I knew that the stars reassemble some sort of crypt ids and all sort of stuff and it was good to know that they have real rocks from planets , especially rocks and meteors.",
          "Ideal for anybody wanting to get \"closer\" to the skies. Great information and display for any level of astronomy.",
          "We visited Space Place right on 4.00pm to catch one of the shows on the Planetarium. The dinosaur show kept our 3 and 5 year old enthralled throughout and they were keen to talk about dinosaurs when they got home. The museum itself was highly engaging with plenty of hands on",
          "Some informative and interesting videos and information boards. Stuff for kids and adults. Great presentation in the observatory from a girl who was obviously very knowledgeable and enthusiastic.",
          "Very clean and warm environment. Staff were excellent in their recommendations and answering questions. The cosmic show was out of this world, very well presented",
          "A work event that included dinner, drinks and learning about the stars. Just a great evening and an amazing experience having the place to ourselves. Highly recommend.",
          "Some of the exhibits and facilities feel a bit dated but overall it was a great experience for anyone with an interest in space and/or astronomy. The (paid) movie was very good, and I particularly enjoyed the free movie inside that talked about Maori astronomy/history/mythology.",
          "If you're visiting Wellington, you definitely have to come here. This observatory offers you the chance to look through an old telescope and watch a fantastic movie in a circular room: you'll be sitting on a comfortable chair and watch a movie played on the ceiling. The movie",
          "We visited Carters Observatory on a clear night to cap off some school work on Space for the children. We were hoping to view the night sky on the large telescope at the observatory and we were very lucky that the wind stayed down and the clouds kept away. We had a great time",
          "We paid only 12,50 for a very interesting show about astronomy. The exhibition is great - I was impressed with its quality of the paints and objects. It's well worth. Good to take your kids as well.",
          "This is a great place to visit with the kids. Highly informative, with lots of interactive features for the children. We saw the dinosaurs show in the planetarium, followed by a short tour of the stars, which our 5 year old loved. We'll visit again for the night sky viewing",
          "Come here on a rainy day - or any day and your kids will be occupied for ages. There is an awesome space related 'movie' to watch in the cinema and then the exhibitions are hands on and fun for all ages - could spend an hour in this part along easily. Totally recommend. Take the",
          "Attended the 7pm show. It was interesting mainly for the domed planetarium screen; quite a way to watch stuff - it was oddly low on information though, so don't expect too much. The planetarium itself is awesome though, full of all sorts of stuff, well worth a visit. The weather",
          "This is a great place for kids and adults alike. Lot's of things to look at and explore. I really enjoyed the planetarium, and the show I saw was very well done, and the guide was very informative.",
          "Not much to add to this review what others haven't already said. Like any observatory, this one is equally enjoyable. Many exhibits to see and engage or interact with. We walked from bottom of hill up. Nice yet slight workout. Did not take the tram or bus. Wasn't far of",
          "Outside the observatory the views over Wellington are stunning. Once inside there is so much to see and do. A movie in the observatory was really interesting and then walking around the interactive exhibits. Not my first time here and will not be my last. I would rate this",
          "Excellent place to visit both for adults and kids. My son had a great time and learnt a lot. Good interactive and well set out displays",
          "At the top of the cable car. It is a great evening. We bought a city pass that included the observatory and cable car from the isite, great saving. We strolled around the gardens until sunset then went to the observatory. With entry to the observatory you choose to watch one",
          "Pop along to see a clever display of science and astronomy illustrated in clever visual exhibits. there is a cool gadget shop and if your kids are above 5 then the dome movie theatre will be fun to learn more about what's beyond our atmosphere...",
          "If you take the cable car up to the botanical garden then make sure you check out the observatory in the same area. Interesting place so get on your science caps. Enjoy!",
          "We did the tour where you see a film and then a guide talks about the night sky. Good fun and educational, and great for older children, as long as they can sit still and pay attention. We then walked around the exhibitions before leaving and walking back down to the city",
          "We really enjoyed exploring their displays and the show in the observatory was excellent and informative. They have a variety of shows, so I would recommend checking information on each show and their time table to determine which show meets your needs.",
          "Very interesting and informative. We took two young children, ages 3 and 6, and expected to have to leave part way through, but they were enthralled and did not want the show to end. Sit in the back rows to gain most from the views and the experience.",
          "The planetarium presentation spent too much time (for me) on earthly matters and not enough on the stars. That said it was an interesting and informative one. . Bits of moon rock and meteors to touch. Nice little gift shop",
          "This is a great little spot at the top of the cable car. Well worth a look if you are interested in space at all. Loved the movie show.",
          "We thought an hour would be enough but we\u2019re wrong. The kids got really interested, and then we walked around looking at everything on display and on top watched the 45 minutes space video. Not much to say besides: a must see while in Wellington !!!",
          "take the cable car to the top, walk a few steps to the observatory, sit back enjoy, a god idea is to call for what is on, but great",
          "The sky is the clearent in this part of the world (when its not raining), which makes it a perfect place to stargaze. The museum and the planeterium attraction were quite fun too! If in wellington, you will have to travel up the cable car and this is right there. Recommended for",
          "Good space museum at the top of the cable car. Was able to see the International space station and the southern cross in the night sky via a very powerful telescope.",
          "Great displays and information. The show we watched was high quality and well made but we recommend trying to sit at the back of the theatre so you can see more of the screen. Inside the observatory is really interesting. Recommended if you are interested in space or science or",
          "The narrator was very enthusiastic. We gained a decent amount of knowledge from her. Worth a visit if you're interested in astronomy.",
          "We are both Space buffs so I expected not to learn much but this was well done, well presented and well personalised describing the skies above Wellington in helpful detail. The show is just the right length and very well done.",
          "Great thing to do if you are up the cable car and its wet. Kids loved all the interaction with the displays. Adults might struggle with the movie in the dome but young ones come out full of knowledge.",
          "The museum and observatory shows are a great way to get kids interested in the stars and science in general. The changing themes of the shows mean there is variety and the quality and quantity of info in the museum warrants more than 1 visit",
          "I visited here to have a look around and see the planetarium. As an adult traveller, I can see how the Space Place is an excellent place for children and families who were absorbed in the various exhibits and activities. The digital planetarium was the highlight for me and I",
          "Really interesting and I have never been to a space observatory before. I especially like the overhead movie.",
          "Something Ive Always wanted to do and today I got the chance. Well worth the visit. The staff are realy friendly and helpful and the exhibit is truly amazing with great interactive activities. You must take the time to visit.",
          "Our 3.5yr old son had been to \"Family of the Sun\" with Grandparents a few months ago and came home excited about it, so we went one wet Sunday afternoon to see \"Tilt'. Enjoyable for adults and children, and under 's are free, so a good choice for us.",
          "We loved the Carter Observatory. We were able to go to a fabulously, educational show and the regular exhibits were just tops.",
          "We went to watch \"we are stars\" with kids 10 & 12 and all loved it. A great and informative half hour. After the show one of the staff takes you through the current night sky. After the show there is a fabulous shop to look around. The staff are great and explain everything in",
          "We watched the show (which is pretty cheesy) but we did learn a bit. There is so much information here, it was fantastic.",
          "As part of a much larger trip we spent a part of an hour here and loved it, its entertaining and well done",
          "A visit to the observatory for the \"We Are Stars\" show on a Thursday evening was a fabulous date activity. Tickets aren't expensive, and the animated show is really good (some of the narrative component felt more like a kids' show, but that's a minor complaint) along with a",
          "More or less stumbled across the Carter Observatory whilst strolling through the botanic gardens. Spontaneously decided to have a look at the exhibition and made it to one of the shows. Thought the material as well as the show were very interesting and well-presented for both",
          "Quite well presented for all ages. Friendly staff. Clean facilities. $12.50 for adults which includes one show in the Planetarium. Toilets available. Small gift shop too",
          "I spent 30 mins trying to find a car park. Apparently it's all illegal to park. We finally gave up and did something else. Maybe you have to find alternative transport and not drive there. Some random lady tried to helped us. But it was too much work.",
          "I really enjoyed this spot as an adult - we picked a show viewing time for adults before we went which was cool watched on the dome 360 degree theatre screen with a talk and visual on the local night sky afterwards. Then a look around the museum bit which was also interesting.",
          "the ticket price was only NZD12.50 and included a short movie, and a narration of Wellington's night sky from that very night. Learned some fun facts, included in your ticket price was looking around the museum, and looking out of the telescope if a clear night. Thankfully it",
          "I dragged my hubby here as it was on my bucket list. We watched the film at the beginning of the tour which is a new film and very informative- appropriate for children and adults. We were all very lucky as THANKFULLY the night sky cleared and we were able to view out of the old",
          "Awesome experience. The observatory are looking to partner with overseas observatories as well which could be a really exciting development. Fantastic place for staff xmas parties too.",
          "We had a very enjoyable visit to the Carter Observatory, just a minutes walk from the top of the Wellington Cable Car. Lots of very interesting displays that even kept our 3 year old interested for ages. The movie we saw in the star dome was called \"We are Aliens\" and I would",
          "This is a great destination for an afternoon walk up the hill, or a ride on the cable car. It includes the weather station and has a universe of information",
          "Check out their website to see what events are on, opening times, prices etc. Make sure you do the star dome and book in to use one of their big telescope evenings. Outstanding views of the stars with commentary.",
          "We spent a couple of hours wandering through the various displays. It was almost impossible to get my 8yo out of the kids interactive area. We missed the show (8yo was exhausted from all his adventures in space) but do not feel that we wasted our entrance as the rest of the",
          "My daughter is interested in space and planets etc and this is a great place. The telescope is great. If you wish to views it movies I recommend you to book and there is a limited amount of seats. A very interesting place",
          "The staff are pleasant, but we were misinformed as to the showing on the day we went. We had hoped for information about the galaxy and were shown a film about dinosaurs ! The seats were stained though quite comfortable.",
          "My 10 year old son loved it, almost as much as I did! Lovely staff, and the talk after the show was really informative, pointing out some of the stars we look at every night and telling us the story behind them. Really recommend you allow at least an hour to look through Space",
          "The planetarium is well worth a visit two great shows. But rug up it gets pretty windy on top of the mountain.",
          "Better check before your visit as when we were there at the end of June, it was closed for maintenance, a bit disappointing but can be left for our next visit to Wellington as if is such an exciting city.",
          "I stumbled across this after a trip up the mount on the cable car and what an amazing place . I was very impressed at the knowledge of the young man taking the lecture and as I was the only one thre he was able to show me what to look at in the night sky . This was a wonderful",
          "we visited the observatory on a whim and had a really great time. The presentation was really fun with the staff member leading the presentation being very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The unfortunate part was that there was a young boys birthday party so we had to sit in the",
          "What a fun and interesting museum. I particularly enjoyed the Astronaut film and learning about the night sky and where to find the Southern Cross and Makariki, etc. The galleries were really well presented too and are at a level that appeals to all age groups.",
          "We visited by cable car and spent half a day, watching the show, and exploring the grounds around. The show is not very high-tech, but does bring you the appreciation of how different the Southern hemisphere skies are from the northern that we take for granted all our lives.",
          "Well worth the trip up the hill. Lots of interactive displays and interesting information. I rather liked the theories of creation from a Maori point of view. Very nice telescope. The sky show was very well done.",
          "We went a while ago . What a great little observatory Excellent for both children and Adults alike.Everything is interactive and you can go around launching rockets .The star show was brilliant and very informative.show, which took you to various planetary systems.Well worth",
          "We had intended on getting the Cable Car up and walking down through the botanic gardens and once we were at the top the weather turned wet and we stumbled upon the observatory. They had a great exhibition and we did a session in the planetarium that was very entertaining,",
          "We went to the observatory for my sister's wedding and was highly impressed. The room was so lovely with books from WW1 all around. Great atmosphere.",
          "Not amazing, but not uncool... Pretty much aimed at kids and families. Very educational, but rather sterile",
          "Hands on exhibition and Planetarium shows daily. On Tuesdays & Saturdays the observatory is open until 9.30pm. We happened to chance upon the observatory on a clear Tuesday evening and after the Planetarium Show we were treated to seeing Jupiter through their massive",
          "The exhibit is extremely interactive and kept my children entertained each time we visited, which was at least 5 times! We watched nearly all of the movies over two weeks and loved them all. We found the staff very knowledgeable and friendly. Having visited several observatories",
          "Arrived at 10.15am on 19th May (opening hours advertised as from 10.00am) but informed that it wasn't opening until 11.00am. However a small group was let in as they had a \"booking\" Came back at 11.00am to find the advertised TILT show about to start. Was advised that in fact",
          "Great integration of Maori mythology and astronomy with a wonderful planetrarium and great staff. Small but very well done.",
          "Been to the planetarium a few time, with interesting short movies played on the dome ceiling, there are some interesting displays in the main area and you can get upclose to their heritage telescope.",
          "Head up the cable car, then a short walk and you get to see the planetarium presentation, which the kids loved and visitors got to see a good view of wellington",
          "We stopped in here at the top of the Botanic Garden for a very interesting planetarium show about navigating by the stars and Maori migration.",
          "I am a regular visitor to New Zealand, having lived here for 12 years before relocating overseas. I chose to spend the morning of my birthday here with my younger brohter (23) and my mother. All three of us had an excellent time! My brother is a scientist and was impressed with",
          "it was pretty cool, price was a bit steep but none the less it was still pretty cool learning about the night sky of wellington and how to find stars and planets as well as a little education on \"aliens\"",
          "Well priced and we enjoyed the show - the planetarium is a key part of it. Very well done displays which were informative and had a nice mix of Maroi cosmology and astronomy, which differentiated it from other observatories. Historical displays interesting.",
          "We had a bit of free time in wellington so decided to go to the Cater Observatory. Easy to get to as only a short walk from the top of the cable car. We had missed the start of a show when we arrived and didn't have enough time to wait for the next one. We went through the",
          "travel by cable car up then a short walk up a small hill to the top there is a little shop to buy drink and ice cream great for both children and adults alike there's a film about the night sky with a gentle man talking about the sky 10/10",
          "Really loved how easy it was to get too, how central it was to other attractions. Star show was lovely. Will try to avoid going again during school holidays though.",
          "We wandered in & were in time for the 45 min movie. So sat through it. Wouldn't rusg to do it again. Would be a lot more fun with space mad kids. But was still interesting.",
          "The displays had much interesting information displayed in an easy to understand way, but there was minimal interactivity there and working. What show is on varies, and sadly at the time we went it was not the one we would have preferred, but it was still good and the presenter",
          "We enjoyed the planetarium presentation, which we thought would be of particular value to children. Can't comment on the view through the telescope which wasn't open while we were there. Easy to get to because it's not far from the cable car station",
          "My first planetarium! Trippy flythru, voiced by a Doctor Who and run by a hardcase host. Tons of interactive displays. Only downer was we went on Tuesday, one of 2 late opening nights but it was too windy to open the dome for the telescope. Cable car ride was cool at night too.",
          "I so enjoyed seeing the stars and planets the guys there were helpful as novices and not a planets and stars persons we went there after a function up at gardens and what we learnt was real buzz....lol",
          "I felt that it was aimed at older children rather than adults. Also an inaccuracy - Energy does not equal Mass",
          "We went with a 4 year old and a 12 year old and everyone loved it! Plan ahead so you get there within a reasonable time of the next planetarium showing (especially with littlies) and if you go in the evening you may be able to go into the actually abservatory and look through",
          "Brilliant! Spent hours walking through the exhibition centre. There were displays, videos and interactive games. We also visited the multimedia centre the Planetarium and learnt about the night stars, black holes, etc.",
          "Get away from the hubub of the City centre, take the 10min cable car ride to the botanical gardens, and do something different! I did the planetary tour, where the Southern Hemisphere night sky was shown to us in good detail with the Maori descriptions and stories as well as",
          "I have been a few times and I always learn more, the kids are never bored either. A great family day out. Would recommend for visitors.",
          "Nice location and very informative. Recommended for kids. Tuesdays they are open till late night. It is rather small but worth a visit.",
          "Great exhibition area and very interesting theatre with 2 fascinating films - great escape on a wet day or even a dry one!",
          "We've lived in Wellington for nine years and only just got around to visiting the observatory. It's great! Really well presented displays, the interactive displays are very slick and nicely done. The show is a good experience - we saw a film about extreme weather on the other",
          "Wow! This is a marvellous experience whether or not you are interested in astronomy. The exhibition is just superb and so well arranged, both static and interactive it is great. And then the Show in the planetarium, is one of the best in the world. Don't miss this out of",
          "We spent an evening here whilst waiting for an overnight ferry. Paid parking is close by or you can catch the cable car up from the city centre. $47 for a family visit including a show. We went on a Tuesday evening and we saw a 9pm show after looking around their visitor centre.",
          "Each time I go to Welly I take my Down Syndrome Nephew and we go here and watch the shows, awesome venue with interesting shows. He father passed away in 2000 and he misses him so we go and look at the stars in the show they do and he says he can see his Dad, which is wonderful.",
          "After walking through the gardens on a very hot day we decided to stop by the place originally for the air con! We had a guided planetarium show which was amazing, I would recommend this for everyone, young or old! Definitely worth the money watching, and having a look around.",
          "This very small attraction can hold your attention for much longer than it seems at first glance. There is so much to read, watch and experience. Recently refurbished it is an excellent attraction, and recommend you go to one of the planetarium shows as they are well worth it.",
          "Even though I am not a space fan I found this museum very interesting and loved the show at the end the staff were very helpful with what to do and where to go",
          "Some members of party felt motion sickness in the shows due to the curved overhead screen - but I loved it. If you want to see multiple shows we experienced virtually the same talk on the night sky with each showing - felt it would have been goo to talk about skies other than",
          "Standing high above Wellington inside the Botanical Gardens for over 3/4s of a century this is a lovely observatory which was refurbished in 2010. The exhibits are good and the planetarium show is amazing and well worth the price.",
          "A lot to see and do here, the kids especially liked flying the rocket capsule. We were looking forward to viewing the night sky with the big telescope, unfortunately Wellington's wind meant they could not use it. The viewing of the film in the dome was unique and fun.",
          "work very well done on this observatory, didn't have time for any of the\"shows\" but its still worth a visit just for a quick look",
          "Spent an enjoyable 90 minutes here, the interactive displays are very informative and eye-catching and the 45 minute planetarium show good and rounds off the experience. Staff very helpful and knowledgeable.",
          "Heaps of things to see, very well put together and lots of information provided. Great interactive material and loved the fact they were open late. If you plan your trip ahead make sure you check the weather as we only stayed for 2 nights and the night they were opening the dome",
          "Definitely worth a visit - amazing displays and history. Hard to say anything else (an \"observatory\" says it all) - but go there; you won't be disappointed!",
          "Educational and very interesting with lots of activities for children and teenagers to get involved and learn something. Well worth a visit.",
          "My children, 5 & 7, enjoyed this very much. Was entertaining and informative. We touched a piece of moon! That was cool.",
          "When I organised my trip in Wellington, I made sure to include the Carter Observatory in my \"must visit\" list. I made sure we visited on a night when there was star gazing. (Tue & Sat only- open till 10pm) Indeed it was very educational for both adults n children. I wished we",
          "Took the cable car up the mountain and got to experience one of the planetarium shows. Very good value and show was fantastic. Recommend you check show times before you arrive to try and time your visit to match your preferred show.",
          "The Observatory mixes historical information with geologic and intergalactic evidence. The various explanatory panels are well designed and the audio-visual presentations are well delivered. There is lots of things to touch, twist, sit in and play with for the kids (and adults",
          "Interesting in the planetarium; being able to look up into the dome to view the 'stars etc' Haven't been at night to view the real stars etc yet though. Information centre.",
          "A very well presented video showing on the moon landing. The museum and displays were very educational.",
          "The observatory is located in the Botanical Gardens so is in a wonderful setting. The observatory itself has a rich amount of information and a planetarium is a superb experience which is a must.",
          "There has been a great improvement to the foyer of the observatory and the display rooms are full of information that will interest young and old. There are interactive displays, video clips and lots of educational toys for children. Star dome is really effective for viewing",
          "If you're over 10- skip the (not cheap) show. It is meant for small kids, and you'll learn almost nothing from it. The exhibition is nice, with free admission, and worth couple of minutes of your time.",
          "Good set up and planetarium shows a beat experience. It always is a bit busy trying to see through the telescope they should get some smaller portable ones and put them outside or something. The kids have fine here and it is certainly well set up for kids.",
          "Top of the hill right off the cable car ride and botanic gardens. The history of this place is awesome and the surrounding elements of star mapping and the overall tour are very informative. It is worthwhile as part of the total package at the top of the hill after the cable",
          "Took the walk-through and planetarium tours and found both very informative and value for money. Set in beautiful gardens.",
          "The Planetarium show is very informative - explaining how navigating by the stars works in the Southern Hemisphere. New Zealanders would benefit from going, although hopefully everyone already recognises the Southern Cross! The seats are so comfy and reclining in the dark made",
          "This is one of the top spots in NZ. the displays are informative and told in a language we could understand. The stargazing display, which was preceded by a very informative documentary about the space race, was very well done and showed were to find the various star groups in",
          "Off the beaten track and something different, I love this place. It is so interesting and educational but in a fun way. It really entices you to learn more about the solar system and just how amazing it is. The staff are really knowledgeable and friendly. I definitely recommend",
          "This was very interesting. Not advertised that it existed and even walking up to the observatory it did not appear to be anything to see but as soon as you get inside it was great. The staff were fantastic and displays were interactive. You can choose whether to pay to view an",
          "My son is really into rockets at the moment, so this was a great day out for him!! We did the show about aliens and were the only ones in there! It was probably just a bit long for my 2.5 year old, but he did stay still through the whole thing - just lost momentum a bit at the",
          "We went to the observatory, interesting seeing the film of moon landing, the star consolations not so much, ok to see if your interested in that sort of thing, maybe we just expected more for the price we had to pay....",
          "On a wet and rainy Wellington Saturday morning, not much to do a 7yr and 10yr old. We decided on Cable Car and Carter Observatory. Fantastic place to visit, so much information, but the best of them all was the 11am presentation in the Planetarium. The dome was the screen, lie",
          "I was disappointed by the experience we had in the planaterium here. The first half hour of the show was an advert for google xprize! I would have liked more stars and planets.",
          "Neat place to visit if you need to kill time, a bit on the expensive side as the place is quite small but staff were friendly. The place is more aimed for kids but still a nice place to go on a rainy day before a flight. The cable car ride up makes it fun too.",
          "Great venue like a museum about the universe. Really interesting with hands on exhibitions and lots of reading about all sorts to do with the planets, stars, universe etc. You could visit there several times a year. Disappointed we didn't get a look through the big telescope",
          "I found the Observatory really interesting as i went their yesterday with friends and found the staff very friendly helpful",
          "I have been to planetariums and observatories in the UK in London and Leicester and didn't feel that the Carter Observatory was any better than these. The displays and information on show were excellent- lots of detailed and interesting information for people of all ages and at",
          "The Carter Observatory is located at the top of the cable car in the Wellington Botanical Gardens. There are several price options depending on what you choose to view. For a very reasonable price, we got to look through an interesting exhibit before a movie (narrated by Buzz",
          "We took our 3 year old son here, he really enjoyed watching the movie in the dome and learning more about space. We really enjoyed it ourselves as well.",
          "This is a rather small observaytory (compared to those we have already visited) but it has a nice part for kids and quite a lot of the exhibits are hands-on which we always like a lot. We also enjoyed the movie and the explanation of the sky afterwards as the view from New",
          "Wonderful exhibits on astronomy and lots of hands on activities. The staff is warm, knowledgable and welcoming. I wish we could have spent more time....",
          "I took my 6 year old niece and we both really enjoyed it. Lots to see, some of it hands on for the littlies. We took in a show which was fantastic. The person hosting it explained the stars etc and pointed out things we could see in the night sky. A great experience. I would go",
          "Excellent displays cover a wide array of astronomy, making it useful to kids and adults alike. The 360\u00b0 Cinema has always something interesting showing. We enjoy every time we visit and even more so our growing boy. An essential Wellington attraction.",
          "Enjoyed getting there, comfortable seats, interesting and well explained ,great presentation. well worth going to.",
          "Take the Cable Car and have ride to the Observatory to see the wonders of the universe. Perfect activity for rainy days in Wellington.",
          "Wow what an incredible night I had with my mum here. We came for the late night on a beautiful clear Saturday to look through the telescope. We were so lucky, we got to see Saturn and it's rings!! Also always enjoy the shows in the dome. I will definitely be recommending",
          "We saw the documentary about the first man on the moon which was interesting. Looking around the exhibits later we found it informative, and interesting.",
          "It is brilliant. Seated in the back couple of rows, my grandchildren were so quiet, I doubted they were there!! We were all enthralled with this visit. The overhead projection of the strs and galaxies was amazing, not to mention, I can still be educated at 74 years old. I could",
          "We never actually made it in to see the planetarium show but the museum was free and surprisingly good, we ended up spending a good hour and a half looking around, if your interested in astronomy and space it is a must see.",
          "I popped in for the 3pm show and saw the 1 hour presentation before wondering about the observatory. They have hourly shows running. I\u2019ve never been to an observatory before so getting a taste of what\u2019s out there in space was really interesting. I must have a gaze at the night",
          "We had been looking forward to going here as had read some good reviews, but we were extremely disappointed and for us not worth the money. The Planetarium show was quite interesting and there were some fun interactive displays for children, but overall not much to interest we",
          "The exhibits here were just OK. The movie, on climate change, and the accompanying star talk were a waste of time and money. The movie had lots of dead time footage, and some inaccuracies (for example, stating that the carbon cycle was a one way street to pulling carbon out of",
          "Took my 9 y.o here whilst visiting Wellington. We spent the morning here and could have spent another couple of hours here bit had limited time. The school holiday program was on and we watched tilt which was very interesting in the planetarium. The lady that took the show",
          "This is a short walk from the cable car. It is free to view but you have to pay if there is a special exhibition on show. We found it good with interactive options especially suitable to children. The exhibits on space and New Zealanders who have or are currently working in this",
          "Would not have gone specially to visit but it was worth it. Well laid out, not too technical and not so much that you switch off",
          "We visited on family day, and the discount entry plus extra activities made this especially worthwhile. There was a treasure hunt, kite making and the launch of a new show, tilt. Our almost 4 year old had a great time. The usual displays are also well worth a visit and offer",
          "My wife is mad keen on the stars so whenever there is an observatory near by a visit is a must. We spent an informative and enjoyable 3 hours. We saw a film in the dome about going back to the moon and the very knowledgable Hari explained the stars we can see in the southern",
          "Smaller than we thought and not exactly worth the price we paid. It only take about slight over 1 hour to finish everything. The planetarium show was great though. The staff was knowledgeable and explained the stars well.",
          "I really enjoy the exhibition and the show. You can take the cable car to it from town or drive up and the views are wonderful. The lady who spoke after the show had a passion for the subject and this made you enjoy it even more",
          "We had been to the observatory about 9 years ago when the kids were a lot younger and because of that we had not really had the chance to take everything in. So on our second trip we had a leisurely walk through the exhibition and were able to thoroughly read the data on the",
          "Great views from the top and a really informative series of displays. We went to the late night session and were blessed with a clear night sky and had fabulous views of the southern night sky with expert direction. We also got to look through the large telescope for a super",
          "I went here at night with another homestay student and my family and really enjoyed the displays, the little gift shop with science-based gifts and especially the star show where different groups of constellations were shown on the roof. Unfortunately the giant telescope was",
          "excellent value for money. Good displays with enough interaction for the kids and interesting information for adults. Excellent planatarium show with amusing and informative narration by passionate staff. A must for families visiting wellington.",
          "As kids this would be brilliant, a two adults, maybe we were a decade or two too old. but it was still enjoyable. Aimed at kids, lots of interactive displays, excellent graphics on film shows.",
          "I took my two youngest children aged 11 and 12 to the Observatory on the 11th of January. We thought it was excellent value for money, and very informative. The children thoroughly enjoyed the history of space film, and the short features about the planets. Great setting at the",
          "Of everything there is to do in Wellington, this was what I was looking forward to the most. I visited the observatory on \"John's Hop on/off tour\". The driver recommended one hour at the stop, but I took two hours. I wish I'd asked for three. I should have, and wanted to,",
          "Children enjoyed the show at the observatory. Very good for kids and adults as well. Bit expensive when paying for a family.",
          "We love going to the observatory in Wellington, children and adults alike. State of the art facilities open to the public and a very nice tram ride up to the observatory if you travel up from Lambton Quay. Alternatively there is plenty of parking which is free at the Botanical",
          "Liked the show, plenty to read and learn, could easily use up 2 hrs if you were really keen.shows are $18 I think.",
          "The day of our visit to Carter Observatory, it was pouring down rain. We'd originally planned to do a trip on the cable car, etc. but decided against it due to the weather. We did brave the rain long enough to walk to the observatory and got soaked. There are beautiful views up",
          "Visited Carter for the first time, being a long time amateur astronomer I was impressed with the displays, the library was amazing. The young man who led the planetarium show did a great job, very friendly and informative. Carter is a great place to inspire peoples interest",
          "Must do experience. very interesting experience, and make you appreciate our place in the universe. I learnt a lot in the exhibits reading while my 10yr old wandered and explored on her terms nearby. the planetarium show is awesome, you lie back in comfy chairs and look at the",
          "A really interesting attraction,which provides another good excuse to use the cable car to the top of the hills overlooking Wellington. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I watched an interesting film and discussed astronomy afterwards with the staff member who presented",
          "This was an excellent place to learn about astronomy and the night sky in the southern hemisphere. The film about Maori stories of the night sky was really enjoyable. I would recommend the exhibition and the planetarium show.",
          "The fun starts by getting the cable car up to the observatory. The planetarium is great fun too . Exhibits etc are interesting, but all very much geared to children. Still worth a visit though",
          "Loved the Astronaut film and learning about all the constellations. Perfect activity for a wet-weather day.",
          "We visited twice, principally to look through the telescope. Check the weather and plan ahead. The volunteers are friendly and helpful.",
          "The observatory was conveniently located close to the Tram stop. It had a great astronomy museum with lots of videos and such. The Imax movies cost extra, but was worth it, especially for children.",
          "Interactive displays, various planetarium displays and knowledgeable staff all make for an interesting visit.",
          "This is a really neat interactive attraction. Great for the kids as they can get 'hands on' with the exhibits. There's also Planetarium shows that are really interesting and fun. Something for both the adults and children to enjoy. Really worth it",
          "Took the Cable Car up to the observatory so did not have far to walk. Lovely view of Wellington from up there, and we looked around at the other buildings up there - very interesting. A unique clock /sundial to one side of the observatory is a must see. We were able to walk",
          "we had a great time, the guy who did the talking did a great job, explaining and with added humor. we had a good look around, there was a kids party going on, so while we were doing the feel for the lift off child's were walking past pushing the buttons, so I few growly words",
          "good planetarium show that lasted around 45 minutes then a good 1-1.5 hrs spend wandering through the remainder reading and looking at all they had to offer. great to do on any day but especially if the weather is poor.",
          "If you are interested in stars and the universe this observatory is excellent. It was late in the day so unfortunately missed the special exhibitions but the journey through the different spaces was extremely interesting and especially the Southern Skies gallery and The Theatre.",
          "Arrived just before a show and waited to get in the show, wandered around the exhibition and really enjoyed what we saw, the show is well worth the money - the chairs are so comfortable you could easily fall asleep when the lights are dimmed. Well worth the fees charged, they",
          "Its a great place to stop by when you are doing your botanical gardens walk. Good exhibition with plenty of very helpful staff. The planetarium show is also worth a visit, it is nice to get an explanation of all the southern skies and link it to the local mythology.",
          "We loved the interactive information in the Carter Observatory. We could have spent 3-4 hrs there, but only had 1.5 hours. The planetarium experience is a must - fantastic commentary and information provided by the staff. Our daughter was inspired, and went on to spend the",
          "If you are into astronomy and space exploration, the museum is a great place to go. A lot of trouble has gone into imaginative displays. But best yet was the enthusiastically presented show. do both if you have the time.",
          "Good educational family fun. Avoid the shop behind the counter if you have kids and no credit card with you!",
          "Loads to see there! A very interesting show told us lots about the night sky but sadly it was too cloudy to use the telescopes. The displays there are well presented and so informative... only wish we had had more time there!",
          "We made a trip to the Observatory yesterday at about 4:00 only to find that the last planetarium show was at 3:00, so be aware that while the museum is open until 5:00, there are only planetarium shows at 11:00 a.m, 12:30 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. The show concentrated on the Southern",
          "I was not actually planning to visit this but since I was there I wandered in. Due to the time I was there, there were no shows, viewings, talks etc. I think without these the rest of the displays on their own do not make for an especially exciting or interesting experience but",
          "This was the most amazing place. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. My 9 year old son is still raving about it. Awesome, awesome, awesome!! Our favourite place in Wellington",
          "We have been before and really enjoyed the show and talk by the astronomer. There are lots of different shows and they are really well produced and a great activity if it's raining in Wellington.",
          "Loved it, took my sister with me and my partner, was very intrigued and interested in all of it. From start to end, is so worth it. Will be back.",
          "What a warm, welcoming oasis of interesting information. It was a cold day in Wellington and I'd reached the top of the Cable Car but couldn't face the Botanical Gardens in the rain. Only a few metres down a (surprisingly hidden) pathway I came across the Observatory and",
          "Very well kept facility, with very friendly staff. All parents around Wellington should take their kids for a visit.",
          "If you're into stars, galaxies, Milky Way and stuff like that then this is definitely the place for you and your kids. Watch the Planetarium show for a more educational guided experience. Unfortunately, went there to watch on the telescope but wasn't able to since was told it",
          "I love observatories, so this is right up my alley. Excellent show, it's a must see for children and adults. The exhibit itself is pretty interesting but seeing the show made the experience worth it.",
          "I have always been a fan of science, so when I decided to take my sons to the Carter Observatory, it was really a fantastic experience! The presentations are excellent. I recommend thatbyou plan ahead of time by checking out their website and plot your schedule before heading",
          "We went to the Carter Observatory in a cold and windy day in Wellington(!) and its a perfect thing to do! The displays in the observatory are very good and more extensive than I though. Best of all they have a display room just for kids which includes a self drive game where the",
          "The Carter Observatory is perfectly situated at the top of the Botanic Gardens. From time to time various exhibitions and educational shows take place there, At times the genius of such can diminish due to some underwhelming host introductions.",
          "The exhibit is deceptively big - there is a lot to be learnt here, especially if you have an interest in space but know very little about it (like me). The show was also fascinating, and makes great use of the screen and seating. Afterwards the host was very enthusiastic about",
          "This was a well set up observatory and the film in the theatre was very informative & interesting. A lot to see and explore. Kids would love the hands on things to do & would learn a lot.",
          "We bought Star Passes for our family and you 'break even' in about 2.5 visits. The kids love it, it's a great day out and you get to watch as many movies as you like. Make an evening of it and go star gazing a couple of nights a week. It's really interactive for kids and",
          "Wonderful treat-escape from the hub-bub of the city Highly recommend for young & old, engaging, informative & helpful staff ... patient with questions. Return trip in hand",
          "kind of the best $20 i ever spent. there was a giant annimation called we are astronomers and it was narated by David Tennant and I am a huge fan. it was very informative and fun. i had a great time. and they have a little museum type thing you can go into too with a little",
          "Stumbled upon the observatory after wandering through the botanical gardens when I left the cable car. Wasn't willing to pay the entrance fee until I noted a sign that a U2 event was playing that evening to accompany wine and beer and a review of the southern hemisphere night",
          "This is just below the cable car station - so it's worth a detour if your are up there. Wouldn't make a special trip......kinda a bit run down.",
          "We had a great time on Valentines day. It is hard to stay awake using the super comfy recliners in the dark room ! The lady giving the presentation was very good, welcoming and entertaining. The telescopes at the end are an impressive site, but don't expect to see very close",
          "This place is cool. You have to see the show as part of your visit, it was the highlight for us. The museum is really interesting with lots of variety between reading, audio visual displays etc. You even get to touch a piece of moon rock. There is a display where you get to",
          "A mediocre observatory but you do get to know about the southern sky. Nice dome theatre and live narration by one of the astronomers who is available to answer questions.",
          "The Carter Observatory has the perfect mix of education and entertainment. We were fascinated and enthralled by the planetarium show, and the displays about space. The meteorites are surprisingly heavy!",
          "We just missed a show of the Planetarium which was disappointing but didn't feel like waiting over an hour for the next show. The display we did see, while interesting, wasn't really worth the cost, modest though it was. The most interesting part was being able to look at the",
          "Compact observatory with activites for everyone all year round and frequent planetarium shows. Very friendly staff who are always happy to give guidance. Definitely worth becoming a member as they always have different shows happening all the time!",
          "Situated at the top of the botanical gardens and close to the cable car, not just an observatory - more a collection! Well worth a visit - glad I did because otherwise, I might not have got to see what the southern skies really can offer at night!",
          "We enjoyed this particularly as it was at the top of the Wellington Gardens, and the rest was much needed but they did deliver and interesting insight into space.",
          "the exhibits and information at the observatory were excellent with many being interactive and the show in the theatre was fantastic (try and get a back row seat as it is harder to watch near the front)the commentary was clear and easy to understand and takes around 20mins.After",
          "The display and museum part is great, but the movie part was a bit of a bore and we could hardly understand the woman talking, we didn't find the ending very interesting at all.",
          "Carter Observatory is a very short walk from the top of the Cable Car, in the middle of the Botanic Gardens. It has good, informative and interactive displays and great shows. You might be able to get a glimpse at the telescope, which is a real historical treasure. Best to be",
          "This was excellent value for money and I will have to return with kids as we did not allow enough time. Great little planetarium with regular shows and the observatory is really well set out and informative with lots of interactive exhibits for kids and adults. Wish I had",
          "We caught the cable car up to the observatory and watched the last show of the day which was at 4pm. The show goes for 45 minutes, the cost includes the show as well as looking through the museum, very interesting.",
          "The Carter Observatory may be small, but it's interesting. The exhibits show the basics of space and its exploration including New Zealand's contributions, and also go into detail about the Maori view of planets and stars in their stories. The planetarium show is very",
          "We toured the Observatory as part of a group. The displays are informative and well presented. Interesting mix of history and contemporary science. The planetarium show was well narrated by a very enthusiatic guide. The Cooke Telescope (used to photograph Halley's Comet in",
          "alwasy a great destination, though I feel the kids love the shop as much as the displays! good telescope viewing via the cooke telescope whick is a museum piec in itself",
          "There were lots of stars to see in the excellent displays and film, but I'd really hoped to be able to look at them through the telescope. This was available for visitors to use, but sadly set only to view the moon. I'd have loved to see the S. hemisphere constellations a little",
          "I have always loved planetariums so when I found out I would be in Wellington where they have one, we decided to go in for a show. The exhibition is fabulous. It's aimed at children mainly but it took me way back to my youth. Lots of interactive exhibits all explaining",
          "At the top of the cable car is the Carter Observatory and Planetarium. This is a mix if static and interactive displays suited to adults, young and older children. The space show in the planetarium was very good as you looked at the Soviet and US space race. The show concludes",
          "It's an observatory, so it's basically like all others you'll go to. Good for kids but as an adult interested in getting to know more about the science itself you'll probably be disappointed. There's plenty to offer to keep kids interested though and it's got some interactive",
          "We weren't sure how much time we should allow for our visit to Carter observatory and had no plans for the rest of the afternoon when we got there, which was great because we ended up spending hours reading, watching short films and one longer film in the dome theatre. The staff",
          "To be honest, we would probably have not gone here had it not been for the dire weather. But we thoroughly enjoyed the couple of hours we spent here. The show was very good - we had to adjust to seeing the world from the other way up! The exhibits told you about the maori",
          "spent the morning of the eclipse here with all the excited staff! they taught everyone a lot and took the time to make sure everyone got a look! inside the observatory looks amazing and teamed with a trip in the cable car it works out to be an enjoyable day out in Wellington",
          "I love the way that Carter Observatory has been improving its programmes to make them more interesting for the general public with a basic astronomy knowledge. I am goin again in three weeks.",
          "We paid ten dollares each and there is not any kind of show and we could not have a look in the telescope.",
          "Having never been to an observatory presentation it was interesting, would have loved togoback at night",
          "We hadn't planned on coming to the observatory but did so on a whim after riding the cable car. The astronomer who did the presentation in the planetarium was fantastic...informative and humorous and didn't lose a beat even when someone in the audience started snoring! the rest",
          "We go every now and then for a look or to watch the new planetarium show. We love it. The staff are super friendly and know their stuff. We've gotten some great advice in the past and I always look forward to our next visit. Keep up the good work guys.",
          "We visited with a school group of 10 to 12 year olds. The observatory gave a good educational talk to the group and we went up to see the old telescope which was very interesting. The 'movie' however that was shown at the time was disappointing. Our group of children and the",
          "One of my favourite places in Wellington. If you have time, go to one of the 40 minute shows they play in the planetarium. You won't be disappointed.",
          "Loved the \"hands on\" atmosphere at the telescope viewing and the very enthusiastic young man who made it so interesting. The night show in the planetarium was great with a lovely hostess. What a wonderful experience for young and old. Thank you.",
          "But only a so-so planetarium show. Check for scheduled showings before you go, so that you don't end up with a National Geographic TV show presentation, instead of an actual star-viewing and exploring show. The static exhibits were extensive and well done, though.",
          "We became members recently and used our Star Passes well when we visited Wellington again this August/September. We took our 3-year-old grandson three times and he loved the 'gravity box' in the exhibition and some of the short films about the Milky Way, the planets etc. We then",
          "This is set in the Botanical Gardens above Wellington commonly accessed by the Cable Car. It explains a number of previously unknown facts about the earth, galaxies and beyond. It can consume more than the hour we had but does give the little ones a valuable insight into such",
          "A great way to spend a couple of hours. There are some interesting short videos to watch and some wonderfully fun interactive displays, to entertain both child and adult. The Planetarium was amazing and well worth going in to see. I was however disappointed in the shop, was",
          "Well presented film of the exploration of the stars and good display of NZ space pioneers didn't realise their involvement",
          "This isn't a place that I would normally viit and found it was really interesting and learnt a lot about the universe, space and waht they do at observatories",
          "Enjoy enjoy, very interesting and quite exciting. Able to buy passes and various movies etc. Great present for Christmas",
          "This is great for nerdy adolescents on a wet day. There is a movie about the planets, themed as a weather forecast. If you take the cable car to get there, that adds to the adventure. Nice view of wellington from the top. You can walk back to town, either straight down the",
          "We visited the carter observatory after having missed the closing time of the one in Auckland. Very helpful staff, and really interesting exhibition. I found the show to be very good, and the guy was very passionate, I just wish they had perhaps showed more movies rather than",
          "I wish that we had more time set aside when we visited this observatory. We watched a film of the universe which is shown on the ceiling of the theatre - feels that you are there in among the stars, but don't fall asleep because the seats are too comfortable!. There was a film",
          "We saw the \"We are Astronomers\" and the \"Matariki Show\" and it was a great night! Unfortunately the weather wasn't good enough for the telescope, but we still had a great time :-) I have always been a fan of Astronomy, so things like this just blow my mind away all the time!",
          "The shows are limited to available seats of course, so that means be there early! The show is really good. One pre-recorded one uses Ewan MacGregor's voice, bizarre but you are charmed by his Scottish lilt!",
          "Great little space museum with tons of info and great interactive pieces. Interesting information on traditional space history and Maori lore. Took in a show at the Planetarium which was the high light!",
          "Went for a rapid 1.5 hour visit. Its not a world class place but there a few attractions close by which bolsters the overall rating. I enjoyed the show they gave us. Take the cable car up, visit, walk back to town through the gardens in time to see parliament.",
          "I spent a fun and laidback (hahaha) hour at the obervatory. We saw a star chart and planetarium show (in laidback chairs). There is far more to see....lost about space and spacetravel, stars, meteors etc. I was thrilled to see reall meteors and to touch them, and the child with",
          "Very interesting if you are into astrology etc. Would recommend this trip combined with the Wellington Cable Car, a real bit of history.",
          "I had this amazing 45 minute journey through space with a pre recorded show about the solar system. The show is all about data collected from outer space by \"aerials\" that was put though orbit by scientists. Lean back, relax but don't fall asleep as you will miss this",
          "Great place. Interesting, well laid out displays. The dome movies / talks are great! Should have visited before now.",
          "We were lucky to go on a clear night and get to see Saturn through the telescope. It was a fun and cheap way to spend an evening.",
          "Everything has just been upgraded and the show is a real treat. We took some lovely freinds from New York and they were as impressed as we were! It is fun to look through the giant telescope.",
          "Wonderful to view the SOuthern Hemisphere and learn about the stars etc. CAn feel slightly sick as the earth spins but you get used to it.",

          "I'm from NYC and I LOVE the planetarium there, but this was so sweet and small and had a very nice show about the crazy weather on the other planets. The guide was very witty and informative.",
          "Took visiting parents and just loved it once again. Been before and the more you go the more you learn.",
          "We took the cable car from Lambton Quay, and wondered through the Botanical garden and that is where one finds the Carter Observatory, as it was Easter Saturday we could only look at the building and not get in, (too full). But it was also mid afternoon.",
          "The Carter Observatory is in the Wellington Botanic Gardens. It can be accessed from several directions, but my suggestion would be to ride the Cable Car going to the top of the gardens. Once inside, there is a great partly interactive display of all things astronomical, then a",

          "Very cool to experience the shots in space by rocket. Also interested in the various space plans FOR THE FUTURE.",
          "so much to learn what is up in the sky and this was great. Friendly staff and good atmosphere.",
          "31 march great time at carter observatory. We got to look through the biiiiiiiiiiig telescope and We got to see wildest weather in the solar system. I think u should go their. By Ryan",
          "The Carter has had a chequered history, eventually falling fallow for several years as it searched out a new business model and funders that would allow it to flourish. Well, it reopened a year or so ago and seems to be going strong. There are the usual exhibits on astronomy",
          "ok this would probaly be better at night but we went middle of the afternoon. The information in the observatory is detailed and really interesting considering im not into this stuff. Plenty of kids there on our visit who seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely. Don't think",
          "It was initially an escape from a very wild and windy day but it turned out to be a great experience (also very informative) I thing it would be a good family place to visit.",
          "I'm a local and I hadn't been to the observatory until this year. But it was fantastic! This small planetarum and observatory is bursting with well-presented information, and considers astronomy from the New Zealand perspective. I spent a couple of hours there, but there's still",
          "I took my wife and younger siblings. My wife and I ended up buying the annual Star pass thing, so we have already been back a number of times and seen every movie they are currently showing, which cuts the cost down significantly. The museum section is very fascinating,",
          "A great site for astronomy lovers. Really enjoyed the show.",
          "Wow. What a spectacular place. Sooooooooooooooo much information. A few interactive things to do and a \"classroom\" type setting for young ones to learn. The room where you go to see the night sky and learn a little about the stars etc is a must",
          "This was our first visit to the Observatory, although we've lived here for years. We enjoyed it. The exhibition is interesting and I could go through it again - plenty of interesting content. I particularly liked the library and telescope room - history fans will be",
          "Very good, newly installed exhibit where you can see pictures of planets, other galaxies, etc. There's a large telescope, which I wish was open for public use every day. And educational and inspiring movies.",
          "We're lucky to have this observatory in the heart of the city - skies are clear, production and information evenings are great - not particularly the most stunning in the world, but taking the kids to learn about the solar system and to view planets through telescopes, gives",
          "Crikey, what an amazing amount of informsation in here. Quick ride up on cable car in howling wind, but amazing views enroute. Lots of exhibits available to touch and the show of stars in the night sky topped it off. Comfy seats semi reclined where you looked up into a large",
          "lots of interesting information and clearly presented. The first half of the show -about space weather was interesting. The second half, about groups of stars we found plain boring to anyone who has ever seen Orion before.",

          "The best introduction to the Southern Sky. Compact yet chock full of creative, highly informative exhibits. Well worth a few hours of your day atop Wellington.",
          "We visited in December 2011. The museum displays are quite simple yet informative, probably more suited to children. The planetarium show was the wildest weather in the solar system which runs approx 25 minutes followed by a 10 minute show of what can be seen in the skies over",
          "The presentation dome is impressive but the Galleries are uninspiring and probably only exciting for children.",
          "V good exhibits and great movie - the best part !",
          "Visited the Observatory for the very first time, the multi-media exhibition was great - viewed the 'We are Astronomers' show in the planetarium - INCREDIBLE! Very informative, and impressive graphics - made you feels like you really were viewing the night sky!",
          "Rushed to get to the 8pm show at the observatory - impressive screen, but that's where the interest ended for me. Presenter obviously knew her stuff, but was really difficult to understand and lacked basic public speaking skills. Left very underwhelmed. . Also, the children in",
          "We visit the observatory every so often because our daughter (7) won a Star Pass and has always been interested in space. The observatory is quite small and low-key but our daughter loves going there, and we find it really interesting, too. The exhibits are well-presented, the",
          "Give yourself a couple hours to watch a show and check out the exhibit in the back. Lots of cool information and the show is informative. Our guide was great. Also enjoy the view at the top of the hill (but don't bother with the cable car).",
          "Hi I am a student from Kirkwood Intermediate. During our Camp in Wellington we had the Observatory for one of our camp activities. We all had great experience at the Carter Observatory. From the experience that we had at the Carter Observatory each and every child in my class",

          "combine with botanical gardens great views - go also to cable car museum",
          "An interesting small exhibition of the history of astronomy in the area, and astronomy in general. You can see an old 9 inch refractor in the observatory - wonderful engineering! and the show in the small \"planetarium\" covers the major landmarks of the Space Race before moving",
          "Walked there from my hotel and had a great time. I found it more interesting than Te Papa. Definitely worth a look.",
          "I can recommend going to the Carter Observatory at night as you see amazing things like Saturn! Really enjoyed looking up @ the night sky. Great presentation in the dome + interesting & informative displays. Really close to the beautiful Botanical Gardens & just a hop on the",
          "Easy access up the Wellington cablecar and short walk. Lots of interesting displays to look at before - and after - going into the planetarium. Good presentation and explanation of the night sky - kept an 8 year boy engaged. Don't go to sleep in the comfortable chairs in the",
          "We went to the Carter Observatory on a wet, windy Wellington afternoon (I can say this, we live there!). It was well worth going out in the rain. We were welcomed by the friendly staff as soon as we got through the door, the children were given an activity to do with the",
          "I discovered the Carter Observatory is a busy place on a Saturday night, when they have the dome open for telescope viewing. On my visit, it was pointed at Saturn, and the staff were very helpful in making sure we could spot this. The exhibition was very informative too, with",
          "Make sure you leave yourself enough time to really have a good look at all the displays as well as catch one of the great planetarium shows. Chock full of information about the universe and presented in a manner that's entertaining as well as educational. Don't miss the shows,",
          "I visited the Carter observatory years before and have really liked the changes that let your mind wander over time and space. Which is usually hard without a beer or glass of NZ wine! We liked the planetarium and movies and the sense of time that a good presentation enables",
          "The kids enjoyed the fabulous play equipment then we went to the Carter Observatory to see a 40 minute film presented on the domed ceiling of the theatre. Absolutely brilliant \u2013 one of the best doco films I\u2019ve seen. Not only totally fascinating and intriguing and mind boggling",
          "Can't believe I'm the first to review this - it's a fantastic little spot. You take the Cable Car from downtown Wellington up into the Botanic Gardens and then it's just 100m walk from the top to Carter Observatory. Carter reopened in April 2010 after a complete refit and it's"

        "wiki": "Wellington Electricity Lines Limited (Wellington Electricity) is an electricity distribution company, based in Wellington, New Zealand.\nWellington Electricity supplies electricity to approximately 400,000 consumers through over 164,500 installation connection points (ICPs) in its network that covers the Wellington city, Porirua and the Hutt Valley regions.\n\n\n== Ownership ==\nCheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Limited and Power Assets Holdings Limited together own 100 per cent of Wellington Electricity, with both companies being members of the Cheung Kong group of companies and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx).\n\n\n== Distribution network ==\n\nWellington Electricity uses a 33 kV sub-transmission network, with 11 kV high-voltage distribution and 230/400 V low-voltage distribution. The network comprises a high percentage of underground cabling, with 66% of the sub-transmission circuits being cabled. Wellington Electricity also owns and operates several rectifier stations and a 53 km network of DC cables in central Wellington, used to supply the trolleybus system.\nThe majority of electricity used in Wellington is taken from the national grid at Transpower substations located at Upper Hutt (Birchville), Haywards, Melling, Gracefield, Pauatahanui, Takapu Road (to the east of Linden), Kaiwharawhara, Wilton and Central Park (Mount Cook). The network also receives up to 12 MW of electricity from power generating facilities connected to the distribution network, including two landfill gas stations at Silverstream and Happy Valley, a gas fired cogeneration facility at Wellington Hospital, and a single wind turbine in Brooklyn.\nA major project was completed in 2012 to replace 33 kV underground cables that supply part of the Wellington Central Business district. New cables were installed from Wilton to Moore Street in Thorndon.\n\n\n=== Network statistics ===\n\n\n=== Network performance ===\nThe Wellington Electricity 2016 Information Disclosure reported the performance of the network for the 2015/16 year as follows:\nThis level of network performance means that average consumer typically experiences a power outage lasting 55 minutes once every 20 months.  However, Wellington is subject to severe storm events and high wind gusts that can cause extensive interruptions for some consumers. Normalised figures are exclusive of major weather events and outages.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ownership of Wellington Electricity has changed significantly since the early 1990s. At the start of the 90s, the Wellington City Council Municipal Electricity Department (MED) and the Hutt Valley Electric Power Board (HVEPB) merged their electricity assets. In 1992, the passing of the Energy Companies Act required that the various franchised electricity distribution and retailing organisations then operating in New Zealand become commercial power companies with a responsibility to operate as a successful business. Two new companies were formed, Capital Power and Energy Direct respectively.\nIn 1996, the Canadian owned power company TransAlta acquired both companies to form a consolidated Wellington electricity distribution network business. The  Electricity Industry Reform Act was passed in 1998, and this required that all electricity companies be split into either the lines (network) business or the supply business (generating and/or selling electricity) by 1 April 1999. Ownership of the lines network was passed to United Networks in 1998, which Vector acquired in 2003.In July 2008, the network was purchased by Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Limited and Hong Kong Electric Holdings Limited to create Wellington Electricity. Hong Kong Electric Holdings Limited changed its name on 16 February 2011 to Power Assets Holdings Limited.\n\n\n== See also ==\nElectricity sector in New Zealand\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWellington Electricity website",

          "The drive up wasn't very long. Very isolated but great open space feeling, right up at the top. Nice atmosphere. Apparently, there are few walktrails routes options that you can take if you want to explore more. Can see the usual sceneries of NZ many seas & mountains views",
          "Visiting Wellington Wind Turbine was spectacular for the surrounding scenery and to get good views of these gigantic modern windmills up close. Certainly very highly recommend visiting the same to any tourist.",
          "Well, this was deceiving. We loved the trip up to the turbine but when we arrived we had no idea actually how huge this turbine was. The view from up here is spic, the information boards per informative and you get to feel both isolated on top of the hill yet so close to the",
          "Went to see this huge windmill. The place is at quite a good altitude and gives you a really awesome view. You could actually see a few other windmills far away as well.",
          "You can of course walk up, but by car the road is narrow and winding, however worth the trip to see the city and surrounds from above and sense the size and power of the windmill",
          "Went up to see this, think the international student from Japan liked the view from up the hill more than learning about the turbine. Awkward road up there and footpath not very nice.",
          "But a great view to be hard and to see a turbine up close without a long walk interesting facts to read on the board too",
          "Great place to visit to have a look at the stunning scenery. Situated high up above Wellington the views are spectacular.",
          "A great view and an interesting thing to go check out. There seem to be a number of walking trails - we had my young boy with us so took an easier walk and he thought it was great.",
          "The turbine is a turbine so I wouldn't go to just see the turbine. However, it is built on a beautiful spot overlooking the entire city of Wellington. Getting there requires a car, but the trip is a pleasant drive along the coast.",
          "If in Wellington - visiting these things is a must.... if you're not into the engineering feat fo teh turbines, then the views will definitely blow you away. We have a beautiful backyard and this is one place you can appreciate it.",
          "You can see the wind turbines from my nieces home so we decided we needed to go visit. It was great. Beautiful day, amazing machines. Thoroughly enjoyed and appropriate for all ages.",
          "I took a trip up to the turbine with a Family group including a six year old (who was suitably impressed.) We have often seen this from a Relatives home across the valley,but it is hard to imagine the size until you are standing right underneath it. I was also surprised to",
          "One of the best and highest points to get great all round views out over Wellington. This turbine stands out on the horizon and is quite well sign posted, be warned though the roads are very tight with sharp angle turns and parked cars, not forgetting it\u2019s also a bus route!",
          "Whether you walk or drive up the hill the views are sensational. There is not much up at the top save for a small display about how they got the turbine up the hill, etc. The view is second to none - you can see nearly 360\u00b0. It can be quite windy and much colder up top.",
          "Those days where you have some hours to spare and not sure what to do, go visit this wind turbine, if you are with kids, they will love it! there are nice walkpaths to go for a stroll as well, so bring comfy shoes, you ll end up taking great pics and it is a lot of fun!",
          "We went with a few people for a Sunday walk through the Brooklin wind turbine. At the top, there is information to tell you about this place and when it was updated. The walkway is really good and the view from the top is amazing!",
          "Well worth visiting for locals and visitors alike. The view is worth every step if walking up, but if you are not up for the trek then there is easy car access with car parking. The turbine itself is pretty cool too.",

          "The view from the top of the hill is gorgeous! You can see the strait to the South Island and down to Wellington city. I've also been told that the hike/walk up is great though I was in a car. The track follows the perimeter of Zealandia. What I don't get is how the wind",

          "I enjoyed the stroll around the wind turbine. the view itself was enough for me, least of all the enormity of these wind turbines. Looking for a brisk walk out while in Wellington, visit here and get a taste of the reason shes known as windy Wellington!",
          "If you are into hiking and scenic views, you should check this one out. You will not be disappointed, though remember its VERY windy, make sure you have all the jackets, wind breakers and keep yourself warm! You can either take the car up and hike down and back. Its quite a",
          "Yes it's a wind turbine, yes there are plenty around Wellington however it's still awesome being able to stand under it as it works. Those giant blades going round and round and round... The views are pretty awesome too.",
          "the best way to see a wind farm. The farm is easy to access and do take time to walk around and see the old installations left from the war.",
          "Once you have seen one, you have seen them all. At least this one turns most of the time since Wellington can get quite windy. Not a big fan of wind turbines since they can kill birds and their intermittent operation means that backup power is always required.",
          "Very windy but good for sightseeing.To get here you will need a car otherwise, a good pair of walking shoes and a strong pair of lungs to get up the hill. Overall, not bad.",
          "If you're looking for the best views in Wellington you need to go here. Many tourists opt for Mount Victoria as it's recommended by hotels and tour guides, but this lookout is far better and gives you a sprawling view of Wellington, Lower Hutt, Eastbourne and the South Island.",
          "the view from the hill over Wellington here is not that great. you just see a lot of other turbines, so if you want to have a great view over Wellington, I would recommend other hills (Mount Victoria).",
          "It is steep climb to reach the top of Brookline Hill. It is well worth it because of the beautiful views of Wellington. At the top the wind really blows and it is fun to see the turbine spin. If riding in a tour bus you pass wonderful homes, gardens, and can see local people",
          "Ran up here one Saturday. A good step climb but great views. The sound of the turbine is quite freaky when the wind is really blowing.",
          "An iconic Wellington landmark on top of Brooklyn! Wellington Wind Turbine can be accessed either by foot or with a car, but in either case the views are stunning! Note that if walking up the hill, the walk will take at least an hour from the bottom of Brooklyn Hill, and you",
          "Landmark on hill above wellington, can hike up to for views and wind, not always turning due to weather conditions",
          "If you want a great all round view of Wellington, this is the place to go (on a clear day). There is the added bonus of getting close to wind turbine. Which, although a small one, is still rather impressive.",
          "The sole wind turbine in Wellington is nice visited on a sunny day. It's located in the Wellington suburb of Brooklyn up the very top of the hill. You can park and walk there or you drive up the narrow road and park directly up there. The view there is amazing and the wind",
          "Glad I made the effort to visit the turbine as the views I saw were great. I thought there might be a visitor centre or something especially as it is well sign posted but it is just one turbine and a view, so if you like views and it is a sunny day then go.",
          "There's something about the turbines that felt really elegant - we drove up & the view was amazing. You can also walk up; the view was breathtaking. :)",
          "A great view from the Wind Turbine Farm. A 360 degree view of the Wellington area. Let alone the fascinating information on Wind Turbines. You might think this isn't very exciting but it is very interesting and has great views. Even the drive up was good. Highly recommend",
          "A lovely still day to walk up to the turbine from Zealandia a different view from inside the fence line",
          "Yup, it's a wind turbine! No seriously it's an interesting place to see if you like a bit of engineering. If that doesn't float your boat there's always the walking tracks and the view is stunning. You're able to see the whole of Wellington. Would be a great spot for a sunrise",
          "The view is great there, but is optional in your trip to Wellington if you did go to Mount Victoria.",
          "If you're looking for a good vantage point of the city and also are vaguely interested in the history of windfarms - come on up. The first thing that will amaze you is how gigantic the things are.",
          "We visited The Wind Turbine on the weekend, first time since I was at school. Very windy up there but all part of the experience. Lovely information board to give you facts about how it was built. Fantastic views of Wellington from up there. Pretty cool to visit if you have a",
          "I regularly walk up to the Wind Turbine along the Zealandia Sanctuary fence line from Highbury. It's a great walk although you have to watch the slippery loose rocks that can cause a fall or two on the way down. The view from the top at the Turbine is fantastic and great for",

          "Whenever I have overseas visitors I take them to the normal tourist spots (the free ones like Mt Victoria, Wainuiomata Hill, etc) including the Wind Turbine. Highly educational and informative.",
          "The best part of the old wind turbine were the interpretive panels which showed you how much electricity wa being produced (and how many homes this could supply). For some reason these haven't been renewed. The new turbine is certainly huge when viewed from up close.",
          "We drove up here for the view. I didn't have much interest in the actual wind turbine. However, if you want to take great pictures I recommend driving up here for great views.",
          "Informative and educational static display about the turbine and how it works, when it was installed and then subsequently replaced. Fantastic views of Wellington on a lovely sunny day. You can drive very near it and easy walk to turbine.",
          "Great view of Wellington and surrounds. The road up to the turbine is very narrow and windy but worth the drive or walk for the energetic.",
          "Personally this was not worth the uphill walk although the views are good but they are better elsewhere.",
          "High above the city, up a breathtaking drive. To the top of the world, An awesome must do, lots of parking, trails for walkers and bikers and a suprb upclose look at a massive wind turbine. JUST DO IT!",
          "If you take the walking trail up to the windmill, it's a bit of a hike. The trail is very rocky and uneven (would not be fun if it's been raining as there will be mud) and fairly steep. However, you can drive up to the top, which may be a better option for some. The windmill",
          "An interesting attraction this wind turbine And this wind mill is actually smaller then the full size one's. You can feel the wind on your face",
          "You can walk or drive to the wind turbine. It has fabulous views over Wellington, the harbor, and Cook Strait. On a clear day you can see the South Island.",
          "Worth a trip up if you want a view of the city and sea. Expect the wind of course. Not sure its worth visiting for the turbine unless you have a particular interest in wind turbines. Best to walk up, via the tracks next to the Karori reserve.",
          "The largest wind turbine in the country. It was even more awesome being under it in 100kph winds. This powers 490 homes..",
          "This requires a car (or a mountain bike!) to get to the top of the Brooklyn Hill. Serious walkers can walk up many of the tracks that head up there from the city however). Amazing views from the Kaikoura Mountains in the South Island, to the Tararua and Ruahine Ranges to the",

          "Going past the wind turbines was view we had by taking the Kiwi Coastal Tour. Don't waste your time booking this by itself. If you're from the USA this is the smallest wind farm we've ever seen.",
          "Just visited the wind turbine, one week after it got working. Not quite there yet as the building site is still closed off. Very impressive turbine, even as you approach from the road you see these immense blades whooshing through the air. In a couple of months, it will be well",
          "Be blown away by 360 degree panoramic views of Wellington, a blistering windy day it was worth the trip to view the city's surroundings and the amazing park the birds all huddled on windless perches, i forgot my camera on this outing.",
          "For those who enjoy hunting top views, enjoy a strong breeze and are keen on renewable energy, this is the bees knees.",
          "Most of these turbines are in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Wellington and there are a lot of tracks for tramping there, so you could combine your visit with some physical exercise as well. It looks really huge when you are close to it and you can learn about how they are",
          "Worth the trip up above the city also next to a nature reserve that is in the city....the sounds of all the different bird songs are amazing. The few is incredible overlooking all of WEllington and the surrounding coastline and further inland up towards the Lower Hutt valley.",
          "Well worth the trip out to have a look. The scale of the farm is huge and it's really cool to get up close. The whole area is a big nature reserve (imagine saying that about other forms of power generation!) and there are various walking and mountain biking tracks (signs outline",
          "The wind farm is were a communication station used to be. There are displays with old photos of the sites, and you will be aware of the miserable life operators (and their families) got there. Howling winds, miserable weather. But when clouds open... then you catch a glimpse of",
          "Wow, what a knockout view. Almost think it is more beautiful than the Mt Victoria view. Brilliant to also walk up to the turbine rather than driving up.",
          "Outstanding 360 degree panaramic views of New Zealand's capital city Wellington, fantastic & sunny in Summer, a blistering nightmare in Winter but through all seasons it's worth the trip to view the city's surroundings.",
          "Hardly an attraction. Views aren't bad though we arrived there by accident. Not what I would rate as an attraction these days with thousands of the monstrosities all over the world now.",
          "Better view than on Mt. Victoria, but quite windy. You can go there by car or you walk like 3 km up the hill (which is exhausting).",
          "Read a few reviews about the Wellington Wind Turbine so had to suss it out. Very well worth the windy trip up the narrow roads. The view itself is fabulous and there is one turbine to view up close. Plenty of walking & bike tracks to enjoy too",
          "From a distance, yes it has some visual interest. Up close it is a little interesting. But if we'd just gone up to see this and nothing else I'd have considered it a poor use of time given there is so much to see in Wellington. Go for the view but don't expect to much from the",
          "I have lived in Welly for a few years and heard a lot about this place but thought I would have to drive to see it. My friends told me to come for a walk and we ended up there and I have found my new place to go when I have visitors. Awesome.",
          "Another great view of Wellington besides Mount Victoria. Super windy as well but great place to soak in the view.",
          "What a view.If you are game,you can walk up,or take the car like I did.Very interesting to see how the turbine works.Great view over the city or you can even see the south island on a clear day.On some days you can also be above the clouds standing up there.",

          "The first wind turbine in Wellington is situated at Brooklyn after a narrow and winding road to get up there. The wind was strong and there were some sheep farms nearby with horses running around. One can park the car to view the farm and the surrounding coastal areas - pretty",
          "Great for a walk up to the top or you can drive the wind turbine are huge . Also you can go through the gate with your mountain bike and do down hill . My son does it but not me . The views are great",

          "This was great for amazing views of Wellington, Great walk ways and another insight into how environmentally responsible New Zealand are trying to be. Worth a visit.",
          "It is a very short walk from the car park (anyone can do it) and the views across Cook Strait to the South Island in one direction and the city in the other are stupendous. Standing underneath the turbine and looking directly up at it can make you dizzy (the kids love it!). take",
          "Not only do you realize the size of the wind turbines but the views around Wellington from up there are amazing and well worth a visit. Don't forget your camera and make the most of panoramic shots.",

          "This is at the top of Brooklyn Hill which is about 10 minute drive from the city. Sometimes we walk up which takes an hour or so (one way). Up high like this you get a great view of Wellington and experience some of that Wellington wind that makes you feel alive. You don't need",
          "Visiting here was amazing but finding out the friends your staying with lived next to the turbine. Amazing views and gun turrets that have history dating back to the war.. amazing",

          "This place is a must visit if you are in wellington NZ. We were there last week and love the mountain view and the city of Wellington view. Also don't miss Mr Wellington memorial while you up there it is awesome.",
          "It's a bit of a trek outside of Welly but well worth it when you get to the top. Really interesting to read about the turbine and the area also looks good if your into mountain biking. Definitely recommended trip.",
          "Amazing panoramic views from the turbine. Its the place to get up close and personal with a massive wind turbine being able to get access right up to the structure. As you'd guess it was very windy and cold even on a warm day so make sure you've got a jacket. The access up to",
          "its is a site in itself, no loos. But, bikers start from here as do walkers to the radar site on the distant shore. take wind proofs and have a flask in the car for when you get back. even a change of clothes for if its raining you will get wet! Mike",

          "This place has a gate so is only open during daylight hours and is open for an hour less in winter I think. It's a steep windy track by road but at the top of it as well as the turbine information centre and the turbine itself you can see the predator-proof-fence of the",
          "Historical gem making use of Wellington's famous wind. Not too far from city and spectacular photos of the city and Cook Strait can be taken from here. Interesting story information available on the turbine and one can get quite close compared to other turbine sites.",
          "We parked in the car park & off we ventured on the 3.2 km walk along the access road. Not long into our walk we came across an Ostrich behind a rather large fence, This bird was a tad shy & was quick to shoot thru when a fellow Ostrich appeared. Not in the least bit shy the new",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "You may be looking for Old St. Paul's Cathedral, a destroyed cathedral in the City of London; or for Old Saint Paul's, Edinburgh, of the Scottish Episcopal Church.\nOld St Paul's is an historic site, a city landmark and a popular wedding and event venue in the heart of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand. The building served as the pro-cathedral (provisional cathedral) of the Diocese of Wellington of the Anglican Church between 1866 and 1964. It exemplifies 19th-century Gothic Revival architecture adapted to colonial conditions and materials, and stands at 34 Mulgrave Street, Thorndon, close to the parliament precinct.\n\n\n== History ==\nGeorge Selwyn, the first Bishop of New Zealand, purchased part of the site of the church in 1845 and Governor George Grey added to it in 1853, at which time the land stood on a prominent cliff-top overlooking Wellington harbour.  Agreement to build the church was reached by 1861 and the Reverend Frederick Thatcher, then vicar of St Paul's, Thorndon, was engaged as the architect.\nThe foundation stone was laid by Governor Grey on 21 August 1865. The building work was executed by John McLaggan and a team of eight carpenters, and the church was consecrated by Bishop Abraham on 6 June 1866.Soon after the church opened, it became apparent that it was unstable in high winds, and so the south transept, designed by Christian Julius Toxward, was added in 1868.  Later additions included the north transept and north-aisle\nextension, also by Toxward, in 1874; the moving of the chancel five metres to the east and the addition of minor north and south transepts to the design of George Fannin in 1876; the choir vestry in 1882, probably designed by Toxward; and extension of the baptistry as designed by Frederick de Jersey Clere in 1891. Thatcher\u2019s original wooden shingle roof was replaced with corrugated iron in 1895, and subsequently with Welsh slates in 1924.In 1964 the Diocese of Wellington moved to the new St Paul's Cathedral nearby.  After a significant battle to prevent its demolition, Old St Paul's was purchased by the New Zealand Government in 1967, and subsequently restored by the Ministry of Works under the guidance of Peter Sheppard.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nOld St Paul's is built in a Gothic style, albeit with a subdued effect due to the limited resources available. It is constructed from New Zealand native timbers, with stunning stained-glass windows. The interior has been likened to the upturned hull of an Elizabethan galleon, with exposed curving rimu trusses and kauri roof sarking.\n\n\n== Current situation ==\nOld St Paul's is now managed by Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga. While no longer used as a parish church, it remains consecrated, and is a popular venue for weddings, funerals and other services.\nThe flags displayed in the nave include the ensigns of the Royal Navy, the  New Zealand Merchant Navy and the United States Marine Corps (second division), which was stationed in Wellington during World War II. The church retains close links with the New Zealand Defence Force.\nSome of the walls and columns of Old St Paul's are decorated with memorial plaques, including many dedicated to those who fought and died in World War I.  There is a plaque in memory of Wellington historian John Beaglehole, most famous for his biography of explorer James Cook, but who also played a significant role in the fight to save Old St Paul's from demolition.Old St Paul's is closed from May 2019 until July 2020 for seismic strengthening work.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Old Saint Paul's at Wikimedia Commons\n\nA selection of \u00a9 photos taken during the architectural Restoration\nHistorical website about the church",

          "Not originally built to last as long as it has, Old St. Paul's is a simply gorgeous cathedral that still, somehow, has a homey feel to it. The building is undergoing some renovation to preserve its structure, and is being lovingly cared for by a consortium of public and private",

          "Its walking distance to town and only 3 minutes from the backbencher or the Thistle where you can replenish any fluids lost on the journey",
          "Beautifully preserved church tucked away but worth seeking out. Wonderful stained glass windows and amazing timber work",
          "Quiet unassuming church from the outside. When you enter you are taken back in time. The church is wooden from top to bottom. You feel warmth and reverence and intimacy when you enter. It feels much bigger inside than when you look from outside. The highlight of the visit",
          "Old and beautiful probably is the best to describe this church. Old in term of NZ history, more than 150 years old, do not compare to the churches histories in Europe. Beautiful because it was built from several native timbers of New Zealand, different parts of this church made",
          "The church is nice , completely made in wood and it's quite and calm . The right place for pry . The only thing I didn't like it was the the ATM machine ( for credit card) at the entrance to gather offers for the church . I know that money is important but It seemed to me",

          "Wow! Went to a Don McGlashan concert here and what a wonderful surprise. I was captivated by the wooden interior.",
          "Not a must-see, I think, but if you're strolling in or near the government center, Old St Paul's is worth a look, especially if you've every wondered what a Gothic would look like if done entirely in timber. There's much history in the old church, too, despite its relative",
          "The relocation of this chapel inside the larger St Paul's, is a beauty in itself. The restoration of the quaint wooden building is testament to great craftsmanship of the builders of NZ. It's beautiful, serene and peaceful.",
          "Having a couple hours free time in Wellington on a cruise stop, we went to both the new St. Paul's, then the Old St. Paul's. The \"old\" cathedral is a feast for the eyes, both architecturally & color-wise. The old, warm native woods used for the interior make it an incredible",
          "This deconsecrated church is magnificent. Thank goodness they did not demolish it, as was the plan as one point. Old St Paul's was built in 1865-6, and replaced by the new St Paul's Cathedral of Wellington in 1964. There is a small souvenir shop and toilets available for",
          "What's \"memorable\" to me about this otherwise \"small & ordinary\" church is the flag of the U.S. Marines (actually I believe the flag of a specific division of the U.S. Marines instead of that of the entire Marine Corps) hanging inside which as the staff lady explained to me",
          "This was the previous Wellington cathedral. Beautiful timbered church. A must visit while in Wellington.",
          "We especially visited because my wife's grandparents were married here. This is an amazing building and so great that plans to demolish it in the 60's were not followed through. We had a spacial treat with another visitor from overseas gaining permission to play the organ and",
          "It was nice to see a church build of wood. Normally you will see it in Scandinavia. The smell inside was real and the guide there was very information and helfull",
          "This was high on my list of things to see in Wellington, but when we arrived, there was a sign saying it was closed for a rehearsal/private event. And the staff was pretty serious about it. So we only got to walk around the outside and not get to close to anything else.",
          "I have seen countless churches while traveling, yet these stands out as being particularly unique. The church is built entirely in wood, sort of what the old medieval churches must have looked like before they were lost to time or even fires. We were greeted at the door by a",
          "This church is one of the best heritage building in Wellington. The church is small but simple exquisite. Centrally located and charming. Must visit.",
          "We just loved this old Church the architecture and the history is really worth the short walk just north of the City Center. It's really close to Parliament building as well.",
          "A stunning example of Gothic design influence, and built from native timbers. If you're visiting Wellington's parliamentary precinct, National Library and/or the Thorndon area in any case, why not walk just a little further so that you don't miss this extraordinary piece of",
          "Don't be put off by the so so exterior the interior of this unusual all timber church is stunningly beautiful. Take some time to look at the alter cloths and have a chat to guides to learn a bit more about thia remarkable and peaceful space. I am a atheist but if my local",
          "It's a really old & historic church that was built by boat builders who apparently did not know much about building except for boats, so.... have a long look at the ceiling, it looks like you are in an upside down boat. It also has some WW2 connections especially with the",
          "This is a beautiful building which could have been knocked down when the new cathedral was built. Luckily it was saved. Superb wooden roof, lots of information about the building and restoration work. Good visual history at the back of the church. Very helpful volunteer guides",
          "Old St Paul's is a good example of colonial New Zealand structure, constructed entirely of native timber. There's detail that is amazing in the woodwork and the windows, worth spending a while to take a look at. This particular church has a genuine sensation of tranquility too.",
          "with its arches of timber, rather than stone. Its close to the Beehive, so I visited both the same day.",
          "It is a beautiful and historical place. We could smell the scents of timber inside the church. It is an old building that resisted the Earthquake.",
          "Pop in for a look if you can. This is a truly stunning building that has stood the test of time. Popular for important events happy and sad.",
          "i took a friend from Canada to visit St Pauls and it was lovely to share her delight and moving reaction to this church's interior beauty. She was impressed we could freely walk around and see the old vicar's vestments and other details up close while taking our time.",
          "This wooden church is well preserved. We were surprised it is no longer an active place of worship. The volunteers/staff were very helpful in guiding us. There were short videos that explain all the special features of the building.",
          "Cute little church with character and history. I got the pleasure of chatting with Neil not only about the history of the church, but about his life growing up in NZ.",
          "This church is a classical example early NZ, Not much to see from outside but the interior is superb, The stained glass windows are magnificent, the pews originals and the lectern a real gem of gilt and polished wood, So much history is on show with Regimental banners laid up",
          "Smaller than I expected but wonderfully ornate and historic. Lots of interesting and unusual features (brass plaques, hidden panels, Christmas shop). Easy access and something all ages can enjoy. This is history brought alive and still respectful and peaceful",
          "Despite its wooden structure, this beautiful old building called Old St. Pauls Cathedral served the people of the Wellington district for over 150 years until the new St Pauls was built close by in 1964. It looks very imposing from outside, but we were in awe when we entered it.",
          "This church is not a big one but well decorated. It is not far away from Beehive so you can visit on the way or after Beehive. It is free. The decoration of the inside is magical.",
          "I went there in December and the church was decorated for Christmas with lights and a tree all lit up. It was simply magical. Nice gift shop inside as well.",
          "A 'must' on any tour of Wellington. Beautifully maintained and steeped in history, with a very small gift shop well stocked.",
          "What a beautiful structure to visit. You will be amazed at the fine woodwork skills on the walls, pews, and fixtures in the church. Breathtaking to walk through, historically rich and humbling to experience. Take the time to visit, you will not be disappointed.",

          "From the exterior this Church looks to be just an average building. However, once you step inside the true beauty shines through. The timber and carvings are gorgeous, and the stained glass windows are beautiful. We were there at 10am as the doors opened, so before any crowds",
          "In down town there is this beautiful church tucked in among the taller buildings around it. The church is wooden construction and is well kept buy the city. The stain glass on both end of the building are amazing to see. There is an area in the front of the church that plays a",

          "Nice old wooden church, big, used a lot for weddings and funerals. Lucky it survived when the new, less attractive new cathedral was built.",
          "This wooden church is been built in 1866. When entering this church the smell of the wood is intense as it was build yesterday. The church is in a very nice state, just beautiful. Daily open 9:30 \u2013 17:00",
          "Something very different but interesting to hear about Wellington's history. Free entry so donations encouraged. Very helpful volunteers.",
          "This church is a classic and worth a visit to see the beautiful wooden architecture. The history alone is interesting. We were there by ourselves other than two staff members, and we learned about the church, its significance to U.S. Marines, and we just enjoyed the peace and",

          "Not that old, compared to Old World cathedrals, but an absolutely lovely example of wooden architecture. There are some explanatory videos as well. Now a state-owned historical treasure. The interior is worth a return if it is closed for a special event.",
          "What a lovely place - a cathedral built out of wood! Beautiful craftsmanship. Well worth seeking out if you are in Wellington.",
          "What a stunning church, beautifully made and with such a wonderful history. We visited here as part of a tourist bus tour which I highly recommend",
          "Old St Paul\u2019s unique colonial architecture makes it a great example of timber Gothic Revival architecture. The warmth of the wooden interior glows under the light that streams through the beautiful stained glass windows. For nearly 100 years, Old St Paul\u2019s served as the parish",
          "Make the effort to find this church which knocks the nearby cathedral into a cocked hat for quality,charm,character,interest,architectural detailing and history.The church is no longer used as such but retains that symbolic feeling of peace and calm.Sit down and take ten minutes",
          "This old wooden church is absolutely beautiful and has been fully restored to its original state. Entry is completely free, but donations are welcome. It has a traditional interior with a brass lecturn in the shape of an eagle, stained glass windows, a magnificent old organ, a",
          "I had the privilege of being married there in 1983 and my return brought back the wonderful memories .",
          "The interior of this old church is simply beautiful. It is worth taking a few moments to sit and take in the architecture. There were volunteers in the church to answer questions and pass on information about this old church. At the front left in the draws are some of the old",
          "Those of you used to traveling in Europe probably won't be all that amazed but for New Zealand it is quite a rare example of a beautiful old church. The wood construction makes a difference from the more common stone and it really is beautiful to behold.",
          "We visited with a group from our cruise ship. The church is beautiful inside and had a interesting history. They have a small gift shop outside that helps support the upkeep. Usually I cringe at gift shops but theirs is tastefully done. I wish I had bought more now that I am",
          "From the exterior, I did not expect the church to be as beautiful as it actually is. Having seen many colonial churches in the New England - USA, I expected it to be rather plain. However, St. Paul's was a beautiful little church. It certainly represents the architecture of that",
          "Whilst this Cathedral is small in comparison to the European churches and Cathedrals it has the atmosphere and gravitas. If architects and city planners dont get the point that this building is made of wood to withstand the dynamic environment Wellington is sited on they are",
          "This great church has history, charm and wonderful character. We occasionally bring tour groups from the US to NZ and when in Wellington like to visit Old St Pauls. A great example of early craftmanship. Would love to experience a worship service there.",
          "Once all (most?) churches in NZ looked like this - serene and balanced with the warmth of indigenous wood.",
          "This is a quaint little church which dates back approx 150 years. Gorgeous stained glass windows and the woodwork inside is attractive.",
          "We went to Old St Pauls as part of a guided tour around Wellington when we first moved here. We weren't expecting much as it's quite plain from the outside but it was an absolute little gem! It's stunning on the inside, gorgeous and wooden, and the staff who work there are all",
          "We were fortunate enough to be married here 15 years ago. The church is worth a visit, beautiful architecture and history.",
          "Churches don't overly interest me, however there was a brass band playing at Old St Paul's which a group of us were interested in seeing I had never been in the building before, so we had a good look around. The building has some amazing features, the exposed beams were really",
          "The stained glass windows of this church are simply beautiful telling their stories as they do of their patrons' lives and the Biblical figures who inspired them. The wooden structure of the church is resonant with stillness and beauty and definitely worth a visit to soak up its",
          "Was very surprised to see the US flag hanging in this church. Come to find out there is a wonderful history involving the people of Wellington and the U.S. Marines.",
          "This is not a St. Paul's like in London. This is a tiny church but with a big spirit and it's what's inside that counts. Very decorative inside but the covering outside says take off, nothing to see here. Go inside and take a look for yourself.",
          "What a delight of a church building, which is free to enter and donations are appreciated to keep the place running in the way it is kept. A little further out of town but easy to find. The staff we met on our visit were a delight ( what would we do without volunteers ) All in",
          "a beautiful quiet location in the heart of the city. Beautiful stain glass windows. Small gift shop worth a visit",
          "That it was once thought this church should be deconstructed is mystifying. The use of timber and stained glass is beautiful. Thanks for this beauty.",
          "A short stop here on our day of sightseeing. Beautiful church. So glad they didn't demolish it. Nice touch with the US marines flag and the stories of great hospitality from the parishioners of this church during World War 2. It would be a wonderful wedding venue.",
          "A beautiful old wooden church with interesting historical associations. Slightly off the beaten track. Well worth finding.",
          "Lovely wooden structure, welcoming and interesting to see all the hard work that would have gone into making this building.",
          "Definitely worth to spend some time going inside this little beautiful wooden church, which no longer holds services. It is situated close to the Beehive. Not the biggest, but I think maybe Old St. Paul's is arguably the most beautiful church in Wellington. Feel the wonderful",
          "This church gives a remarkable insight into the history of Wellington and is well worth a visit. The interactive screen is very good with a lot of detail.",
          "Beautiful wood and stained glass, but something is missing here. The wood was carved local Maori masters, we were told -- but no mention of them as members of the church.",
          "This is an interesting structure, lovingly restored. One of the volunteers answered our questions and pointed out insect damage on the pews. Ask about the US flag in the sanctuary.",
          "St Pauls is a beautiful old and inviting church in the heart of Wellington. The wooden church is wonderfully warm an calming and I enjoy visiting regularly for some quiet reflection. I have been too a number of concerts here and the venue has interesting acoustics within a",

          "Beautiful shady setting and the native wooden beams and soaring arches inside shone like liquid amber as the sun filtered in. Prettiest stain glass windows. Great restorative renovations. I enjoyed too, the sweet little Christmas shop in the old vestry area. This is a very very",
          "It was a pleasant church to visit, but not something I would recommend going too far out of your way for.",
          "The Anglican Church needed a bigger church and wanted to demolish Old St. Paul's. Luckily they sold it to the state who preserved its rich history. Pay attention to the American flag and the United States Marine Corps flag which denote their worship at this church during WWII.",
          "The native wood is spectacular! Built in 1866, definately worth seeing. It is a stop on the Hop on van tour",
          "This is situated just up the road from Wellington railway station the nearest you'll get if getting a bus from the main shopping/theatre area [$2]. The interior is stunning, such craftsmanship of those carpenters of 1866, using four different native timbers. The colours are",
          "This is a beautiful example of a church built by ship builders. The rafters look like the ribs of a ships hull. All is put together with bolts and wooden pegs. Quick visit that is free.",
          "The carpentry involved is awesome. Its wood and more wood without a stone in the building outside or inside. White outside and varnished inside. I saw a wedding there and it was a great venue. The history side seemed to me to be much the same as other great churches around the",
          "A Cathedral rich in history. Unique Colonial architecture...the colours if the stained glass windows is beautiful as is the wooden ceilings...a must see",
          "While St. Paul's has been replaced by a modern construction (in concrete blocks!!) this beautiful building is far superior, in my opinion. It has atmosphere and feeling in bucketfuls and it is really a very beautiful building. Of timber construction, inside and out, it has",
          "My two sisters and I visited old St Paul's because it was th church that our family attended in the later 1800s when they lived in Wellington. We wanted to have an idea of what they would have experienced. We were not disappointed. The atmosphere is lovely and the stained glass",
          "Such beautiful architecture; you feel the awe of the early Europeans in Wellington as they sat devotedly in this upturned boat. The lighting through the native woods brings reverence. It's no longer a functioning church, is now open to concerts, weddings etc. Easy to get to; 5",
          "Beautiful building, lovely architecture. This wooden building (once a Church) is lovely. It's quaint yet big, bold and beautiful and right in the heart of Wgtn CBD. I understand you can hire the venue.",
          "My daughter got married in this church. The inside is just beautiful. The stained glass windows are stunning, as is the woodwork from ceiling to floor. The church is reasonably expensive to hire and for an extra fee, you can also add the bells ringing to announce the brides",
          "Not my first time there, but was for my partner, and he thought it serene and lovely too, and unlike me, he's not a church goer.",
          "I went in here to kill some time before a meeting, the history and tranquility of this building is an experience to revisit. The place would be perfect if it wasn't for the people taking photos.",
          "I have been here for both occasions one absolutely delightful wedding and another sad but wonderful funeral.It ha so much ambiance and history it is a must visit too as a tourist.",
          "Definitely worth going inside this little church (which no longer holds services) to see the ancient (for Wellington!) wooden beams and to learn a little of its history via the panels at the back. It's free and there's also a little shop inside.",
          "As soon as you walk through the doors the smell (pleasent)of timber is in the air.This old church (still used on special occasions)is an amazing piece of history and well worth the stop.The whole building is timber and from inside the arches and stained windows will dazzle you",
          "A wonderful bit of architecture and a nice recounting of its history by the greeter. An unusual lack of reverence from a group of tourists and an odd placement of the gift shop.",
          "The interior has a warm inviting feel because the church is all made of wood. It is still a church, although regular services aren't held here anymore. A place with lots of history and worth a stop.",
          "This is my favourite place in Wellington. The light bounces off the warm real wood walls . The Windows pools of colours . Above the aisle hangs the banner and flag of one of the American marine platoons stationed here in the war. They left the flags but took many brides back to",
          "Being from England this Church felt reassuringly spiritual (walking inside made me feel like being home in the presence of God). The stained-glass windows are vey good and photography is permitted at no extra cost - indeed entrance is free to all. Would have loved to have been",
          "Any of the churches or cathedrals around the world are peaceful places to visit. This one provided a refuge for American warriors during WWII. An old 48 star flag still flies in honor of those boys.",
          "It's the oldest church which is same as before. I went there during Christmas with a friend, I was shock by its stunning cravings and pictures on the window. It holds wedding ceremony as well, but it's quite expansive and hard to book.",
          "We stopped here on a tour we took with John from Capital Personalized Tours because we love to visit churches. This wooden church is one of the old if not the oldest churches in the area but it has been maintained wonderfully. It was not a sunny day when we were there but the",
          "The first sightseeing activity this morning in Wellington and absolutely loved Old Saint Pauls. Something quite special about the space. Even made a purchase in the Christmas Shop. The audiovisual presentstion about every aspect of the Church was impressive and very enjoyable.",
          "The inside of this church is just beautiful the wood work is an example of fine craftsmanship. The stained glass windows are also very nice.",
          "Passed by this church on the way down from the botanical gardens for a quick visit. We spent about 15 mins looking around inside this beautiful church with some lovely stainglass windows and woodwork inside . There are also a few exhibits inside near the alter to read on the",
          "On a walking tour. What a beautiful wooden building so glad they decided to keep it when they built the new. Have included a photo of the different woods used to build it. It's fashioned after a ships hull at ceiling level. The stained glass is exceptional.",
          "This historic church building is no longer used for worship, a new cathedral having been built in the city. We really enjoyed looking around at the timber work, the stained glass windows, and the artefacts. The ceiling is really interesting and the volunteers on the site have a",
          "It's worth taking a short amount of time to stop in and gaze in wonder at the superb woodwork that makes the structure of Old St. Paul's so special.",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to this beautiful wooden church. It is very peaceful and the staff are happy to relay its history. Able to walk around at leisure and take photos. A couple of coach parties arrived but it wasn't a problem. Easy to walk to from the railway station.",

          "My first experience to Red Rocks a few days ago, was more of a hard slog through hard gravel and deep sand, rather than a nice pleasant coastal walk as we were first lead to believe. \n\nIt took us a long almost one hour trek from where we \u2026",
          "Great place. Walking is great, so is driving. Quite challenging drive. Car drivers will love. Lovely place to watch seals live.",

          "Beautiful walk along the coast on a sunny day, at the right season, seals can be viewed along here  The occasional vehicle sharing the rocky road.. very popular spot.",
          "It's a nice coastal 2 hr round trip walk at a moderate pace. The highlight is the fur seal colony at Sinclair Head / Devil's Gate, easily saw around 100 of them chilling on the rocks and blocking the walkway as well. Really cool to see \u2026",
          "It is one of the best day hikes South of Wellington City. Highly ecommended with friends. Sometimes you might spot fur seals.",
          "Gravel walk what takes you through the rocks. Can get very windy, but walk is easy. I suggest to bring water with you and enjoy beautiful views. I didn't have that luck to see seals, so you should check it up when is the season, if you \u2026",
          "Beautiful walk. If you bring the kids - be prepared, it's along walk from the car park to to the seals/ red-rocks. About 4k there, and obviously 4km back. Do bring water, especially in summer, but even in Winter. Had to carry the little \u2026",
          "It has a beautiful views but I thought that there were more to see, the views on the way there is amazing!",
          "Nice place to see seals. However, I was not prepared by the time I was there as it was so cold so we did not manage to get to Red Rock just closed by.",
          "Rode my bike here on the way to look at the seals, though more accurately I walked alongside my bike, due to the traction on the stones on the beach, definitely more walker friendly than bike. Well worth it though, its an awesome beach surrounded by awesome mountain ranges.",
          "Amazing scenery and fun 4WD track. Devils Gate is a rugged spot, very windy!",
          "This place`s good & awesome. you can take a rest on beach or you can hike~",

          "Amazing spot. Pretty easy to get out to devil's gate in an AWD SUV if you're used to bumpy roads and tiny streams, but if the water came up in the creeks you'd want a 4WD. Seals there today (maybe a dozen) in early May. Awesome experience.",
          "Good time of the year to get out at the moment as many of the NZ fur seals are in and relaxing on the beach, just don't get too close... it's against the law.  for those who are a little less mobile it is possible to drive there, but it is definitely a 4 wheel drive road and requires a reasonable skill level to drive it.",
          "The car park to start the walk is very huge but also very busy.\n\nEven if the walkway which go to the red rocks is flat, it's not very easy for kids: rocks, shared road with cars; you should have some good shoes.\n\nBefore starting the walk, you should check the wind: it's very exposed and it can be very windy.",

          "It is a long nice walk (I recall 30-40 mins)... be prepared with food and stuff. You can go with a 4 wheeler. The drive is a little bit rough. Be wary of incoming vehicles as some parts are narrow. Seeing seals in person is so lovely. \u2026",

          "Good to go see seals , good views and good walk",

          "Great for a walk...",
          "And just beyond are where seals hang out. Named after the distinctive red rocks in this particular spot. Morning & midday walks are best as it can get a little cold in the shade walking home. Don't do this walk if the wind is likely to get strong - the sand & wee stones will get into your eyes and all through your hair. 10km return trip",

          "Beautyful there.",

          "It's a nice coastal 2 hr round trip walk at a moderate pace. The highlight is the fur seal colony at Sinclair Head / Devil's Gate, easily saw around 100 of them chilling on the rocks and blocking the walkway as well. Really cool to see these animals up close, spent one hour",
          "Awesome coastal walkway, quite easy to walk along (just be aware of the rocks and cars). Fantastic views of the surrounding mountains, sea, and obviously the red rocks! A fairly long walk, depending where you want to head to, so time it right otherwise the sun will be hidden",
          "There's a World War II forward observation post with huts and bunkers atop Sinclair Head, the high promontory that looms over Devil's Gate and the seal colony just beyond. It's an impressive site to visit, redolent of history and offering some of the best views over Cook Strait.",

          "Few places will give the views this walk gives (on the right day!). I would highly recommend it if you want to see an entirely different perspective on your city or like exploring, views or both. Information on this walk is a bit misleading in terms of how long it is supposed",

          "Its a long walk but walking beside roaring ocean is diff exp. Head to seal colony, where else you can see so many seals! Definitely worth visiting while in Wellington, but yes be prepared for a long long walk. keep hydration option and energy bar if you didn't have good food",

          "The walk along the coast to get to the red rocks area was nice, but there were a lot of cars going back and forth which wasn't the greatest. It was worth it just to see all the seals at the end though. There were so many of them, but they blend in with the rocks pretty well so",
          "After sight seeing in central Wellington we went further afield and took the short drive to Red Rocks on Owhiro Bay. There we walked along the coast on a pretty trail with lots of views. Some in our group spotted a whale, some saw a cluster of chicken-like birds walking among",
          "Great walk, in the right time of year you can go see the seals. the walk there and back is about 10k I would say. if you have a 4x4 you can drive. not recommended for small children or pushchairs. don't go in bad weather",
          "This walk is so stunning along the rugged Wellington south coastline. If you are feeling really energetic you can walk over the hills to the Brooklyn wind turbine. One way takes about 2.5 hours if you are reasonably fit. Its not a hard walk with a few up and down hills.",
          "The rocks really are red, and sometimes purplish, and can be pretty amazing around sunset. Further round from the rocks is the seasonal seal population - a much longer walk to Sinclair Head will reveal a larger more permanent group. Please don't approach or tease them. The walk",

          "This is a great place to get out and walk along the southern coast. It is pretty easy to get to via bus and there is a seal colony during the winter. The path is a 4-wheel drive road though so watch out for cars, etc. during the week.",
          "Red Rocks is right along the southern coastline of Wellington and is the perfect place for a decent walk along the coast. During the autumn-winter season, be sure to check out the seal colonies when the stop on by - it is just amazing to see! If you have enough time, walk past",
          "I hadn't been around to Red Rocks for perhaps 20 years so I decided to take the kids to see the stunning scenery and some smelly seals! It was a more beautiful walk than I remembered, and the new visitors centre is certainly an improvement. Be warned thought that this is",
          "Stunning views over the sea front...there is also toilet block and picnic area with information about this place.",
          "This is a great place to see stunning views and the chance to see the seals. No need to book a tour - just walk along until about 10 minutes past the devils rocks (looks like devils horns). This is where many seals prefer to lounge around. Allow 2.5 hrs round trip and allow to",
          "Went on a cold but sunny winter day and had a really nice walk along the beach. Barely any other people, felt like we were alone there. The seal colony is right next to the walkway so you definitely get a great view. It's a wonderful place :)",
          "On the 2 August 2016 my son drove my partner and I to red rocks and over 'DEVILS PEAK' On the way to 'DEVILS PEAK' we were privileged to observe around 15 seals sunbathing on the rocks and were able to get within 10' without disturbing them. 100 meters passed we then spotted",
          "This is the time to walk around to Red rocks to see the Male Fur seals sleeping and eating and swimming in the seal. Dont get up close to them. a nice beach walk but check out your low tide before you start, If a southerly wind is blowing its very exposed to the weather.Its free",
          "A good place to get away from the city. Walk along the bay and round to the rocks. Or just sit and watch.",

          "Today I made a trip to red rock reserve to see the seals I read some reviews from others but it's not a 30th 45min walk. If you are planning to make a visit make sure you are prepared to walk at least 2 hours. Love the view Kept me away from all of those digital stuff and",

          "I've cycled, walked and 4wd'd through this reserve, and it has never been the same twice. If you have a vehicle up to the task, you can drive quite a long way around on the beach including through Devil's Gate (Sinclair Head) where, after you exit the marine reserve there are",
          "Nicely developed area with new toilets and walkway along coast, though stony. Dramatic coastal scenery along the way.",
          "The place is full of tracks which you can explore with a group of friends on a weekend. At certain times of the year, it turns into a seals sanctuary, where a large number of seals come on shore. As most of the track is along the beach, it's important to have proper shoes.",
          "Start by spending some time in the visitors centre to get a feel to the area. You can then head of on a trip that can be as long or short as you want. I sometimes just walk along the first couple of beaches to get some fresh air but often take the 4WD for a trip to one of the",
          "Walk at your leisure you can walk from 20 m to 2 to 3 hours depending on your fitness . 4x4, bikes share the same path so be aware . Take your camera to take photos of the seals but can be hard to spot at times as they blend into the rocks . There are toilets at the car park.",
          "Two hours walking!!! Along the beach walking not easy to walk if windy. good fun for teenagers. You can't see which one is seals which one is rock because they lye on rock and their skin color same as red rock colour",
          "It's the perfect place for a good walk! If you walk for enough you get to the point where you can see the fur seals. We saw 4 of them :) Just be careful when you climb on the rocks as they hide underneath/between it. We walked the distance but you can do it with your car if it",
          "The perfect time to visit here is during sunset. It is so beautiful. Take your camera. If you are driving with a campervan spend the night here as they have free camping.",

          "A beautiful (but very windy) walk along the coast. We saw a lot of seals. About 5 miles from where we parked our car round trip. Highly recommend for a free way to see a little bit of Wellington's scenery.",
          "The whole walk takes about 45 mins-1.5 hours (depending on how fast you walk), the views are amazing, we enjoyed it even on a rainy winter day. Once you get to the end of it there's 100's of seals , sleeping, stretching even fighting. 10 mins car ride from the CBD but once",
          "10 minutes drive from the CBD (or a bus to Owhiro Bay followed by a walk of about 10 minutes) is a coastal walk that will make you feel like you're out in the wilderness. I love this wild coastline. A walk of about an hour will bring you to Sinclair Head where you'll see heaps",
          "Such a wild a rugged place to visit. A great walk out along the wild coast. See the seals and enjoy the spectacular views around you. We loved this place on a clear day. You can see the South Island and all around. Do not miss this!",
          "We visited here in July 2015 to see the Fur Seals and it was not disappointing. Sure, you can take a tour, but we (3 adults of moderate fitness) walked from the car park to the Seals on a Sunday. Check the time you go as the seal are only there in winter. The walk is about 5",
          "Fishing from here is not for the faint hearted. I am not into that sort of thing but I take my hat off to those setting out from there to fish. What a spectacle!",
          "This a must see! Absolutely fantastic view. This is open to vehicles so you need to keep an eye out. The beach is rather difficult to walk on but the views never end. The cliffs on land are amazing and there is an old quarry that is just astonishing to look at the sheer height.",
          "We took the bus to the Owhiro bay, then walked along the beach, enjoyed the view a lot. You might need a suitable pair of shoes to be able to climb the rocks. Unfortunately we didn't see any seals",
          "This is a popular beach walk not far from the central district in Wellington. The walk is about 45 minutes around the bay. Walk past the red rock formations and you will reach a seal \"haul out\" \u2013 a place where seals rest to regain strength during the winter. Don't get too close,",
          "Quite a long walk around the bay, past the red rocks we finally found the seals sunning themselves. There were loads, and we got really close to some. Loved it.",
          "We walk about 2 hour ( return ) and had a relaxing and beautiful walk, very easy to find and very easy to walk. Sometimes it get windy so take a jacket and not only we saw the red rocks we even got lucky and saw a seal!( they are usually there between may to August )",
          "We checked this out and decided to stay watching the ferries pass while picnicking by the rocks. There's a huge room full of information panels open daily, toilets, rubbish collection, fresh water. Many travellers stop here to walk around the coast or over the hills.",
          "Pick the right season and you will find 100s of seals. We went in October and we were mind blown by how many there were and how close they lazed in the sunshine. Easy walk, mostly flat, some stoney and sand pathways, it can get chilli in the shade so take jackets. Pack lunch and",
          "If you have nothing better to do on a sunny day, go to the Red Rocks Reserve. After 90 minutes of walking, either along the shore or on the dirt path (have to move out of the way for cars), you will come to the first set of Red Rocks. They are beautiful, and very rocky. The",
          "Whether walking or going in your 4X4 the scenic views are amazing. Fresh air, and a great view of the South Island.",
          "Red Rocks is a lovely costal walk. It's also a nice ending point, if you park nearby and mountain bike up Happy Valley to the Wind Turbine and then back over the ridge track and end back at Red Rocks. The other day we saw a seal, which was awesome!",
          "It was a nice walk around the coast except for the gusts of wind pelting us with sand and pebbles. But the views are amazing! Sadly there were only 2 seals when we visited and there were quite a number of 4x4's who were speeding and almost hit people. Other than that it was a",
          "Really nice walk even if it's windy (of course!). Lots of seals. The view is amazing. Sandflies :/ And it's a shame there are so many 4x4 :/",
          "Take some time out from the City and go for a nice leisurely stroll around the coastline. You could very well be rewarded with seeing the seals on the rocks (you will smell where they are!). Also makes for a good bike ride. Take a packed lunch and some drink with you and go",
          "We had eight days in Wellington in October with fabulous weather - we were driven to Island Bay and set off on the Red Rocks walk.... We did it on a Sunday when no 4WD vehicles or motorbikes are allowed --- the track is sandy, rocky, pebbly and sometimes rough. The Red rocks",
          "This was an awesome spot with some amazing rock formations. Would be even better if there were signs explaining the rocks.",
          "you have to drive to get there but the views are smash. even in the rain. seals are often there if you're prepared to walk 100m from the car. more importantly the light is good for painters and photographers. though for painters in Wellington the wind can be a problem. Mike",
          "Went on a sunday afternoon for a little peace and quiet. Its a beautiful walk along the shore. There's nothin much to do though other than watching the waves hit the rocks on the shore",
          "This was a walk we'd talked about doing for ages and we needed to wait until there was a Sunday (no cars allowed) when the weather wasn't too wild. This is a pretty exposed place on the South Coast so it's windy and wild and we went on a relatively calm day but it was still",
          "Wish I'd known Sunday was vehicle free day. I went on a Saturday and was constantly annoyed by vehicles and more importantly by dirty smelly moto X bikes that ruined my walk. That aside, the walk is easy for the most part and the scenery simply breath taking. You can enjoy",
          "Beautiful walk or drive. I enjoy both around red rocks. It's a really pleasant area, great scenery and wonderful photographic opportunities. On a good day you can see all the mountains in the South Island across the water, really a beautiful site. Sunday is vehicle free day",
          "This is the real South Coast, unadulterated and wild. Pack good shoes, water, snack and wander around to Red Rocks themselves (45 mins to an hour) to see seals in season. Check with the Wellington City Council on which days cars are NOT allowed around there, otherwise your",
          "After having done the stunning Bondi-Coogee board walk and thoroughly enjoying it we decided to try something similar in our hometown on a Saturday. Unfortunately I did not enjoy this walk, it is like walking on a road and was marred by having to get out of the way of big",
          "Visited it few weeks back it was pretty awesome to see some red colored rocks. Nice place for a walk and to enjoy.",
          "This is a great walk and only a couple of 4wd's all day on a wednesday so not a problem. From bus number 1, hop off when it turns around at the end of the route and turn right along the coast (walk through the small park or down reef road to seafront). There is a great little",
          "I love this walk - from Island Bay, past Red Rocks, through to the seal colony. It has to be done on a Sunday when no four wheel drive cars are allowed there, and there will be loads of families, dogs, cyclists. Even though it is a very isolated area, on a Sunday it's almost",
          "This is a beautiful place with stunning scenery and cute seals! It's about an hour and a half walk - if your strolling. It's all flat, though you are walking on loose stones so it can be a little tough in parts. Recommend wearing sneakers - or at least flats. Would be best",
          "From the carpark you can stroll to an exhibition detailing the local fauna and flora in the reserve.The site also offers a grand view of the south island on most clear days.For the adventourous,there is a walk of at least one hour to the seal colony.This is good between october",
          "I love this place and been out there countless times. Excellent place to take a family as long as the weather is good. It is an easy walk out to the seal colony .",
          "this is a lovely walk of 1-2 hours along the wild coastline. there are usually seals at the Red Rocks, they are wild - make sure anyone with you treats them as wild animals and doesn't get too close and especially not block the seals path back to the ocean. i have walked this",
          "We hiked through the Red Rocks Reserve on a wintry, rainy day in mid-June. It is about a 45 minute hike along a flat (for the most part) trail along the coastline tp get tp the seal colony. The beautiful black beaches have lots of boulders and tide pools to explore along the",
          "A wonderful flat walk along, for the most part, a firm rocky 4wd road. We managed to take our 2 year old in his buggy and while we did have to negotiate sections of rock, gravel/sand and even a shallow creek crossing, we managed without too much effort. Just be prepared to take",
          "We picked a sunny Sunday to visit seals, and it did not disappoint us. No 4WD allowed on Sunday so it was easier to walk along the bay. We saw about 20 seals in total, just after the Devil's Gate, which was about 40 mins walk from the parking lot. Once you spot one, you'd see a",
          "After reading the information at the car park site we went for a long walk, (the path is stony, wide, and used by 4x4 cars), in the wind in search of seals and we wern't let down. We saw a few resting in the sun and when we wnt rock pool exploring we suddenly came across a seal",
          "I absolutely fell in love with this place, despite the grey and drizzly weather. If anything, the weather heightened the experience for me. The walk along the rugged, wild looking black sands, strewn with rocks and boulders and the crystal-clear rock pools left behind by the",
          "My rating comes with a caution - there is no cafe! The enjoyment of Red Rocks begins at the carpark where DoC has constructed a really interesting information kiosk out of old Quarry materials. Toilets are high quality, but locked at 9pm. The walk to the actual \"Red Rocks\" takes",
          "If you are looking at a nice walk in Wellington then come and try this one. You can go all way to the end where you are bound to see seals but that would be mainly in winter. It's about an hour to walk to the end so you will need at least two hours. Great to walk in the evening",
          "The Red Rocks are about an hours walk from the car park. In the winter you will see seals here. I recommend going on a Sunday as you will not be dodging motorbikes and 4x4's."

        "wiki": "The National War Memorial of New Zealand is located next to the New Zealand Dominion Museum building on Buckle Street, in Wellington, the nation's capital. The war memorial was dedicated in 1932 on Anzac Day in commemoration of the First World War. It also officially remembers the New Zealanders who gave their lives in the South African War, World War II and the wars in Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nThe War Memorial consists of the War Memorial Carillon, the Hall of Memories, and an unknown New Zealand warrior interred in a tomb constructed in 2004 in front of the Hall of Memories.\nFour Rolls of Honour bear the names and ranks of 28,654 New Zealanders. Lyndon Smith's bronze statue of a family group is the focal point for the complex, which is visited by approximately 20,000 people a year.\n\n\n== War Memorial Carillon ==\n\nThe National War Memorial Carillon was designed as a sister instrument to the 53-bell carillon at the Peace Tower in Ottawa, Canada.The carillon bells were made in Croydon, England, by Gillett & Johnston, and arrived in New Zealand in January 1931.At the time of dedication the 49 bells ranged from one weighing a shade more than 4 kg with a diameter of 170 mm and 140 mm high, up to one weighing 5 tonnes and measuring 2 m by 1.6 m. Their total weight was more than 30 tonnes and they cost \u00a311,000.The complex made considerable use of New Zealand stone. The carillon was clad with pinkish-brown Putaruru stone. Unfortunately the material was variable and weathered badly in places. It was removed from the carillon and replaced by Takaka marble in 1982.Since 1984 the Carillon has been substantially rebuilt and enlarged. Twenty mid-range bells have been replaced with 21 smaller treble bells and 4 large bass bells, extending the total range to 6 octaves. The Carillon currently has 74 bells, including the \"Peace\" bell, which, at 12.5 tonnes, is the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. The Carillon ranks as the third largest in the world by total weight.Anzac Day and specific battle commemorations have special places in the annual schedule of events. The Carillon is played in over 200 hours of live concerts per year and a comprehensive domestic and international carillon teaching programme is conducted under the direction of the National Carillonist, Timothy Hurd.. Since the opening of the National War Memorial Carillon in 1932 there have only been four official carillonists \n\n\n== Hall of Memories ==\n\nThe Hall of Memories is approached through an octagonal vestibule forming the base of the Carillon Tower. Inside there are six memorial alcoves on each side leading up to an apse and Sanctuary at the southern end of the Hall. These alcoves are designed as small side chapels dedicated to the different branches of the New Zealand Armed Forces that have served in overseas conflicts.\nThe entrance to the Sanctuary is flanked on either side by two white stone columns, each surmounted with a bronze orb and cross and engraved with the coats of arms of members of the Commonwealth whose forces served in World Wars I and II. These coats of arms are linked by stylised branches, representing the tree of the Commonwealth. On each of the two side walls of the Sanctuary a large cross forms the background for the coats of arms of the main towns of the nine provinces of New Zealand. These crosses symbolise the sacrifices made by New Zealanders in times of war.Mounted to one side of the Sanctuary is a Lamp of Brotherhood, one of 84 made after World War II to commemorate the war dead of all nations and to promote reconciliation and unity between nations.Four Rolls of Honour, inscribed with the name and rank of each fallen New Zealander, are placed in bronze display cases on the east and west walls of the Sanctuary.The Hall of Memories is lined with cream Mt Somers stone. Inside, Hanmer marble, Coromandel granite and Takaka marble are all used.\n\n\n== Unknown Warrior ==\n\nThe Unknown Warrior symbolise[s] the tremendous sacrifice New Zealand has made over the last century in the struggle to preserve freedom and justice and the democratic way of life...For all New Zealanders this [is] a day of remembrance and a day to remember.\nTo serve as a focus of remembrance for the sacrifice made by all New Zealand servicemen and women, in 2004 a project was undertaken to repatriate the body of an unknown warrior for burial in the new Tomb of the Unknown Warrior.\nThe Unknown Warrior is one of over 250,000 New Zealanders who served in overseas wars. He is one of 30,000 who died in service. He is one of over 9000 who have no known grave or whose remains could never be recovered. The remains were chosen by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission from the Caterpillar Valley Cemetery, near where the New Zealand Division fought in 1916.\n\nAs the soldier's name, rank, regiment, race, religion and other details are unknown, he represents and honours all New Zealanders who became lost to their families in war.\nI told him [the Warrior] we're taking him home and that those who are taking him home are soldiers, sailors and airmen, past and present. I asked the Warrior to be the guardian of all military personnel who had died on active service. I then promised that we, the people of New Zealand, will be his guardian\nOn Monday 1 November a New Zealand delegation departed for France to begin the process of repatriating the remains of the Unknown Warrior. A handover ceremony took place on 6 November at the New Zealand Memorial site near the village of Longueval, France. The ceremony marked the official return of the Unknown Warrior from the care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission into the care of New Zealand.On return to New Zealand on Wednesday 10 November, the Unknown Warrior lay in state at Parliament. Thousands of New Zealanders attended the vigil to pay their respects. A memorial service was held on 11 November at the Wellington Cathedral of St Paul, followed by a Military Funeral Procession through central Wellington. More than 100,000 people lined the streets to the National War Memorial where an Interment Ceremony with full Military Honours took place.The Warrior was finally laid to rest in the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior on Thursday 11 November 2004, Armistice Day.The Tomb is sealed with a bronze mantel bearing the words: \n\n\n== The Man with the Donkey ==\nA bronze sculpture by Paul Walshe of Richard Alexander Henderson as \"The Man with the Donkey\" stands outside the National War Memorial. It is based on the photograph of Henderson taken at Gallipoli by James Gardiner Jackson on 12 May 1915, and is a \"tribute to all medical personnel, stretcher bearers and ambulance drivers who served alongside New Zealand troops in wartime\". Commissioned by the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services\u2019 Association, it was unveiled by Henderson's son Ross in 1990.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1919 the Government voted \u00a3100,000 for a National War Memorial in Wellington .After considerable debate, it was agreed to build a complex that included a national art gallery, museum, and war memorial, including a carillon in the central suburb of Mt Cook. A competition was held in 1929 for plans for the war memorial, and for the Dominion Museum and the National Art Gallery immediately behind it. The competition was won by Messrs Gummer and Ford.\nThe inscription on the foundation stone reads: REO WAIRUA. TO THE GLORY OF GOD. To the memory of the New Zealander that died in the Great War, 1914 to 1918, and in honour of those that served or suffered, this stone was laid by the Right Honourable G W Forbes, PC, MP, Prime Minister of New Zealand, on 15th May, 1931.\nWork was completed for an Anzac Day 1932 dedication when Governor-General Lord Bledisloe switched on the Lamp of Remembrance atop the tower and the Evening Post reported hearing 'magic from the skies'Although the museum was opened in 1936, the planned Hall of Memories fell victim to first the Depression, then the Second World War. The first plans were prepared in 1937, and Gummer and Ford forwarded a new set in 1949, but the project did not go to tender until 1960. When tenders closed, the Christchurch firm of P Graham and Son (the same firm that built the carillon tower) was chosen, its tender being \u00a3114,000.The hall of memories was officially opened by the Governor-General, Sir Bernard Fergusson, on 5 April 1964.The Carillon's Putaruru stone had badly deteriorated by the late 1950s. Although repairs were approved as part of the Hall of Memories project, work did not finally begin until 1981-82. Among other things, a section of the campanile was replastered, Canaan marble replaced the Putaruru stone, and the metal louvres, window frames, and grilles were replaced.In 1985 the Carillon, increased to 65 bells, was restored, ready for rededication in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II in the following year.In 2004 the unknown New Zealand warrior  was added; retired Army Colonel Andrew Renton-Green, who chairs the National War Memorial Advisory Council and the coordinating committee behind the tomb project, explains why it took so long:\n\nThe history goes back to the time Gummer designed the National War Memorial, which was completed \u2013 not in its present form \u2013 in 1932. The original design was just the carillon tower and an avenue which led from the harbour to the tower, with what was then the National Museum behind. As part of that design Gummer actually made provision for a tomb, but all building other than the carillon tower was abandoned because of the economic situation at the time \u2013 the Depression.\nSo Gummer\u2019s vision was still there; it was never fulfilled. In 1963 the Hall of Memories was added, and it was at this time that the RSA, and others, said wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea if we had our own Unknown Warrior. There are not many people in New Zealand who can afford to pay their respects to one of their family by going to Westminster Abbey, where the Commonwealth tomb was put in the ground in 1923.\nIt still took another 40 years before a government \u2013 and the RSA pays tribute to Helen Clark\u2019s leadership in this \u2013 finally got onto the job. The Ministry for Culture & Heritage held a tomb-design competition but, even then, controversy over Robert Jahnke\u2019s winning entry stalled the project; eventually the job went to Kingsley Baird, who came up with a classically simple design of bronze and stone set into the steps below the present memorial.\n\nIt\u2019s just another step along the way, from Gummer\u2019s original design of just the carillon, to the Hall of Memories being added in \u201963, to this being added now \u2013 it shows that it\u2019s actually a living thing, it\u2019s not dead. It\u2019s not about dead people at all, it\u2019s about living people.\nIn February 2020, the National War Memorial Building was closed to the public due to concerns about its resilience in an earthquake.\n\n\n== Pukeahu National War Memorial Park ==\n\nPukeahu National War Memorial Park, also known as Pukeahu Park, opened on 18 April 2015 in time for the centenary of the World War I Gallipoli landings, and was one of the New Zealand Government's key projects to commemorate the 100th anniversary of World War I.In May 2004, Prime Minister Helen Clark said,\n\nA park would further enhance the area which is already being redeveloped with the building of the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. It will provide a more appropriate setting for New Zealand's memorial to those New Zealanders who gave their lives in times of war. Significant aspects of our heritage and identity were forged in difficult times of conflict...this is illustrated by the growing numbers of people who attend ANZAC Day services in New Zealand.\nIn 2005 the Ministry for Culture and Heritage worked with the NZ Transport Agency to acquire land on the northern side of Buckle Street, in front of the National War Memorial, to create a National Memorial Park.\nOn 7 August 2012 the government announced Buckle Street section of State Highway One was to be moved underground via a 'cut and cover' tunnel beneath the Park, allowing the Park to extend over the road and up to the National War Memorial creating a unified National Memorial precinct.The park is designed to house memorials from New Zealand's military allies. The park opened with a memorial of 15 red sandstone columns commissioned by the Australian Government to pay tribute to the Anzac military relationship. A French memorial is planned to be constructed in 2017 with inauguration intended in 2018.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNew Zealand War Memorial, London\nUnited Nations Memorial Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPukeahu National War Memorial Park\nA Day to Remember: The Story of the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior",

        "wiki": "The Wellington Cable Car is a funicular railway in Wellington, New Zealand, between Lambton Quay, the main shopping street, and Kelburn, a suburb in the hills overlooking the central city, rising 120 m (394 ft) over a length of 612 m (2,008 ft).\nThe one way trip takes approximately five minutes. The Wellington Cable Car is widely recognised as a symbol of Wellington.\n\n\n== Track and stations ==\nThe line consists of 628 metres (2,060 ft) of mostly straight 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in) metre gauge single track with pine sleepers. The only curves are at the passing loop in the middle, at Talavera station. Except for the lowest part the line rises at a constant grade of 1 in 5.06 (17.86%), through three tunnels and over three bridges.\nThe lower terminus is in Cable Car Lane, off Lambton Quay (41\u00b017\u203203.3\u2033S 174\u00b046\u203228.7\u2033E). The upper terminus is next to the Wellington Botanic Garden at the city end of Upland Road, Kelburn's main street (41\u00b017\u203207.25\u2033S 174\u00b046\u203204.17\u2033E).\n\n\n== Cars and propulsion ==\n\nThe Cable Car has two cars, which start from opposite ends of the line and pass in the middle. They are attached to each other by a 30 mm diameter cable, supported by 120 rollers, which runs round a pulley at the top of the hill. A 185 kW 550 V DC motor at the top of the hill drives the pulley. The Cable Car is a funicular rather than a true cable car: the cars are permanently attached to the cable, which stops and starts as required, while a cable car grips and releases a continuously-moving cable. Wheels on the south side of car 1 and the north side of car 2 have double flanges, while the opposite wheels on each car have no flanges, directing the cars to the correct side of the mid-way passing loop at Talavera.\nThe cars are designed to fit the grade, using internal steps to provide horizontal floors.\nThe normal operating speed is 18 km/h (11.2 mph) (5 m/s or 16.4 ft/s), with a maximum passenger load of around 100 (30 seated, 70 standing). Each car weighs approximately 13.5 t (13.3 long tons; 14.9 short tons) when empty and 21 t (20.7 long tons; 23.1 short tons) when full.\n\n\n== Passengers ==\nThe Cable Car is used by slightly under a million people each year. In the mornings and evenings, it is used by commuters travelling between Kelburn and the city; at other times of the day, it is used by people travelling between the city and the Wellington Botanic Garden, by students attending Victoria University and living in nearby student hostels, and by many tourists, especially during summer.\n\n\n== Ownership ==\nThe Cable Car is owned and operated by Wellington Cable Car Ltd, owned by Wellington City Council. Wellington Cable Car Ltd also owns the overhead wires for Wellington's trolleybuses. Operation was contracted out to Australian company Transfield Services until early 2007, when it was brought back inhouse. Wellington Cable Car Ltd is responsible for all operations of the Cable Car, including the maintenance of cars and track, employing drivers, selling tickets and providing customer service. Unlike buses and trains, the Cable Car does not receive a subsidy, and is profitable.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe Cable Car Museum was opened in December 2000. Located in the original winding house, and with a new extension completed in 2006, it houses original grip cars 1 and 3, with the electric winding gear still in working order. Car 1 is in red 1970s livery, including contemporary advertising. Car 3 was restored in 2005 to a green livery dating from about 1905, and a bell from the San Francisco Cable Car was added. The winding gear is still in working order and runs a loop of cable, but the cable no longer leaves the building.\nThe Cable Car Museum is operated by the Wellington Museums Trust. It has a Category II listing with Heritage New Zealand.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The original line ===\nAt the end of the 19th century, Wellington was expanding rapidly, and, due to the city's hilly terrain, good building land was at a premium. When new residential developments were proposed for Kelburn, it was suggested that a cable car or funicular could be built to provide easy access. In 1898, a number of people prominent in the development of the residential subdivisions founded the Kelburne & Karori Tramway Company. The plan was to build a tramway between the city and Kelburn, and link it by carriage to Karori, a settlement on the far side of Kelburn. The company began purchasing land for the construction of the tramway, and negotiated with the Karori authorities for a new road (now Upland Road) to link the upper terminus with Karori. In 1898, the City Council granted permission for the venture, on condition that it had the option to purchase the operation at a later date. The location of Victoria University of Wellington was influenced by the company's offer of a donation of \u00a31000 if the university were located in Kelburn, so students would patronise the car when travelling between the city and the university. Several of the Company investors like Martin Kennedy were supporters of Seddon, who stalled on releasing land on the alternative Mount Cook Gaol site for the university, although this site was widely supported in Wellington.\n\nThe designer of the system was James Fulton, a Dunedin-born engineer. Fulton was responsible for both selecting the route and deciding the method of operation, a hybrid between a cable car and a funicular. Like a cable car, the line had a continuous loop haulage cable that the cars gripped using a cable car gripper, but it also had a funicular-style balance cable permanently attached to both cars over an undriven pulley at the top of the line. The descending car gripped the haulage cable and was pulled downhill, in turn pulling the ascending car (which remained ungripped) uphill by the balance cable. There was a Fell type centre rail, used for emergency braking only. The line was double track, of 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge.\nConstruction began in 1899, involving three teams working around the clock. The line opened to the public on 22 February 1902. Demand was high, with thousands of people travelling each day. In 1903, a number of old horse-drawn Wellington trams were converted into cable car trailers, increasing capacity. By 1912, the annual number of passengers had reached one million. In 1933, the steam-powered winding gear was replaced by an electric motor, improving control and reducing operating costs.\nIn the 1940s, the Cable Car suffered from increased competition: City Council buses ran to Karori and other western suburbs, bypassing it. The company believed that it was inappropriate for the City Council to compete with a private company, and a legal dispute broke out. The argument ended when the City Council agreed to purchase the company, which occurred on 13 February 1947.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Cable Car was the subject of complaints about safety and comfort. The old wooden cars were increasingly considered antiquated. On 10 May 1973, a worker on the new motorway suffered serious injuries in an accident when he stepped in front of a Cable Car at the Clifton stop, prompting a review. The Ministry of Works concluded that aspects of the Cable Car were unsafe, particularly the use of unbraked trailers, and called for the system to be scrapped. The trailers were withdrawn, considerably reducing capacity.\n\n\n=== 1978\u201379 upgrade ===\nDespite public protests led by Mayor of Wellington Michael Fowler, the line closed on 22 September 1978 for re-gauging and installation of new steel cars and equipment by Habegger AG of Switzerland, becoming a full funicular. The contract was managed by Wellington engineering firm Cory-Wright and Salmon. The line re-opened on 22 October 1979.\n\nInitially, the refurbished Cable Car suffered a number of problems. The service was frequently interrupted for technical reasons and for extensive safety checks. Largely as a result of these problems, patronage dropped to a low of 500,000 in 1982. After a serious accident in 1988, which put the cars out of service for months, the system underwent a major revamp. This solved most of the problems and patronage has steadily increased since then. A safety survey is conducted annually at the end of October and takes four days.\n\n\n=== Deregulation ===\nIn 1991, when passenger transport was deregulated, there was speculation about the future of the Cable Car. Councils could no longer provide transport services directly, having to either privatise or corporatise their operations. The City Council sold its bus operation, but due to public pressure it retained ownership of the Cable Car and the trolleybus overhead wiring, with operations and maintenance contracted out separately.\nInitially both contracts were won by Harbour City Cable Car Ltd, a joint venture between the Stagecoach Group, which had purchased the buses, and East by West, a Wellington ferry operator. In 1994, the City Council decided to carry out its own maintenance, and Wellington Cable Car Ltd established its own maintenance capacity. In 1997, the operations contract was won by Serco, which was later purchased by Transfield Services. Wellington Cable Car Ltd took the operation in-house in early 2007.\nCracks were discovered in the tunnel below Talavera station during the 1999 Annual survey. These were fixed with metal anchoring and by coating the tunnel with reinforced concrete.\nIn July 2006, renovation of Lambton station began, to improve its looks and accessibility. The works were budgeted at $1.3 million, scheduled to be completed in early November. On 18 December the renovated station came into use, with automated turnstiles (and a substantial price rise). Lingering problems with the ticketing system upgrade were fixed during the October 2007 annual survey. A new computer was also added to the winding mechanism during the survey which has caused a few temporary issues with how smoothly the cars run.\n\n\n=== 2016 electric drive and control system upgrade ===\n\nIn 2016, the Cable Car underwent a major equipment upgrade to replace the electric drive and control system. Since the 1979 upgrade, each car has completed more than one million trips. The Cable Car also took the opportunity to cosmetically upgrade the existing cars and make changes to the staff facilities.\nWhilst the Cable Car was out of action, the Wellington City Council also carried out construction work in the Cable Car Lane and Lambton Quay Terminal. This included: \n1. replacing the old leaky canopy with an elegant new glass one that will let the sunshine in (Phase 1)\n2. building a new ticket booth and moving the entry gates to make queuing and buying tickets easier (Phase 1)\n3. new paving, signs and colour scheme for the heritage-listed Stonehams building (Phase 2 \u2013 final phase of work on the lane in 2017)\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe landmark Kelburn Kiosk was built at the Kelburn terminal in 1905. It was burnt down in a suspicious fire in 1982. The Skyline Restaurant was built to replace it in 1984, with a design that won an award from the Institute of Architects in 1986.In 1996, Paul Lambert rode 80 trips in one day, setting something of a record. The Cable Car waived the ticket price, and he collected funds for the Life Flight Trust throughout the day.In 2001, Josie Bullock ran for the Wellington mayoralty on a platform of bringing the wooden cable cars back into service. She claimed this would only cost about $300,000 to accomplish, even though this would require relaying the entire track and refurbishing the cars to bring them up to modern safety standards.On 24 February 1909, John William Wakelin, aged 30, was accidentally killed by the tram.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCable car (railway)\nFunicular\nList of funicular railways\nSan Francisco cable car system\nPeak Tram\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBurdett, Ron E.

          "We do this every time we come to Wellington, and it never fails to impress. We were lucky to have a nice fine day so the views were great. Nice complex at the top with a restaurant, seats outside, & a walk around path to see the city from different angles. My husband didn't",
          "Quick trip up the cable car to see the view and experience a bit of Wellington history. Children seemed to enjoy it and the cars were clean and efficient. Worth doing and you can wander round the Botanical gardens at the top for a nice walk too.",
          "Excellent way to go up and see the whole Wellington from the top. The Cart driver is very friendly and helpful.",
          "Our young children thoroughly enjoyed the return trip on the cable car. We took in the museum and also walked the grounds including the observatory. Best views on Wellington and a perfect fine winter's day",
          "The view from the top is pretty awesome. Nice cafe at the top too. The trip only takes a few minutes and is worth it.",
          "This was pretty cool, safe speed kids loved it and could stand while the cable car moved. Not a rough ride , lights in the tunnel were cool different, and the museum up the top was awesome we loved it",
          "Kids loved going on the tram and visiting the museum. My youngest loved the lights in the tunnel the most.",
          "Hadn't used the Cable Car for years and was pleasantly surprised how fun it still felt. The lights in the tunnel were super cute and I got a student discount which was an added bonus! Such a pretty view at the top as well.",
          "The view from the upper station makes the journey worthwhile. This was the beginning of a day which included the Cable Car Museum, a walk back down through the Botanical Gardens, lunch at Picnic Cafe, the Rose Gardens, Begonia House and the Bolton Street Cemetery. It was one of",
          "The round-trip cable car experience was fun. Keep your eyes open for the light installations in the tunnels. The museum up top is informative and easy to navigate.",
          "My friend and I took the cable car to the top so we could catch the shuttle to Zealandia. The car itself was cute, but there was only a span of about 60 seconds with a good view of Wellington. The whole ride lasted perhaps less than 10 minutes, much shorter than I was expecting.",
          "We went up the hill with the cable car, had a stroll around the Botanic Garden and drove back down. Although it's just a short drive, it's real fun and a nice experience. Some light effects in the tunnel and a nice view from the top. Would definitely recommend.",
          "Fun experience to ride the cable car to the top of the lookout! Easy walk back through the gardens to city- highly recommend taking your time and enjoying the walk down. Lots of other activities to do at the top as well- cable car museum, space place, gardens, and a shuttle to",
          "Kids are free on weekends. A lovely experience and beautiful views from the top. We didn't have a long wait. Plenty to see and do at the top.",
          "Allow plenty of time for this attraction as there are likely to be queues at the bottom. Well worth the trip and the views at the top are magnificent. One tip, if you are mobile enough and you have sufficient time, it is worth just taking the single trip to the top and walking",
          "My older mum really enjoyed her trip up the mountain to the top - we had a lovely afternoon tea when we arrived. The car was clean and pleasant to ride in",
          "The Cable Car ride is interesting in itself, but the highlight is the view from the top. This looks out over Wellington with views to the sea and covers a lot of the CBD. The saying 'you can't beat Wellington on a fine day' is true! A fantastic picture opportunity.",
          "One of the things that a visitor to Wellington wants to do, but it\u2019s quite a short ride, and you don\u2019t get a particularly good view from the cable car. However, The views from the top over the city and the bay are excellent. We rode up before 0900 and the museum wasn\u2019t open,",
          "This was a fun way to get to an elevated overlook. The locals say it\u2019s like San Francisco, as a native I don\u2019t agree but it is similar.",
          "The ride lasts about 10 minutes and there is not much to see from the car. Once at the top there is a small museum which is interesting for about 5 minutes. The views from the top are quite good but really not worth going out of the way to see.",
          "This is a fun little ride on a historic cable car that stops along the way because, it isn't an amusement ride, it is an actual functioning method of transportation for folks going into the city to work. After leaving the city streets the cable car climbs up through various",
          "on one of the stops we took advantage of this, at the top you got a great view of Wellington, it's quite hilly.",
          "We took the cable car from the Lambton Quay entrance to the Kelburn Lookout. The cable car ride was okay. Don\u2019t worry about getting a good seat on the cable car since it\u2019s difficult to take photos on-board. Wait until you get to the top for the views. As the cable car",
          "The cable car takes you up from the city centre to a place with a wonderful view over the city, and right next to the Botanical Gardens (which we could have done with more time to view, possibly?). And most interesting from the railway point of view too!",
          "We took a ride on the Wellington Cable Car to the top of the Botanic Gardens, There was no queueing or waiting to catch the car. A great way to the top of the hill.",
          "Wow, bit of a crush at Bottom Station with a Sunday morning crowd, but seemed to move people through quickly and the cars are immaculate as were the stations.The ride itself was probably a little under-whelming, but pleasant way to get to the top and enjoy the great views over",
          "To enjoy a ride on this unique cable car I recommend to come early in the morning to be first otherwise you may have to wait. It is a spectacular experience and from top you have a wonderful view over the city.",
          "This is a must do attraction in Wellington. Considering the cable car runs from the centre of town, to the top of the hill, the entrance was not easy to find; we walked past the alleyway leading to the entrance twice! Once we found it, we opted for a 1-way journey (we planned",
          "A must do when in Wellington We have a transport obsessed 6 year old and the pure delight of sitting next to the driver and watching the cables go up. We did this twice both on the most amazing weekends in wellington, a true highlight and a bargain Go visit the kids park if you",
          "This was our 'must do' activity in Wellington. We had to wait for a little while for the ride to the top, but it was worth the wait. The scenery was great even on an overcast/rainy day to check out the view of Wellington Museum was great - a blast from the past",
          "It's just nostalgia....but have to ride the cable car every time I come to Wellington......pity we can't ride on the side as we did back then in \"the Day\"",
          "An easy way to get to the Zealandia attraction and Botanic Gardens. A smooth ride and a good experience for a short time in Wellington.",
          "The cable car only takes a few minutes to the top of the hill but is a great way to get a view of the city taking a step back in time.",
          "We went up to the Botanical gardens on this cable car and not only found it fun but less exercise than the walk up.",
          "We enjoyed the Wellington Cable Car Journey in mid-March of 2020. The most difficult part was finding a parking spot as the cable car begins in downtown Wellington. The cable car is relatively inexpensive at $8.00 NZ and is really fun. The ride to the top is short and you can",
          "Short fun ride up the hill! After already having had a full day, we knew we had to do the cable car, especially as our toddler LOVES everything transportation and train related. The ride up/down the hill is short, but fun! At the top you have access to the botanical gardens,",
          "this is a good way to get a good view of the city and a good way to get to the park and other sights",
          "A must deist with the Station Right in the Down Town area. There is a Botanical Reserve on the top which you can walk down to the City.",
          "A quick walk from the coach took us to the car, which we filled. The ride up the hill was reletively short thorugh tunnels filled with lights. It was difficult to see any views as we were facing forward. At the top there is a museum about the cable car and a viewing room to",
          "The cable car is an easy way to get to the top of the hill. There is a small museum at the top along with some other attractions. You get a great view of the city from the top. We opted to walk back down and there are clearly labelled routes for tourists to follow which include",
          "One of those must do tourist activities in Wellington. A nice view at the top but really just a ho hum experience.",
          "This is a must for everyone visiting Wellington. There is simply no better way to experience Wellington than to take this 5-minute ride from the heart of city center, up through the hillside terraced houses to the lookout high above the city. The views are amazing!",
          "After I walked up the steepest road I have ever climbed in life, to see son at Victoria university, my son shows me the cable car. loved the views and ride. $5 NZD adult one way.",
          "Vertaal in het Engels  Funny short ride. Long row, nice to look upstairs. Not super special but nice.",
          "Its kind of fun and an old institution. But dont bother buying the return trip, since its much nicer walking back down to town through the botanical garden,",
          "We took our kids up the Cable Car, they thoroughly enjoyed the novel way of going up the hill. The views are spectacular from the top.",
          "We love riding these things and this one was no exception. Very clean and smooth and a great view of Wellington too.",
          "We had a great day riding around Christchurch. Each driver did a very good job driving and tell all the passengers about different areas we were passing. And one of the drivers told us about a wonderful restaurant Casa Publica which had very delicious food and great waiter and",
          "We bought one way, and it was a great decision because going down the hill and seeing all the park was very nice. There are many types of flowers on the botanical gardens, I recommend to buy one way (up) and come down walking.",
          "Fun ride that only lasts a few minutes brings you from the beautiful gardens down to the main shopping street in Wellington.",
          "The cable car is a short trip However it is worth it The views over the city are great The bush walks at the top was a great work out History of the cable car very interesting Wellington does sightseeing well Glad we did this You don't expect a cable car in a CBD",
          "Exciting trip up...well worth it for the lovely long walk back down the the gardens and the famous Bolton cemetery. Buy tickets in advance or online to save queuing. They have a list up of all the cruises so you know what days to avoid being held up in queues.",
          "The Wellington cable car is a must do for visitors, made even better by the fact that it\u2019s used by locals daily as well. Well kept, clean tidy and efficient transport",
          "A low cost ride to the top of the hill, we then enjoyed a lovely walk through the Botanic gardens back to town Don\u2019t miss it",
          "When looking at photos of the cable car it\u2019s misleading The ride is ok services ok but very little information but very quick to direct you to a store to spend money",
          "The furnicular ride was a short one to the top where there are gardens and a beautiful view of the city. Walk around the gardens to admire the flowers and greens.",
          "Thoroughly recommend the cable car in Wellington, inexpensive and fun and great views when you get to the top.",
          "The ride is but a few minutes and the views fleeting The tunnel with lights is hardly entertaining. At maybe a few bucks less you wouldn\u2019t feel this was a tourist trap. Did enjoy the gardens.",
          "Convenient means to get to the quay and city from our AirBnB place up on the hill. Easy walk to Kelburn village from upper cable car station. Nice view of the city from the top and easy access to the Wellington Botanical Gardens.",
          "Novel step back into the past. Ride was short, but the views were amazing from the top. The museum was interesting",
          "It\u2019s a short ride to the top, but we enjoyed it. You can pay for a single trip to the top and walk down, or you can buy a round trip. We rode to the top and took the easy walk down. The botanical gardens were the highlight of our visit to Wellington, and they are easily accessed",
          "It was a fun 3 and a half minute ride up the hill to see a fine panorama of the city. You can visit the free museum at the top, walk in the gardens or have a cup of tea in the caf\u00e9. Look out for the coloured lights in the tunnels.",
          "Saw some cricket besides the wonderful bay over which Wellington looks. Just to note if you are catching this to get to the Botanic Gardens you will have a steep walk down to the rose garden and cafe. So best not to buy a return but just walk down back into the city.",
          "We all enjoyed this activity and we were a large family of parents, teenagers and grandparents. View from the top is wonderful u can see Wellington City.",
          "This was so fun! It is a short ride but doesn't cost much. We used it as a means of transportation to get to the shuttle up to Zealandia Sanctuary.",
          "We had visitors from the States and showed them around Wellington CBD. We were very proud to be able to take them up the Cable Car and walk through our amazing botanical gardens. A must visit if you have travellers to show around.",
          "If you're in Wellington you have to ride the cable car! It's a great, unique, way to get up to (or down from) the Botanic Gardens from the CBD. You can visit the (free) little Cable Car Museum at the top as well.",
          "We had an afternoon to spend in Wellington with a 3yr and 5yr old so thought we would check out the Botanic Gardens via the Cable Car. The kids loved to cable car and the lights in the tunnels. There area few different attractions at the top, but they were closed by the time we",
          "Riding both ways is about 20mins all up. Family and I took the ride at night and it gave us the opportunity to see Wellington and tunnels light up.",
          "Cable car ride itself is really just ok nothing special or WOW factor to it, but once you get up top lots to do and see with amazing gardens, landscape, walking tracks and lots of other things for all ages. I would recommend cable car up $5 and walk down only 30 minutes with",
          "Definately a cool way to get up to the botanic gardens, kids thought it was very cool and the views from the top are amazing.",
          "I personally loved my little ride up the Wellington cable car. It really is a must-do and so quirky for the city to have this. At the top you get a great view and have direct access to the beautiful botanical gardens as well as the observatory. I would recommend getting a single",
          "Excellent way to see the city and harbour. Good price - with opportunity to walk the Gardens from the top. Checkout the Cable Car history museum & slide show at the Top.",
          "You might think this is a conventional cable car but it is not. It\u2019s a quick ride up to the top of Mt. Victoria . Walk down ( leisurely) amid rose gardens, playgrounds, lovely views. Not to be missed!",
          "Cable car goes from downtown shopping area to the botanic gardens. Brilliant trip goes through two tunnels which give a light show as you go through. It\u2019s quite cheap and well worth doing. Lovely restaurant at the top and the gardens as well as o lovely view of the whole of",
          "Its great when old pieces of infrastructure remain, and work efficienty and effectively. For $5 each we ascended by the Cable Car and we rewarded with a glorious view of Wellington and its surroundings. We chose to return by via the Botanic Gardens where there is a signed route",
          "The cable car or funicular is a bit of fun and an easy way to see Wellington from above, though not the most exciting looking city compared to Sydney Australia, where we are from the $9 return ride is reasonably priced in fact it cost us more to park in the city also we found",
          "Was an awesome journey, great for families, beautiful lights in tunnels, lots of people on board for our trip so had to stand, but that was fine.",
          "My wife and I were on a tour and took this funicular cable car up to the summit. It takes about 5 minutes to get to the summit which is 120 meters high.",
          "This is a fun activity to do if you have an hour to spare, have a walk aroud up the top through the gardens and get some great photo shots of the city, there are public toilets at the top but a little grubby, Its not the best place to eat but good to take a picnic lunch",
          "Great way to see two areas of Wellington at a very low price and also experience a bit of history. We first enjoyed the shopping areas at the base of the cable car and then at the top of the cable car we enjoyed the museum, views and gardens. We had purchased the hop on hop",
          "One of the great cable car rides in the world, to one of the great views. Ride up and enjoy a long downhill walk through the botanical gardens.",
          "Although the journey doesn't last long, about 5 mins I think, it's worth every cent! The lighting effects in the tunnels and the destination at the top make it worthwhile.",
          "very reasonably priced at $9 return......thank you. Take the ride up and stroll back down through the Botanical Gardens. Lovely Lady Norwood Rose Garden and Begonia House. There's a coffee shop at the top should you feel the need as well as a nice little museum. A very nice way",
          "What a great view of Wellington on a warm clear day, the Cable car is only minutes ride but worth to see Wellington at another level from the hill. Cheap and easy to ride.",
          "You have to get up the hill one way or the other and this was a great way to go. It is a rather short trip, but scenic. The walk down thru the Botanic Garden was well worth it.",
          "Good value at $9 return , Queenstown is $44. The view is good and there is a cafe up top. Coffee at $5.80 is the most expensive I have ever had apart from Switzerland but at least it was good coffee",
          "Had an afternoon in Welly so had to go do this.. $9 for a return ticket... but I would consider a walk down so a son tip for $5 would be my recommendation.. Very nice tho and great view going up.. and down too.. Open until 22H so would Great to see with the city lights on o",
          "This is another one crossed off the bucket list. Had done it 50 years ago but the modern carriages are more comfortable and comply with Health and Safety regs. Still have to queue for tickets as it really has become a tourist attraction. The museum at the top gives the history",
          "Great cable car ride can\u2019t believe how windy Wellington is until you get to the top great museum also nice little cafe too if you want you can take the cable car up and walk back down through the Botanical Gardens",
          "A must do in Wellington NZ. A 10 minute ride up the mountain followed by a great view of Wellington You can walk back down through the beautiful Wellington Botanical Garden or ride back on the cable car.",
          "This was a nice little afternoon ride during our stay in Wellington. It doesn't take long to get to the top of the ride, where we exited and walked back down through the botanical gardens. Maybe some better signage to start you toward where the Botanical Garden is located, but",
          "Had fun going in cable car, looking round the museum and then walking down through the incredible botanical gardens, fantastic views of Wellington from the top, well worth it just for that!!",
          "Really enjoyed riding the tram to the top of the hill - and walking down through the Botanic Garden, Historic Cemetery and back down to Lampdon Quay.",
          "We paid our $9 each and hopped aboard with the seat at the lower window - great for photographs. This steep ride is a must do in Wellington, for the ride , the views and the panorama at the top.",
          "Walked up through the botanical gardens, had a great coffee at the cafe near the top and caught the cable car down. Job done!!!",
          "Enter the cable car from bottom in the middle of a terrific downtown shopping district or from the top where you have some terrific views. At the top is also a nice little museum and a cafe.",
          "As this is an icon of Wellington, you have to do it! The base station in the CBD was a little hard to locate, as it's basically down an alley. We bought roundtrip tickets, but ended up exploring the Botanic Gardens and then walking back into town through the Bolton Street",
          "The best way up to the top of the Botanical gardens. Spectacular views at the top. Always good to ride on an historic transport system",
          "It's just nice, being the traditional Wellington thing. Beyond that, it's not a special ride, just a uphill 5 minute trip. However, you can enjoy the views from above, once you get off the cable car, and walk through the gardens.",
          "short ride - nice museum at the top - cafe there a bit pricey. walk down through the botanic gardens a good way down - weather permitting !",
          "This is a MUST-DO activity when in Wellington, NZ. But, at only $5NZ (US$3) you can go up to the top for the best photos in the city! I'd recommend the 20 minute easy walk down back to town. On a clear day, you can see forever! This is highly recommended tourist activity for a",
          "Something fun to do if you are in Wellington. We were only there for the day so it was nice to take the ride to the top of the hill to get a panoramic view of the city.",
          "Cheap way of going to the top of the botanic gardens. It will save you a hilly walk. Take the cable car lane from lambton quay.",
          "Cute and different option to get to the Botanic Garden, the rio takes less than 10 minutes (or at least that\u2019s how it feels). O. The way you are not able to see the city but the tunnels have cool lights shows. The view from the top is nice!",
          "Spent the day in Wellington and had to go up in the cable car to see the views. Well worth the ride for the stunning views from the top.",
          "The cable car ride was short but well worth it. I would recommend the walk back down to the CBD through the Botanical Gardens (the gardens were beautiful even though it was raining lightly) as an alternative to returning on the cable car.",
          "You get a good view o Wellington. Recommend that you take the car up the hill, then an easy walk back down through the botanical gardens. When a cruise ship is in, there are plenty of guides to show you the way.",
          "Definitely worth of your time. It may be a bit challenging to find it at first, but the ride up hill will def be worth it. If you\u2019re lucky to get clear sky, the view will be amazing!",
          "Very regular service with great views over the city. Cable car in extremely good and clean condition. As a NZ Gold Card holder the \"up\" trip was free but as my return \"down\" journey was after 3.00pm I was charged $5 for a single trip. No big issue but a 3;00 cut-off is surely",
          "Great way to see the city. Takes tou up to the top of rhe city, and you can walk down through the fardens.",
          "Didn't have much time because we were visiting on day trip from cruise ship. The queue seemed to be neverending but eventually we made it (about 30-40 minutes wait). Great views from the top. Enjoyable ride. Walk around at top. Great little cafe and friendly staff - yummy food!",
          "Took us to the top and started our garden walk. The cable car was very clean and was on time and driver was very friendly .",
          "Friendly staff and good value for money. It was not luxury and the view on the way up was not particularly exciting, but the Botanic Gardens were beautiful.",
          "Well established for us tourists but did not realised still a very active part of transportation for the residential community to get into the city and return home We rode the cable car up, where there is a cable car museum with the history layed out, then we miander back down",
          "Can say we've done it. They take gold card. Awesome view from the top. Worth the trip. Got to do it while in Wellington",
          "Really enjoyed our ride on the cable car. Great cable car museum at the top which is really interesting and amazing views over Wellington. Lso a cafe. Walked back through the botanical gardens which were lovely.",
          "I guess it is a must to take the cable car in Wellington, even when the ride is just a few minutes. The car is kinda cute and the view from the endpoint is nice. After the cable car ride the walk in the botanical garden is a must. I enjoyed a lot.",
          "We took some friends who were visiting from Adelaide on a cruise ship to the Cable Car and they were hugely impressed, so much so that rather than us driving them back down, they took the return journey by cable car - very impressed!!",
          "Our two 6 year old grandsons really enjoyed their ride up and back. The little museum is interesting, as was watching the cables pulling the cars up.",
          "The actual ride is very quick. What you are going for here is the experience and the nice views on top of the hill. There\u2019s also a trail through the botanical garden to get down to the starting point without taking the cable car back. Just make sure you don\u2019t pay for the return",
          "This is a fun tram to ride to get up to where you can get a nice view of part of the city There is a restaurant/snack shop at the top. Some locals,use this for their commute to work.",
          "Short but memorable journey to reach the Botanical Gardens and Wellington Observatory. Marvellous piece of engineering affording great views in comfort.",
          "It's a nice way to get a good view from the top, a bit confusing on after being at top how you pay to get back down which is pay again back at the bottom but some great views and nice ride",
          "Nothing special, but always neat to ride a cable car. Very good view overlooking the central business district and bay.",
          "Worth using to go up To the botanical garden, good museum at th3 top very detailed history of the cable car and its popularity.",
          "Really enjoyed the Wellington Cable car. Once up good views of the City and wonderful walk down through the botanical gardens.",
          "We took the cable car up to the top which was a cheap way to travel. Once at the top we sat with a coffee and enjoyed the breathe taking views before walking back down through the botanical gardens.",
          "This is a great way to get up the the Botanical Gardens where there are great views over the city. The cafe/resaurant on the summit offers good food and great coffee. A must see if you are in Wellington.",
          "This is an easy place to visit on the main Street, and is a cheap $5 trip to an excellent view over the city. You can also go on to Zealandia eco park, or walk down through the botanical gardens. Nice half day out.",
          "Nice, but short, ride to the top. While not like the San Francisco cable bars it does the job. Best part is the top area with museum & shop, views overlooking Wellington along with other amenities. Well worth the time.",
          "Despite having to battle with a cruise ship of passengers all wanting to get on the Cable car, the queues moved very quickly and the wait not too long to get onboard. What a great, quick, picturesque way to get to the top of the hill! Enjoyed the small museum at the top of the",
          "Enjoyed the short ride in the cable car to the top of a very steep climb which has a terrific view at the top. It\u2019s busy at times but the cable cars run regularly- we paid $5 for a one way trip to the top, and walked down via the botanic gardens, and cemetery. It was a",
          "The cable car provides a fun way to the hill above Wellington for an overview of the city. Watch out for the queues for tickets and the large bus tours that queue jump you! Adult tickets $5. The ride is smooth with great views. The tunnels have a disco light effect... Once",
          "Suits it\u2019s purpose, nice simple ride with a lovely view. Only issue was the attitude of the man who greeted us. We\u2019d bought a city pass at the information centre for three attractions, one being the cable car. The older gentlemen behind the kiosk didn\u2019t recognise this voucher,",
          "We got a return ticket but walked back via rose garden and cemetery. Some nice houses and views on the way up, more a means of transportation than an attraction? Still cool though.",
          "Although the ride itself was pretty fast, the sights along the way are great! A transformation from the lively city to the picturesque hills of Wellington. Also, nice view at the top.",
          "It is a definite must to ride the Wellington Cable Car up the hill from Lambton Quay to the botanical gardens and to catch the shuttle to visit the Zealandia nature refuge. It is also a short walk from the bottom station of the cable car run to the Queen's Quay to find excellent",
          "The cable car itself isn\u2019t very exciting, but it\u2019s a great way (defined as quick and easy) to get to the top of the hill.",
          "A nice, quick, and fun way to get to the top of the hill for great views.We rode up and walked back down. It does not take long but is worth it for a bit of fun and to save your legs going up hill!",
          "Not worth the hype. Better for people who have intention of using it as a form of transport to get to one place to another, instead of coming to experience it as an attraction. It is a fairly short journey (less than 5 min) at $5 for a one way ticket with no view",
          "The ride itself is fairly short, but worth the price for the experience. You go through a few tunnels and two of them had light shows that were neat. Once at the top, you had a great view of the city & water, plus the cable car museum was right there. We only did a one way,",
          "Good way to get to the top of the hill...iconic experience in Wellington. Once at the top you have easy access to the cable car museum, the observatory and a leisurely walk down through the gardens. A well spent $5!",
          "Loved the cable car and psychedelic tunnels with cool colourful lights. The view from the top is great and walk through botanical gardens magical. We took a return ticket but there are at least a couple of exits that one can take to reach Wellington on foot.",
          "You travel in a very old cable car. The ride is short about 5 min to the top. There you can visit the. Cable Car museum and then walk through the gardens. Also from the top you have a view over the city. It is a great location to take a picture of Wellington. The city is not",
          "Its not long, but it's handy, especially you are going to th botanical gardens. A shuttle to Zealandia also leaves from the top. The view is nice but not earthshaking.",
          "This is a must do when in Wellington , it is cheap with family and student discounts , we went up to botanical garden , down past the Henry Moore sculpture to the graveyard , we then walked further past the old government building , the beehive then through the railway station",
          "The cable car trip is worthwhile in itself for the scenery and the experience. At the top there are numerous treats, such as the museum, the cafe, the perfumery, the gardens, and more in addition to the amazing views from the lookout.",
          "The starting point of the cable car is hidden in a ugly shopping center like area and you find it easy when you follow the queue. The way upwards with the light effects is a nice start. Arriving at the top in the botanic gardens you will be welcome from multiple city volunteers",
          "Great trip! Terrific views, very interesting cable car museum at the top - make sure to visit the perfumery too, across the courtyard.",
          "I always love a trip on a cable car and the Wellington funicular was a great way to get up to the Gardens. It's only a short, five minute journey and is very reasonably priced. The views from the top are stunning so it's well worth the trip.",
          "It was my first time riding a cable car! They really did a cool job with lights in the tunnel. It reminded me of warp speed from Star Wars or Star Trek. You don't have to buy the tickets in advance, you can just buy them in person. We took it up to the Botanic Gardens which",
          "A must-do. A wonderful way to spend a few hours. Take the ride to the top and walk down through the gardens.",
          "SO reasonably priced and such fun. We rode up, walked back. No need to book ahead, pitch up and enjoy.",
          "Walked to Cable Car from our Hotel. Buying tickets was quick and efficient. No concessions for seniors unless you are a NZ resident. The cable car is relatively quaint, but a great way to get to the high area in Wellington wher eon can visit the Space Place and the Botantic",
          "Cable car goes through tunnels, not a scenic trip up as we Expected. Cafe, museum and observatory all closed by 5.30 pm, although cable car runs until 10.00 pm. Botanic Gardens are not actually in evidence at the top, need a bit of a walk to see them. Some views of city, but",
          "A short and brief ride up the hill. Aside from a nice view it was unimpressive. The walk down through the gardens was the best part.",
          "Only a short ride but worth the $5. You travel to 3 stations through lit up tunnels. Only took the tram up as you can walk back down through the botanical gardens which are beautiful but steep in places. At the top is the tram museum - definitely worth a visit.",
          "We were given a complimentary one way voucher to use the cable car by our hotel (The Bolton), it\u2019s a quick efficient way to reach the top of the Botanical gardens and is also wheelchair accessible.",
          "It is a very pleasant way to visit the Botanical Gardens. Runs pretty frequently and is comfortable.",
          "This journey is only short but good value. I bought tickets online to avoid queues but there weren\u2019t really any queues. The views at the top are great as are the gardens. Cable car can be rather crowded which reduces the enjoyment. Zealandia bus goes from the top which is",
          "Took a return trip on the cable car. Super value for money and the view at the top was amazing. Well worth a visit",
          "The Wellington Cable Car is a \u201cmust do\u201d event for tourists. It\u2019s inexpensive to ride, is quite unique for it goes up and down a very steep incline but the actual distance it travels is only one km or so. I recommend that you take the cable car ride one way - upwards, get off",
          "Don't be confused that this is a sight seeing adventure. It is just a mode of transport to get from the top the bottom in Wellington. It is not a cable car where you will have lovely views but a funicular. It's great if you are using it to get from A to B but don't waste your",
          "This was one thing i was truly looking forward too but i was disappointed with the cable car as you are in a tunnel 99% of the time and only a brief moment (less than 1 minute) before you reach the top that is out in the open. Whole ride up goes quick over in a matter of",
          "Even better for Senior Gold Card holders being free at certain times I preferred the previous cable car ~ more vivid experience and not cocooned by electric doors, windows and air conditioning. Still a great experience and great for all ages",
          "There are not many activities to do in Wellington, but Cable Car is one that must do. It has history and very comfortable, only $10 for return ticket. The only cons I think is the length of it and not much to see during the trip. Of course you could take more photos of the city",
          "With the hype, I thought this cable car ride would be a longer ride, but the lines for ticket and a seat is longer than the trip. Once on the car ride, you can't really see much of Wellington from the car. but the view from up the top is great. the cable car museum was",
          "The cable car takes you to the top of the hill where there are museums, hikes, and various gardens. It is lovely.",
          "The cable car goes from Lambton Quay in the centre of the city up to the botanical gardens. It is 5 NZD single and 9 NZD return. It is sensible for the visitor to combine the cable car trip with a tour of the gardens, so ride up and walk down. There is also a cable car museum at",
          "The ride is short. Kind of disappointed. Should have just drive up to see the scenery. Waste my $ on the tram.",
          "I was expecting a network of cable cars that were connected to the city's most vibrant neighborhoods. I got a ride on an amusement park type ride that tried to give the flavor of San Fran. It dropped me off at the Wellington Botanical Gardens and did connect me to a free taxi",
          "It was an unique experience and easy way to get to Botanical Garden or Zealandia. We purchased the family ticket in advance over the internet, so it was just a matter of scanning in the QR Code at the turnstile. The cable cars come frequently, and there were no queues, so no",
          "The cable car is a quick (but inexpensive) trip up the hill. The bit that\u2019s really great is firstly the birds over the city and then the access to the botanical gardens. The walk down from the top is delightful, and well signed.",
          "We took the cable car on the downward journey, there is a small building at the top housing an original museum piece cable car along with a very small souvenir shop. There are obstructed views over the harbour outside the platform. Once you board the cable car there really is no",
          "Before you buy a round trip ticket I would consider buying a one way up then walk down through the botanical garden. You can also view the parliament buildings as well. Saves a few dollars and you get plenty of exercise.",
          "Enjoyed our trip up the mountain. Had a walk around the botanical gardens. Views were worth the trip",
          "A tradition stretching back to the early 1900s and the only way some people have of getting to work. Great views over the harbour and the Botanic Gardens and Observatory there for you to visit also so well worth a trip. Look in the free cable car museum for the history of this",
          "Must see in Wellington New Zealand was the billing... they were right. we were very impressed that in the middle of a busy city there is an outstanding Cable Car that takes folks to the top of the mountain, the botanical gardens and magic vistas",
          "Although a normal form of everyday public transport for Wellingtonians it is a must if you are a visitor to Wellington. The whole thing is steeped in history and if you like to know the ins and outs of things as I do you will most likely find this attraction quite the",
          "After a nice walk to the top of the botanical garden we decided to experience the cable car going down. A great service and terrific views across the City and water.",
          "It\u2019s so affordable this tram ride up to the top and the view is outstanding but the feel of being on the tram is really nice And it\u2019s kept so clean too",
          "The cable car runs regularly and is very clean. The ride up to the Botanical Gardens only takes a few minutes and the panoramic view of Wellington is well worth the trip.",
          "Found in a mall along Lampton Quay, the cable car takes you up to the botanical gardens. From which you get great views of the city. You purchase a one way or return ticket at the ticket office then go through the turnstiles using your ticket to board the cable car. On the way",
          "A quirky mode of transport but like the disco lights in the tunnels and the view from the top was lovely. We bought a one-way ticket and walked back down through the Botanical gardens which were stunning. The museum is worth a visit and has a restored original streetcar on",
          "This was the long activity done on a day trip to Wellington. We were blessed with brilliant weather so had amazing views. Great way to finish a great day...and not expensive",
          "The actual cable car is cool if you have never ridden in one. It is confusing on how to pay. We went down and you pay after you get off. It's weird as there are no signs.",
          "The cable car runs regularly and is clean. The ride is smooth and the tunnels lights are funky. Use this to get up to the Space Place and Botanical Gardens. The view of Wellington is great from the top and there is a cable car museum, toilets and cafe.",
          "my daughter and I took my grandson who is almost 2 on the cable car. He was very impressed with the lights in the tunnel. Also as we haven't been on it for sometime it is always nice to see Wellington from the cable car",
          "The cable car was nice, we went uphill through tunnels that had different lights in them. The view from the top was amazing and the botanic gardens were super nice too!",
          "Short ride but impressed, the view at the top was remarkable, didn't have time to go around the gardens, will try another time.",
          "The Wellington Cable Car was born of necessity in the early part of the twentieth century to develop the hills above the downtown port area. Wellington is some ways evokes San Francisco in that there are steep hills surrounding the city and its lovely Lambton Harbour. The",
          "Loved the trip up and back the mountain in the cable car. The views from the top were awesome and my son loved the LED lights in the tunnel. I have been to Wellington about 10 times but this is the first time I have been on the cable car and thoroughly enjoyed it.",
          "Only $5 each for a ride up the cable car. It's only a 5 minute ride, but rather cool and saves a slog up the hill. Then you have a nice view over the city, a cafe, museum, perfume shop and Zealandia you can visit, and then take a meandering walk down the hill through the",
          "When we have friends over we take them on a scenic Wellington tour and the cable car is where we start. It is a quick ride up, but I think it is nice and I like the lights in the tunnels. On the top, the cable car museum is worth a visit and of course you need to take the",
          "Used the cable car to get up to the gardens. Then we had a nice stroll down enjoying the well manicured gardens.",
          "The views from the top are well worth the price (which was very reasonable). We loved the illuminatated tunnels - very cool and something I haven't seen before. There weren't any waiting lines when we were there, and the cable cars come frequently. We also had lunch at the",
          "Great way to easily marvel at the topography of this city and the engineering prowess of our forefathers! Kids loved it. Cable car museum at the top (free) has dressing-up clothes which entertained for an hour as they got into role!",
          "Exciting and comfortable. Very nice and pleasant way to climb the hill to Botanic Garden. With a very nice cafe at the end of the cable car",
          "We did this up and down as we had limited time. We had a smoothie and a scone at the top and both were very good. The view if you have done things like this in the past was average at best. I can't speak of the gardens you could walk through on the way down as we didnt do that.",
          "The 3.5 minute ride up the mountain goes very smoothly. Once up the top you need to walk around the gardens to make it worth the trip. Interesting views from the top.",
          "Loved our trip so much. Wandered around botanic garden with terrific views. Short trip up but take time to do an adventure while at the top. Enjoy daytime & evening rides for more great photos",
          "We took a one way trip up in the cable car having decided to walk back down through the lovely gardens which was fantastic and ending down at the Rose Garden and Begonia House. While at the top we had a relaxed coffee and then took in the cable car museum before walking back",
          "Over far too quickly, but magical just the same, we rode the Cable Car to the top and walked leisurely back down the Botanical Gardens, which is a lovely circuit. The best bit about the Cable Car was the light show through the tunnel.",
          "Was expecting a bit more, over in about 4 minutes, go one way and walk back. Nice coffee at the top and quite a cute spot.",
          "The cable car was really fun to take up from the centre of Wellington. Its not very long but worth the $5. Getting to the top is the best part. There are 2 free museums at the top - the cable car museum (great for kids and adults) and the perfume museum. The perfume museum is a",
          "great lookout not too commercial, but if you want you can find souvenirs as well the museum is ok...",
          "Really interesting cable car and history. Was quite a short ride, but the view from the cable car and the tunnels was cool!",
          "The Wellington Cable Car is land-based, not an aerial gondola. When you arrive at the top in the suburb of Kelburn, there are beautiful views of Wellington. There, you may visit the free cable car museum and/or the free botanic garden. The cable car museum is rather small.",
          "The cable car was an excellent way for us to go to the Botanical Gardens. It was easy to get to and reasonably priced, not to mention a fun ride.",
          "Only takes a few minutes to get to the top worth it for the views. You can then do museum and space centre which is worth a visit. I would walk back down through gardens rather than take cable car back down.",
          "A very short trip but well worthwhile as the views on the way up are spectacular. Easy to access & reasonably priced",
          "The cable car was very good but the wait appeared long but it moved within 20 minutes. The venues at destination were excellent esp the Space Museum.",
          "The ride only takes 5 minutes, and you may need to queue for 10 minutes to get on, but the views of Wellington and the harbour from the top are great! The free cable car museum at the top is well worth a short visit, and a stroll through the streets of pretty Kelburn up the top",
          "This is a must do when you visit Wellington. The view of the city from the top is beautiful and then you can walk through the Botanical Garden.",
          "Bit of a queue to use but once on a quick assent up the hill side. Good views of the harbour from the top . Cafe and small museum at the top with nice botanical type gardens to walk around. Bit of a damp day when I went but on a clear day views would be fantastic. Cable car is",
          "If you are visiting wellington, you just have to have a ride on the cable car - Swiss engineering in the Southern Hemisphere at its best The lower terminal does get crowded and busy. My advice is queue in the upper boarding section if you want a good hillside view - queue in",
          "A short ride with a few stops upward with panaramic views of Wellington, NZ. The Botanical Gardens and cable car museum among other sights are on the route.",
          "The cable car gets you to Kelburn in just 5 minutes. Brings you to a pick-up point for Zealandia. Also brings you to the top for a great view of Wellington.",
          "Well organized & a good outing for the full family in Wellington. Staff are amazing & friendly making family visits so easy. It\u2019s must to do in Wellington",
          "A $5 little cable car ride was good value and the walk back down to the city was beautiful. Don\u2019t expect anything amazing. It\u2019s just a cable car ride up the hill. Amazing feat of engineering and the little museum is worth a quick look.",
          "Very long queue but it went surprisingly fast to get onboard. The trip is nothing special, not like Hong Kong, the \"famous\" light tunnel is nothing. Very nice view from the top. I recommend walking down thru the wonderful botanical garden.",
          "We were staying near the top of the cable car, so using it once I was a must do. At five dollars one way per adult, it is not a multiple trip activity given it takes about three minutes. The tram goes every 10 minutes and is clean and extremely well maintained.",
          "It was a good experience, nothing to wow you but it's a tram-like car into which you get. The car then goes up the hill, if you have a return ticket, you can get back. On the top, there is a museum and botanical garden which are quite nice. The view from the top is awesome. I",
          "We went on the cable car as with it was not far from where we were staying. We had heard that it was a quick ride and great views. This is correct! We bought return tickets as we didn't think we would like walking back! The cable car was very quick!! The light tumnels were good",
          "Bargain at the price for an amazing view out over Wellington and out to the harbour. Worth a trip up, and a wander across the botanical gardens!",
          "The views from the top of the cable car are magical looking over all of Wellington and the harbour and the actual ride is very comfortable but quite short. Excellent little attraction.",
          "This cable car is actually used by locals because of the steep hill they live on. As a tourist I felt it was worth the $4 because we were there and wanted to experience it. Don't need to do it again.",
          "A short but fascinating trip. Weather was not the best with Wellington living up to its reputation as 'Windy Wellington' The rain added to the ambience! So views from the top were limited and the walk back down through the Botanical Gardens damp! Nonetheless a 'not to be",
          "At $5 each way it ends up being about $1 per minute but it\u2019s a cute ride up and an easy way to get great views of the City. Suggest a walk down again through the botanical gardens which are lovely and takes about 45 minutes down to the city via the historical cemetery and",
          "We went to the botanical Gardens with the cable car it was a lovely experience. The first ride we had was lovely was nicely interacting with the tourist. Going down was a very grumpy young man he hated his job you can see that. He could have a little smile on his face when we",
          "Stayed at Kelburn for 3 days so bought a 10 trip card. Regular service so 10 mins wait max. Worked well for our visit",
          "It is a short ride but at the top there are some great views. Also, from there you can start some very interesting walking itineraries going down through the botanic garden. First, you may want to visit the cable car museum.",
          "Enjoyed the ride. It wasn\u2019t long but gave an amazing view from the top of the track. Loved how the cable cars ran every 10 minutes so time was of no issue.",
          "We understand that this is more like an icon of Wellington and we for sure wanted to visit and we did whoever it wasn't what we were expecting.. but certainly we recommend as it's of course one of the things that you must do while visiting Wellington!",
          "This is a great way to access the attractions 'up top'. Although called a cable car I think of it as a funicular railway. I took the up journey. My first surprise was that it had intermediate stations before reaching the upper terminus. Indeed, some locals used it as a 'commute'",
          "A must if visiting Wellington and once at the top you can see all the history relating to these cable cars from the beginning to now.",
          "It was a great experience travelling on the cable car. What a great way to see Wellington. Have a great look around the museum and especially the bottom level to see the original cable car. The lights through the tunnel were very pretty.",
          "Great experience, short ride, but lots to see when you get to the top. Well worth a trip up. Don't pay cruise ship tour prices !!! There are free shuttles, this actuation is a short walk from shuttle. The cable car cost $9 return, there are gardens, cafes, shops, museum , space",
          "We rode up on the cable car and wandered down the hill through the botanical gardens. The Rose Garden at the bottom of the hill was a highlight. The roses are huge here. We exited through the cemetery at the bottom of the gardens. It was an enjoyable way to spend the",
          "A unique way to reach a great view. Cafe at the top (great service, good food, reasonable prices) made a for a pleasant stop and many walked back down the hill via the Botanical Gardens (immediately adjacent). Buy return only if you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll travel both ways via the cable",
          "Beautiful clean car with clean windows for clear views. Be sure to go before 3:00 because the Zealandia tour bus offers it's last ride at 3:40.",
          "Great must see and do when in Wellington Very affordable Great views Great museum at the top very informative Great coffee shop and eatery at the top",
          "We got on the first cable car to arrive. Nice but short ride, partially through tunnels with coloured lights. The botanical gardens were beautiful to walk through, but pretty steep on the way back up to the top if you buy a return journey!",
          "This Funicular Railway is a fun way to get up to the top of the hill in order to hike down through the Wellington Botanic Garden.",
          "The cable car mainly goes through lighted tunnels (understandable, given Wellington's windiness). However, this means there is not a lot to see on the trip itself. The real gem is the botanical gardens at the top and the grand views down to the harbour (again from the top, not",
          "It was very short ride up, under 5 minutes. They also really pack you in, so it can get very crowded. The cable-car itself is reminiscent of an older version of the one in Hong Kong (going up Victoria Peak). We bought one-way tickets, then walked to Parliament House, then along",
          "We purchased our tickets online to save time and walked straight here once we were dropped off in the city. I loved the ride up to the top (especially the light tunnels). The walk down was fantastic as well - really handy guides helping",
          "The ride was fun, the lines not so. We had to stand in line for almost an hour to get up. The cable car was fun. Had two stops on the way. Takes you to the top of the mountains, from where you can see the city. Don't buy RT ticket! Instead, ride to the top and then walk down",
          "We jumped on the Cable Car in the city and rode it up the top. It is worth the trip just to see the city of Wellington from the highest point. The houses at the top are equally impressive. It doesn\u2019t take long if you time it right. Try and avoid cruise traffic, go early.",
          "Took cable first thing in morning and experienced no crowds at all. Later we noticed a line due to 2 cruise ships in town. Had good coffee at restaurant at top cable car stop. Checked the nice little museum. Free. Space observatory up there but not for internal viewing. Then",
          "An exciting journey steeped in history and surrounded by beautiful gardens. Walking down to town from the top is recommended as the botanic gardens are well worth a look. The history museum at the top is great. There is a nice cafe at the top as well.",
          "We went up the hill in the cable car a couple of times. This is definitely one of those must do things when you are in Wellington. At the top you have a magnificent view over Wellington. There is also a cafe to stop and have a coffee, something to eat or even a drink at the",
          "Many tours will drop you off at the top and collect you at the base. Interesting museum to look at before the descent which is quite spectacular.",
          "Located in the city center, this is a great way to get to the top and see Wellington on a clear day. After taking in the views, we descended onto the paths that took us through the beautiful Botanic Gardens. Some of the paths are a bit steep, so good walking shoes are",
          "Convenient method to reach scenic views of city. Once you reach mountain top there is cafe where you can grab small bite or beverage while enjoying the view.",
          "The ride itself is not long but certainly offers a bit of a novelty and nostalgia. Originally opened in 1902 the cars have been replaced but the route and tunnels remain historic. $9.00 return for an adult, operating Monday-Friday 7am-10pm, Sat 8.30an-10pm and Sunday 8.30am-9pm.",
          "On a fine day visiting the Botanic Gardens via the cable car is highly recommended. Excellent views on the journey up and at the top. It is an easy walk back into town (emerging near the Parliament buildings) down through the beautiful Botanic Gardens and Rose Garden (no signs",
          "Make the most of the cable car and try go on a sunny day. We started on Lambton Quay and went up, make sure you walk around the gardens when you are up there and go to the cafe in the gardens or one on Lambton Quay at the bottom cause the cafe at the top is quite overpriced. So",
          "Took the cable car to the top of the hill. It was cheap and better then walking. I do not know if you would call this an attraction, more of just a transportation.",
          "We took the cable car going down the hill. It is a comfortable ride and it takes you through two tunnels on the way down. At the top you have great views of downtown and the harbor. We found outcasts lot of people ride up and walk down through the botanical gardens. Because of",
          "The cable car trip was a nice unique experience that was really well priced. It was something that can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. The museum was interesting and worth a look. Great views from the top stop. Well worth it.",
          "Traveling in the Wellington cable car is worth it. The entrance is conveniently located in the city center on Lambton Quay. Those who have a fascination for cable cars will certainly enjoy the ride. The views from the top are okay. By reaching the top, one can get easy access to",
          "Seriously it's just a cable car; but it does get you to the top, and it's a really steep hike if your don't take it",
          "Quick ride to the top of Wellington. Good experience and well worthy the effort. Climb 120 metres in 5 minutes.",
          "Enjoyable trip to the top of Wellington, town lived up to it reputation wet and windy so we pasted on the walk down from there to the beehive, instead we rode the cable car down again. Good view from the top and on a dry day would have enjoyed the walk. Merchandising store at",
          "Cleverly decided to visit after lunch..no lines and straight up.. cute little train with a great view from the top.. an easy walk to get to the top.. nice and quick and well maintained",
          "The cable car takes you up to the top of the mountain in a couple of minutes. The ride is not spectacular, but it is nice enough and costs only 5$. It is a good idea to take the cable car up and walk down.",
          "Convenient, comfortable trip to the top of the Botanical Garden. We did walk past the entrance and luckily only walked about a block too far before we asked. Locate it on your maps ap.",
          "We went for a ride on the cable car because the last two times we had been to Wellington it had been closed for routine maintenance, both times about the same time of year. Loved the ride and the tunnels are cool. Particularly enjoyed the cable car museum at the top. Thought the",
          "We rode the Cable Car up the mountain and enjoyed the view from the top. Because it is springtime, the trees and bushes were flowering and their was a nice pungent smell in the air.",
          "Very poor signage, if it is such an attraction in Wellington they must have better signage. Staff must explain that botanical garden is a steep walk for a cable ride back. feel sorry for the senior citizens as there is no facility.I recommend buggy cars for those who want the",
          "Possibly because it was a Cruise ship day, the line was very long and took over half an hour. The cars are cute and well maintained. The ride is short, but better than walking. We walked down thru the old cemetery.",
          "Not only is this the easiest way to access Wellington's 'high country' like the Botanic Gardens, Observatory and even Victoria University it is an experience in itself. The cable car operates regularly from its base tucked away in Cable Lane (quite logically).The steep climb",
          "Nice ride to the top and walk down via the botanical gardens. Great way to exercise and get fresh air in the city",
          "Nice but nothing overly exciting, the view under the excursion is ok, and the staff is really friendly",
          "The cable car is really a vernacular and costs $9 return. There are good views at the very top so bring your camera. There is also a small free museum at the top.",
          "If you take the cable car from the center of town you don't have to climb all the way to the top of the botanic gardens. At the top there is a shuttle bus to Zeelandia.",
          "Is a lovely ride. By the end of the way you arrive in a massive and amazing park, reserve all day for enjoy the whole place.",
          "If you visit this lovely capital city in New Zealand, the cable car ride to the high point of the city is a must do. A relatively short journey, but tad guess are stunning. Easy access to the botanical gardens - another lovely experience.",
          "There was a lovely view from the top of he cable car and it's a great fast way of getting to the top for zealandia or the botanical gardens but the ride itself is not supper interesting. There are some great murals and lights in the tunnels that the cable car goes through but",
          "We took a one way ticket and then walked back via the Botanic gardens. Great views and fairly priced at $5 each one way!",
          "Cute historical ride up the hill in Wellington. Get off and go to the museum and the botanic gardens which are lovely.",
          "We took the cable car up for 5$ and took the great touristy foto and walked back down through the botanical gardens. Can totally recommend that as a trip. We also visited the small museum, it was interesting but I really loved the view up the mountain. Totally worth it.",
          "Wonderful ride up to Botanical Gardens (free), Planetarium, Cable Car Museum (free) and free shuttle to/from Zealandia eco-sanctuary. Short ride but worth the cost. Get the \"Return\" (roundtrip) ticket.",
          "Lovely and enticing, this is an experience to be had by all. By taking a ride you also have a ride to the Wellington Botanic Garden. Great experience.",
          "This was part of a tour but It cost $5- for the one way up the mountain side. Views up the top were wonderful. Very unique & something you should try & do in Wellington",
          "We went on the cable cars to the top . We grabbed a cup of hot chocolate at the cafe at the top. The view is amazing. Its a smooth ride to the top and only takes a few miniutes then a lovely walk down into the gardens. It was a little chilly when we took the cable cars but well",
          "Five dollars, three minute so probably not the highlight of your holiday but why not? Cable car museum up top well worth a look.",
          "Great way to see the botanical gardens and get a great vista of the city. Runs every 5 minutes and costs NZD 9 return but you can get a 1 way ticket and walk back (downhill) to be the city centre",
          "It is a must do in wellington and while it is not a spectacular cable car it is please ride to the scenic view of the top of hiill. The walk down is nice - about 30 minutes",
          "Great to get you to the botanical gardens & back! We only got it back down but it was a cute little trip! Reasonable priced & goes every 10 minutes!",
          "We took a return trip on the cable car passed through several will lit tunnels with coloured lights, it is a very steep descent but we felt safe. Two stops on the way up and down were you can get off at either.",
          "What a wonderful experience we had, from the start of being able to travel free with our SuperGold cards, to the magnificent views of Wellington. Thoroughly enjoyed the trip.",
          "Having visited the city for the first time we had to give the cable car a go. Great ride and spectacular scenery from up top.",
          "had a lovely ride up to the top in the cable car. Good price to! Had a great milkshake at the cafe at the top, and also saw a New Zealand Native bird close up, singing away, it was a Tui! you could tell by the two white bells on its kneck, so cool..... looked also at the cable",
          "Our cruise ship the Majestic Princess called in at Wellington for a day during our cruise around both islands of New Zealand. We took a coach tour to see the main sights and finally ended up at the cable car ride to the top.. The carriage was really old style and we made our way",
          "Went up the cable car with my daughter and grandson. A cool wee trip. We had lunch at the cafe, wonderful views of Wellington. Went to the wee museum then strolled through the gardens. Lovely way to spend an afternoon.",
          "Very cool small trip up the hill. Kids love it, and brings you to the top of Wellington's beautiful botanical garden. Do it on a nice and sunny day and you'll get a great view of the city!",
          "If you havent done it, it is worth the trip on yesteryear transport. Take stroll around the garden at the top and the observatory is also very good.",
          "A \"must-do\" as a visitor to the city. Great views, followed up with a wonder around the museum and the sprawling botanical gardens. A pleasant return trip down later in the day topped of our overall experience.",
          "A short but lovely ride up the mountain. With spectacular views & a comfortable cable car at very reasonable prices. Ended up spending more time than planned wandering the botanical garden & hillside. Plenty of places for little kids to enjoy & the playground was a fantastic hit",
          "This is the quintessential Wellington. The ride on the cable car is pretty funky, spotlessly clean and a bright roomy vehicle. There is easy access for walkers, prams and wheelchairs alike. We didn't feel rushed to get on or get off at the stops. The view from the top on our",
          "Booked tickets online for when our cruise ship docked, Everyone else seemed to have the same idea so spent the day exploring Wellington. What a lovely place!. By 3pm there were no queues and no waiting to get on. Could have spent hours up there just admiring the view except for",
          "Great cost and it was a quick beautiful ride, tucked into a little lane, which we actually walked past twice looking for it, but once we saw it we wondered how we missed it. Cues looked long, but moved very quickly, great price, and lovely gardens and cafe at top. Highly",
          "A short but enjoyable ride which we did one way down as part of a day tour of Wellington. Specially enjoyable as our last attempt was aborted when we arrived in Wellington on one of 2 huge ships and queue was just too long.",
          "This was very affordable and something you don't get to do everyday if you don't live in Wellington. The coffee at the top yum and the walk down through the Botanical Gardens was beautiful",
          "Kids loved the awesome light tunnel, driver was lovely and very accommodating and helpful with us having two infants in prams. Great views of Wellington from the top would recommend to anyone visiting this city.",
          "What a nice ride, There were colorful lights in a tunnel. The ride was short, but I was impressed with the views",
          "Bought the round trip cable car ticket\u2014 Went up and had a great snack a the Cable car cafe at the top and being that we didn\u2019t have a lot of time we went back down. Worth doing.",

          "One way on the cable car up to the botanical gardens , it was great , fantastic views of Wellington , would recommend and the free shuttle to zealander xx",
          "An enjoyable trip up the hill . The cable car museum is extremely interesting and well worth it. We didn\u2019t walk all around the gardens, but if you took the time it looked lovely.",
          "We got a one way ticket up and then did the city walk going down. Great way to see many different things in this part of the city.",
          "Nothing extraordinary, although a nice view. If with a car, better to access the same view and atop location via the nice botanic gardens",
          "5 minute trip to top. Runs every 10 minutes until 8pm then every 15 minutes until 10:00. A bit pricey but worth it. There are discount family and senior fares. Small museum and cafe at top open until 5 pm. Botanical Gardens are just yo right side of gardens just to right side",
          "Yes, do this if you can tho I would give the Museum and parliament buildings priority if time is short. You go up in the car, learn quite a bit about how land speculation and development happened in this area, enjoy a tea or beer at the top and get some nice views of the town.",
          "We took a ride on the cable car (funicular) on the last morning of our stay. It\u2019s quite expensive for what is quite a short trip, but still enjoyable, given it\u2019s not something you do every day. Two of the tunnel sections have multicoloured lights lining them, which made me",
          "This was really good, only a short trip up and back, but worth the ride. Tunnels all light up like a disco as you go through them, well done with that.",
          "Very economical, up to the top. Plenty to do and see, go for the night and take in the night sky. Great walk through the gardens",
          "Not to be missed- right in the heart of city shopping centre so easy to locate. Not expensive and lovely Cafe at the top.",
          "Short ride up the hillside to a panoramic view of Wellington and the harbor. Tram was clean and quiet. Worth a few minutes on a nice day. Not well marked but a three minute walk to the Dominion Observatory provided even better vistas.",
          "A fun one-time experience for me during my first few weeks in Welly, with stunning views of the city. Ride down from the botanic gardens for the full experience. Not worth using if a local, in my opinion.",
          "The ride is very short but the views from the top are good. The well sign posted walking route back down via the botanical gardens was thoroughly enjoyable.",
          "The cable car was excellent. We chose to ride up and walk down. The scenery was stunning. The big let down was the appalling manners of the cable car man who was boarding us. He was one of the rudest men I have ever met. I am stunned he has a job there as he really should not",
          "Great trip up the mountain to see the city and harbour. Well priced and easy short trip that runs regularly. Cable Car museum at the top was interesting. Also beautiful garden walks at the top. I will make sure I allow more time next trip to explore the gardens more.",
          "Having done the cable car in Hong Kong I wanted to do the same in Wellington. We went up just before 8pm and got some lovely night views across the city. I wish we\u2019d had more time to do it by day and walk back through the gardens.",
          "The entrance to Cable Car Alley is a bit hidden but located right in the centre pf town. On a sunny day, you'll get the best views of the city (from a central location- Victoria Peak is also great but further out) from here. You go through some slightly random flashing lights",
          "Great, inexpensive service. I recommend this place for a quick, cheap meal. Plenty of choices and fantastic value for money.",
          "The cable car is a must do experience with the kids. It is a short journey and a very reasonable price. You reach the top and check out the amazing views. There is also a cable car museum at the top. It is small but also free. We also enjoyed the walk through the botanical",

          "The cable car is easy to get to, reasonable ticket price. There wasn\u2019t a lot of things to do at the top (I didn\u2019t go to Zealandia though). Beautiful view of the city from the top.",
          "A fun wee trip up the cable car. Great colours through the tunnels and spectacular views at the top easy access onto Zealandia or to the botanical gardens. We visited the planetarium while up there also",
          "Good activity if you want to experience a bit of history and get nice views over the city. The LED light show through tunnels on way up was a nice touch",
          "The cable car connects the beautiful botanic gardens with central downtown. It is a fun experience, and the museum is also worth a visit.",
          "Everyone loves a cable car ride and they will enjoy this one. Friendly helpful staff and a smooth comfortable ride 600m up the side of the hill to great views at the top. You go through a tunnel with lots of fairy lights, must be good at night. If you have a Gold Card make sure",
          "This attraction continues to perform, with modern, clean and efficient cars and terminals. We enjoyed our return experience. There are excellent vistas from the summit over the Wellington CBD, harbour and towards the Hut Valley. At the summit, we enjoyed a short loop walk which",
          "Pulled up at bottom after walking down from the top. Wheelchair fitted straight in. Amazing tunnels and weird feeling when it starts it springs back and forth. Heaps of fun",
          "Entering Cable Car Lane and purchasing a return ticket on the Cable Car is a great way to view wellington both on the Journey up/down but the view from the top is magnificent. The Cable Car Museum is also worth a visit particularly if you have an interest in the history of the",
          "Great tourist attraction - only takes 5 minutes to ride the cable car to the other end, which is where you can purchase a ticket. Family with one adult & 3 kids was $15 return. There\u2019s a few eateries where you get off so we grabbed some lunch and then we got back on the cable",
          "We took the cable car uphill ($5) and then walked down through the Botanical Gardens (free). The ride is quick so just a trip up and back down would seem pretty expensive. The view from the top is glorious! And the casual stroll downhill through the gardens is a very pleasant",
          "Was a bit expensive if only going for the return trip, which isn't very long. We started at the base and rode up, got off and visited the Cable Car Museum (worth doing, interesting), walked around some of the gardens (very pretty), had lunch at the Cafe (average food, but nice",

          "this is really worth doing . Its unique and the view up the top at the cafe is superb on a fine day. It was like being transported back in time with the slow rumble of this oldcable car as it made its way up the hill. Not sure whether the twinkling lights in the tunnels would be",
          "The cable car journey is rather short but the view at the top is beautiful. I went in the evening so the view of the city lights was breathtaking. I felt it was little pricey (NZD9) for a short journey though.",
          "An interesting and comfortable ride, but somewhat overpriced, I felt. We started at the top where there is a cafe and museum, as well as the Observatory and gardens.",
          "A quick and practical way of getting to the top of the hill behind Wellington. Great lookout at the top and an enjoyable walk back through the Botanic Gardens, past Parliament House into the foreshore. Efficiently run, seems well operated.",
          "Fun ride to the top of the hill Reminds me of the cable cars in San Francisco but on smaller basis- there are only 2 of them Not a bargain",
          "Not worth the time as a cable car ride except if you want a arial view photo, but one would get better photos from the Mt Victoria lookout.",
          "Well worth a trip on this cable car. Plenty of room and worth the wait. Great ride to the top and then a walk through the gardens to the bottom. Have your cameras ready and a cup of tea in the cafe on the way down.",
          "I\u2019m not quite sure why this ride is $9 return. It literally takes fives minutes. The view is lovely and Carter observatory staff friendly. Nice blustery walk away from city life.",
          "The ride was smooth, short and fun! I love the view on top of the cable car, the wellington botanical garden and cable car museum is also at the top of the cable car. While at the bottom is the CBD just walk for 4 mins and you\u2019ll reach the wellington museum. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "This ride on the cable car only takes 3 1/2 minutes, so it\u2019s worth getting the return ticket just so you can ride it for a little longer. A ticket for a family of 5 is $20 return. The lit up tunnels are nice, and the views from the top are worth it. The museum up the top is",
          "What a fantastic little tram / cable car! The history is there and the walk down through the botanical gardens well worth doing!",
          "And before you know it, the funicular ride was over, but as a visitor to this beautiful city a ride on the bright red cable car was all just part of exploring. Our single ticket journey began at Lambton Quay rising up one hundred and twenty metres to the Botanical Gardens in",

          "The cable car is very much like Angles Flight in Los Angeles, Ca. but the views of Wellington at the top are spectacular. From the top you can see the entire bay and most of the city. The park is also a wonderful place for a relaxing stroll and fantastic views. The ride up is",
          "A very quick trip up, but a nice experience. Takes you up to the gardens where you can look around. There\u2019s also a cable car display. Beautiful views of the city. Perfect on a nice day.",
          "A charming ride with great views and a way to avoid some of the hills. There's a museum showing the history of the cable cars. Up the top you can visit the observatory and the botanic gardens.",

          "We were treated to two stunning days in Wellington and the weather was absolutely beautiful. With weather like that it meant a definite ride up on the cable car to take in the amazing views from the top and we wre not disappointed! Well worth it.",
          "We took a ride up the Wellington Cable Car. A nice little ride to the top of the hill overlooking downtown Wellington. Nice views of the harbour and also allowed us to walk through the Botanical Gardens.",
          "Visit to Wellington is incomplete without taking a ride in this lovely little cable car. One should go up the hill in this and come down walking through the Botanical Garden.",
          "Well they talk it up but it comes with no punch. Waist of time really. Get to the top and they have souvenir shops to buy from and a bar but that's about it.",
          "I was able to get many amazing photos of the city below. The meseum was nice the history of building the cable car. great area for photos.",

          "We arrived at the port on a cruise ship and took the free shuttle service into town and went to the cable car for our gondola ride. The weather wasn't so good, drizzly and cool but we had an excellent view of the vista. We took a walk around town afterwards. Lots of shops",
          "Climbing 120 metres in 5 minutes from Lambton Quay thiis attraction takes a short historic journey through hillside terraced houses to the lookout with spectacular views of the city. The Botanical Gardens are adjacent to the lookout and were in bloom with spectacular colours.",

          "What a ride in this rail that has been in going for 100 years. 2 Trams going in opposite directions. Great ride with fantastic views over Wellington, with Historic homes on either side. Once at the top you can take photos of Wellington and take a walk around the Botanical",
          "The ride was fun, and we didn\u2019t know to expect such a great view from the top of the hill, so that was even more of a bonus! There\u2019s also a free museum and a cafe at the top of the hill, and we went back again the next night to visit the space centre. It\u2019s a cheap bit of fun ($9",
          "On our 1st day in Wellington, our guide suggested we take the famous cable car from Lambton Quay. Lining up for the red cable car, we saw locals and tourists. it was a very quick 5 minute ride highlighted by a LED light display along the tunnel. The views on the lookout was",
          "We did not know what to expect with the cable car, but we paid our $9.00 each, (pensioners), and hopped on board for what turned out to be a fairly short trip of less than 10 minutes up the rather steep hillside. I think the car could also be described as a tram as that was our",

          "Great fun!!! So easy to jump on board and enjoy the trip up from Lambton Quay and arrive in Kelburn 5 minutes later. Lovely scenery and lots to see/do at the top (Kelburn) with the Botanic Gardens, Space Place & Observatory, the Cable Car museum and a wonderful cafe: Cable Top",
          "Cool lighting in tunnels short uphill ride reasonable cost, good views from the top. Worth a trip while you are there",
          "We used the cable thinking it\u2019s a must do local attraction. Most of the trip up the mountain goes through tunnels, with the panoramic views only at the top - probably I had the unrealistic expectation of seeing the city growing small as the funicular went up the mountain? The",
          "Due to recovering from an ankle injury we took the cable car to Vic Uni, or so we thought. We ended up the top, the last stop. Yes there is a good view, Despite there being a conductor there was no instruction about the stops. And we ended up walking back down to the Uni. I",
          "We took a family trip on the cable to enjoy the scenic view from the top. This was indeed amazing. There is a small museum at the top which is well worth a visit. The trip is worth it but quite expensive for the 4 tickets we needed as our children were not quite young enough",
          "Definitely a must do when you are here. We sat next to a local who pointed out various landmarks going up. The view up the top is amazing and although windy we had a perfect view.",

          "We liked hopping on the cable car and travelling to the summit to soak in the views. Cablecar itself is merely transport, obviously not much going on in itself, but was clean and comfortable. Ticketing was quick and easy and you don\u2019t have to wait a while either. Stations at",
          "This short and affordable cable car ride is a must for any traveller to Wellington! Once at the top, it gives a great view of the city and waterfront. There is also a lovely walk through landscaped gardens! Spectacular on a sunny day!",

          "When in Wellington always take the Cable Car on a good day to get fabulous views of Wellington Harbour. At top there's the Botanic gardens and you can get great walks. Cafe down at Rose garden is great but usually very busy. Cafe at top of Cable Car is ok. Avoid if there's a",

          "This is a must do when visiting Wellington. We visited he re 25 years ago and this was a much longed for return. We were not disappointed! Just as good as the first visit. We took the cable car up and walked down through wonderful gardens and a fascinating burial ground. We will",
          "The cable car trip takes about 5 minutes and is cheap. The museum at the top is interesting. The best features are that from the top there is easy access to Zealandia and the Botanic Gardens both well worth the effort.",
          "A short cable ride (funicular cable carriage ) and not a gondola which takes you from city centre in Wellington up the beautiful botanical gardens into Kelburn village Not bad for a leisurely afternoon away from hustle and bustle",
          "Took the Cable Car up the hill (free with Goldcard) so saved $9.At the top is a good little free cable car museum. Walked part way back down the hill in the gardens and then got back on the cable car. As mentioned free to us, otherwise $9 pp each way, which is expensive.",
          "Well priced, lovely views going up and a nice clean carriage with friendly staff. By far the easiest way to get up and down the city.",
          "Not only a great experience to ride the local cable car but also access to great sights, access to the Space Place and shuttle to the Sanctuary. You can buy one way tickets or with return for a few $$ more.",
          "It's a short ride up and down on the cable car, but oh so worth it. It gets you to the botanical gardens and the space museum, and along the way your treated to a wonderful little light show. It's unique and fun and worth the price. I recommend sitting all the way in the front",
          "5 NZD for a one way ticket, it's a cool experience if you are interesting on doing something new in Wellington Would say it's cool to do it but it isn't a must do. The ride up is about 8 minutes or so and if you are looking for a great view, I would rather recommend going on top",
          "We rode the Famous Wellington Cable Car up to the top for a Fabulous view of the city harbor! A fun experience that I would recommend!",
          "Cable Car starts from a narrow lane called \"Cable Car Lane\" right in the middle of the City off Lambton Quay. It was primarily built for the settlers in the Kelburn area and right up to the top where you have a Botanical Garden. Its a great Transpiration system for locals and",

          "Nice cable car ride that has nice views at top of the hill. Good attraction with reasonable admission fee. I recommend the best time to visit is near sunset so you can see views of Wellington during day, sunset and nighttime.",

          "Easy to find the terminal downtown, we were greeted by a big crowd which moved fairly quickly as each cable car is quite large. On the way up there are a couple of stops, however most people head to the upper terminal to take in the great view over Wellington and waterways,",

          "I have walked past 100 times but have never used the cable car so this was a first. Seems simple enough $ 4.50 per adult one way and some decent views from the top. I think next time I will take the car up and walk back down to the city through the botanical gardens. Enjoy......",

          "Bought round trip family ticket for 20$ (2 adult and 2 kids), which is cheaper than to buy separately. There is a small cable car museum on top - free entrance. We went up and walked around the botanical garden - exit on the city area. If you plan to go to the botanical garden,",

          "Shame they didn\u2019t have the Easter egg hunt on Good Friday. Went up on a great day and the views of Wellington were amazing. The lights in the tunnels and people on the cable cart were lovely. Always a good trip to take visitors and a favourite is the gelato at the top.",
          "We were dropped off by a shuttle bus from our cruise ship into the centre of Wellington. Our friendly and helpful bus driver told us to walk \u201cjust a wee way\u201d down the street to the cable car. It was very easy to find and we were so impressed with the organization at the ticket",
          "I\u2019m pleased we didn\u2019t pay for a return as the walk back down through the botanical gardens was outstanding. We waited a while to get on the tram and the ride was over fast. Views are limited. Hard to give this more than 3 stars",
          "We used the cable car on a sunny bright day so good views all around! Inexpensive at NZ$9 return. Very busy on Easter Saturday... at the top there is a cafe and several other tourist attractions..eg botanical gdns. We enjoyed!",
          "As a form of transportation to get to the botanical garden or to experience the cafe then it is worth it. But as an attraction in itself it\u2019s a bit overrated. I accept it is an engineering feat and could appeal on that basis and definitely a Wellington icon.",
          "Good fun way of getting to the top of the hill and visiting the planetarium and getting a view of the city and bay.",
          "to the top station and boy, this is steep! Fun, but steep! But then one is rewarded with great views, and the ride down is really enjoyable. I love that this is not a tourist thing but real mass public transport. Think Istanbul or Budapest more than Heidelberg. Note: If you",
          "Great little cable car and easy to access. Great trip up with excellent attention to detail in the car. Lights in the tunnels were a bonus",
          "A great affordable family activity. The views at the top are great and the planetarium is awesome, nice place to walk amongst the gardens",
          "We travel on the cable car every time we come to Wellington. It\u2019s such a unique experience with great views. Now we have led tunnels too! Great stuff"

        "wiki": "New Zealand Parliament Buildings (M\u0101ori: Ng\u0101 whare Paremata) house the New Zealand Parliament and are on a 45,000 square metre site at the northern end of Lambton Quay, Wellington. They consist of the Edwardian neoclassical-style Parliament House (1922); the Parliamentary Library (1899); the executive wing, called \"The Beehive\" (1977); and Bowen House, in use since 1991. Whilst most of the individual buildings are outstanding for different reasons, the overall setting that has been achieved \"has little aesthetic or architectural coherence\".\n\n\n== Parliament House ==\n\nThe main building of the complex is Parliament House, containing the debating chamber, speaker's office, visitors' centre, and committee rooms.\n\n\n=== Predecessor building burned down ===\nAn earlier wooden Parliament House (1870s addition by William Clayton and 1880s by Thomas Turnbull) was destroyed by fire in 1907 along with all other parliament buildings except the library. The library had an iron fire-door that saved its collections. Following the destruction of the building the Parliament occupied the adjacent Government House (the site now occupied by the Beehive) for ten years.\n\n\n=== Replacement building ===\n\nA competition to find a replacement design was announced by Prime Minister Joseph Ward in February 1911 and 33 designs were entered. The winning design, by Government Architect John Campbell, was selected by Colonel Vernon, former Government Architect for New South Wales. As another of Campbell's entries won fourth place, the actual design is a combination of both entries. The design was divided into two stages. The first half, a Neoclassical building, contained both chambers and the second half Bellamy's (the parliamentary cafeteria) and a new Gothic Revival library to replace the existing one.Despite cost concerns, Prime Minister William Massey let construction of the first stage begin in 1914, but without much of the roof ornamentation or the roof domes. The outbreak of World War I created labour and material shortages that made construction difficult. However, members of Parliament (MPs) were so desperate to get out of the run-down old Government House that they moved into the unfinished building in 1918. In 1922, the first stage was completed (the second stage was never built). The building was finally officially opened in 1995 by Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, after its comprehensive strengthening and refurbishment. The intention of the Liberal Government was for the design to be implemented in stages, eventually resulting in a coherent architectural setting. Instead, as Heritage New Zealand remarks, the setting that has been achieved \"has little aesthetic or architectural coherence\", especially through the construction of the Beehive instead of completion of Parliament House.\n\n\n== The Beehive ==\n\nThe land intended for the second stage of Parliament House is occupied by the Executive Wing. This building conceived by British architect Sir Basil Spence in 1964, largely designed by the Ministry of Works, was officially opened by Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand in 1977. The first parliamentary offices moved into the building in 1979. Due to its distinctive shape, it is referred to colloquially as \"The Beehive\".The building is ten stories and 72 metres (236 ft) high. The top floor is occupied by the Cabinet room, with the Prime Minister's offices on the floor immediately below. The office of individual ministers, various function rooms, and Bellamy's restaurant occupy the first three floors.\nIn the late 1990s there was consideration of moving the Beehive behind Parliament House, and finishing Parliament House according to the 1911 original plans. The plan was quickly scuttled due to a lack of public support and concerns about cost.\n\n\n== The Parliamentary Library ==\n\nCompleted in 1899, the Parliamentary Library is the oldest of the buildings. It stands to the north of Parliament House (to its right, looking from the front).\nThe library was designed in Gothic Revival style and was fire resistant, being constructed of masonry. The third story of the design was not built to save money. It had an iron fire-door separating the library from the main entrance section. This saved the library from the fire of 1907 which destroyed the rest of the timber parliament buildings.Along with Parliament House, the library was strengthened and refurbished in the 1990s. This included recreating Gothic elements of the roof including ironwork, turrets, and finials. It still houses Parliament's library. The building is registered with Heritage New Zealand (previously known as the New Zealand Historic Places Trust) as a Category I heritage structure with registration number 217.\n\n\n== Bowen House ==\n\nA 22-storey office building across Bowen Street from the Beehive, Bowen House houses MPs' offices and support staff and has been leased by Parliamentary Services since 1991. It is connected to the rest of the parliamentary complex by a tunnel under Bowen Street.\n\n\n== Old Government Buildings ==\n\nNot part of the current parliamentary complex and on the other side of Lambton Quay, this four-storey building was designed by William Clayton and built in 1876. The Old Government Buildings currently house Victoria University of Wellington's Law School as part of Victoria's Pipitea campus. Several rooms featuring displays of the building's history have been set up for public viewing.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNew Zealand Parliament website\nNew Zealand Parliament History and Buildings",

          "The guide was very good (Jennifer), there is a short video, visited the new parliament briefly, visited the old parliament and the library, which was very ornate with carvings and lead lights. Parliament was in session so viewed proceedings from the public gallery. We had been",

          "Though we didn't go for the guided tour, we enjoyed the place - its clean surroundings and the beautiful architecture. part of the building is shaped like a Beehive. Great place for Photo shoot and one must admire and respect the Seat of Power in any country.",
          "I recommend making an online booking to ensure a trip on the day. Clear instructions are provided before the tour. The guide is very well informed & he set a good pace to get through all the areas to be seen. It is well set up for visitors with storage for bags & tidy bathrooms.",
          "We first attended a question hour when Parliament was in session and that was interesting. Later went on a guided tour and our guide Josephine did a good job explaining and answering questions. Our host also hosted us at the Parliament cafeteria.",
          "Did the one hour guided tour. Recommend to pre-book online, esp. in the holidays. Very informative guide and toured through all the places you see on tv. Beautiful architecture inside. Lots of history on the walls. Would do again as a lot to take in on the whirl-wind tour.",

          "My Husband hadn't been to see the Beehive, New Zealand Parliament so we went there and it was great and extremely interesting, just as I remembered. You get a tour and see where all our MPs make major decisions etc. Very educational, not just for children.",
          "Visited Beehive and Parliament House in Wellington last to last weekend. Enjoyed one hour guided tour. Highly impressed by the Interior, it's amazing. Loved the paintings, murals, sculptures and enjoyed the history behind everything. Must to do thing when you are in Wellington.",

          "Our tour guide was Kim and she was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly. The tour was a quick half an hour one and we crammed a lot in during that time. The building is beautiful and so interesting to actually see it (instead of seeing it on TV). I thoroughly enjoyed it!",
          "There are many parliaments in the world and this one is New Zealand's. It is full of elected members, civil servants and visitors most of the time. I went in through security, including a metal detector, sat on a chair and left through a door.",

          "I really enjoyed this tour. The beehive is like a big office but the old part of the Parliament is really beautiful and has its own art gallery!!! Very different from all the other Parliament I have visited. Another part of its uniqueness is that it seats on very big base",

          "I'd been stood up by my daughter and was at a loose end in Wellington on my own. I started wandering and found myself outside the Beehive. Having never gone into Parliament, I stuck my nose in and joined a tour. The tour guide was an engaging, enthusiastic and informative 50",

          "This was a pretty good activity to do whilst in Wellington - not many free things these days so enjoyed the fact it didn't cost us anything. The guide was entertaining and informative and I was impressed at what parts of the Beehive we had access too.",
          "Nicely laid out green space with New Zealand\u2019s three main government buildings. Generally a quiet area, unless there\u2019s a protest or big news event. Short walk ( 10-15 mins ) from the CBD or Te Papa. About 5 mins from the main bus depot.",

          "Came here on an educational visit. It does indeed look like a beehive from the outside, but if you're able to get a tour inside, definitely do that. As a politics nerd, I enjoyed learning about how the NZ parliamentary system works.",
          "We visited the seat of power in New Zealand to show expose our children to the beatiful architecture of parliament. The adjacent cathedral is equally impressive. We did not take the tour as all was fully booked.",

          "We took the tour which was very interesting. Our tour guide was very very good but unfortunately about to retire. She told us so much about the history of the building. It is a beautiful place and we were allowed into the Chamber which is based on the English Parliament. We",
          "The Parliament Building for New Zealand is interesting in that it wasn't designed by a New Zealander which gave it a controversial start. It does contain offices for the parliamentarians and the Chambers where they gather and has been christened The Beehive after it's external",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed visiting this area. Surprised at how open it was, and that you were able to walk up to the door of the parliament building. The Beehive is an amazing structure. Beautiful lawned areas, surrounding buildings.",

          "As with most tours, much depends on the guide. I've done this tour a few times and had average and excellent guides. Some are less adept at managing a large group (talk while walking and don't wait for the whole group to arrive before beginning). The pace of the tour won't suit",

          "The New Zealand Parliament Buildings is a much see while in Wellington. The \u201cBee Hive\u201d as the rounded building is called is interesting to see but I do prefer the old main parliament building. It is all still worth seeing.",
          "If you don't come across it, it is worth making a special trip to see the unusual \"beehive\" structure.",
          "What an interesting array of buildings.At one end The Beehive and at the other the older church like buildings. In between the renovated newer look to Parliament. A wonderful wide view with statues of the past prime ministers adding to the feeling of great importance. Lovely to",
          "Bonnie Raitt got that right. Sometimes you do something YOU want to do, because (fill in the blanks) ... just because. The intent here was to design and build something that would be a source of national pride and international interest. Well, big score on that last part.",

          "The focus of this tour is on the buildings and systems of Parliament here. If you want more info about present day politics this isn't the tour -- the guide was neutral and discreet. Of real interest was the presentation about how they earthquake proofed the buildings. We",

          "Get on a tour. A tour will make your visit. NZ is a very laid back city and Wellington is a laid back capital city. So of course their parliament would be laid back as well. It's like going to your posh auntie's house for tea. Be on your best behaviour, get your feet off of",
          "Wellington is such a cool little city to walk around. Especially at night when the lights change everything. The Parliament grounds and buildings are always very well kept so always look nice. The way the buildings are lit up at night is something quite special",

          "Good tour and the guide was really informative. The stupid thing is you aren\u2019t allowed to take photos which appears antiquated. I would love a photo in the debating chamber and library. Apart from this, would recommend.",
          "On our way back to the city from the botanical gardens we passed directly by the Parliament buildings, and decided to take a free guided tour. We learned so much about the workings of the lawmaking body, along with a lot of the history of New Zealand. Our guide (Violetta) was",
          "The only photo I have. It is mandatory to check coats, jackets, back packs, purses, cell phones,cameras and anything else you bring in. There are NO photos allowed here. The tours are scheduled and are prompt. There are limited numbers if people allowed on a tour. Different",
          "Firstly we took the one hour Introductory tour and the guide was just right - relaxed, knowledgeable and led us through at the right pace. The following day we thoroughly appreciated the opportunity to take the (monthly) Art Tour. Our Guide was even more of a joy, and we were",
          "Worth doing if you like politics! Guide was very interesting and was happy and able to answer any questions. If you like to find out about the parliamentary system in NZ, don\u2019t miss this (and it\u2019s free!)",

          "My husband, who is both a political junkie and an engineer, really \"geeked out\" on this tour. The tour goes quite fast. I wished it had been a little slower. I only got a chance to ask one question. I think the highlight for my husband was seeing the system of \"shock absorbers\"",
          "This was my first visit to Parliament buildings and the grounds. Was very impressed and proud to be a Kiwi.",
          "A must for any visitor. Most interesting and totally free. The guide was excellent and gave access to the whole building including the debating chamber.",

          "We went round the parliament building with a Kiwi born in Britai, who was most entertains. The chambers, largely modelled on the UK, were very interesting. I thoroughly recommend this hour long free tour.",
          "Look good from outside and even better inside. There is a lot of green space around the building that you can just be rolling around on the grass. Haven't seen much security staff around that quite surprising.",
          "We were not allowed in to have a look-see since we had not signed up for an hour-long tour. In any case, the newer building, while impressive in a way, also seemed to be a rather odd bit of architecture. Others might love it though.",
          "This is a gorgeous building and was surprised how close we could get to it. Did have time to go inside but was told it is as beautiful inside as out",
          "Terrific to see how it all works. Different in some aspects to our parliament in Australia but definite similarities as well. Our guide was full of good information and very enthusiastic with the children on our tour. Well worth a visit and it's free.",
          "The tour of the Beehive ( government), Parliament and the old Library was illuminating and interesting. Book ahead via the website, which instructs you to send an email; A bit archaic, but you do get confirmation quickly. Tours are popular, so booking is best. Collect tickets",

          "Highly identifiable building this Parliament House is well worth a visit & a look. Commonly known as \u201cthe Beehive!\u201d & is easily seen from the road or in more detail up close. Recommend to see it as NZ\u2019s House of Parliament.",

          "I am particularly interested governments and the way they function so this was a rather interesting visit to me. Was very keen on sitting in for their debate but due to time constraints, I was not able to. One thing to note is that you'll probably need to bring your own water.",
          "You can go on tours at set times for free and when Parliament is in session you can sit up in the public gallery and see all the MPs debate and act like school children. Recommended for a couple of hours",
          "As people who arent really into politics etc we thoroughly enjoyed taking the free tour through Parliament house and buildings. Particularly the tour of the basement where all the earthquake work has been done. Amazing Well worth the hour or so",

          "We did the hour long \"full\" tour although access to the Beehive was restricted due to a staff party (Christmas). However, the whole event was very enjoyable, from the introductory film through the guided tour of the older buildings and even the earthquake-proof foundations.",
          "When driving towards downtown Wellington and someone mentions the beehive parliament buiding, you may wonder what they are talking about and if you might be able to notice this. You will notice the building for sure as itis very uniquely built. I read that it was built over",

          "I've giving this 3 stars only because I'm reluctant to give 2 for a tour which could have - should have - been much more worthwhile. I'm hopeful the problem was with the specific tour guide I happened to be assigned to. Questions clearly were an annoyance to her and I'm afraid",
          "One hour tour showpiecing the different architecture of the older and modern parliamentary buildings. Stood on the floor of the Chamber, but not allowed to sit in the members\u2019 seats! Finished in the basement to see the earthquake-proofing. Fascinating to learn about NZ\u2019s",
          "Guided tours of the government are free of charge. You get you badge at the reception (signs available) and as it is forbidden to enter with your belongings, there is a secured cloakroom where you have to put everything. Diana was our guide and we learned a lot about the system",

          "We visited the Parliament Buildings as part of a walking tour. The bee hive is probably the most outrageous government building we have seen but is in fact only one of 3 or 4 structures that make up the government of New Zealand. We learned that there is in fact a tunnel linking",
          "is all we did, but it was worth it. Security vetting was pretty tight as would be expect3ed. The highlights tour was very informative, both about the building, the government and the electoral process, and how these have changed in New Zealand over the years",
          "Free tours are available every hour. The tour lasts an hour but allow time prior to commencement to check in your belongings, cameras etc. You don\u2019t need to be au fait with the politics of New Zealand to enjoy the tour. The guides are informative and you never have time to",
          "We did the 1 hour tour of the parliament which was well worth it. Our guide Euan was excellent, knowledgeable about the buildings and history with a sense of humour that we really appreciated.",
          "It looks pretty good and it is a special building, looking a bit tired though - however if you've never seen it up close then come and have a look .... its a good photo op :)",
          "So different to our baying 650 MP's. There was a little barracking but nothing really. The guided tour was fascinating",
          "Took the tour of Parliament today and was impressed by architectural features especially the round building know as the beehive. The tour guide was knowledgeable and gave an interesting presentation. Would highly recommend visiting this complex.",
          "We did this spontaneously while walking past the building, and were glad we did. Tour guide was articulate with a good sense of humor and took us thru several chambers while comparing and contracting NZ politics to other countries. Thoroughly enjoyable and recommended!",
          "Get a guided tour through the \"Beehive\" Parliament. You will then understand how coalition government is very different from the government in the U.S. Our guide was fabulous--she was very informative and knew the answer to every question, and knew our system of government so",
          "The tour is really good, informative, interesting and provides good information on the political structure in New Zealand. Access was wide and explained well. Very interesting.",
          "This is a free tour of about an hour. You have a short video to start which explains about the NZ voting system and then your guide takes you around the different areas of the seat of Government. We visited the historic chambers where Parliament sits, viewing galleries, select",
          "The Beehive and other Parliament buildings are lovely, the grounds are well kept, and if you are around during Christmas New years, you can get some super photos of the Pohutakawa trees in bloom.",
          "The Parliament Tour was approximately one hour and long and along with seeing the interior of the building, it provided detailed insight into the NZ political process. At the end of the tour learned about the earthquake modifications made to the building. Photos not allow in",
          "If you enjoy understanding how our governments work this is a can't miss. Complete with a fine complimentary tour delivered by local citizens who care it is a great introduction to the New Zealand legislative process. Good for all.",
          "Take the tour it's with it takes about 45 mins great tour and the building and grounds are wicked as and in a sunny day wow so it in Wellington you must d o this",
          "Close to the centre , these impressive public buildings are well worth a visit. The hourly free tours give an excellent insight into the workings of NZ parliament",
          "We just timed it right to join a tour and were very glad we did. Everyone was most accommodating and welcoming from the security people at the door to those on the reception desk. There is a cloakroom to leave all your belongings, as mobile phones and cameras are not allowed.",
          "Great buildings, very interesting, made more so by our amazing tour guide Kim, she was very knowledgeable and shared this, keeping the whole tour interesting at the same time, she is a real credit to your workforce.",
          "Nice place to walk around if the weathers good. The building is unusual The other buildings around there are nice to look at also.",
          "We were early for a train so popped across the road to check out the Parliament Buildings. As it was late Saturday afternoon they were not open and the tours were not running but it was really interesting looking round the outside. The grounds are very well kept and the old",
          "I don't think you can visit a nation's capital and not see their Parliament! This tour was exactly what you would expect from a Parliament tour. They explained the New Zealand political system well, show you all the chambers in Parliament, show you the library and committee",
          "I can\u2019t complain because it\u2019s free. The guide seemed new, and spent a lot of time telling us we were running late... we probably wouldn\u2019t have been if she hasn\u2019t brought it up so often. She also repeated herself a lot. We had our 6 year old who loves museums and tours and he was",
          "Took our 11 and 15year old for the hour tour, was really informative and could've stayed another hour. Thought we would see more of the Beehive though so was a little disappointed. The old parliament buildings have been restored beautifully and so nice to see. Kids came away",
          "Better things to see in Wellington really....beehive seems to need a bit of a facelift or at least a wash!!!",
          "A great way to learn about New Zealand and their government. Strongly suggest taking a guided tour as there is quite a bit to learn and see. Tour guides very impressive and able to objectively discuss their government and how it works. Stunningly well built and maintained",
          "Well worth a look at the Beehive and surrounding government buildings. An interesting tour giving good historic and current info. The surrounding grounds are quiet and lovely for a stroll. Benches in the shade made this a quiet spot to watch the world go by.",
          "Tours take about an hour. Very informative and interaction is encouraged. Great to go inside the Chamber and see where everyone sits during debates and question time. Tour guide was very enthusiastic. Not suitable for young children but older ones were interested",
          "Beautiful buildings, well kept lawns and landscaping. On Saturday not a lot of people. Well worth seeing",
          "Went for a walk around the city and stopped to have a breather in the parklands surrounding the Parliment buildings which was a beautiful place to relax. It is easy to get to this location at any time of the day and well worth a look around.",
          "Being from the uk we are used to democracy government etc but this tour was fascinating. Citizens from less democratic areas may we\u2019ll be amazed at how government works in New Zealand. Ordinary citizens can sit in on select committees and attend sessions of parliament.",
          "Visiting Parliament Buildings can always be interesting and the Wellington Parliament is no exception. Definitely worth an hour to stroll around when visiting Wellington. You can incorporate The Supreme Court across the road",
          "I think for a free offering, you should make time to tour parliament. A brief history movie to start, then a quick guided tour through the various rooms and their functions in government. It\u2019s free.. it\u2019s informative. It\u2019s fun.",
          "Free guided tours are available, after you go through security. You can also go to the visitor's gallery when Parliament is in session.",
          "Got some great photos. A mix of modern and historic buildings. The gardens are beautiful. Seats are available in surrounds",
          "A really nice setting. The beehive looks very interesting and there is a short around the inside of parliament. The old buildings are old and well kept and the wooden library part is very traditional. It is impressive the way Wellington has managed to preserve it's older",
          "Interesting tour of NZ's parliament free of charge, with very knowledgable guide. Get to go into the cool places you see on tv! Highly recommended.",
          "I think it is not inappropriate to say that the old parliament building complex is best piece of architecture in New Zealand. The Parliament House, Library and the more controversial Beehive form the best man-made landscape in Wellington. Having a picnic in the front lawn is",
          "Interesting building, go on the tour. Its where our government sits... Thank gaaaawwwwd national are out and we have a left wing government again.... Get in there and check it",
          "This was a stop on our city tour and there are three interesting buildings in a row and this is one of the three. Its grounds are also peaceful and well maintained.",
          "Great access & view of the 3 parliamentary buildings. It was public holiday when we were there so the visitor centre was closed but it was still worth a look and walk around.",
          "The place looks better than the pictures that I've seen. Also much much bigger and really quite an historic place.",
          "The bee-hive building is perhaps the standout of modern 60s style architecture yet there are many buildings of interest in the same vicinity. For that alone it\u2019s worth s quit visit. We arrived without planning and spoke to a security guard on break. He gave a personal run down",
          "This interesting modern structure sits befittingly adjacent to the old Parliament buildings. Definitely work a look and can include old St Paul\u2019s church and Wellington cathedral nearby. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",
          "Well worth booking in for a free tour on the parliament website. It takes you right through the main government building where the house of representatives debates. Really interesting!",
          "Well worth taking the tour. Very knowledgeable tour guide. Ask if you can see the earthquake proofing",
          "We walked from Mt Victoria down through the botanical gardens, cemetery to Parliament which was quite a steep but easy walk. There was no one around and we got to sit on a bench seat within the grounds to sit and ponder what was what. A tour group arrived with a guide and that",
          "We had a 1hr tour and it was great. As it was a Sunday we could go to all the locations and the tour guide was very knowledgeable. The highlight was being able to visit the debating chamber. This is a must do for visitors to Wellington, even for New Zealanders.",
          "We had a lovely tour with an enthusiastic guide. We got to observe the parliament in session. As Americans, we found this most interesting and exciting. The buildings are gorgeous, and the work to stabilize them in the event of earthquake is amazing. Each staff member we",
          "This building that I visited some 20 years ago, was built earthquake-safe. Pretty close to train station and downtown.",
          "Interesting stroll thru the grounds. Several diff end architectures on the parliament buildings. Relaxing,not far from the city centre.",
          "A most see if your in nzs capital! We enjoyed a wander around the buildings.. was quiet quiet as it was weekend",
          "A lovely exploration and explanation of the parliamentary system in New Zealand. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and made the tour interactive and appealing to all ages from children to teens to adults",
          "We were in a Wellington for long weekend and decided to take a tour of the beehive. This was well worth the visit. Very interesting and the tour took you to seen lots of interesting place, would recommend this as a must do when visiting Wellington.",
          "History of nz parliamentary system shown. Lovely building and worth a visit if you have a couple of hours",
          "If you want to visit Parliament, I recommend taking the free tour. You are able to learn a lot about the history of the buildings, workings of government and history of the country. They even explain how the buildings are equipped for earthquakes.",
          "Architecture is worth the time and like everywhere in NZ the landscape is beautiful. Worth the effort.",
          "Okay place, but not much there, and buckets of areas cant get into. I would make a short trip if a Kiwi and keep it for simple photo if from overseas. Just to tick the box.",
          "We took the free tour of the Beehive executive building, Parliament House and the Parliamentary Library and enjoyed it very much. There are many interesting and lovely spots (no photos allowed though) and the earthquake protection display at the tour end is fascinating.",
          "Nice for a few pictures but we honestly didn't spend more than 20 minutes there. I wouldn't take a detour to visit this place unless for special interests.",
          "My wife and I took the tour with Jennifer. A very good presenter and guide who certainly knew her craft. Very engaging and happy to take all questions and no difficulty in answering any of them! A rare treat to see the workings of the main buildings and at no cost aside from an",
          "An easy walk quite central in Wellington. Had a free guided tour of the beehive and the old Parliament Building and the library. The tour was about an hour long and very interesting. Then went upstairs to the gallery as Parliament was sitting. That too was very interesting. If",
          "Free and has a small security check when you enter. You then sit down and wait to be picked up by your guide at the time you booked for. Tour starts with an introductory video, then you are off around the various buildings. This is quite interesting and a lot is explained to",
          "Great to see the building and if you have time to go on the guided tour. Strict security to get into the building as you would expect but well worth a visit",
          "Always enjoy taking friends to see the NZ parliament ... not many countries in the world allow you to enter the chamber, or watch the live proceedings in person. Always interesting to know you have walked where the Queen has walked, and to see the artifacts and architecture.",
          "As it was our 1st time in Wellington we visited Parliament as it was one of those 'when in Rome' type things to do and were quite pleasantly surprised how informative and interesting the visit went. We took the tour - which I would recommend to visitors - as their tour guides",
          "It's nice to have pictures taken outside the Parliament buildings, but it's nicer to have the guided tour inside. The tours have scheduled timings and can be booked online earlier. You can also walk in, they will accommodate you. Photos are not allowed, but it'll make you focus",
          "Very nice looking at the old & New buildings. Had a chance to go inside didn't do a tour but watch a video regarding how the parliament works.",
          "A few of us did a very quick tour and it was worth it. When time is limited it is better to at least have a taste and a better understanding of parliment and how it all fits together. This was a free tour and great",
          "Came to the Beehive and took a shot jumping in front of it. Saw a reporter I went to school with and had a nice chat. enjoyed.",
          "We strolled around the parliament buildings. Obviously the government welcomes ordinary people because they have made visiting its main buildings so easy - and made visitors feel very welcome. The architecture varies from classic colonial to modern off-style to the creative,",
          "Unluckily we picked the wrong day to visit and the debating chamber was closed to the public but we were still able to see limited areas. The tour was well worth the time and the guide had a good sense of humor and knowledge. I would definitely visit again when everything was",
          "We took a stroll to see the parliament buildings on the morning before we headed home as 8 year old we were with was particularly interested in seeing the beehive. She wasn't disappointed! Worth a look.",
          "We pre-booked the free tour for our party of six by simply calling the day prior. During school holidays booking makes sense, I think otherwise you can simply show up. Tours depart on the hour. The tour was very informative and pitched at the perfect level. My form of",
          "I've always wanted to see the Beehive and this time we were very lucky! The tour started at 10am and we were there at 0945 so that we didn't have to wait for long. Our tour guide spoke well and quite funny too. She knew the history of the buildings, how the parliament works,",
          "Well worth a visit, if short of time pre-book the tour as they fill quickly, beautiful interiors and fascinating facts of our democracy at work.",
          "This 1 hour tour was very interesting and our tour guide was clearly thrilled by working here and imparted lots of extra fun comments . Would do it again!",
          "While visiting New Zealand I toured the grounds of the Parliament. Although there is some ongoing construction for a new Defence building nearby, the Parliament grounds are well kept. I enjoyed photographing the Beehive which is the equivalent of the House of Representative or",
          "Love the look of these beautiful old buildings at night. A fun little stop for a photo op and you can walk in the grounds - the gate is left open at night they just have some security walking the grounds.",
          "We walked in as it was raining heavily outside only expecting to be able to have a little look. we saw they had a free tour and took the tour. very interesting to hear about the history and the structure.",
          "Arrived late in the day but managed to get the 1600 tour highlights , Rebecca was extreamlly knowledgable & able to answer all our queries, we went into the parlementary chamber @ sat in a select room.",
          "Our 9 year old daughter is really into Politics and since it's Election Year she begged us to visit the Beehive and it did not disappoint if you are not from Wellington then trust your navigation. The tour is worth it, you get to ask your questions and ts just a great place to",
          "A nice place to sit and have lunch with friends, and food shops are nearby. Wide open spaces and maybe you will see members of parliament.",
          "We took the 1 hour tour which we thought would drag on, but it went so fast as it was so interesting and our tour guide Ngaruru was fantastic. She certainly knows her stuff, we were very impressed with her.",
          "I have toured the Parliament buildings a couple of times. It is fascinating to see how they have approached isolating the whole building from teh foundations so that in an earthquake it can move, And some of the large meetings rooms are beautiful. Well worth a visit.",
          "If you are interested in how democracy works then this is a good place to visit, if not then it's just another building...... The old building is stepped in history and beautiful inside and out. It can be quite good to sit and watch the debating chamber in action if there's an",
          "These are great to have a look around if in Wellington. The tour is awesome, they explain everything about the N.Z. Parliament.",
          "Our family enjoyed the visit. The highlight was the debating chamber, and the select committee room- the places where all the action happens. The old upper chamber was also interesting to see. Some of the other bits were a little average, so the total one hour was absolutely",
          "It's quite rare to get a free tour parliament tour, so you should definitely pay this place a visit if you have some spare time in the afternoon. I have done the tour 4 times, and all the history associated with them is interesting. The tour requires an hour so it's good",
          "My brother works here so we got a quick tour and even got to go into the debating chamber. Not my thing, pretty boring but good to see.",
          "I strolled down the hill from the Botanical gardens and thought I would just walk past and have a look and take a photo. The beehive building intrigued me and I was keen to see it first hand. On arrival a very cheerful guide informed me that a free tour was starting shortly so",
          "A perfectly maintained time capsule ... lived the technology that makes the building earthquake proof ... a must see for any tourists. User friendly staff very informative about parliamentary proceedings - enjoyable",
          "There were 2 possible free guided tours; half an hour and an hour. These tours run regularly and no booking is required. The guide was excellent and spoke clearly and informatively and the visit gave an excellent overview of the political system in New Zealand as well as the",
          "well worth the trip to the city just to see this. the lady doing the tour was very knowledgable. a lift available for those that cant manage stairs",
          "The hour long guided tour is free. There's a brief video followed by four main stops. The building foundation is on display for its earthquake safety features. Stops at the library, committee hearing room, and the assembly hall are brief but informative. We also walked into the",
          "You must join the tour. Guides are so professional and nice to people. It's free and this is quite a rare opportunity for you to get into the Parliament!!!Tour starts every hour. So it's easy to join.",
          "It was very interesting to see the beehive and Parliament Buildings while visiting from the US. Everyone was quite nice and answered our questions. There is a ton of art work in the buildings and our tour guide was able to give us history of the art as well as the building.",
          "New Zealand should be proud of offering an interesting and free guided tour of their Parliament buildings. Definitely recommended.",
          "The tour was great. We only wanted the 30 minute tour but we ended up on the hour one and I am so pleased we did. The guide was very enthusiastic and knowledgable. The only downside is not being able to take pictures!",
          "We really enjoyed the 1hr free tour. The buildings are magnificent and the tour was really infoemative. The guide was able to answer all of our questions and was enthusiastic about it. We did the 10am tour on a Saturday and didn't have a booking which wasn't a problem. I did",
          "Tours of Parliament leave on the hour and are free . It is worth every minute as so much information is given to you in that hour. You get to tour all the parts of the buildings and get real insight into NZ parliamentary systems and indeed NZ history. The building has meaningful",
          "Wellington, being the capital of NZ is steeped in history. There are 4 parliament buildings in the city. They look magnificent in their splendour. On this day it was not possible to go past the gates due to security issues but looking from outside you can imagine the grandeur",
          "This is a very cool place to visit, but unfortunately we did not have a very good guide - very ho hum. It is very interesting to hear how Parliament runs and to see the building. I hope you get a better guide.",
          "I went on an hour long tour which begins with an introductory video on the logistics of the parliamentary system in New Zealand followed by walking around the three buildings to look at different rooms of importance. What sealed my opinion about the buildings was the sheer",
          "Enjoyed this visit. Educational and great to get this quick (only 30mins) 'back of the scenes' tour. Unfortunately the lady taking our tour was quite soft spoken and would have benefitted from either assistance in voice projection or a smaller group. However an honour to get",
          "Take the longer one hour free tour. You get a fascinating insight as to how parliament works and we were able to go into the debating chamber. If I had had time I would have gone to listen to a session which is available to the public between 2 and 3 Monday to Thursday. You also",
          "The buildings are truly beautiful, filled with tonnes of history. I was unable to visit inside any of the buildings of Parliament during my time in Wellington, but the grounds are especially beautiful on a nice sunny day. A walk through the grounds was great.",
          "Really enjoyed the one-hour tour of Parliament. Good introductory video (needs updating with footage of the current Governor General though and one really bad typo) and an excellent, well-informed guide. I loved the fact that information booklets were provided in several",
          "Unique buildings in a garden setting in central Wellington. Great place for photos and easy walk from bus and train.",
          "It's relaxing to walk through Parliament gates into the tranquility of its grounds. Huge old English trees mix with native trees such as Pohutukawas. Old buildings mixed with new surround this part of Wellington. The Beehive is a great backdrop for photos.",
          "I have heard that they have a guided tour inside, but even just going there to take a picture is worth it, the architecture of the beehive is beautiful, and so is the other buildings around it",
          "The parliament buildings are unique compared to most countries and prove to be a worthwhile visit. Although, due to the tour not being free, I just stayed around the outside of the buildings and appreciated the architecture.",
          "We did the free one hour guided tour of the parliament buildings. Our guide was very knowledgable and it was a very interesting tour. I would have liked to stay a bit longer in some rooms but I understand the need for everyone to keep together for security reasons. It's a shame",
          "A great way to spend an hour - a few hard core tourism businesses could pick up a tip or two here. Well organized, paced and structured, good mix of visual and spoken info, varied info given and delivered by an Excellent guide - she was an import to NZ and english her second",
          "Moderately interesting. We took the 1 hour which was a mistake. The 30 minute option would have been more than sufficient.",
          "Just a casual place to hangout. Nice grass area and a nice picture spot for taking pictured of the government houses.",
          "Free tours are provided on an hourly basis. Each lasts about an hour. The tour includes visiting the basement to see the earthquake protection measures, which involved cutting the building away from its foundation. We also visited a Maori decorated committee room, the house and",
          "Learnt a lot. Strange sense of interest standing on the debating chamber. Will probably vote more thoughtfully this year.",
          "Came here with a friend and did the 1 hour tour, our guide was great! What I thought was going to be a boring tour that I felt obliged to do because I was in the city and I'm a kiwi, turned out to be the highlight of our entire day. Fun, factual and fascinating tour taken by a",
          "It's a bit of a security gauntlet to come in (try not to have too many gadgets with you or steelcap boots, takes a bit longer to move through). Well worth it though, particularly if you've got a spare hour or so and the weather isn't playing nice. The guided tour is free and",
          "We attended the public gallery while the politicians were sitting in the debating chambers. Was great entertainment & also very interesting. Worth checking out.",

          "I'd never been inside our houses of parliament, but our 8 year felt it was a requirement when visiting our nation's capital...and I found the tour interesting with lots to see and hear about. The tour is free, and when we went it was completely full. A 50/50 mix between",
          "It is very great place with amazing structure if you are a tourist it is nice to visit at least once.",
          "The main parliament building is nick-named the Beehive. It is shaped like a beehive and looks like one from a distance.",
          "Parliament buildings boring I hear you scream, think again there is more than meets the eye. Yes the politicians hang out here but you won't see them much, the real star is the history of the buildings - the seismic improvements, gifts to the nation (yes some are weird) it is",
          "There is free tour that runs every hour as long as you pass security your fine. You cant take photos or bags on tour. This was an excellent well presented tour.we got to see and learn many new things about the government and parliament. Dont feel its something for kids its",

        "wiki": "The Wellington Botanic Garden in Wellington, New Zealand, covers 25 hectares of land on the side of the hill between Thorndon and Kelburn, near central Wellington.\n\nThe garden features 25 hectares of protected native forest, conifers, plant collections and seasonal displays.  It also features a variety of non-native species, including an extensive Rose Garden.  It is classified as a Garden of National Significance by the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture.\nThe Wellington Cable Car runs between Lambton Quay and the top of the Botanic Garden, and it is the most direct way to get from the top part of the garden to Wellington's Central Business District. The winding hill paths of the Garden are a popular spot for Wellington residents.  It is used for walking, jogging and taking children to the playground, and tourists enjoy meandering through the Garden's many collections via the downhill path to the city.\nThe Gardens feature a large Victorian-style glasshouse, the Begonia House, the Lady Norwood Rose Garden and the Treehouse Visitor Centre.  There is a large children's play area, a duck pond, and glowworms visible some nights along paths in the Main Garden \u2013 there are monthly tours during autumn\u2013spring (the Garden is otherwise closed at night).

It was initially managed by the New Zealand Institute (later named the Royal Society Te Ap\u0101rangi) and its manager James Hector until 1891. The New Zealand Institute planted conifers as part of a programme to import plant species and assess their potential for economic benefit to New Zealand. The first Map of the Garden in 1875 by John Buchanan also included the compilation of a list of all plants growing there, and a survey of native plants indigenous to the Reserve.Some animals were kept at the Botanic Gardens prior to the formation of Wellington Zoo in Newtown in 1906, this included the \"City Emu\" which died shortly after being relocated to the Zoo from the Gardens.The Wellington City Council began managing the garden in 1891, developing various parts of the garden such as:\n\nLady Norwood Rose Garden (1950)\nBegonia House (1960)\nTreehouse Visitor Centre (1990) in conjunction with the World Wildlife Fund\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBotanic Garden Visitor Information\nWellington Gardens website",

          "Good size garden dedicated for the roses. You can find lots of variety at this garden and it is well worth the walk. The fact that they are moving away from chemical fertilisers, fungicide and insecticide to more sustainable gardening methods, should be applauded and they deserve a 5 star rating just for this effort.",

          "So many beautiful types of Rose's. Lovely respite. There is a cafe and toiletries. Nice for a short break from a hectic tour.",
          "I don\u2019t love botanical gardens as a rule but this one was a pleasant surprise. Some of the biggest red roses I\u2019ve ever seen! A peaceful was to spend a few hours and they have a coffee shop as well.",
          "At base of the Botanic garden which situated on mount Victoria is the Rose garden.All roses blooming on our visit in early Dec and if one is a rose enthusiast it\u2019s a must visit . Very colourful with many many different roses. Extremely well tended to by gardeners.",
          "We were here when most of the roses were in full flower. A feast for the eyes with some truly vibrant colours. Very relaxing to sit and just enjoy being around such beauty. The perfume from some of the roses attracted plenty of bumblebees. Very well cared for garden that you can",
          "We were just in time for the start of the rose season. Beautiful beds with many colors and species. Easy to continue from here to town.",
          "While we only stopped here briefly. In addition to the extensive rose beds (just beginning the spring bloom), we saw the Japanese Peace Shrine. Set with a waterfall, a stone lamp on the water contains a flame carried from Hiroshima; it will burn as long as nuclear weapons",
          "The rose garden has a really relaxing feel to it, it is well laid out and maintained. They have a good selection of roses, which each bed labeled and what really struck me was the smell of the roses when I entered the garden which I have not experienced in other rose gardens I",
          "Pretty formal garden with groupings of the same species of roses. Some unusual varieties of roses. They have a good looking cafe/coffee shop. Plenty of benches.",
          "This was a beautiful park that has lovely flowers. My husband grabbed a coffee and friends had scones. The roses weren't up, but other flowers were. It was a nice stp",
          "I come here every week to walk around and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. Great to grab a coffee in the nearby cafe or just take a stroll around. A perfect date spot as well.",
          "we took the tour and walked around the grounds but unfortunately this was not the season for flowers",
          "While it might not have been the peak seaon to visit the rose gardens in winter, we did enjoy discovering the gardens, there were some flowers, it was a very peaceful place to visit. All was not lost as the Lady Norton Rose Gardens sit in front of the Begonia House and Picnic",
          "Great for the summer walks on the weekend or take friends from out of town. Kids love the fountain and there's loads more in the botanic gardens including the begonia house right there with tropical plants and water lilies.",
          "Lovely scents abound in season (about November to March). Well look after. Just by the Begonia House and fabulous Picnic cafe. Cafe very popular and rightly so. Still very good off season but you'll probably spend less time here and more in the Botanic Gardens.",
          "Even on a wet and rainy day, these gardens were beautiful to wander around and to simply appreciate the flowers. A lovely little cafe is on the corner, with hot drinks and food and a small greenhouse filled with tropical plants should not be missed either.",
          "The best time to visit is during the flowering season. However, even when the roses are dormant the beauty of the landscaping is striking. Being sited in the botanical gardens there is always something of interest.",
          "This garden is fantastic to have stroll and enjoy the roses. The design is really beautiful and the roses come in a wide variety of colours. The ducks that hang around the garden add to the lovely atmosphere and the cafe next to the garden is good to have a cup of coffee. Plenty",
          "We stopped here in the middle of a busy day of sightseeing. We felt rejuvenated after walking among the gorgeous roses and the indoor gardens. There is also a spot for lunch and we had a good coffee break.",
          "The roses were all in bloom but some were a little past their peak. Nevertheless it was a beautiful sight and the gardens are very well maintained. One of the workers was skimming the fountain pool and asked if I would like him to turn up the fountain water pressure, which he",
          "Lovely place to visit, even when the roses aren't in season. Beautifully kept gardens, flat and easy to get around, gift shop with some lovely NZ souvenir items (mostly 'nature' themed), begonia house, and one of my absolutely favourite cafes! The food at the cafe is absolutely",
          "We visited in March, the best time for the rose's would have been a month or so ago. Still a lovely place to see.",
          "Reached after the descent (from the Cable Car) through the beautiful botanic gardens, a large variety of roses are planted out in a majectic display. Many hybrid tea and floribunda varieties to delight the connoiseur. Nearby cafe, toilet facilities, gift shop and Japenese peace",
          "This is another wonderful New Zealand botanical garden. The flowers are stunning and profuse. There is an African section, an Australian section, an aviary, a vast rose garden and greenhouses with the largest tuberous begonias that I've ever seen. And of course the tallest",
          "The Lady Norwood complex of Begonia House, formal fountain, pergolas, and those lovely rose beds occupy 12,000 square feet which is a miniscule part of the nearly one square mile of Wellington Botnical Garden. But what a lovely part it is! The garden has more than 100",
          "This is a must for those exploring Wellington\u2019s Botanical Gardens. The rose garden is very beautiful and close to other lovely sights in the Gardens. The resident ducks are also very cute!",
          "We stumbled across this excellent rose garden in our walk down through the Botanical Gardens to the Wellington waterfromt. We were fortunate enough to visit in February when the roses were in full bloom. As an added bonus there is a nice cafe located in a corner of the garden.",
          "Going to this rose garden was part of our city tour of Wellington. Beautiful blooming roses and the facility had a wonderful gift shop. This is where we could find a nice picture book of New Zealand.",
          "After a beautiful walk through the Botanic Garden we came to this top of the line attraction at the bottom of the hill. The rose garden was in beautiful bloom late in January, and the hothouses were filled with color. A feast for the eye! There was no entrance fee. Still,",
          "The garden is at the bottom of the botanical gardens that come down from the top of the city. The rose gardens are well laid out and there is a cafe at one side. However what you must go and see is to one side- the peace flame. It is a small waterfall falling into a small",
          "Well worth visiting, roses of every colour well cared for and marked to easily read names and varieties",
          "As always the Rose Gardens are magnificent. No matter the time of year it's always a pleasure to view.",
          "What a beautiful spot away from the hustle and bustle of Wellington City Centre. What a glorious facility too for anyone working nearby to be able to while away their lunch break in such tranquillity. Unfortunately our visit was in early spring so we did not see the roses at",
          "I suppose it depends on the time of year as to whether this is impressive, but in late January..Not so much.",
          "As part of a walk thru the Botanic gardens well worth a visit but will not make the top ten of world rose gardens",
          "Nothing of great spectacle here, just a basic set up of a rose garden. Not especially large and easy to walk through in a few minutes.",
          "In the heart of Wellington you can find this oasis of calm and it's free. The botanical gardens are an amazing place to sit and reflect on life. Well worth a visit.",
          "What an incredible rose garden within the botanical gardens. It is beautifully laid out and is an absolute picture. The delicate orchids in the arboretum were simply stunning. The Lady Norwood rose garden certainly lives up to its reputation. It is a delight to wander",
          "Probably best viewed in November & December for the finest displays. However the blooms were still good & the sweet fragrance is a delight. Very good cafe on sight. The Rose garden can easily be fitted in a circular tour of about an hour with 3 other attractions. Funicular",
          "Found thru walking down from the funicular thru the botanic gardens. Gardens look nice and are of an age gone past. Cafe is a nice setting, run very militarily, normal food selection. Keep an ear out for the patter from the waiters and how many times you hear them say",
          "The variety of roses and their beauty is not to be missed. The garden was clean, the adjoining cafe was a delight, and the surrounding hillsides reminded me of Butchart Gardens in Victoria. This is nowhere near the expanse of Butchart, but well worth the time. Do not miss the",
          "This is worth a visit, especially if you like flowers in general, and roses in particular. The scent of all the roses is wonderful.",
          "Highly recommended, I can honestly say, that everytime, bar none, I've come away from this place satisfied with the service, food, coffee and atmosphere.",
          "Lots of ladies who lunch go to the cafe in the garden. The garden is nice when it's rose-blooming time. It's a formal garden, a bit severe. Years ago, people would spread loved ones' ashes in the gardens. But I think it's illegal now, though I rather suspect many folk still",
          "This is a nice sheltered and colourful place to visit on pretty much any day. You can usually find a park nearby so it is good for elderly folks, small children or if you just feel a bit lazy. When the roses are in full swing, the colours are superb and the blooms massive,",
          "Catch the cable car up and walk back down, the roses are in full flower at the moment and really beautiful.",
          "The view over the Rose Garden from the walkway coming down is incredible - such a wide variety of roses and the kaleidoscope of colours is amazing. So beautifuly laid out leaving room to wander among the beds and get up close to these beautiful specimens. There is also a cafe",
          "It should be a beautiful rose garden if you are coming in the right season, between November to April each year. However if coming in October, all the roses have not blossomed yet, not the right time. The garden is not really big, just medium size, but when full with roses this",
          "The roses are in full bloom currently as are the Icelandic poppies. Wander past the cricket on the adjacent oval or stop for a cup of tea.",
          "The rose garden is looking particularly good at the present time, and is the current highlight of the Botanic Garden. Good adjacent cafe, although it does get busy.",
          "We got off the cable car at Kelburn and took a leisurely walk through the gardens and all the way down to the Rose Garden. I have never seen so many colors on roses! Beautiful. They all had cute names like hot pants and heart throb.",
          "Nice rose gardens, adjacent to some glass houses with some more colourful plants and a small souvenir shop. The garden cafe is also next to the Rose Garden. A short walk from the top of the cable car.",
          "Well worth a visit if you like to see well laid out gardens with pleantiful information. If you are visiting the botanic gardens or the observatory it is worth going in.",
          "I was here in mid-November, which was likely to late in the growing season to be visiting a rose garden. In full bloom, however, I bet it would be beautiful.",
          "The entire botanical gardens is well worth a look. While the roses were only just starting to show colour, there was lots more in the same gardens to look at.",
          "An appealing menu, very friendly staff, great atmosphere, and you can visit the begonia house when you've had enough to eat.",
          "When we were there not many roses were seen but still we saw some. It is bottom of the botanic garden, some walk from the cable car station.",
          "As it was winter, the actual amount of flowering roses was minimal, but I could easily see how spectacular it would be in the proper flowering season. Nice to just leisurely walk around and enjoy the range of plants. Also very clean and well maintained.",
          "Some Friends from O/seas arrived for a coupla days.. First day.. clear blue sky... Rose Garden, here we come.. Drive up(7 seater) .. and let them loose... return in 90 mins...broke up into 2/3 groups, fotos everything , group fotos, individual selfies, etc, etc. lunch etc at",
          "A great spot for Wellingtonians and visitors right through summer and early autumn. Always well tended.",
          "Huge range or Roses and good range of tropical plants inside shed. Don't miss to visit at least once in summer for rose season. And whole year for inside tropical plants.",
          "Great coffee in the cafe and a wonderful place to look at some amazing flowers. Check out inside for more interesting flower species",
          "My absolute FAVOURITE part of the botanical gardens, the greenhouse is a close second. The cafe is close by and you can see the roses from inside.",
          "Nice place for a visit and morning tea - very pretty flower display - at the bottom of the hill from the Cable car",
          "There are plenty of Roses here with all different colors but it was raining so didn't get many photos. There are a cafe and indoor plants inside as well.",
          "What a lovely rose garden. So many different kinds of roses. A lovely botanical greenhouse with some amazing plants and a cute gift shop as well as a resaurant",
          "We visited Lady Norwood Rose Garden recently on a Celebrity Solstice Cruise Ship excursion. We enjoyed viewing the beautiful selection of roses on display and the photo opportunities afforded. We found the time we spent here on this shore excursion was not long enough and it",
          "A lovely series of rose beds, all the better because you get the beauty without the work. We took the cable car up and walked down the small hill via Lady Norwood's roses. Many of them smelled divine and it was lovely to \"stop and smell the roses\". I was surprised that so many",
          "Have visited many better rose gardens, tucked out of the way and if not driving a bit of a hike to get there. Instructions as to get arounfd the Botanic gardens not good, especially with its steep terrain.",
          "The rose garden is very nicely laid out. The blocks of roses are labeled, and appear to be well taken care of. There is a cafe on site to allow for a bit of refreshment, or lunch.",
          "This is a perfect ending to a ride up the Wellington Cable Car and a walk down through the Botanic Garden. There are greenhouses with begonias, palms, and succulents for winter or rainy day visits, but the roses are blooming primarily in summer. There is an excellent caf\u00e9 with",
          "We visited this garden after our trip on the street car and walking down hill. a formal rose garden and a real treat for anyone who loves roses.",
          "Caught the cable car up and strolled down. I planned on rewarding myself with a wine at the bottom but in reality the wine was totally forgotten. I had the most relaxing walk down the mountain, enjoyed flowers, waterfalls and birdlife. Finally ended up at the cafe enjoying a",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the huge variety of planting and had an excellent lunch at the well run conservatory cafe",
          "At the height of the Rose season this is a lovely place to spend an hour or so admiring the various variety of roses The tropical \"hothouse\" is well worth a visit (no charge) and a cafe adjoins it. Take the Cable Car up. If you have the energy and time stroll down through the",
          "We visited this garden on our way down from Wellington botanical garden. As it was autumn, the flowers were not in full bloom, but beautiful nevertheless. Found at the base of the botanical gardens.",
          "Roses in abundance here in lovely surrounds. There is also a tropical house and cafe with free toilets. The kids will love the very same ducks.",
          "We had a half hour for this site. Could have spent a lot more time. The greenhouse has begonias and orchids and lotus. BEAUTIFUL.",
          "We walked down to the Rose garden from the cable car, a nice downward stroll. Rose garden is spectacular, roses labelled. We were able to eat our lunch at the begonia house next to the roses.",
          "We visited after walking through the main botanic gardens - all of the roses are currently in bloom and there were lots of varieties to see and smell. We didn't spend a huge amount of time here, but definitely worth passing through.",
          "Otherwise you will be sorely disappointed at all the pruned and roseless rose bushes! They have ducks that wander about here, too, and a small greenhouse you can walk through.",
          "A part of the Wellington Botanic Gardens, this small garden is not to be missed. There are not just roses here but there are numerous other varieties. The greenhouse contains many varieties of exotic plants and flowers. There is also a nice caf\u00e9 next to the garden.",
          "Beautiful range and display of roses with an easy walk to view and smell them. This is a natural and enjoyable place to visit.",
          "We enjoy wandering around the rose gardens no matter what season. It is always peaceful. There is a small fountain/duck pond in the middle of the roses with seating around. Small children love to watch and play. The roses are spectacular when in flower. There is a good cafe here",
          "In the middle of a lovely stroll through Wellington's gardens the roses are phenomenal. We were about 7 to 10 days from seeing the full rose garden at its best but it was still outstanding. Lot's of different varieties, colors and something for everyone. GO!",
          "I am so jealous of the New Zealanders to have this beautiful garden to reflect. \"Smell the Roses\" Definately put this on your 'must see' list.",
          "if you are visiting the Wellington Botanical Gardens, don't miss out on the Rose Garden. Absolutely beautiful with so many varieties of roses.. my favourite one was called Rock'n Roll :)",
          "This is a must visit place if you enjoy Botanical Gardens. There is a cafe and hot house located nearby which are both worth a visit. Make this your destination after riding the cable car to the top of Kelburn and meandre downhill towards the Rose Gardens.",
          "We visited the gardens during a tour of the botanical gardens and were amazed at the displays. Unfortunately for us the displays were not their best as having passed their peak flowering but even so it was lovely.",
          "We spent quite a while here beautiful roses many varities well set out ducks roaming around there is a hot house as well and a gift shop",
          "Lots of lovely roses to smell and admire. Definitely take some time out to visit here. Has a cafe as well.",
          "I live in walking distance so I can visit whenever the mood takes me, the seasons change or when a special greenhouse plant is flowering. Beautiful roses outside and the greenhouse is full of wonders. Highly recommended - a slow way to enjoy Nature. The fun way to do it is",
          "Great variety of roses; amazing colour; old and new - plus those that might replace those not doing so well; delightful to walk around; great for photos!",
          "The lovely rose garden is a great surprise in the new year. So many blooming flowers presented in a clear and delicate way. Very worth visiting.",
          "These gardens have been a central part of the Wellington Botanical Gardens for probably more than a century. They are in a lovely sheltered valley and have a huge variety of roses. There is a good cafe in these gardens also a gift shop and Glass House full of all sorts of",
          "What a beautiful well presented garden very well maintained they have a cafe there as well but we didn't stop, just walked around the beautiful garden. We walk through the botanical garden and at the bottom of botanical garden down the road a bit further you see lady norwoods",
          "visited this garden a couple of times during the entire year, and even outside the \"rose season\" (ie winter) this is a garden worth visiting, combine it with the botanical garden then, that is located next to it.",
          "But then, what is? Nice tea garden to visit at the right time of year if the roses are in bloom. Does not quite live up to the rest of the Botanical Gardens standards.",
          "We went to the rose gardens yesterday. It was a lovely sunny day and the rise were in full bloom . The fountain water was dirty it could do with a clean out . I heard a little bit say to his mother , oh the water is very dirty for the little ducks who were sitting beside the",
          "I love roses and these would be some of the nicest ive seem!!! So many beautiful roses all in full bloom. Amazing",
          "Having ridden up the hill in the cable car, we walked down, through the botanic gardens, then along to this rose garden, and then down the hill all the way into the city. All very pleasant. Glasshouse is full of luscious begonias, bromeliads and ferns. Lunch at the Picnic",
          "We enjoyed wandering around the roses and had lunch in the cafeteria, which was very good. Not as extensive and as easily accessible as Auckland's Parnell Rose Gardens, but quite lovely.",
          "It was pleasant just sitting in the sun whilst my wife took scores of photos here and in the Boronia House. Take the Cable Car to its top and then walk downhill for 20 minutes. Lovely spot.",
          "This garden was created by Lady Norwood in 1953 and there are over 300 varieties of roses blooming. A very pretty garden and we think would be wonderful when in bloom. Just stroll through and ENJOY!",
          "These gardens are at the base of the botanic gardens. They're not massive but are beautifully laid out. All beds are labelled with the name of that particular rose plus details of the grower. We were there just before they were at their best but the bushes were very healthy",
          "A very nice place and when I was there way less touristic compared to other places. Maybe it is a 30 minutes walk away from the cable car? But worth to go there, and don't forget to drink your flatwhite there!",
          "The location is ideal and the rose beds are superbly laid out. As it is still October the roses are not yet in bloom but it is clear that they are very healthy.",
          "Nice place to visit in the Botanic Gardens. it's not such a big rose garden, but it's pretty to visit if you're close.",
          "Beautifully laid out, this rose garden is probably stunning in season. Right now there were just a few rogue roses in bloom, but we still enjoyed following the longish path to end up here.",
          "If you are a rose garden fan - and I am - then the Lady Norwood Garden is a superb example of the genre. The roses are well chosen and the beds maintained with skill and attention. This is obviously well-loved by staff and visitors. Don't miss it.",
          "We recently visited and there is nothing to see if it's not rose season. You can see that the garden has potential and I am sure if beautiful if it's the right time of the year. If it's not the right time of year, skip it.",
          "The dinning room is really too noisy but the service and food makes up for it. The food was well cooked and tasty. The service was helpful and friendly. Perhaps a little over priced for what we got but it's a bit of a touristy place and was a lovely way to end our tour of the",
          "Though the Botanic Garden in which it is located, is much older, the 1950's rose garden looks settled and lovely. We liked roaming around different rows of rose bushes and seeing the interesting names given them. I spotted one or two that I have in my own garden in California",
          "Well laid out gardens although at this time of year, winter, nothing in bloom. However a free visit to the Glass Houses are worth a visit. There is also a Coffee shop on site",
          "We walked through this on the way down from the hill. Take the cable car up and walked back down. Lovely walk of about 1 hour. Well worth seeing the flowers here.",
          "Stopped here as part of a tour, a fountain in the middle and paths going from there to the rose gardens. It was nice that the names were displayed on some of the roses. There is also a large glass house with indoor plants, a caf\u00e9 and toilets. Nice and quiet and a good way to",
          "This beautiful garden is lovely to visit and walk around in. The rose collection is fantastic. The greenhouse houses a fantastic collection of orchids. There is a nice cafe in the rose garden for tea. Lots of sculptures around the grounds and scenic views of the harbor.",
          "Although visiting on a rainy day in winter, it was still a beautifully calm & serene place to visit. There were still roses in bloom and the laid out pathway to the fountain in the middle seems typical of an English country house.",
          "Even in winter, the rose garden was a nice place to visit. We loved the layout. I can only imagine the beauty when the roses are in full bloom.",
          "The rose garden is a lovely spot to enjoy some sunshine on a cool Welly day. Obviously in winter the roses are few and far between but during the warmer months the roses and fragrance in the air is amazing!",
          "Any time of the year, this display of roses is well worth a visit, for beauty, contemplation, reflection, and a must for Wedding Photo shoots in Wellington. Peaceful and serene, surrounded by many other Botanical Gardens features, also worth exploring.",
          "There is always something to see, otherwise just go in the glasshouse where the tropical plants are.",
          "We went here when the roses were in full bloom and the scent and view was beautiful. It is a lovely walk to the gardens which is also overlooked by a cafe where you can sit and have a drink admiring the flowers.",
          "Not the best time of year to go, but I was in Wellington, and it wouldn't be the same without a walk up to the rose garden and a coffee at the cafe there. You have to feed the sparrows a wee crumb. If you are patient, they will pick it out of your fingers, on the wing.",
          "Have visited these gardens over many years. Always enjoy our walk around them. Always something to see throughout the year. Love their herb garden. Roses are the highlight.",
          "If you love roses this is the place to be. Me and my friends visited and was astonished how many different kinds there are. Some have no smell and some have a lovely rich smell. The cafe is really good, the fresh scones are tasty. You can either walk up from the city or get the",
          "came across this little place by accident as went for a walk , nice area and interesting history worth a visit if you have time spare",
          "No matter what time of the year you visit, there is always something lovely to see at the Lady Norwood Rose Garden. The garden is set around a geometric pattern and a fountain, where ducks often play. The roses are in their best splendour around November, but whenever I have",
          "This rose garden has over 300 varieties of rose! Some of them smell absolutely beautiful so its a good idea to get amongst them and see which ones smell the best. Its a minute away from the entrance to the botanical gardens, plus features a lovely warm greenhouse with more",
          "This is a well tended rose garden with many different types of the flower including one of my favourites: Honky Tonk Blue. Spend a few minutes strolling around to help you relax!",
          "We were there in early March and it was still beautiful. The garden is laid out like the spokes of a wheel. There is also a good greenhouse. We highly recommend Wellington Botanical Garden, but if you don't have time for that at least visit the rose garden. You won't be",
          "You can combine this with a ride up on the cable car, a walk downhill through the botanical gardens and then the rose garden before arriving back in the city centre. Well worth the effort!",
          "The garden was in full flower when we visited and the roses were completely wonderful. I've visited rose gardens from all over the world and this is one of the best. Staff were very helpful, getting us water, even when they had just closed for the day.",
          "I love this place whether the roses are in bloom or not. A chance to take time to \"smell the roses\". The garden is maintained very well and when the roses are in bloom, it's just magical.",
          "The rose were a little past their best when I visited but were still beautiful and one can visualise what the whole area would like at their best. Found downhill from the Wellington Botanical gardens, the Rose Garden has an excellent caf\u00e9, full of locals when I visited - which",
          "We were just looking for a place to sit for a while and enjoy a quiet evening. Although the weather hasn't been ideal, the roses are still in good order. A lovely area to just wander through and check out the fountain in the centre. If coming here during peak times, you are",
          "This is at the base of a hill. 9You vcan get he cable car to the top and walk down through the gardens to this res garden if you wish.) It is well laid out and, if rises are in bloom, would be quite lovely. (We were there towards the end of the flowering season and it was still",
          "We took the cable car to the top and then walked down to the rose garden and then back up to the cable car. Whole trip was about an hour. Got some lovely photos.",
          "Had lunch with a good friend here in November 2016. Lovely food and great service in the caf\u00e9. The garden is a lovely display of roses. A very pleasant and peaceful place, especially lovely on a summer day.",
          "I love the rose garden. There are so many varites in the beds, so many colours, and such a lovely scent. It is a lovely place to just sit and look and think. My son and daughter in law had their wedding reception there. There is a restaurant on site.",
          "We always take time to visit the rose garden when in Wellington. In summer and autumn there always seems to be plenty of blooms, a huge range of colours and roses which have the most beautiful perfume.",

          "Holidaying in Wellington recently we visited the rose garden in the botanical gardens. Well set out, we found them very beautifull and obviously she was a lady who loved her gardening and roses. Nice that it has been named after her and also in the same area the Begonia House",

          "I would highly recommend a trip to the Botanical Gardens if you're in Wellington on a sunny day. The roses weren't quite ready to be in full bloom, but they were lovely.",
          "The roses were not out when we visited, the cafe and greenhouses were interesting though. The begonias and air plants were good. The lilies again,were not out much at this tome. But it does lead to the Botanical garden.",
          "I came upon this whilst wondering around the Botanical Gardens. Unfortunately the Roses weren't in bloom nor was the fountain working so I probably saw this on a bad day hence the 3 star review. I am sure it would be different in the height of the season. Begonia House is",
          "absolutely stunning, cafe adjacent, toilets, outside seating - do not miss this on your trip to Wellington.....",
          "Visited Sunday 11th September. I should have given it more thought that the roses only bloom at certain times of the year. Very disappointed that I didn't get to see them on this visit. I would imagine that they would be fantastic when in full bloom judging by the garden layout",
          "This is a wedding photo place as its truly beautiful and smells divine when all the roses are in bloom. Grab a nice coffee or lunch at the restaurant there and make a B- line for the begonia house with its indoor Lilly pond and exotic plants.",

          "The plan for this complex of gardens is the work of the Director, Edward Hutt. It was certainly the largest addition to the Botanic Garden established during his directorship (1947-1965). It was accomplished with the financial help of Lady Norwood who donated constantly for",

          "Don't miss the orchids. Nice caf\u00e9. Located just below the Botanical gardens. Take the Cable Car up to the top of the Botanical gardens and walk back through the botanical gardens past the rose garden and through the historic cemetery.",
          "This is a huge circular garden just outside the begonia house. There are many different types of roses, beautifully planted, with incredible fragrances! We first saw it from the trail above which showed us just how neatly the garden was laid out.",
          "While walking down the paths from the cable car you come across this lovely garden of some of the most colorful flowers I've ever seen. It is a nice attraction and somehow quite calming as it was quiet on the day I was there. Make sure that you have your camera!! Lot's of",
          "Beautiful when the roses are in flower. Still going in May. Nice warm and usually sheltered micro climate. Sit in the Picnic cafe for morning coffee or lunch.",
          "High above Wellington is the garden built originally by a husband for his wife. During World War 2, US serviceman were camped nearby. This place has a history. Impressive, multicoloured roses extend across lawns. It is located in a sheltered bowl, so is hot in the afternoon.",
          "Beautiful setting for a rose garden, we went in April so getting to the end of the season, would like to go in summer when in full bloom",
          "This was my favourite part of the Botanical Gardens. There is a great variety of roses on display. I would love to see it when all the roses are in full bloom.",
          "On ones walk down from the train stop and see and smell the lovely collection of roses around a central pond.",
          "I think keen gardeners would enjoy a visit here - I'm not an expert on roses by any stretch, but I enjoyed visiting the rose garden. it's a nice place to spend a sunny afternoon, and seeing all the different varieties of roses was interesting.",
          "Lady Norwood Rose Garden is part of the botanic gardens and is located at the bottom of the botanic gardens, alongside an enclosed garden area and cafe and shop. The gardens are beautiful and some of the roses give off a beautiful perfume. Make sure thought to check inside the",
          "Being as we in the garden in March the roses were close to their past due date. The flowers were the same as the USA in September or October. A park side restaurant is on site.",
          "I believe this is part of the Royal Botanic Gardens, but is more accessible because one doesn't have to climb for it. A nice but somewhat limited and pricey cafe allows one to sit and enjoy the roses for a relaxing interval.",
          "A beautiful circular rose garden located in a sheltered part of the Wellington Botanic Gardens. With a collection of international and NZ varieties, the roses are well labelled and many possess enticing fragrance. On that sunny afternoon, several ducks were napping under the",
          "Lots of roses outside; Gardenias, inside. Great color, great presentation. Has the de rigeuer gift shop (very small, but there for those whose trip is not complete without a stop at the gift shop) and a caf\u00e9.",
          "The Wellington Botanical Gardens are a place to revisit many times a year. So many varieties of plants and flowers. A beautiful cafe serving excellent coffee. Colouring pens and paper supplied - really enjoyed this added touch. Great service.",

          "Depending on the time of year, these can be a delight to walk around and smell the roses. Gets busy certain times of year.",
          "I visited rose garden as part of Botanical Gardens. Large display of roses beautifully laid out. I was there in mid March, still blooming but I think past prime time.",
          "After the Botanic Garden this is a more relaxed area to walk around. The variety of roses is immense. Very busy on our visit as tour buses from cruise ships were stopping.",
          "At the moment the roses are coming to the end but they still looked great. This is one of those things you have to come at the right time of year so anywhere between Nov and April is probably right. There is the Hothouses there too and the Botanic Gardens so always worth a",
          "beautiful roses, some colours i saw for the first time. there are also a glasshouse with enormous colourful begonias nearby, and a nice cafe.",
          "If you are the admirer of natural beauty, this would be your good stop in Wellington. Near the Botanic Garden. Here you can find varieties of roses, ranging from the classic rose to recently released varieties. Purple, pink, orange, white, red or combination of those colors.",
          "This is part of the Botanic Garden. From the Sculpture Trail we saw some very interesting trees. But when we really look at them, they are made of wire. Further down is the Rose Garden. There are many beds; each bed contains a different variety of rose, with many colours that",
          "Lovely and well tended rose gardens. Stop and have a coffe at the cafe and enjoy the scene. Also be sure to visit the begonia gardens (inside) as they are particularly good as well.",
          "At the stat/top of botanical gardens with a tea point close buy. Lots of variety's and well laid out but most of them didn't look in a great condition. It appeared to dry and well drained, not the best place for a rose. Not a patch on the one in Christchurch.",
          "February is probably not the best time but still a great place to pass a couple of hours. Cable car up walk down comes out on Lambton Cay behind the Beehive Parliament building.",
          "You'll find this garden at roughly the halfway mark of the walk from the top of the cable car back to the city through the Botanic Gardens. It's a great excuse to stop and literally smell the roses - very well laid out, plenty of variety, and even for those like me who aren't",
          "I'm surprised that there's a separate review for this because it's part of the Wellington botanic gardens. I only found the rose garden average - maybe it's the time I was there. By average, I don't mean bad, but I don't think you should make a trip just to see the rose garden..",
          "While we were visiting past the full bloom period, the garden was still lovely and well maintained, with some roses still flowering.",
          "Beautiful rose gardens with so many varieties so lovingly tended. Do not forget to go in the glass house to see some more tropical plant varieties and then visit the beautiful restaurant for a bite to eat.",
          "Pay attention to the Bolton Street Cemetery as you exit the garden. It is Wellington's oldest cemetery and the tombstones often state the cause of death.",
          "Another Wellington \"attraction\" that failed to enthuse! Maybe save this one for when you're over 70 as it may improve in appeal by then!",
          "A carpet of roses their perfume enticing you into this magic place of peace and tranquility a little slice of heaven in this small garden of Eden.",
          "This is really worth the walk. Take the cable car up the hill then walk down the hill through the botanical gardens and you end up here. A great cafe and a magnificent rose garden is your reward",
          "Spent well over an hour simply strolling and looking at all the roses and taking photographs of most of them. Do take the time to go inside the greenhouse as there are some amazing flowers that are not on display outside. The finish with refreshments (coffee, wine, meal) at the",
          "Don't miss this when you are in Wellington. Even if you have a few minutes, walk through this garden. It is very relaxing and you will be just amazed by the beautiful roses -- each bush is a photo-op! The Begonia House is also very interesting with a wide variety of tropical",
          "It always amazes me how well the roses stand up here to Wellington's notorious wind but they do! Its a compact, formal garden with a great selection of named roses that helps gardeners chose varieties. There's tea rooms/cafe beside it also.",
          "Not the largest rose garden we've been to, but we'll laid out. Some times too many can be overpowering but this was just right. Great colours",
          "After walking down the hill through the Botanical Gardens, one is greeted by a colorful suprise of a classical garden featuring roses of all types. Adding to the experience is the Begonia House and the tea house. It is a wonderful place for a peaceful pause.",

          "Make sure you spend time in this wonderful garden. All the roses are well sign posted. There are many unique specimens to look at. There is a cafe near the gardens if you wish to dine or you can bring your lunch and sit on one of many benches that surround the gardens.",
          "The perfume from the roses was evident as we approached the garden. It is traditionally laid out and most roses clearly identified in more than 100 beds. The Begonia House is well worth a visit too",
          "Always lovely in summer the roses are spectacular, very nice begonia house and cafe, limited on veg options. Poignant memorial water feature linking NZ with Hiroshima and the nuclear free movement in the wake of the bombings in WWII. Can walk through to the heritage Bolton",

          "We visited the gardens twice. What a beautiful place to visit in summer when the roses are in full bloom. An amazing rose scent was in the air! Had morning tea at the cafe. Walked down hill from top of cable car station initially and then returned a few days later via car. Free",
          "Great place to unwind, get warm to the bones in the greenhouse in the winter where the tropical plants greet you with flowers and foliage from the tropics. Love the little pond with all the water lilies and fish that little kids love watching. The cafe is next to the building",
          "These rose gardens are so beautiful. An amazing variety of blooms well signed, many with beautiful perfume. A pleasure to wander around or just sit and enjoy. Garden beds well laid out so the whole area is appealing, even the grandchildren enjoyed the visit. Allow plenty of time",
          "One of the jewels of Wellington. Such a tranquil spot to spend some in. You van grab a coffee and sit out watch the beautiful roses come into bloom. If you get tired of that (doubtful) then you can always stroll into the tropical house or the rest of gardens.",
          "The cafe is a must try, our meals were delicious, the service was excellent, as was the coffee. A lovely and welcome rest up after a good walk through the garden.",
          "On the way down from cable car ride to the top we stopped to see the rose garden. Many species of roses.",
          "In the botans for the afternoon, we decided to visit the roses. Many had bloomed already but not all were done - we saw several gorgeous species and also visited the greenhouses nearby.",
          "The start of the rose flowering season. The rose bushes are healthy and in full bud, just starting to flower. This is a lovely spot for a short walk among a well cared for garden of rose beds. Parking immediately outside.",
          "Nice setting and very good lunch food but a little pricey. Recommended as a treat, especially for taking elderly parents.",
          "I was in Wellington to early to see the Rose garden in full bloom. It would be absolutely stunning when blooming but it was not to be. All the same the well pruned roses were a delight and the fountain centrepiece gave it character along with the Picnic Cafe view of the garden.",
          "Yes. I pass through here most days on the way to the CBD. I live over the road and got married here a couple of leap years ago! Great cafe and great gardens and glass house. If it's a nice day get up here and enjoy it's beauty.",
          "We love roses so are frequent visitors, epsecially in early summer when the blooms are fresh and new. We are never disappointed. It is nice to stay awhile, far removed from the busy world, on one of the many seats in the garden. The cafe on the fringe of the garden is well",
          "Always a crowd pleaser, a nice sheltered spot, just be patient with getting a park. Catches the sun, so take a sun hat",
          "We stopped in in late September and they had just pruned all of the roses so there really wasn't much to see in that sense but I would imagine that it would be quite the site. Inside they have two green houses with very nice plants of all shapes, sizes, and colors from all over",
          "Amazing Rose Garden. A must place to visit. The Rose Garden was a tranquil and peace place to sit and think whilst being in the city.",
          "A beautiful garden with a lovely restaurant. Quiet and delightful, a great place to rejuvenate oneself",
          "Enjoy a light lunch in the cafe there after smelling all the divine roses or watching married couples get their photos taken by the fountain.",
          "I had to laugh at a previous reviewer who said the roses were in poor condition. If he knew anything about roses he'd know roses are a spring to summer flower and they are dormant in winter. We never tire of coming to the rose gardens as we are avid rose growers. The roses are",
          "Somehow a part of the botanical gardens, this was, by far, the less attractive part of them. Most of the roses were poor looking, the area was not spotlessly clean as the rest of the gardens and the place did not feel safe due to the car thieves lurking around. You can easily",
          "The Rose garden is a beautiful oasis in a delightful setting. Visit the begonia house, walk around the lovely rose garden and see the Japanese peace garden. Have a coffee in the delightful Caf\u00e9 before walking the short distance back to the city. A must see.",
          "Enjoy the roses in summer and the hot houses during winter plus the cafe that is on the other side of the hot house is great for a coffee and great cafe food with lovely scones . Also there is a fish pond in the hot house so kids will love to see the big and little fishes .also",
          "This was absolutely charming & well worth taking the time to visit. As well as the roses there are indoor tropical gardens packed with a whole range of lovely flowers. The place is well looked after & there's also a cafe which we didn't have time to visit but I'm told is",
          "The rose gardens are absolutely gorgeous. At this time of year the Council provides opportunities to learn to prune roses as well. A gorgeous display in summer. There are sculptures in the surrounding gardens in the hills as well.",
          "WOW! If you like roses, you simply must see this garden. Enter the garden on Glenmore Street or for more exotic tropical beauty, take the Cable Car to the very top of Wellington and then walk down through the Wellington Botanic Gardens ending up at the Rose Garden. I am not sure",
          "Beautiful rose garden. Lovely fragrances. Also nearby is the beautiful begonia house. Plenty of colours. Nice place for anyone that loves nature",
          "Visited this place during winter and there wasn't much roses in bloom but the garden is still pretty and has beautiful flowers of various colors. There is a cafe at the gardens so it's a great spot to sit and have breakfast or brunch. My friends and I have takeaway coffee.",
          "Often missed because it has a completely different entrance to that of the Botanic Gardens, the Lady Norwood Rose Garden and Begonia House is beautifully laid out with hundreds of varieties of roses with ample room for the hundreds of people visiting whilst were there to walk"

      "name": "Mount Kaukau",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Mount Kaukau,  pronunciation: [k\u0254\u0289k\u0254\u0289] is a large hill in the northern suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand near Johnsonville, Khandallah and Ngaio.  The summit is 445 metres above sea level and is the most visible high point in the Wellington landscape further accentuated by Wellington's main television transmitter mast, which stands 122m from the summit. The city, harbour and the Remutaka and Tararua Ranges can be seen from the summit. On a clear day Mt. Tapuae-o-Uenuku and the Kaikoura Ranges in the South Island may be seen, whilst northwest is the Porirua Basin and the Tasman Sea. \n\n\n== Name ==\nThe hill's original name Tarik\u0101k\u0101 means 'where the parrots rested' and is shared with the nearby settlement in Ngaio at the base of the mountain. Before the clearing of the native Totara forest on the slopes and general area, the native parrot kaka was common through the city. Over a hundred years later today, the population of kaka has begun to regenerate thanks mostly to the efforts at Zealandia, and are becoming a more regular sight throughout the city and in the rejuvenating native forest on the slopes of Mount Kaukau.\n\n\n== Slopes and surrounding area ==\nMuch of the eastern 'city side' slopes of Mount Kaukau make up Khandallah Park, which is one of the oldest parks in New Zealand, established in 1888 and then registered as a domain in 1909. Khandallah Park has more than 60 hectares of native forest. Native birds such as the kereru, tui and fantail are common sights when walking through the native forest. Stumps of the old totara trees can also be seen walking through the first lower parts of the forest. In mid 2017 an old bunker off Woodmancote Road, at the base of Mount Kaukau, was rediscovered after it had been sealed off and forgotten many years previously. The bunker in an 'H' shape, had been built for Royal New Zealand Signals Corps in 1942. Due to poor construction the bunker was very leaky and was never used. Mount Kaukau forms part of the Northern Skyline track from Johnsonville to Karori and Makara.\n\n  \n\n\n== Recreation ==\nKhandallah Park has 9 kilometres of walking tracks allowing access to the peak of Mt Kaukau from Khandallah, Johnsonville, Ngaio and Crofton Downs. Some tracks are also open to mountain biking and e-biking.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transmitter ==\n\nThe 122-metre Mount Kaukau television transmitter was built in 1965 to transmit television channel WNTV1 offering improved coverage over the channel's previous transmitter at Mount Victoria. Today it is the main television and FM radio transmitter for the Wellington metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Transmission Frequencies ===\nThe following table contains television and radio frequencies currently operating at Mount Kaukau:\n\n\n==== Former analogue television frequencies ====\nThe following frequencies were used until 29 September 2013, when Kaukau switched off analogue broadcasts (see Digital changeover dates in New Zealand).\n\n\n== Kaukau Challenge ==\nEvery year Khandallah School, which is at the base of Mount Kaukau, organises a fun walk / fun run from the school to the summit and back, called the Kaukau Challenge.  The Kaukau Challenge has been an annual event since 2006 with about 500 people taking part each year.\n\n\n== Snowfall of 2011 ==\nIn mid-August 2011, two Wellington men, Nick Fone and Daniel McFadyen claimed to be the first people to ski and snowboard down Mount Kaukau when they took advantage of the unusual weather pattern delivering snow to most parts of the North Island. As Wellington has a temperate climate, snow down to near sea level is extremely rare, happening less often than once every 15 years.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Sometimes had to park near the start of a well travelled walk to the view point at the top f mount karakul. Well worth it\u2019s!",
          "Mt Kaukau offers splendid 360 degree views near Wellington. A climb to the 445m summit takes around 45 minutes at a reasonable pace and is well worth the effort! From the top, one is greeted with views of the sparkling harbour, the wind turbines to the west and the surrounding",
          "Tough climb but on a good day, surpurb views of Wellington & the top of the South Island are present. Its really nice in the evening sunlight.",
          "This is a great hill to climb when you need to get a sweat on! It can be very windy at the top, so best to head back down to Khandallah Park and have a picnic there afterwards.",
          "Stunning scenery. Was much quicker to the top than anticipated (parked at khandallah swimming pool) so only a couple of hours but enough of an incline etc to make it feel like you you've done a good walk! Highly recommend (I did have a calm day though)!",
          "We climbed up from Simla Crescent Station and returned via Box Hill (having lunch at a cafe in Box Hill). It's steep, but the 360 degree views at the top are rewarding and it's far more peaceful than Mt Victoria.",
          "Steep climb from Khandallah to Mt Kaukau and not recommended for anyone with poor footwear, knee or joint problems or unfit people. Many steps to climb and you need to ensure that you have water because there are no water stops on the way up. Once up there, there is a raised",
          "I drove here to hike up Mt Kaukau, and it was definitely worth it. Stunning views of the city and harbour. Bring a wind jacket and some sun screen, and don't forget your camera!",
          "There are so many but Mt Kaukau is definitely up there. Having walked the steepish path from khandallah Park last time with a small child in a backpack, we this time decided to climb from the back along the Old Coach Road through Flinders Park from Cortina ave in Johnsonville.",
          "A shortish 30 min walk up from Khandallah pool and a wonderful view awaits over everything. Great fun.",
          "We decided to take the 'alternate route' up and the regular walk back. The walk up was a bit of a challenge for me but well worth it. The view from the top is fantastic.",
          "This walk can be as easy or hard as you like. The walk from Kandallah station to the top if Kaukau is well signposted and the track is well kept, but just rugged enough to feel as though your tramping, not just going for a city stroll. The top has a good vibe, with lots of",
          "Mount Kaukau is amust do for every visitor to Wellington. It's a brisk, 'cobweb bowing away' walk to the summit through dramatic bushscapes and the views are stunning, indeed captivating once you get there. On a recent, fine December mid-morning at the start of the week, we had",
          "This has great scenery and it's a great place for walking and running. It's a great piece of Wellington.",
          "there are various routes getting up to the top and we took the one from Simla Crescent. A quick walk and easily accessible, we took about 45mins to top. the view is great , 360 degree view over the city. Hidden gem in town and family friendly trail",
          "This is a good walk and on a fine day the view is worth the walk up the hill. There's also an ok cafe to reward your efforts on the way back.",
          "I love this place but mostly because I'm a local. It's a great place for a quick walk but demands enough effort out of you to make the hour walk up Mount Kaukau a meaningful experience. The views are great at the top. I'm not sure if I would recommend a picnic as it gets pretty",
          "Wellington is awesome on a good day and if you happen to be there on an awesome day and have an hour available, the walk up Mt Kaukau really is worth it. Multiple track choices, all are steep and all have steps. Some are steeper than others. Views from the top are endless in",
          "This is a bit of a steep walk that takes about 40 min to get to the top if you enter from the Simla Crescent side. The path is clearly marked and there are a lot of steps to get up but you don't need to be a gym bunny or fitness guru to make it up there. The track was fine with",
          "The walk is quite a long way up although there are well made steps along the path. We are 57 and 60 so you don't need to be an athlete to make it up. However, it is tiring so please take your time. The views at the top are fantastic and there are a few spots on the way that",
          "Colonial Knob/Rangituhi is the highest peak in Wellington City but Mt Kaukau is more accessible from the city. It is a lovely walk up and back along a formed and in placed stepped track through native bush. great views of the Wellington region can be had from the top on a",
          "Lots of steps to the top but it\u2019s worth the view overlooking Wellington. Suitable for dogs. Take a drink of water with you as there is nowhere to get a drink. There is plenty of car parking at all entrances.",
          "There\u2019s no doubt ... it\u2019s a great feeling when you reach the top! You can take any of several well marked tracks to the top of Mt Kaukau. Some tracks (from Khandallah Park, Simla Crescent, Truscott Ave and Clarke Street) are very well made, others are a little more rugged, but",
          "It\u2019s fair to say this is quite a hike to the top. There are a number of paths/tracks to the top. If you are not familiar with Mt Kaukau I suggest you take the easiest route unless you are very fit. There are quite a few steps to ascend but its worth the hike to see",
          "A great way to spend an hour. Well maintained tracks through lovely native bush, emerging at the top to expansive views across Wellington harbour and city, south and west to the Mainland, north to Pauatanui inlet. Very popular - lots of people doing the same as us though some",
          "Well worth while - about 30-40 mins one way. Steep steps, slippery and muddy after rain. Nice to see at sunset, but bring a torch as it will be very dark on the way down",
          "There are a few entry and exit points up to Mt Kaukau...the main ones being from Khandallah and Johnsonville. The trek is kind of the shape of a C...you can start at Khandallah up to Mt Kaukau and return to Khandallah or down to Johnsonville. I did the track from Johnsonville",
          "Takes no more than half and hour to reach the top, can be a little steep in places, but generally can be done without stopping. You're rewarded with 360\u00ba views of the Wellington region and South Island once you reach the top. Stunner on a warm sunny day.",
          "This walk begins with a climb through gorgeous native bush. It keeps going up and up but the views are totally worth it. If you go slowly you don't have to be that fit. You can see the panoramic views of greater Wellington. Just beautiful",
          "Quite steep depending on which entrance to the park you take. The Johnsonville access is probably the nearest and easiest. Climb up through bush and open hilltop to the goodnight kiwi beacon at the top. Glorious views all round...but prepare for exposed conditions and weather",
          "It is a long and hard walk up to the summit, but the scenery (the ocean, the city, the windmills and the hills) makes it worthwhile.",
          "It is a great place to go get some exercise. And get a great view of Wellington. Take your time walking the steps it's worth the view. Picnic tables at the top if you want to pack a lunch.",
          "If you want to get some great views, take the track up Mount Kaukau. It is steep, but well maintained with lots of steps cut into the path. The path is stony in places, so good shoes are a must. Go at your own pace - I'm not even moderately fit, so there was some serious puffing",
          "If you're moderately fit and up for a quick ascent to enjoy the stunning panoramic views from the summit (elev. 445 m or 1460 ft), it'll take about 30 minutes from Simla Crescent, 4th stop from Wellington Station on the Johnsonville Train line (a bargain at NZ$ 8 round-trip).",
          "If you are moderately fit then this step walk is well worth the effort. It's fairly steep but an excellent path .",
          "Definitely a location to visit on a clear and sunny day. Superb views across the mountain range to the sea, just stunning so take a camera for some great shots.",
          "The path from Simla cresent or Khandallah path is well marked and a steady climb in beautiful bush and stunning views as you catch your breathe. The view from the top is incredible .",
          "Moderate fitness took me 27 mins to climb up, good well maintained tracks, well worth the effort, pretty magical views of Wellington.",
          "Climbed Kaukau as part of a long run recently. Requires a reasonable level of fitness and very exposed on a windy day. The views are well worth the climb though. You can carry on along the tops down towards the south coast if you are really energetic.",
          "Mt. Kaukau is located north from Wellington CBD, and can be accessed by foot from Khandallah. Easiest way to get there is by catching the train to Simla Crescent on the Johnsonville line, and walking up the hill. Alternatively you may do the Skyline Track, and end up on the",
          "We took the train out from Wellington and then hiked the Northern Passage back into the city - about 10 miles. There are some gorgeous views from the tower and, if nice weather, a picnic table to sit and enjoy a lunch. But even in bad weather, we enjoyed the hike and the scenery.",
          "Reasonably steep walk. Would highly suggest doing this if you don't have time for the entire Skyline route, however, if you have a about 5-6 hours, do the whole thing! Do it on a clear day, as there is minimal shelter. Parking shouldn't be an issue.",
          "There's a few approaches to the top of Kaukau, all get steep and sometime s slippery so dress appropriately. Probably the easiest is from Broadmeadows as you can drive up most of the height of the hill. You'll see all kinds of folks at the top, young kids, runners, cyclists and",
          "My friend suggested we went for a walk - on a beautiful fresh sunny day well worth it for the views at the top - can be a little muddy in places where the light doesn't get through the trees. Some fitness required - is steep in places and lots of steps - views are awesome",
          "Mount Kaukau is a nice walk just outside of the Wellington CBD. It offers nice views of the city after the walk. I recommend visiting on a dry sunny day, as the track can get all muddy just after the rains. I strongly recommend this walk.",
          "Steepish walk uphill from the station, for up to an hour. Great views. Can be included in longer day walks, such as to Johnson's hill in Karori. Avoid in bad weather - exposed.",
          "There are several tracks leading to the summit. Most are straight up, steep and short but the one starting at the end of the Old Coach Road has an easier gradient but is a bit longer. There's a track to suit everyone's ability. From the top, on can link up with the Old Coach",
          "You have to go up here whilst in Wellington. Great views of the city and rolling hills. The walk isn't challenging, just well built steps up and up.",
          "I love the views once you reach the top of Mount Kaukau. This is a steep, uphill walk up a number of steps but will take you less than 1 hour. A great walk for a city lighting the great variety and diversity in Wellington city.",
          "The highest point in the immediate Wellington area, it is readily accessed from well graded walking trails leading from public transport routes. For example enter from the Crofton Downs or Awarua stations, walk along the ridge to the summit and descend via the Khandallah or",
          "A great walk up to the summit, can be a bit of work the first couple of times but worth it. Walking amongst beautiful forest, mountain streams and listening to beautiful song birds, is an experience. The walk is cool due to plenty of shade and the views at top are beautiful.",
          "Mount Kaukau is a good above Wellington city, it takes approximately an hour from the car park to the lookout at the top and is a fairly steep climb comprising of sloped track and stairs. You'll need good footwear, and the useful stuff like sun screen, water, food and a jacket",
          "Many entrances and exits to reach the summit. We started in Box-hill area. Took us about 30 minutes to reach the top. Lots of stairs once you pass about the half way point. It was a warm day and it was a work out to get to the top. A little slick with wet ground and it had not",
          "If you are going to make the trek up Mt KauKau make sure you have some sensible walking shoes and check the weather forecast as it can change pretty quickly up there with dramatic results! On a calm sunny day the view is sensational - you can see right across Wellington and over",
          "I love this amountant - it is better that you do the Skyline Walk to this mountain. It is worthit. So beautiful mountain ranges. But it can be a long walk.",
          "I'm a local to Mt Kaukau, having lived in the area for over 20yrs, and consider it a 'must-do' for anyone living in or visiting Wellington who enjoys a hill walk. The main tracks are well maintained and as easy as a fairly steep uphill walk can be and you can get up and down in",
          "Such a fantastic workout - and when you get to the top, wow on a good day that view is just breathtaking. You can see the South Island when it's clear. Lots of walking tracks to choose from",
          "Beautiful views and well worth the huff and puff to get up there - lots of different entry points, but the one from Khandallah pool is easy for tourists. Cant beat it on a good day!",
          "This is a decent walk and a good run. Many different tracks to choose from. Even if you are not that fit, there are spots along the way to sit and take in the view. Worth going to top to get a super view and a sense of achievement.",
          "It is definitely worth the walk up to the top, especially on a beautiful clear day. You can sometimes see the top of the South Island! Great walk, great views!",
          "This is my local \"top bush walk\" and I do it 2 - 3 times a week. Many locals do, and most of the time there is a handful of others on the walk up or back, regardless what time of the day or week... There are multiple access tracks up the hill, some steeper (and therefore",
          "This walk is amazing. I do it for fitness purposes, but nothing beats that view at the top. On a nice day, I can sit there for hours just looking around Wellington and out to the Hutt Valley. If you are an active person then I would definitely recommend you do not miss this.",
          "We visited Mt KauKau for a lovely walk. Its a decent climb up, but the views at the top are wonderful. Great for fresh air and to get that heart pumping. Worth the walk to see the beautiful city from up high.",
          "This is an awesome little walk you can do in an hour or so. The views from the top over the harbour are awesome.",
          "Mount Kaukau is renowned as one of the most strenuous bush walks in Wellington. At the same time, it is definitely doable for amateurs if you just pace yourself. It is so worth it! Through the native bush on the way up with the peaceful atmosphere, you can hear many of NZ's",
          "Regularly walk to the summit from Old Coach Road, Truscott Ave, Khandallah Pool or Simla Cres entrances and it is always a great workout. Usually rewarded with stunning views from the top no matter the route. It is a good walk with lots of steps no matter the starting point.",
          "This has got to be one of the best free short walks anywhere. There are a number of different tracks up Kaukau - those from Simla Crescent and Clark Street, or from Khandallah Park (car parking at end of Woodmancote Rd) are all well maintained and regularly upgraded although",
          "I caught the train to Simla Crescent from the CBD, and walked up the walking track, that is really well signed just a minute or two from the train station. the track is well formed, and there is no fear of loosing your way. The views from the summit are spectacular, I was lucky",
          "The view from the top is rewarding. Mt Kaukau is a must do in the Wellington region, especially for those who enjoy the outdoors and a bit of push play. I have seen individuals run up from the Johnsonville entrance to the top, or groups of families; with kids as young as 5",
          "Have run/walked every track on this beautiful mountain. So many tracks starting from different suburbs like johnsonville, Mandalay, Ngaio, Simla Crescent & Crofton Downs. Some people have asked about the best view of the wind turbine, which is actually not from the top of",
          "My son, a couple of friends and myself decided to do the walk up Mount Kaukau. A fairly steep and uneven climb took us est. 45 mins. Up and another 45mins. down perhaps a bit longer as we lost our way back. Beautiful views from the top a bit windy typical of Wellington.",
          "Mt Kau Kau is a lovely place to go. The walk up to the top is do-able for most people, but it does get the blood pumping and the heart going due to lots of steps and being a good uphill walk. The views are worth the effort it takes to get to the top, stunning panoramic views and",
          "A very pleasant walk initially through dense woodland (bush) on well maintained paths. We started from the car park in Khandallah and slthough the sign post states 1 hour walking readonably briskly we reached the lookout in just over 30 minutes. Although the weather was not",
          "Tough climb but the views at the top are worth the puffing and blowing! We suggest you start at Khandallah and walk past the caf\u00e9 which is next to the swimming pool and head through the park to the start of the walk. Pool only open is summer but reward yourself coming down with",
          "Well worth the effort to get to the top for the view of the harbour, city and beyond, even in the face of a southerly.",
          "Make sure not too windy, and go for nice long walk to the top, with great views all around. Can get windy on the top",
          "We started our climb up to Mount Kaukau at Truscott Avenue in Johnsonville. Wow, what a climb it was too!! 445 metres above sea level. Unfortunately the day we chose to do this walk the weather was very misty, so we didn't get the spectacular views at the top that you would",
          "Well worth walking up Mount Kauakau whether from Ngaio, Khandallah or Johnsonville. We recommend going early, ideally 8am latest to avoid too many people and take water. A great way to see Wellington.",
          "I was lucky to visit Wellington recently over an amazing stretch of fine weather. The views from Mt Kaukau were stunning - the Marlborough Sounds looked close enough to touch. We took 45 min up and then carried on south for 2 hr along the Te Araroa Trail and descended through",
          "The way up is a really tough one. The main way uses stairs that never seem to end, but you can take an other way, much more interesting and beautiful by starting in Otari Wilton's Bush. From Otari Wilton's Bush (which is a very nice forest park, by the way) take the Blue Trail",
          "When you are in the neighbourhood of Wellington and you have a reasonable fitness, walk of Mt Kau Kau. It is part of the Northern Walkway. There are several starting points. We always take the starting point at Simla Cresent. Easy when you come out of town by train. ( take",
          "We went up here with neighbours who said they'd lived in Broadmeadows for 20 years but had never been up here despite it being right on their doorstep! We started from Sirsi Crescent in Broadmeadows so it's already part of the way up. The walk really only steep at the beginning",
          "Legit my fav walk - when I was fitter, i'd run it! Lots of people and dogs head up - also lots of children. So it's walk for everyone! People are generally polite and move to the side. There is a cafe down the bottom, and the Khandallah swimming pool is open during the summer",
          "This walk is approx 45 mins uphill, there are a number of steps to climb but many lovely views overlooking Wellington along the way. The view from the top is worth all the steps, it's a 360 degree view. Take your time and also a water bottle and enjoy the amazing views. Plenty",
          "What a fantastic walk to the top! Nice, steep and challenging. Beautiful through the bush, with some parts open to the sky. The view from the top is spectacular, especially when the sun is out and no wind like today. Definitely bring your water bottle and camera, even a picnic",
          "You can start on Huntleigh park way and go up Crows nest. This will then link onto the skyline track which takes you to Mount Kaukau summit. Once at top of Crows nest you can see all the wind turbines. Definitely one of my favourite runs to do, but not for the faint-hearted!",
          "Really enjoyed our 8am walk - took about 1.5 hours return. A pleasant hilly walk and then great views from the top. Well worth it, enjoyed it more than Mt Victoria.",
          "The view from the top of Mt Kaukau is stupendous. On a beautiful day it might actually be the best place in Wellington. The walk up is pretty steep, and there are a lot of steps! The path is really well maintained and very clear. Next time I'll take a picnic up so we can hang at",
          "Walked the skyline walkway and this was definitely the highlight and perfect place to stop for lunch. Would say the walk wasn't easy, but easier than city to sea.",
          "A great hike up but well worth it. Go on a clear day. Take some sandwiches and a flask. Great panoramic views 360. Beautiful landscape.",
          "It's a steep, but enjoyable and not too hard walk up here. The views are excellent too. Be prepared for the winds.",
          "Great walking track with multiple entryway. Good incline challenge and the view is definitely worth seeing. If you take the north route via McClintock you go through a farm and if you are lucky, cows and sheep will greet you along the way.",
          "A reasonable standard of fitness may be required to climb to the top of Mt. Kaukau from the cafe in Khandallah, but the views are well worth it. On a clear day you can see from The Kaikouras in the South Island to Mount Taranaki near New Plymouth.",
          "If you have a reasonable level of fitness and knees that will cope with a number of stairs, this multi-faceted hike will take you through bush or river valley, and open scrub to a view worth puffing over. The top affords 300 degree views from the tip of the South Island up to Mt",
          "While Mt Kau Kau provides a good workout and great views, it gets very windy at the very top where it is mostly exposed. Tip - bring sunscreen, water and a jacket. It is nice to get dropped off at Johnsonville's entrance to walk up and then come down through Khandallah",
          "It's a steep climb but worth it for the views. I really doubt you'd regret making the effort to go up here, just probably try and go when the weather is alright!",
          "Views will wow you as you start climbing up the track from Khandalah. You can see all the way down south to the inlet in Porirrua on a nice clear day. Not a place to go to when it is raining coz it can be slippery on the way down.",
          "We walked up MT KauKau for Guy Fawkes last year. Make sure you take a couple of torches and something warm to drink at the top as it can get windy. It's a lovely walk up especially at sun rise or sun set. The view is amazing and most of the time you can see the South Island and",
          "Started the hike from Simla Crescent and ascended to Mt Kaukau. The hike is energetic but not too taxing and the views at the top are worth it.",
          "The walk up is a bit challenging for the less sporty ones, but a very nice walk anyway. The views of Wellington are great from the top. Watch out for the wind...",
          "Couldn't resist the challenge to walk Mt Kaukau. Word of warning - WEAR APPROPRIATE FOOTWEAR WITH GRIP. About 2.9k on constructed stairs and basic walking track with exposed tree roots, and rocks, so watch what you're doing. Hard haul up to the top - be warned if you're not so",
          "A great 360 degree view. Plan to do it on a nice day with no wind however. Great either biking or walking",
          "After breakfast at a local cafe Dunshea's ( only a short walk away) - climbing up to the top of Mt Kaukau was just the coolest thing to do ! Highly recommended for anyone with 'some level of fitness'. Getting there does involve a fair amount of uphill and long sections of",
          "Walk it, you'll love the 360 view from the top. It is not difficult, and will take about 30 minutes from the Kandallah Pool car park. Bush covered most of the way, good walking track opens out onto a grassy track near top. Stop there for a picnic and enjoy the vista!",
          "If you are in Wellington & want to get some aerobic exercise do this! Catch a train or bus to Simla crescent, walk up Simla a little way and there's the start of the track. Plenty of steps, good quality track, very nice bush. As you climb look back at the views. Or do as I do",
          "The walk was quite tricky in places but i only have a mild fitness level and managed ok....the walk took a while we went from simla terrace at the bottom by the khandalla pools.......but was absaloutely worth the walk when you get to the top and see such a spectacular 360 view",
          "Go on a clear day. It's a steep hike up but well worth it when you get to the top. Magnificent views. Take a picnic up with you and enjoy and take the time. Then in summer there is a pool at the bottom to enjoy.",
          "Enjoyed a great walk on a lovely day. Be prepared for a steep climb, so not for the unfit.mthe views of Wellington are spectacular! Well worth a morning excercise.",
          "We walked up from Simla Tce (?), took under an hour for the return trip. A good climb up, gets the heart rate up. Awesome view and well worth the effort. Glad we found this walk. Will definitely be back for more walking in Wellington, a great place fir walking. Wear good",
          "One of the first trek in wellington, you will enjoy the changing shades of green around while you trek. It will test your lungs and your fitness.",
          "If your feeling fit and its a good day then you really should take a trip to the top of Mt Kaukau. It has 360 degree views accross the city. If its windy dress warm. The Skyline walkway is also a good option for people who have a spare day (around 3 hours to Karori from Kaukau",
          "Just an hour walking takes you to a view all over Wellington. Take a camera and binoculars. It was a fine day when we went, the turbine blades stood still.",
          "You need to be fairly fir, but if not just take your time. Its worth it for the great views. I walked up in about 30 minutes and 10 minutes to run down",
          "Start your day off at Khandallah Park, a suburb within Wellington with an outdoor swim or on the playground. Then, take one of the many dirt trails through the foliage to the top (which is the highest point in Wellington). Sometimes you can see bulls or sheep grazing at the",
          "As detailed by other contributors the 360 degree views are fantastic and certainly the best I saw in Wellington. I walked up and back via Bells Track which starts at the top of Awarua Street in Ngaio. A few days before I had walked most of the way up via Simla Cres Khandallah (I",
          "The best view of the city and surrounds we have found, and we have walked a lot around Wellington. We take all our guests here. Originally we walked up from Khandallah park which was very steep but totally worth it when you come out at the top, or you can walk to it from Karori",
          "I loved the Mount Kaukau walk my brother and I did yesterday morning. We took the alternative route up, which is quite strenuous but provided absolutely stunning views of the city all the way up to the top. The track is well sign posted once you get to Khandallah pool. The views",
          "There are several routes up the hill, from long and steep to short and, well, maybe a bit less steep. I think there is also a long and relatively gentle one but I haven't tried it. Worth the pull, for the panorama of Wellington and suburbs which is spread st your feet from the",
          "Having lived locally most of my life I have walked up Mt Kaukau several times. The walk up the mountain can be taken from various pathways, the most popular being through Khandallah Park or from Truscott Ave. The walk up the mountain varies from closed in bush to open farmland.",
          "Do this walk on a fine, still day and you will be well rewarded with spectacular views of Wellington, the harbour and surrounding farmland. It is steep in parts, but generally with well constructed steps. Gets the heart rate up and exiting via Crofton Downs gives you a nice,",
          "The walk through the bush to the top has lots of stairs and will get you sweating, need to have a reasonable fitness however there are plenty of resting places along the way. The 360 degree view at top is very rewarding.",
          "As cities go, Wellington has some amazing scenery. From the lookout you can get an almost full 360 view, which includes dainty Wellington city nestled into the harbour as well as meandering coastlines and mountain-top panoramics . It took me 30 minutes to climb (fast paced) with",
          "A long hike up the Mount, through the bush. Lots of different gradients on several walkways. But the view at the top, over the harbour and Wellington is worth it all.",
          "A 360 view of Wellington that is unforgettable. The rolling green mountains are nothing like you would have seen before.",
          "I've been walking up here ever since I was a kid, it's a great walk which boasts a great view of Wellington.",
          "A good steady up hill walk, which at some stages can become a bit congested but when you arrive at the summit, you can get an amazing view of Wellington. It is certainly well worth the effort. This a great thing to do on a calm Summer's day.",
          "We love Mt Kaukau, quite easily accessible from Wellington City, get a train to Box Hill station (Johnsonville train line from Wellington railway station) or taxi to Clarke St, Khandallah. The walk is gorgeous amongst bush and open sky with plenty of birds, and an amazing view",
          "i used to live on the foot of Mt Kau Kau on the Johnsonville side. i ventured up the alot in my childhood and only once as an adult as i no longer live in wellington. i tried to climb up 2 days ago but the weather was so bad that i thought id leave it and climb up when i return",
          "What a view. It is hard and if unfit, take many photos on the way! This is a must do for a Wellingtonian, just like Wrights Hill. Take the kids and some sandwiches and a flask, have a picnic at the top. A group family photo every year as they get older.... Mike",
          "Wonderful walk through native bush then climb for 30 minutes or so quite steep at times. Magnificent views from the summit of Wellington on a good day, or invigorating on a windy one.",

          "I went up there last Saturday. It's pretty much 2.5-3 km uphill walk (`400m elevation) with a few stairs in between. In average you will need 25-40 minutes to go up there and yes i'ts a bit of a small workout. The big bonus are the awesome 360 degree views from up there.",
          "Wellington weather certainly turned it on for us with no wind, yes no wind, and a sunny day. Views were excellent and well worth the walk up. Would recommend this to any body to walk up and see the spender of the capital city.",
          "A group of us made the trek to the top of the hill to enjoy amazing views of Wellington - able to see down to the city and across to Makara including the wind farm!! Although a definite climb all the way up, there was a sense of achievement at reaching the summit and taking in",

          "This is a great place to go to see 360 degree views of Wellington on a fine sunny day. It is a bit of a hike up the hill and depending on which track you take depends on the difficulty. It is steep in parts and some tracks have steps in places. Most of the tracks start in the",
          "I used to do the walk to the top most weekends when I lived in Wellington. Starting from Khandallah Park (by the open air pool and the cafe), the track is clear but is steep in places. Be prepared for lots of steps! Once you get to the top the views are amazing. On a clear day",
          "Mt Kau Kau is a mountain located north of the city and has a number of different tracks to choose from so you can reach the top and the stunning views of wellington harbour for free. The track I usually take starts in johnsonville and can take about an hour round trip to get to",
          "It's been many years since I trekked up to Mt KauKau, but I'm writing a review anyway, as I regularly used to pack a lunch and head up for a walk on my own, with the family, friends or with our family dog. Visiting recently with my husband, I so wanted to take him up there,",
          "The walk had options of moderate or difficult tracks. The moderate one had some track and some steps with various places to stop and catch your breath while looking out over Wellington city and harbour. At the top ( which takes about 45 mins) is a seating area and a plaque",
          "After a coffee and cake at the cafe at the btm, we were primed for the steep bush track leading up to the barren grassy hilltop where the view of Wellington harbour to the south are astounding.we sat and ate our picnic lunch near the top, in a sheltered spot where the wind din't",

          "We walked up Mt Kaukau one day with our girls aged 8 & 5 from Truscott Avenue, just over 200 steps up but well worth the walk, it took us an hour but stopped lots & explored the tunnel on the way up at the top we were met with fantastic views of Wellington.",
          "Fantastic view on a good day. Walk up it from somewhere a bit less steep than the Khandallah end - nearer Jville there are other entries that are prettier and involve less stairs. A bit hard on the knees.",

          "I went on a guided summer walk put on by Wellington City Council. WCC put out a brochure of all their walks early December. I figure we hiked up and down every saddle on the Wellington skyline just to get to Mt Kaukau, puff-puff-puff ... Mt Kaukau, itself, was the hardest",

        "wiki": "The National War Memorial of New Zealand is located next to the New Zealand Dominion Museum building on Buckle Street, in Wellington, the nation's capital. The war memorial was dedicated in 1932 on Anzac Day in commemoration of the First World War. It also officially remembers the New Zealanders who gave their lives in the South African War, World War II and the wars in Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nThe War Memorial consists of the War Memorial Carillon, the Hall of Memories, and an unknown New Zealand warrior interred in a tomb constructed in 2004 in front of the Hall of Memories.\nFour Rolls of Honour bear the names and ranks of 28,654 New Zealanders. Lyndon Smith's bronze statue of a family group is the focal point for the complex, which is visited by approximately 20,000 people a year.\n\n\n== War Memorial Carillon ==\n\nThe National War Memorial Carillon was designed as a sister instrument to the 53-bell carillon at the Peace Tower in Ottawa, Canada.The carillon bells were made in Croydon, England, by Gillett & Johnston, and arrived in New Zealand in January 1931.At the time of dedication the 49 bells ranged from one weighing a shade more than 4 kg with a diameter of 170 mm and 140 mm high, up to one weighing 5 tonnes and measuring 2 m by 1.6 m. Their total weight was more than 30 tonnes and they cost \u00a311,000.The complex made considerable use of New Zealand stone. The carillon was clad with pinkish-brown Putaruru stone. Unfortunately the material was variable and weathered badly in places. It was removed from the carillon and replaced by Takaka marble in 1982.Since 1984 the Carillon has been substantially rebuilt and enlarged. Twenty mid-range bells have been replaced with 21 smaller treble bells and 4 large bass bells, extending the total range to 6 octaves. The Carillon currently has 74 bells, including the \"Peace\" bell, which, at 12.5 tonnes, is the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. The Carillon ranks as the third largest in the world by total weight.Anzac Day and specific battle commemorations have special places in the annual schedule of events. The Carillon is played in over 200 hours of live concerts per year and a comprehensive domestic and international carillon teaching programme is conducted under the direction of the National Carillonist, Timothy Hurd.. Since the opening of the National War Memorial Carillon in 1932 there have only been four official carillonists \n\n\n== Hall of Memories ==\n\nThe Hall of Memories is approached through an octagonal vestibule forming the base of the Carillon Tower. Inside there are six memorial alcoves on each side leading up to an apse and Sanctuary at the southern end of the Hall. These alcoves are designed as small side chapels dedicated to the different branches of the New Zealand Armed Forces that have served in overseas conflicts.\nThe entrance to the Sanctuary is flanked on either side by two white stone columns, each surmounted with a bronze orb and cross and engraved with the coats of arms of members of the Commonwealth whose forces served in World Wars I and II. These coats of arms are linked by stylised branches, representing the tree of the Commonwealth. On each of the two side walls of the Sanctuary a large cross forms the background for the coats of arms of the main towns of the nine provinces of New Zealand. These crosses symbolise the sacrifices made by New Zealanders in times of war.Mounted to one side of the Sanctuary is a Lamp of Brotherhood, one of 84 made after World War II to commemorate the war dead of all nations and to promote reconciliation and unity between nations.Four Rolls of Honour, inscribed with the name and rank of each fallen New Zealander, are placed in bronze display cases on the east and west walls of the Sanctuary.The Hall of Memories is lined with cream Mt Somers stone. Inside, Hanmer marble, Coromandel granite and Takaka marble are all used.\n\n\n== Unknown Warrior ==\n\nThe Unknown Warrior symbolise[s] the tremendous sacrifice New Zealand has made over the last century in the struggle to preserve freedom and justice and the democratic way of life...For all New Zealanders this [is] a day of remembrance and a day to remember.\nTo serve as a focus of remembrance for the sacrifice made by all New Zealand servicemen and women, in 2004 a project was undertaken to repatriate the body of an unknown warrior for burial in the new Tomb of the Unknown Warrior.\nThe Unknown Warrior is one of over 250,000 New Zealanders who served in overseas wars. He is one of 30,000 who died in service. He is one of over 9000 who have no known grave or whose remains could never be recovered. The remains were chosen by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission from the Caterpillar Valley Cemetery, near where the New Zealand Division fought in 1916.\n\nAs the soldier's name, rank, regiment, race, religion and other details are unknown, he represents and honours all New Zealanders who became lost to their families in war.\nI told him [the Warrior] we're taking him home and that those who are taking him home are soldiers, sailors and airmen, past and present. I asked the Warrior to be the guardian of all military personnel who had died on active service. I then promised that we, the people of New Zealand, will be his guardian\nOn Monday 1 November a New Zealand delegation departed for France to begin the process of repatriating the remains of the Unknown Warrior. A handover ceremony took place on 6 November at the New Zealand Memorial site near the village of Longueval, France. The ceremony marked the official return of the Unknown Warrior from the care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission into the care of New Zealand.On return to New Zealand on Wednesday 10 November, the Unknown Warrior lay in state at Parliament. Thousands of New Zealanders attended the vigil to pay their respects. A memorial service was held on 11 November at the Wellington Cathedral of St Paul, followed by a Military Funeral Procession through central Wellington. More than 100,000 people lined the streets to the National War Memorial where an Interment Ceremony with full Military Honours took place.The Warrior was finally laid to rest in the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior on Thursday 11 November 2004, Armistice Day.The Tomb is sealed with a bronze mantel bearing the words: \n\n\n== The Man with the Donkey ==\nA bronze sculpture by Paul Walshe of Richard Alexander Henderson as \"The Man with the Donkey\" stands outside the National War Memorial. It is based on the photograph of Henderson taken at Gallipoli by James Gardiner Jackson on 12 May 1915, and is a \"tribute to all medical personnel, stretcher bearers and ambulance drivers who served alongside New Zealand troops in wartime\". Commissioned by the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services\u2019 Association, it was unveiled by Henderson's son Ross in 1990.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1919 the Government voted \u00a3100,000 for a National War Memorial in Wellington .After considerable debate, it was agreed to build a complex that included a national art gallery, museum, and war memorial, including a carillon in the central suburb of Mt Cook. A competition was held in 1929 for plans for the war memorial, and for the Dominion Museum and the National Art Gallery immediately behind it. The competition was won by Messrs Gummer and Ford.\nThe inscription on the foundation stone reads: REO WAIRUA. TO THE GLORY OF GOD. To the memory of the New Zealander that died in the Great War, 1914 to 1918, and in honour of those that served or suffered, this stone was laid by the Right Honourable G W Forbes, PC, MP, Prime Minister of New Zealand, on 15th May, 1931.\nWork was completed for an Anzac Day 1932 dedication when Governor-General Lord Bledisloe switched on the Lamp of Remembrance atop the tower and the Evening Post reported hearing 'magic from the skies'Although the museum was opened in 1936, the planned Hall of Memories fell victim to first the Depression, then the Second World War. The first plans were prepared in 1937, and Gummer and Ford forwarded a new set in 1949, but the project did not go to tender until 1960. When tenders closed, the Christchurch firm of P Graham and Son (the same firm that built the carillon tower) was chosen, its tender being \u00a3114,000.The hall of memories was officially opened by the Governor-General, Sir Bernard Fergusson, on 5 April 1964.The Carillon's Putaruru stone had badly deteriorated by the late 1950s. Although repairs were approved as part of the Hall of Memories project, work did not finally begin until 1981-82. Among other things, a section of the campanile was replastered, Canaan marble replaced the Putaruru stone, and the metal louvres, window frames, and grilles were replaced.In 1985 the Carillon, increased to 65 bells, was restored, ready for rededication in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II in the following year.In 2004 the unknown New Zealand warrior  was added; retired Army Colonel Andrew Renton-Green, who chairs the National War Memorial Advisory Council and the coordinating committee behind the tomb project, explains why it took so long:\n\nThe history goes back to the time Gummer designed the National War Memorial, which was completed \u2013 not in its present form \u2013 in 1932. The original design was just the carillon tower and an avenue which led from the harbour to the tower, with what was then the National Museum behind. As part of that design Gummer actually made provision for a tomb, but all building other than the carillon tower was abandoned because of the economic situation at the time \u2013 the Depression.\nSo Gummer\u2019s vision was still there; it was never fulfilled. In 1963 the Hall of Memories was added, and it was at this time that the RSA, and others, said wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea if we had our own Unknown Warrior. There are not many people in New Zealand who can afford to pay their respects to one of their family by going to Westminster Abbey, where the Commonwealth tomb was put in the ground in 1923.\nIt still took another 40 years before a government \u2013 and the RSA pays tribute to Helen Clark\u2019s leadership in this \u2013 finally got onto the job. The Ministry for Culture & Heritage held a tomb-design competition but, even then, controversy over Robert Jahnke\u2019s winning entry stalled the project; eventually the job went to Kingsley Baird, who came up with a classically simple design of bronze and stone set into the steps below the present memorial.\n\nIt\u2019s just another step along the way, from Gummer\u2019s original design of just the carillon, to the Hall of Memories being added in \u201963, to this being added now \u2013 it shows that it\u2019s actually a living thing, it\u2019s not dead. It\u2019s not about dead people at all, it\u2019s about living people.\nIn February 2020, the National War Memorial Building was closed to the public due to concerns about its resilience in an earthquake.\n\n\n== Pukeahu National War Memorial Park ==\n\nPukeahu National War Memorial Park, also known as Pukeahu Park, opened on 18 April 2015 in time for the centenary of the World War I Gallipoli landings, and was one of the New Zealand Government's key projects to commemorate the 100th anniversary of World War I.In May 2004, Prime Minister Helen Clark said,\n\nA park would further enhance the area which is already being redeveloped with the building of the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. It will provide a more appropriate setting for New Zealand's memorial to those New Zealanders who gave their lives in times of war. Significant aspects of our heritage and identity were forged in difficult times of conflict...this is illustrated by the growing numbers of people who attend ANZAC Day services in New Zealand.\nIn 2005 the Ministry for Culture and Heritage worked with the NZ Transport Agency to acquire land on the northern side of Buckle Street, in front of the National War Memorial, to create a National Memorial Park.\nOn 7 August 2012 the government announced Buckle Street section of State Highway One was to be moved underground via a 'cut and cover' tunnel beneath the Park, allowing the Park to extend over the road and up to the National War Memorial creating a unified National Memorial precinct.The park is designed to house memorials from New Zealand's military allies. The park opened with a memorial of 15 red sandstone columns commissioned by the Australian Government to pay tribute to the Anzac military relationship. A French memorial is planned to be constructed in 2017 with inauguration intended in 2018.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNew Zealand War Memorial, London\nUnited Nations Memorial Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPukeahu National War Memorial Park\nA Day to Remember: The Story of the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior",

          "A very interesting exhibition and very well planned and executed. Really enjoyed the stories that were told and the opportunity to just sit and observe for a while. Definitely a must visit when in the capital.",
          "Visited with teenage son and we both found it to be informative and emotional all at the same time . A truly \u201c must see \u201c attraction whilst visiting Wellington",
          "This is one of the things one must do once in Wellington. 100% realistic and tourist who are interested in history and would love to know about New Zealand \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddff history can drag themselves here. A must do thing.",
          "Amazing colour photography used on old black/white shots. I visited Gallipoli , Anzac cove, Chunuk Blair, the Anzac and the Turkish War Memorials in November 2004, The steep hilly terrain, scrubby bushes and clay soil look the same as 100 years ago and thought of all those",
          "This Museum has a great place in kiwis hearts, I\u2019d heard a lot of hype about it and Peter Jackson\u2019s involvement and must say the colourisation of the photos are very well done. Couldn\u2019t help feel a bit odd to be at an entertainment attraction about our Great War but education",
          "I wanted to see this exhibition as I heard it may be closing? I really hope it's not. It's so well done and I think everyone should experience it. We paid for general entry, where you wander around at your own pace. You could have the full trench experience, but that was",
          "An amazing exhibition with some very sad and sobering information. Worth a second (or third) visit or take in the amount of detail within the displays, and a top activity to take visitors to Wellington.",
          "As an Australian I was really interested to see the display honouring our servicemen and nurses that form the NZ in ANZAC. A fantastic interactive display that highlighted the struggle of the war and the friendships forged.",
          "Unfortunately this exhibition will be dismantled after November 11. However it is excellent and well worth it if you can get there beforehand.",
          "Amazing and also very sad. Educational and incredible props help you imagine exactly what the Great War was like. I recommend a guided tour and the trenches tour which was the absolute highlight",
          "An excellent exhibition on the Great War - imaginative in presentation, extremely generous with information and such a shame that is soon to end. We booked on line and included the trench experience - again really cleverly done so you actually felt like you were there in the",
          "Thanks to our friends visiting us from Australia, we were able to visit the exhibition with them. We were so happy to pay the visit because we learnt a lot. Throughout 2 hours visit, including our teenager kids, we were reading the real stories, seeing & watching the scenes,",
          "This exhibition was absolutely amazing. We paid $40 each to go on a Sunday afternoon. This provided us with an informative 45 minute guided tour by Phillip who was a wealth of information. The location in the old museum building is perfect, had to pay for parking! The attention",
          "Very interesting and extremely well presented exhibition . People need to see this and then press for it to be continued , it is a crime to demolish such a great exhibition of our history.",
          "Excellent presentation including little known background history and events in the war. I had not known that the Kaiser was present with Queen Victoria when she died",
          "I got there at about 3:30 and stayed until closing at 6:pm. I learned more about ANZAC and Galopoli than I ever have in just over 2 hours. Very educational. The color pictures of the ANZAC troops with the story was truly outstanding. I would recommend this to anyone who loves",
          "Awesome. Did the guided tour and trench experience. Loved it. The coloured photos bring the war to life for the modern day. Fabulously done.",
          "Amazing well worth a look did the guided tour with the trench experience was well worth the $40. Well done Peter Jackson.",
          "This was the second visit to the exhibition and the first to go go through the Quinns Post trenches. An absoutely amazing experience and it will be a travesty if this is not relocated somewhere for the future. Having been to Quinns Post in Gallipoli and having a relation buried",
          "This has to be the best exhibition that I have seen , A MUST SEE on my books . The detail put into this is the topcurrently considering a revisit",
          "The is a must see for every New Zealander, young or old. We were privileged to spend over 2 hours viewing the exhibition. It is outstanding. It should not be forgotten about and should be put on permanent display somewhere so everyone can keep enjoying it. The stories told",
          "We came down from Auckland especially to see this, since it was announced that it's closing soon. I'm SO glad we did. I can't believe that we can't find somewhere to reopen this exhibit - it deserves a permanent home. The Trench Experience was very well done, and not totally",
          "This exhibition and the trenches tour is so amazing. We would love to go back again to spend more time learning about the history. We are so sad that it is being dismantled and closed on 2nd December 2018. We hope and pray that it will be moved to a different location, but",
          "This exhibition is well worth a visit. The models are so life like with so much emotion captured in each exhibit. It really brings home what the men and women went through during the first World War. I think more people should visit this, maybe it would change people's attitudes",
          "We have been to some of the worlds best museums and exhibitions in UK, France, Japan, China, Canada, Australia and Vietnam and this one stands with the best. Its really 2 museums in one. Firstly there is the Great War Exhibition and secondly Quinn's Post Trench Experience . Both",
          "The Trench Experience was by far the highlight of our trip, amazing detail, outstanding effects and our tour guide was wonderful.",
          "Highly recommend doing a guided tour of the exhibition and a tour of the trenches then spending time going back through the exhibition at your leisure. Really excellent!",
          "The National War Memorial Park is worth visit when you are around the area. The exhibition is a bonus. Enjoy!",
          "This exhibition is exceptional, and the Quinn's Post Trench experience is not to be missed. The first part of the exhibition is an overview of WW1 as a whole, with a number of exhibits provided by Sir Peter Jackson. These original items along with life-size models enhance the",
          "We came over from Blenheim especiallyto see this, after learning it was to he shut down in early December. It will be a crying shame for New Zealand tibiae this outstanding exhibition. I learnt so much, I don't recall learning much about WW1 at school, bar Gallipoli, so it",
          "Amazing visit to The Great War exhibition. The trench experience was the best. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This is a very moving testament to the Great War. The Gallipoli exhibit with its coloured photographs brings this campaign into the modern era in observing and reflecting on the battle. The large model of the Chunuk Bar clearly explains this battle, and such detail in the model",
          "Visited the exhibition for 2.5 hrs one day. Had to go back the next day for another 2.5 hrs to finish seeing everything. What a beautifully constructed exhibit Wellington. So engaging, informative and deeply moving. So glad we were fortunate enough to be in New Zealand to be",
          "I highly recommend this very well done exhibition. I understand it may finishes soon. Peter Jackson the Film Director was very much involved.",
          "This exhibition was fabulous \u2014 the photography, the audio and video, the stories, and the detailed chronology were captivating.",
          "Where do I even begin. This exhibit left me with chills. It's one thing to read stories & see artefacts, but to be listening to audio whilst you look upon the most amazing sculptures that were so lifelike, really flooded us with a whole range of emotions & gave us a very small",
          "Amazing exhibition. Criminal it is being removed soon. Don't miss it - its informative, sobering and so creatively curated.",
          "Do the trench experience, the guided tour [a great overview], then allow a couple of hours to spend absorbing more of the experience. The trench experience was a highlight with a brilliant blend of raw kiwi humour, sounds and smells to make the experience more real, and a sense",
          "Wow! What an amazing exhibition. We did a guided tour and the trench experience. Our guide was fantastic and I believe we got so much more from the exhibition by doing a guided tour. You are able to go back through the exhibition at the end of the tour if you want to take a",
          "A very well presented display of the hardship of W.W.1 that so many young people were encouraged to put their lives on the line for their country",
          "Visited this exhibition with my wife- we had already been to the one at Te Papa and this one is similar but with perhaps more details. The only thing against it was the price! Expensive to get in and then even more for the trench experience which we opted out of due to the cost.",
          "Excellent displays of life at he Front etc during World War !. I had previously seen this exhibition when it opened in April 2014 but my daughter hadnt seen it then",
          "Took a guided tour over the long weekend. Rachael was an incredible guide, so knowledgeable, but also very interesting. The main tour was amazing, we last went 4 years ago, but just had to come back before the display closes. Also went through the trench experience, TBH not my",
          "This exhibition is far superior to many equivalents at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. The holograms of the \"troops\" speaking to you as you pass their positions make it far more real, than the static ones at the AWM. It takes you through the narrow tunnels and",
          "Very moving displays with coloured photos done by Sir Peter Jackson. Fantastic guided tour, very informative and moving.",
          "This is a must see exhibit. The detail involved in every display is extraordinary. Although you could never replicate the actual thing, this is the nearest you\u2019ll ever get (hopefully). Make sure you put it on your to-do list.",
          "We were really amazed at the realism of this Exhibition.It makes you think and to an extent,feel some of what these people had to endure. An incredible amount of skill and work involved to create an unbelievable experience.",
          "An excellent exhibit the brings to life some of the ANZAC\u2019s most devastating WWI battles. The expansive \u201cwalk around\u201d diorama of the Battle of Chunuk Bair is worth the entry fee all on its own. The Trench Experience is a superb re-creation of trench warfare on the barren slopes",
          "I thought I was reasonably well educated but this was so informative and interesting! I'm not one for reading too much at museums as I like to do my research before I get there, but it was all engaging. Some exhibits were to scale; they had life sized horses, tanks and even dirt",
          "This exhibition would have to be the best I have ever experienced. The detail and the historical data is so well shown that one is quite moved by the events that took over the world.",
          "This is a carefully reconstructed life in the trenches in WWI. great idea of life at that time and place",
          "I highly recommend the Quinn's Post Trench Tour which is part of the Great War Exhibition. It is a guided tour (costs $20) for 6 people. Tours go every 10 minutes. Great use of technology such as holograms who talk to you. Very sobering the loss of life in WW1.",
          "The exhibition is thoughfully and dramatically constructed. It does give you authentic responses to how it would have felt being in that terrible conflict. I would reccommend this to anyone but be prepared for an experience that will linger.",
          "Being from the UK, the part of New Zealand in the war is not widely taught. The exhibition was very interesting and informative. Plus the model battlefields along the exhibition are very well put together.",
          "What a wonderful exhibition. Very educational, moving, well laid out, very informative. It is an exhibition that allows groups to move around in whatever direction they choose to. The whole set up is amazing - even the exterior.",
          "This is one of the best exhibitions I have seen. We did the general admission and the trenches tour. Very well set out, easy to follow. Amazing displays. And the trenches tour was designed to be what it was actually like with sounds and smells included. Loved it and would highly",
          "Such a fabulous but sobering place to visit. The displays and coloured photos are amazing. Such a credit to Sir Peter Jackson. It is a terrible shame that this exhibit is closing soon as it is very important to NZ history and should be there for all to see, especially the",
          "Fantastic exhibition. Worth seeing for sure, even if you have to wait in queues for 30- minutes or more, it's worth persevering. Very moving experience and so very well put together.",
          "This is a must see.. It is a disgrace that it is to be closed because the building is required for \u201cother purposes \u201c",
          "This was a real surprise. You can book tours online but as we missed that, we toured it ourselves. The displays are amazing. I expected the soldiers to move any moment. The stories and the presentation of the dreadful experiences were so well done. Very educational. Allow about",
          "Love history and technology? Go and see how Sir Peter Jackson put those together to give you a real Trench experience! You won't regret it \ud83d\ude09",
          "I went to see this with a friend who was down from Whangarei. It was really good. A wonderful walk through war history. I particularly liked the diarama and spent a lot of time trying to find the names of relatives in the lists. Thoroughly recommend.",
          "This was my second visit in two years and I still found it fascinating. The exhibits are amazing especially the Chunuk Bair display. The coloured photos really give you a greater understanding in to the campaign.",
          "Had an amazing visit here as I was there when our vets from vietnam were visiting. Weta studios made some awesome models to depict the era.",
          "A wonderful place. Full of reality of being there. Boards full of names and regiments of those that did not return. To see some of the forefathers mentioned was amazing. The fine detail in all the exhibts, couldnt ask for more.",
          "Complimented the Weta workshop display at Te Papa. Recommend doing the trench experience \u2013 amazing use of technology.",
          "The staff at the front desk were really helpful and put our luggage aside while we were at the exhibition. The displays were fantastic and really informative. I learnt a lot of history leading up to the war and during the war that I didn't prior know. Book the Trench Experience",
          "A must see exhibition Designed by Peter Jackson of Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movie fame and his team Most lifelike images showing the ravages of war . It should have been the war to end all wars but sadly no Exhibition closing soon",
          "The personal stories included in the exhibition really brings the history to life. You cant help but walk away with a more personal understanding of the scale of WW1 and the great losses suffered by the whole world.",
          "Well laid out a good combination of models, photos and real exhibits. Bought home what these men endured.",
          "This is an extremely well put together exhibition of how it was for the ANZAC troops duing WW1. The trenches tour is a sobering demonstration of the plight that such warfare created - it's a 'no holds barred' exposure that will stay with you forever. Given the proximity of the",
          "This excellent exhibit was created to commemorate the centenary of World War I. It has three parts. The first is a look at the war from its causes to its legacy. Different aspects of the war are highlighted. Then there is a model of Gallipoli with colourised photos of the",
          "Every New Zealander should visit this. It's worth partying for the guided tour and the Trench Tour and then going back through the exhibit at your own pace. Brilliantly done.",
          "This is one of the most informative and well presented exhibitions to spend some time looking at, alot of history to learn about.",
          "Visit this display before it closes. It is a unique presentation, warts and all, of New Zealanders, mainly for us.",
          "We did the combo tour, which gives access to a guided tour of the exhibition and the trenches. Impressive experiential expedition, which gives an on depth impression mainly of the Gallipoli events in the first world war. It is very well made, respectful (while not hiding any of",
          "It\u2019s clear to me they money has become a driver for this. While the exhibition is great there is very little information in some rooms, my assumption being they want you to sign up for the guided tour. Having taken a guided tour in the past I can say it really does enhance the",
          "I was amazed at the sheer scale of death, I had no idea...this exhibit is confronting, emotional and a must see.",
          "Have been twice - last weekend went again to see/experience the tunnel experience. You go through in small timed entries with a guide - a top attraction",
          "Don't miss this exhibition which is due to close in early December. The level of detail is amazing and the exhibition is organised in such a realistic way it's impossible not to be impressed. Impressed by the brains behind the exhibition and impressed at the fortitude and",
          "A very interesting but somber experience about NZ 's role in the Gallipolli campaign and other aspects of WW 1. Fantastic interactive displays, incredible photos from then and there are several large dioramas & models created by Weta Studios which are incredibly detailed.",
          "Wonderful opportunity to see The Great War Exhibition before it is taken apart and lost forever. The 'trench experience' brought it all to,life.",
          "You should definitely try to see it before it closes at the start of December (such a travesty). Such a sensitively handled portrayal of this dark chapter of human history. So much tragedy, and yet they brought out the right amount of human interest and humour amidst the",
          "You can be told War stories but nothing will put it into perspective like The Great War Exhibition tunnel experience. It is so authentic from the sights, sounds and even the smells. If only the exhibition dates could be extended beyond December 2018. Well and truely worth the",
          "We decided on the spur of the moment we would go and see this exhibition and so glad we did. It tells the story with words, life-sized models, and a video. It is well laid out and easy to follow. I believe this exhibition is going to be taken down at some stage which is such a",
          "We have been to quite a few exhibits and War Memorial, as well as studying WW1 and WW2 at university. Despite, this the exhibition brought the human experiences of Gallipoli alive for us again. I believe the oversized human sculptures made by WETA Workshop and their story on",
          "Fantastic place, a real gem to learn about history. Great for teenagers to learn more and develop a better understanding on New Zealand history . Really enjoyed our visit will definitely go again as so much to see and learn.",
          "Go see this before it closes we did the guided tour which was really worthwhile and the Quinn\u2019s trench was amazing.",
          "So much to see and learn. The human sculptures are unbelievable. So lifelike. Spent a long time just sitting, looking and listening. Fabulous visit for anyone and everyone. Wish I could go again.",
          "Wow what an amazing experience! The entire exhibition was absorbing and provided an insight into our young and brave troops. The trenches tour is an absolute must do ... incredible realism of what was endured .. clever imagery, dialogue, smell and sound effects. Came away from",
          "The exhibit is well constructed, it creates engagement by using larger than life models, creating a connection with individuals who participated in the great war and presenting information in a variety of formats. Plenty of children looked engaged while they were walking",
          "The immediate reality of battle leaps in front of you once you step into the mock scenes recreated by talented folks at Weta Workshops and others. It doesn't take long to realize how quickly life is in the balance as soldiers were under continuous duress in the struggle to",
          "With a spare couple of hours ( I could have stayed longer) I called at the Exhibit. NZD15 to enter I felt a bit steep for what was presented. Another emersive exhibit in the same space was additional and I did not go for that - just didnt want to spend more money. It is about to",
          "This is an incredible exhibition.So life like.We bought the combo and it was worth every dollar spent.The tour guide was informative.The trench experience beyond description.We walked through the exhibition a second time to take it all in again.The ladies at admission were super",
          "Very interesting I would recommend seeing this Exhibition alongside TePapa. $15 entry fee isn\u2019t to expensive. A great insight into how many men were killed and the scale of how and what they had to endure was amazing.",
          "Visited a couple of years back, but didn't have much time to spend looking at the photo exhibition, so a dreary Saturday was the perfect opportunity to visit again. As with the first visit, we chose to do a tour as well as the Quinn's Post Trench, a newer part of the exhibition",
          "Had been to the Weta cave earlier and found out that the figures and props were made by them so it made a nice link. The content was very informative with a good range if sources. Very thought provoking. Our teenage sons were enthralled.",
          "We visited this exhibition last weekend and were totally surprised just how great it is. It was well beyond our expectations. Thoroughly recommend doing the tour. Time did not permit us to do an additional tour of the trenches but can do that on our next visit. Friends have told",
          "This was a spectacular way to explain what happened to thousands of New Zealanders, Australians. British soldiers, nurses during the attack at Anzac. It used gigantic models to reiinact scenes that had been described in letters sent back by individual soldiers and nurses. It was",
          "This is an amazing insight into WW1 history so well done and thought out. Don't rush this interesting exhibit.",
          "You could easily spend an hour in this exhibit. The larger than life 3-D sculptures of the sights and sounds of war. They were done in great detail and you could not but be impressed with them. There was a lot of information to take in and learned a lot.",
          "An emotional visit: NZ never was directly involved in a war but sacrificed so many sons to foreign wars. Unfortunately only WWI and Gallipoli were on exhibition - many other conflicts with NZ Troops not mentionned.",
          "The walk through time and finding out what was behind the start of the WW1 and how it developed was very interesting and well put together. The large model of Gallipoli gives a great visual representation.",
          "Everyone in New Zealand was touched by the impact of World War One - many have direct linkage to the hellhole that was Gallipoli. Sir Peter Jackson's GREAT WAR EXHIBITION (in the Dominion Museum Building) provides us the tiniest taste of that diabolical debacle.",
          "Just inside the \"door\" we pushed past a \"guided tour\" group. The high pitch of the guide's voice affected us and we were glad to \"escape\". Every exhibit was well described by the notices hence we could not see the need for a \"tour\"",
          "We enjoyed the tour, so informative, 40 mins long and buggy friendly. We then took turns in the trench while the other enjoyed a coffee with the pram.",
          "Go and see this while you have the chance. I took my elderly father and the exhibition was interesting and accessible for us. The attention to detail and the way it's set up makes it more interesting then the usual war exhibition. Only downside was parking was quite expensive",
          "I thought almost two hours would be enough to see everything, but sadly not. I invested in a tour of the exhibition and the trenches (you can do one or the other), the exhibition tour was interesting whereas the trench tour wasn't worthwhile (there were trenches, but then a lot",
          "Brilliant. See if you can spot William Malone in the montage, note his name the day he fell then find the date his RSM also fell on the battlefield. The experience in the trenches is superb. Thank you Sir Peter Jackson for this wonderful tribute to our heroes",
          "Very life like and educational. Well worth a good long visit. Even the children are fascinated. A great way to learn about the great War.",
          "There are so many aspects of the horrors of war that we all should see this exhibition and learn from it. The Trenches, a separate part of the exhibition which is not for young children, is exceptional.",
          "Firstly , make sure you have at least two hours, we didn\u2019t get through it all, but most of it in an hour and a half. There is a lot of amazing detail and it takes time to read each exhibits information and take it all in. It\u2019s quite confronting but in a good way that really",
          "Sir Peter Jackson's exhibition is huge - impressive - sprawling - detailed... but it's not engaging. A guide told us that one of the 3D fully-realised characters was the 'hero' of the story and that we'd meet him again as an old man with his grandson looking back at the war",
          "Sobering and thought provoking... amazing detail to the displays... I visited with 4 different groups with work, and each time saw a different detail. Make the time, and take the time to explore",
          "Reading the stories and seeing the figures and hearing it all out together gave the experience a whole new layer. You feel immersed in the story.",
          "A very realistic and sobering exhibition featuring all aspects of World War One. This exhibition is closing near the end of 2018. We can highly recommend The Great War Exhibition.",
          "This is a wonderful place for the youth of today to see what their forefathers and foremothers went through to keep our countries safe from war. A very emotional place and the stories told were amazing.",
          "I am coming around to the view that no nation does museums quite like NZ. There is a sense of pride that oozes from every pore is this exhibition. The subject matter is poignant and cataclysmic at the same time. So many fotos that have been colourised seemingly making the",
          "Second visit and loved it just as much. Shame it\u2019s closing up. Should be permanent NZ tourist feature!!",
          "We really enjoyed our visit and the trenches experience, very informative and interesting. If you are interested in history this is a must visit.",
          "Sooo large and so detailed. Both those things combined makes for hugely impressive sculptures. Just for the quality of the sculptures it is worth visiting. Wondering through the exhibition you can\u2019t help but feel for the soldiers.",
          "Free to enter - we didn\u2019t have to queue - an excellent & thought provoking exhibition but I think it would probably be too much for younger children",
          "Unfortunately we had just been to Te papa so this exhibition didn't seem so good. Suggest going to this one first",
          "Peter Jackson at his best only life sized really amazing life like reconstructions of war scenes, really worth the effort to visit",
          "I have no other words to describe this. Out of a 2 week trip around the North Island, this was the most amazing thing we did. We love museums, but this was in a class of its own. You feel like you are there going through what the soldiers went through. Do yourself a favour and",
          "Get here before they take it away (isn't supposed to last much longer but let's hope the Govt buys the place). You need to book for the Trench Experience and I'm told the wait can get to several hours - but it is worth the $20 and the wait. The tour is guided in very small",
          "Booked and did the Guided Tours of the Museum & The Trenches. It was just staggering as to how much detail Peter Jackson has put into this Exhibition. We then went into the Trenches. This is an absolute eye opener, we have travelled to a lot of Museums, and War Museums in",
          "Very good exhibition. Well presented and full of detail. Really took you back to the terrible times of the Great War. Lots of pictures and artefacts from the day. The trenches trip was pretty good with holograms of troops that described their situation and realistic gun and bomb",
          "A must see . I had no idea what a treasure this is . Highlight of our Wellington trip , and advised other family that if they\u2019re here consider putting at the top of the list . Another level in terms of presentation Don\u2019t miss this!!!! Recommend the tour before and the trench",
          "NZ should be very proud of our contribution during all wars and this exhibition details our involvement in World War 1 brilliantly, our children have now experienced first hand why this topic is so important at School and in general. Me and my wife were very impressed and so",
          "Recommend everyone visits this. Was absolutely wonderful. Trenches experience was unbelievable. Was the first time I saw great Uncle Maxwells name on a Gallipoli wall. Extremely well done. Lots of care and thought. Thank you!",
          "A well constructed exhibit the caters for all. Great visuals accompanied by informative but short briefs. Great photos and a huge model diorama of Gallipoli. The exhibit is well worth the visit and money. See The Great War and Gallipoli exhibit.",
          "Absolutely amazing exhibition speechless. Get there early and allow enough time. Lines grow very quickly. The detail is astounding",
          "This exhibition is very well put together and well worth a visit. It was an emotional journey in the footsteps of a few soldiers and I would highly recommend visiting.",
          "This exhibition is a must for those interested in the privations of the Gallipoli campaign in WW1. The 'underground' section is particularly well presented. You are 'guided' through this section by a guide - who doesn't say much - in small groups - no more than 6 - through",
          "This place is sensational. Very lifelike which makes a sobering memorable experience. Well worth a visit. I have gone twice and I would go again as each time you hear a new story from a real soldier.",
          "Very interesting if you like history. Nice that the Maori involvement was well presented. There were some activities as well. The large scale models created by the Weta studios are amazing, right down to the hair on the skin. The rest of the Museum was very interesting too.",
          "Amazing exhibition that is well worth the visit ... so much to learn from the past in a dynamic and interesting way",
          "We had big expectations given the marketing that preceded our visit and the reputation that Peter Jackson has. We were not disappointed. It was amazing absolutely amazing. It far exceeded my expectations and was in such great detail. We spent nearly 3 hours at the exhibit",
          "A must place to visit. Nicely presented without overdoing. The wax figures depicting action of war is superb. I would say it is done better than Madam Tusaud wax museum. One can feel the tension and the rage of war personnel at the war front as well as the sadness.",
          "The holographic tour of the Trenches is a must. Soldiers talk to you and look at you. Total immersion. If you're a Peter Jackson fan, this is the place to be.",
          "Another most fantastic exhibition and a must see. Not only do you get to experience it in detail but you get to understand the forces behind it as well as the engagement of New Zealand in the wars. Don\u2019t miss out on the trenches tour as well. Relive the experience and be proud",
          "We spent a good amount of time in this exhibition, lots of facts, photos etc. Especially liked the entrance, walking into a street.",
          "Amazing type of art! The statues look so realistic with much details that really attracts your attention.",
          "Very real WW1 exhibition from Sir Peter Jackson (LOTR). 2 hour plus visit, lot of history and life size models. Very educational and interesting. This is one of two WW1 exhibitions in Wellington currently - the other a smaller one but very real at Te Papa (free).",
          "We took our grandchildren here, aged 2 and 4 and they loved it! Well worth the visit. Great way to introduce history to them and enough of interest to keep them occupied. The scenes are very real and created lots of discussions and questions. We will return without the children",
          "Taking the guided tour option through the exhibition is a worthwhile option as the knowledgeable guide adds so much to the exhibits. Organised chronologically through each year of the war from 1914 to 1918, the exhibition highlights the sacrifices of the troops and the terrible",
          "This was the sole reason for my Trip to Wellington, and it was every bit as impressive as I had hoped. Took my grandmother and we were so impressed. What an experience!!",
          "We visited here on a Saturday afternoon thinking it would be an interesting hour's \"quick walk through \". How wrong we were! The level of detail and the sheer size and range of the exhibits was incredible. You could easily spend a whole day here. We have visited internationally",
          "This is a fabulous display and well worth seeing. The detail of all the exhibits is enthralling. You can get the feeling of the actual environment.",
          "If you are visiting Wellington, this is a must do. Sir Peter Jackson and his team did an incredible job putting this together. If you have time, you can really enjoy strolling through an amazing and very educational journey of WW1, the stories and visual effects really are",
          "Brilliant, very well done, would love to revisit without the kids so I could pay more attention however throughly enjoyed the journey through this exhibition.",
          "One of the best WW1 displays and descriptions I've ever seen. Excellent. The Gallipoli photos in color were fantastic. The trench was worth doing. It took right at 2 hours to do the whole thing.",
          "Definitely worth checking out. We paid extra and had the guided tour and it was well worth it. Definitely try and be done by 5:00pm and you'll get to listen to the last post outside.",
          "This exhibition is a must-see for New Zealanders. The large sculptures of soldiers are incredible. Be prepared for an emotional experience.",
          "This was one of the highlights of our visit to Wellington. We had a guided tour through the Exhibition, and then a guided tour through the trenches. You have to do the trenches tour, so realistic and thought provoking, with dashes of humour.",
          "Give yourself plenty of time to have a good look around. this was a very moving experience. Was reasonably priced entry.",
          "We visited at 4.30 so we explored the lovely gardens and sculptures outside to the beautiful sounds of the bells of the Carillion, then at 5pm we heard the Last Post, and the We Shall Remember Them poem and saw the flags being lowered at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Very",
          "The Great War Exhibition brings home in graphic detail the reality of war. While focusing on the Great War (WWI), including the Gallipoli Campaign the use of photographs, individual accounts and the compelling graphics and props, is something for any person of any age to see",
          "Its definitely worth the money to do the trench experience. The guide was friendly and informative and the whole thing is just so well done! We took our 10yr old and almost 8yr old and they did fine They both thoroughly enjoyed it and it was a great learning experience for them.",
          "These kind of tours and exhibitions can be very variable in quality. Not so with this one. A huge amount of detail from Weta Workshop and Peter Jackson. Very much worth the effort, and the small fee for a guided tour from a well trained and presented group of guides. Highly",
          "One of our main reasons to visit Wellington and this exhibit did not disappoint.so much more than we expected. The displays are so realalistic The colourisation of the photos is amazing and adds to the view into the horror of the WW1 and battle at Gallipoli. The add on trench",
          "Visited the trenches tour and it is so worth the visit. Recommend this exhibit. You walk through the trenches and tunnels. Very well set out, informative",
          "I had not realised how good the exhibition was going to be when I arrived! It is well worth the money that you pay for entrance. This is created by Peter Jackson with assistance from Weta. There are amazing dioramas and coloured photographs to help you envisage life during the",
          "The great thing about this exhibition is that it captures the hardships and wretchedness of war in a way which definitely commemorates the conflict without glorifying it.",
          "Thoroughly interesting exhibit and recommend doing the guided tour and trench experience combo. Allow a couple of hours here at least. The trench experience is very well done.",
          "I have been to a couple of different exhibitions relating to World War 1 but this is by far the best. The life like characters and the graphic information was fantastic.",
          "Suggest you book in advance for the trench as it's very popular and well worth doing. Yet more great Peter Jackson work at play throughout the exhibition. Great photographs from the war displayed throughout. Allow at least 2 hours, if not 3 to do it justice.",
          "This display really sets the scene of the horrors of WW1 and the ANZAC experience. The attention to detail is incredible an absolute credit to the technical & artistic capacity of those who created this work. Combined with the National War Memorial this is a must visit in",
          "A group of 10 visited the museum and wandered at our leisure. I found the layout of the background to World War I fascinating, with the interrelations of the royal families of Germany, UK and Russia set out and the three weeks between leading up to the war showing various",
          "It will be a shame if this exhibition doesn't stay here permanently. The main exhibition is excellent but the trench experience on another level...really brought it to life. My grandfather was at Quinn's Post and the trench experience really echoes what he wrote. This experience",
          "The World War I display is well done but not complete. It needs a more detailed story about the War and Gallipoli. The wax figures actually look real! They should have included more about the affect the War had on the families that sacrificed for the War effort back home. Enjoy!",
          "Did the trench experience which was extremely well done. Plus the colourisation of all the old photos made them amazing and for some reason more realistic. Great value for money compared to other tourist options.",
          "We had already seem the Great War Exhibition - which is very good - but this visit just went for the trench experience. The trench experience is definitely worth paying for - you become a visitor to Quinn's Post - and experience the sights, sounds, and smells of life in",
          "Recently had the privilege of visiting this exhibition and am in awe of the detail of the while exhibit, total respect for our ANZAC brothers that went thru hell for both of our countries so that we can live the way we do",
          "Amazing. This exibition is incredible. Attention to detail was superb and a stark reminder of what the Anzac sacrificed for all of us. The reality of it chilled me to the bone but reinforced how grateful we should always be. Lest We Forget.",
          "This is an absolute must. You do need to book in advance at peak times and the combo ticket at $40 fir the entrance tour and trench is well worth it. You can turn up but you may have to wait or not get entry at peak times especially to the trench. The tour was excellent",
          "We only had a little time and paid to enter the World War 1 display, as well as go through the 'Trench Experience'. The trench experience was well done with loads of high tech creativity. It's a booked event, with a limit of 6 people per 'trip', and it takes about 15 minutes.",
          "Excellent history of WW1 from its origins through to the allied victory. The combination of artifacts, models and maps was quite brilliant. A must for everyone.",
          "Wow!!! We have wanted to see this for some time and finally did it and not disappointed at all. In fact it is so much better than we imagined. We paid the extra and did the Trench tour. $20 each and words cannot do it justice. You simply have to do it. Such reality - NZ is so",
          "This exhibit is extremely well done and so interesting. We learned so much about WWI. It took us almost 2 hours and still we did not have enough time. It is not to be missed.",
          "You must devote time to get the best out of this exhibition. The oversized statues of real people involved in the event and their stories are brilliantly presented and the honest representation of the brutality of war reaches out to the viewer. There is a red poppy tribute area",
          "There is a separate tour of the trenches that has to be booked. These tours are for up to approx 8 people with a guide. It was magnificently presented. A worthwhile visit, highly recommended",
          "This exhibition is really informative and a must see - allow plenty of time. The Gallipoli section is wonderful with amazing photographs which are a must see. The new Quinn's Post trench experience (only opened two weeks ago) is a must see. Peter Jackson at his best. You",
          "Supposed to be the War to end all Wars. Highly recommend to visit this exhibition. The detail, the weaponry, the work, to produce the life size characters you could almost imagine coming to life,after hours. (nod to the movie \"Night at the Museum\") For this exhibit we paid",
          "Do not miss this terrific exhibition in one of New Zealand's treasure city. The history displayed here is magnificent",
          "Really good, I would recommend this to anyone. Great outsize mannequins on display. Grat for all the family",
          "Peter Jackson War display is overwhelming and creative, really enjoy the tour and the war tunnel experience. Worth the money, and surly will visit again.",
          "I'd heard this exhibition was worth visiting but still I was very impressed. This is an absolute must-see for visitors to Wellington with an interest in the history of WW1. Absolutely fascinating and exceptionally well presented. I needed more time there and would not rule out",
          "Loved it, what a trip and Peter Jackson at his best. Very moving, authentic and very well presented Our guide was superb, thoroughly enjoyed this and high,y recommended",
          "Very detailed and interesting. Personal accounts from those involved. Leaves you feeling moved and shows the futility of war. Well worth visiting, but leave plenty of time.",
          "This is a truly incredible Exhibition. We did the guided tour and then walked through again at our leisure. This Exhibition should be retained permanently!",
          "On the tour of the Great War Exhibition itself the visitor starts in a replica of a Belgium village the country where so much of the fighting took place. David, our guide, locates the origins of the Great War in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 which saw Germany defat France,",
          "Spent hours in here taking all the detail in. Very interesting and the displays were outstanding. Highly recommend. A must visit.",
          "This has to be a bucket list visit, you have to see it to believe it, so life like. I can not believe how real it all look. It\u2019s so interesting to hear about the war and how life was like.",
          "Allow 2-3 hours depending on how quickly you read! There is a lot to absorb and it was really interesting.",
          "So worth while and the trench visit a must, worth the additional charge. The whole exhibition has been put together in such a way as to hold your attention throughout. Only drawback is that it is difficult to read and assimilate all the information in a single hit. Would be good",
          "Fantastic exhibition. Good to have Kiwi take on Gallipoli. Great job on all the exhibits. The new Trenches exhibition is a must see.",
          "Spent Sunday afternoon here -paid the extra and did the trench experience which was so worth it -highly recommend this. We spent nearly 4 hours here and didn't read everything ! It is a must see . We have been to the Te Papa Gallipoli exhibition and that too was great -almost",
          "The moment I arrived in Wellington I wanted to see this, I knew it wasn't a free exhibition but for $15 (not including the trench experience) I thought the price was right. When you first walk in you are greeted by a French style street, it's quite amazing how realistic it is,",
          "This is a very well presented display providing a great deal of information about the reasons for going to war, the progress of the war and the development of warfare. The new trench exhibit is to the same high standard as the rest of the exhibits.",
          "The Quinn\u2019s Post WW1 Trench Experience at the The Great War Exhibition is excellent. It was very impressive in its details and realism. We did the combo which is entry, tour, & trench experience, which is good value for money. It is great to have such a world class exhibition",
          "Touching experience we paid for a tour and trench experience which were really enjoyable, highly recommend it. But part of me kinda thinks maybe it\u2019s a little overpriced and it\u2019s an experience you would hope most people would get the chance to do... not at $40 each",
          "We are passionate about history and this exhibition has definitely quenched our thirst for knowledge about Anzac forces and their time during World War One. A realistic trench experience is a must do when visiting! Not free but worth it!",
          "beautiful and striking is definitely worth the visit loots of pic and interactive things for the kids",
          "There's enough reading material to do this one yourself but we chose to do the guided tour. Rachel was very knowledgeable and spoke well about the topics the tour covered. The tour was about 45 minutes and well worth the money. The exhibit itself is outstanding. Sir Peter",
          "Amazing exhibition, so much thought and effort put into the exhibits! the gisnt size models were over the top and so detailed!",
          "This exhibition is well presented with many great artefacts on display and interesting information boards.",
          "This is amazing and everyone with an opportunity should visit this enlightened but solemn experience.",
          "I can't believe I had doubts about going to this exhibition because I thought it would be boring. Excellent displays and very informative guided tour (more expensive but worth it). We did the guided tour and we were then left to retrace our steps at our leisure. The displays",
          "Bringing it home Peter Jackson style. Simply breath taking and respectful. If this doesn\u2019t bring a tear nothing will.",
          "What a poignant exhibition very well documented. We spent over an hour walk around this well present exhibition. It now has a women's view of the Great War to the left before you go up the steps to the main exhibition",
          "Very real looking displays. Great explanations and loved the decorations. It had village streets and felt like you were coming off the ship to exit.",
          "WW1 tribute to all those who fought and died in 1914-1918 by Peter Jackson is a must see to all that are visiting Wellington. I was a short walk and once you entre is is a very sombre place to remember the falling.",
          "Hard to imagine the base levels of deprivation and suffering. This is an excellent exhibition. The LifeSize figure in the early stag3s of the presentation are frightened alive and therefore almost real!",
          "This museum/exhibition is an amazing journey through the history and agony of WW1. I learned more about WW1 (as well as New Zealand\u2019s participation and sacrifices) than I have found anywhere! I highly recommend spending a couple of hours visiting, viewing, reading, absorbing",
          "Every bit as good if not better than the Te Papa exhibit. Well laid out and explained. We did our own walk around. Very good background information giving the lead up to war. Worth the money. No far to walk from the central city.",
          "The War Memorial Park is an emotional site and the Great War Exhibition is in a spectacular old building. The whole exhibition is very interesting but do pay the extra for a guided tour. Not all of the exhibits are well labeled. The artifacts are fascinating and from Peter",
          "This museum was our favorite in New Zealand. For native Americans who learned all we know about World War I in public school, this museum greatly broadened our knowledge. I went through it twice just to make sure I didn't miss anything. Highly recommended, and it can be done in",
          "We took the guided tour of the Peter Jackson exhibition. The guide was informative about the First World War and it was pitched at those with little knowledge and avoided giving a graphic description so was suitable for young and old. The exhibition has more than is at Te Papa",
          "Well worth a visit, brings things to life very interesting and informative, well presented, give a go.",
          "Great exhibition. Very well thought out. The pictures in colour and not black &white really bring it to life. Lots of facts and figures as well as the history of how the Great War unfolded. It is definitely worth several hours.",
          "This is a thorough presentation of the facts of all aspects of WWI. Everyone should go and they will certainly learn something new. We came from Sydney and Chicago to get a closer feel for what our NZ grand fathers had been through in Gallipoli and the Somme, and what it was",
          "Very cleaver and interactive. Best I\u2019ve ever seen and the large figures super sized and amazing! Highly recommend!",
          "Sophie was an amazing guide, so much knowledge and really made the tour enjoyable. Couldn't imagine doing this without a guide. Absolutely recommend the exhibition/museum and tour. There's a 5pm remembrance ceremony (under 10 mins) at the museum for the unknown warrior which I'm",
          "The detail was very real. Very solemn at times but a great experience. I would recommend this to anyone.",
          "Admiring the sculptures share and the story line shown on the back screen of each display. Very detailed and nicely done. Love the details and appreciate the effort to maintain this.",
          "We took a guide for this exhibition and she was well worth the little extra cost. I was worried 12 year old grandson would be bored with such a lot of detail, but he wasn't and rated this experience higher than Te Papas Gallipolli. He asked questions and we stayed quite a while.",
          "This exhibition was amazing, the detail to history, exhibits were second to none and the tour guide was excellent",
          "I enjoyed my trip to the Great War Exhibition, but less so than my previous day's visit to Te Papa. If you have time for both; the war exhibition is certainly worth seeing. But if you're pressed for time and had to choose just one, I would definitely choose Te Papa (which also",
          "Was made aware of The Great War Exhibition at the War Memorial in Wellington by our driver from the Weta tour. What an unexpected surprise! It\u2019s an amazing exhibit developed by Peter Jackson at the Weta team. A very well done and curated exhibit dedicated to the First World War.",
          "What an amazing exhibition. We attended with Mr 10 and Miss 12 and the both loved it and asked to go back twice more. They asked so many questions- it really got them thinking. Nobody should miss this exhibition- it\u2019s fantastic.",
          "one of the things to do when arriving on a cruise ship on a typical windy day.the war figures were so lifelike,the audio great.",
          "Have visited many exhibitions of WWI in many cities but this one is probably the best. Walking in to a typical town in Belgium and then exploring through the years of the war through life size and miniature models as well as cut outs in the floor to show what the trenches looked",
          "I have seen many exhibitions and have a good background knowledge of the war. This exhibition was amazing in the detailed explanation of all aspects of the campaign, particularly the map showing the procession of the Gallipoli campaign. It is so easy to criticise poor decision",
          "This is well worth a visit for people of all ages. The models and explanations are fantastic and it gives a really good feel of what the War was like. To be recommended.",
          "I booked a tour to hear first hand some of the history and stories behind the exhibition. Having a grandfather who served at Gallipoli in 1915, got wounded and 18 months later his troopship was torpedo en route to Palestine where he got wounded a second time proved to be a",
          "Hi I've been all over the world to Gallipoli and other places but nowhere is there an explanation for the cause of world war 1 like this. The beauty and horror of colour photos changes perspective completely and the simplicity of the explanations at every turn makes",
          "Sir Peter Jackson has produced something that more than matches what he produced at Te Papa, (which also should not to be missed), i did not imagine he could exceeded that exhibition, but in my opinon he has. The $15 entry fee controls the numbers so you have the time to",
          "If not the best exhibition, it is fully in details and informations, you can tell as you really were in that war. Is a must do for every one!",
          "So we did the WETA tour and were dissapointed. Maybe because we are from California and have been involved with video and film production, but the skimpy displays and rah rah, but we saw one of the mock ups for the Great War Exphibition. We had already visite the museum, but",
          "two hours went flying by, from the moment we entered and found ourselves in a french village-- just a pity the shops were shut!! --the goods displayed, great cheese and such looked so lifelike. then into the exhibition proper and the next two and a half hours just vanished it",
          "Lots of informaton and hundreds of photos. Incrediably thought provoking and heart breaking. Thank you to all those amazing men that fought for our county.",
          "There's only one for it. AMAZING!!! You HAVE to visit it. The realism is just astounding! it gave me goosebumps!",
          "I have visited this exhibition three times as there is a very extensive visual and written history of the trench war 1914 to 1918 on display. For any one with the slightest interest in modern European war history you should make this an absolute must do. I have been to many",
          "Excellent exhibition to give better understanding of realities of the war, with stunning displays and photos",
          "I learned a massive amount at this exhibit.. including what my grandfather must have gone through while at the front.",
          "What an amazing museum, well done to Peter Jackson and the team! It is truly a wonderful history lesson to all and a must see for all ages.",
          "I took a 20 minute walk from my hotel to the Great War Exhibition, at the top or Tory Street. The exhibition is very well laid out, taking you through the war, year by year. There are statues, replicas of machinery, and plenty of items from the way on display. There is a great",
          "If you are interested in WW1 this display should not be missed. The realism is unbelievable. The models take on lifelike qualities It is a sobering experience but a very real and significant one. Allow at least an hour or longer.",
          "It makes more sense once you realise that most of this is the Great War as seen by Peter Jackson's English father. Which is shame, as the Gallipoli room is worth a visit in its own right",
          "If you are going to Wellington you must go to this. The displays are so moving and well structured. A wonderful reflection of a nations involvement and to those who served. THANKYOU.",
          "In the National Museum, which is free entry, simply not to be missed. Superb graphics and models which bring the place to life. Just do it!!",
          "Anyone visiting Wellington must visit the National War Memorial Park. Rooms and rooms of displays about WWI, the Anzecs against the Turks. Sir Peter Jackson's figures are AMAZING, so realistic. Posters telling men to volunteer to fight are quite interesting. Photos of all the",
          "I came here with my husband and we were advised by the entrance staff to pay for the guided tour. Now usually, this can be a gimmick just to get you to pay more money. But this was money well spent! The exhibition is made by Weta and Peter Jackson and is a wonderful walk",
          "We had already been to the big Te PaPa Museum. This was a perfect fit in provding us a clear explanation of ANZAC and WWI. Well laid out chronologically starting with the three cousins, ruling Germany, England, and Russia. The display ends with an huge 3D display with actual",
          "Do this before you see the Gallipoli section in Te Papa otherwise you might feel disappointed. Lots of models and the photo section was really good. An insight to those who fought and lost their lives. Set in a great old building.",
          "The exhibition is outstanding in its own right, but when you add in the guided tour it is really well done and poignant. I thought I was pretty well versed on WWI, but I got schooled! Really enjoyed it.",
          "Informative for the children. If you have done the Gallipoli experience at Te Papa, you will be disappointed by this. If you haven't, do this first. A basic intro to the war, the Gallipoli part is the biggest part and it's outside the exhibit? The biggest achievement by the NZ",
          "This blew us away with the amazing details. It helped us gain a better understanding of the Great War as well as the fighting in Gallipoli.",
          "Life like figures amazing, so much detail and to hear their storiescwas mind blowing. A great insight to what NZ men and women went through. Highly recommend.",
          "Entry quite expensive but the exhibits are awesome, lifesize and well supported with detailed explanations of the NZ support in the war. Highly recommend this.",
          "We saw the exhibition at the Dominion Museum Building, not at Te Papa. We had a guided tour of the portion of the exhibit that summarized the causes and stages of the war. It was brilliantly presented, both by the exhibition and by the guide. The collection of artifacts is",
          "We stayed in Wellington and this was one of thhighlights for me, very informative tour and my boys (10 + 6) both enjoyed the dispalys and getting to know more about what happened in the past.",
          "I went last year, could not believe how good this exhibition is. World class, so good I got tearful!",
          "$15 enterance or $25 including the tour. Take the tour. I learnt so much more about WW1 and our tour guide added so much extra that was not on the walls to read. The tour was 45 minutes and then we went back in to revisit and take photos. The models are again fantastic. You need",
          "This is a must see at the museum. Very emotional, but gives you a realistic glimpse into the horrors of the wars. The exhibit is done to a very high standard. Very educational. I highly recommend everyone to visit the exhibit. Probably best to see it at a quiet time as weekends",
          "This exhibition was amazing! The amount of detail and reconstruction of the battles and timeline of the lead up to the Great War are mind-blowing. I just hope humanity learns the lessons from these terrible times and actions.",
          "Opted for a guided tour at a small cost. Must say it was worth it as it brought much of the exhibits to life. Plenty to see and some superb exhibits from lifelike soldiers to tanks, weapons and battlefield displays. Some with a live electronic display of troop movements with a",
          "Wished I could stay longer. It was thought provoking and emotional. Wish I had gone sooner. Glad I did not miss it. Really well done. One of the best exhibitions I have ever seen at te papa",
          "We opted for the guided tour and found Marcel most knowledgeable. The Great War exhibition is heart-wrenching and thought provoking. Peter Jackson\u2019s team have done a marvellous job of restoring, colouring and bringing to life the old black & white photographs taken by soldiers",
          "This was my second visit to the The Great War Exhibition and I find the whole display fascinating but at the same time tragic. The whole display is fantastic the commentary and artefacts so insightful. You also have a sense of pride of how resourceful the soldiers were to face",
          "The best war exhibit ever seen - well worth a visit. Amazing and a Must do in Wellington! So vivid and hearing to the stories, reading the letters, makes you realize what they all went through back then. Take a few hours and go around the whole museum as it is worth it.",
          "Experiencing this exhibition is a must for all Kiwi's interested in their history and for visitors who will be shown what the New Zealander's contributed to the First World War. A well laid out exhibition and very informative with great models and displays.",
          "Cheap at the price to see many of Sir Peter Jackson's collection of WW1 memorabilia. An educational visit.",
          "This is an amazing exhibition. The detail, the setting, the music, the mannequins, all of it is brilliantly done. As a UK citizen, its fascinating to see how The Great War impacted on another side of the world. What we learnt in school is heavily biased to British history",
          "We did a guided tour with Marcel, and it was very informative. We were free to go back around on our own after. The exhibit at the end on Australia and NZ soldiers at Gallipoli was fantastic with many photos and details. Highly recommend.",
          "A stunning display exceptionally well done and focused on those that served more so than the events which makes for a more engaging exhibition",
          "Taking the visitor beyond Gallipoli, this excellent exhibit allows the visitor to really immerse themselves into many aspects of the 'Great War', with life size exhibits that draw you in to the horror, and models to show the scale of the battle. There are little surprises in",
          "Very affecting. And it is free. This exhibition is very highly recommended. I took my 10-year old, great source of discussion about war and it's consequences for society.",
          "In my view this was even better than the one at Te Papa, so that says how good it was. Well done. The story was well told. The tours were great value and the attention to detail was spectacular.",
          "Once again peter Jackson has outdone himself. This exhibit is well worth seeing as it is presented in such a way that you can clearly comprehend what happened. Kids of all ages were there and seemed to enjoy it. I know my two did.",
          "This is one of (if not THE) most impressive exhibition that I\u2019ve ever went to. It is so well made and gives you a whole new perspective. Visit it if you have the chance!",
          "Was very moving & realistic & felt like it gave you an inkling of the inside experience of what these heroes had to go through. Would highly recommend",
          "G and I went to this exhibition thinking that it would be similar to the others. We were so wrong! No doubt having the input from Sir Peter Jackson has made the exhibition visually superb. The detail was very informative, but does not overload you with facts. We spent over 2",
          "This exhibition was great. Very realistic looking displays. We took the guided tour, well worth doing.",
          "We absolutely loved this moving exhibition. Was truely an all encompassing experience. Would recommend this to all.",
          "We learned about the participation of New Zealand in world war 1. The models and photos in exhibition were very clear to understand.",
          "This was my second visit to this Exhibition. I visited again as I wanted to know if a photograph with my grandfather was included. It was quite a surprise to see my Grandad staring back at me from a photograph taken of the troop ship by a Chch Press photographer . This is a very",
          "We took our friends from abroad to this superb exhibition, having seen it before ourselves. How thrilled they were. What a fantastic experience, visually, historically and emotionally. This really is a must see.",
          "many hours can be spent here - absolutely incredible, emotional, factual, and rates in my top 10 must do's in Wellington - congratulations to all involved for making this exhibition",
          "This place will blow your mind. The life like exhibits are just awesome. The emotions the exhibits cause are real. This is an absolutely must see when in Wellington.",
          "I really enjoyed this exhibition. I went here with a group of teenagers and we all had a great time. It is good for people of all ages. Whether you are there for the history or the statues you will not be disappointed!",
          "So interesting. Hubby has been doing research on a great uncle from the UK who was killed in Palestine aged 19 and he found it very moving to see the sort of things the soldiers endured. The installations were amazing and the retouched photos incredible.",
          "The great war exhibit was a highlight of visiting Te Papa, Sir Peter Jackson brings to life various New Zealand servicemen and women in this exhibit. The larger than life recreations are extremely authentic and bring a wonderful scale to appreciate finer details of conditions",
          "Outstanding life like figures. Figures and facts all through out this exhibition. Camera are allowed. Take your time to reflect on our past history, you'll come away from this feeling a little sad and sombre.",
          "If you are really enthusiastic about WW1 then you can be absorbed for ages here. Very well done. Probably less interactive for kids past the guided section.",
          "A fantastic exhibition full of lots of information about Gallipoli and how the Anzac troops coped with some horrendous conditions and terrible weather conditions. We found the exhibition really interesting with a lot of personal stories and letters sent from the front the layout",
          "The guided tour is well worthwhile. I learn things I never knew about WWI. The exhibits are so well done and realistic. A brilliant exhibition",
          "WETA studios did all the art work. There larger than life statues that are on display that you could touch, but don't. It is like stepping into the screen at a movie theater. Large but so real. The museum is free so if you have a couple of hours, even if you don't like the 'war'",
          "Wonderful exhibit providing a visually engaging display of what the ANZAC's went through, conditions on the ground, a few individual soldier stories, the female nurse involvement and much more. Major attraction was the hyper-realistic models which were huge, about 4-5m tall if",
          "A great exhibition, loads of interesting information, amazing models and sets. A must see for everyone who comes to Wellington as history comes to life.",
          "Not to be missed. Sir Peter Jackson has contributed a stunning exhibition to the people of New Zealand to honour the soldiers and the horses who served during this long and costly campaign. The displays are lifelike and The colourisation if the photographs brings a sense of",
          "This was a last minute visit which turned out to be fantastic. I don't know much about the great war and this exhibits' format was well designed and draws you right in. We didn't join the tour which allowed me to linger a bit longer on certain pieces without feeling like I'm",
          "We were mesmerized by the so real models that look like 5 times life size.... the detail is amazing down to the hairs on legs/arms. Lots of very interesting commentary and knicks and knacks. We were unlucky to visit whilst there were several school groups so it was very busy /",
          "Well worth it, allow time to read everything. Short film very good. Interesting to see the NZ side if the Great War.",
          "Fantastic larger-than-life displays, loads of information, multi-media station... and free of charge! Can easily spend 2 hours or more slowly reading and watching. So take you time and do not rush through.",
          "The Great War Exibition on the first world war is excellent, very informative and the displays very well done. Recommend .",
          "Well worth a visit if you are in the area and a detour if you are not. Even if you are not a history buff this exhibit is exceptional and very informative",
          "Simply excellent presentation utilising a wide range of display concepts. Extremely informative and interesting exhibition.",
          "We only had a limited time to visit as we parked on a meter a little away from the venu , although we found we could have parked a lot closer. We were very impressed with the Galipoli display the models etc were superb in every detail. We recommended this display to friends.",
          "This was a really well-done exhibit. The amount of work and care that has gone into the displays is just amazing. We took the guided tour which I'd strongly recommend, particularly if you don't know a lot about WW1. The Gallipoli exhibition is outstanding (although we didn't",
          "The Great War exhibition is a brilliant display of one of the most important historical events in human history which brings a lot of awareness to visitors. It is constructed very realistically and has a lot of facts about the war as a whole and a whole separate section about",
          "The Great War Exhibition was an excellent activity. Easy to find with plenty of on site parking. There are options for guided or self guided tours. We spent about 1.5 hours here. The display is divided up by year with a seperate area for Gallipoli. I recommend this for anyone",
          "An exceptional way of remembering the Kiwi brave-hearts and paying due tribute to them. The Museum has done a wondrous job in these displays. The displays, much larger than actual size, look lifelike and real. The skin texture, the hair - and even a fly sitting on an arm - as",
          "Not to be missed, this exhibition, created by Sir Peter Jackson and supported by ANZ is a truly moving account of the time. The National War Memorial Park is also a great asset to our country.",
          "World class exhibition. Highly recommended. Well worth the $15 entry fee. It is different from the Te Papa exhibition.",
          "Apparently this might close in 2018. Hopefully not as it is a tremendous showcase of WW1 through enormous exhibits and incredibly details models. Only a short walk from downtown Wellington.",
          "The grounds are worth exploring also with memorials from multiple countries. Personally I felt the peter Jackson exhibit at te papa was better than his one here. But both are great.",
          "Lived in Welly all my life except the last 30 years and never visited the war memorial or this exhibition. Returning now for a visit Home the exhibition drew me here and it is absolutely fantastic. Peter Jackson\u2019s inspiration come to life through experiential models, exhibited,",
          "This is an interesting exhibition where many of the exhibits and models help the thoughts of what the great war may have been like. The displays are laid out logically. Don't rush your visit as there's lots to see and read and also with some hands-on items. Recommended.",
          "Extremely inciteful and awe inspiring. Give one a very realistic incite into what the soldiers experienced.",
          "This is what happens when Peter Jackson helps you design a museum. Beyond impressive. Could have and should have spent a day here. A must see in Wellington",
          "I visited this exhibition again, after seeing it two years ago when it opened. I was rather disappointed that it hadn't developed as much as initially promised. One thing that was new was the Passchendaele exhibit, small but it told the story really well in a way that made the",
          "I had high expectations of this exhibition but they were exceeded many times. It is just brilliant and if you have any interest at all in WW1 and 20th century history - it is simply not to be missed. The background to the war, the causes, the initial enthusiasm and all that",
          "bigger than life soldiers, giving you the impression you're in the middle of the battlefield. Coming from Belgium (Passchendaele & Ieper), it was a humbling experience.",
          "I visited the exhibition at the National War Memorial yesterday. There are three parts to see: 1. The Western Front - as you would expect from Peter Jackson the exhibition gives a good impression of what life and death were like on the WF. There was a distinct lack of",
          "This was the 2nd war museum visited. The 1st was very visceral and moving, this one is more methodical but intensely documented. The diorama of the field of battle at Gallipoli takes up a very large room. Your vision fills a bit more as you walk around it and see the odds and",
          "Stunning display and very knowledgeable tour guide. Highly recommend you take the tour. You get so much more out of it. And then you really need to go back around the exhibit by yourself. Stand in that Belgian Street. Imagine those poor men giving their lives for poor",
          "I will admit I was sceptical before arriving, however my misgivings were truly misplaced. An exceptional display that honours the New Zealand troops and provides and unparalleled insight into WW1. The entire exhibit is tastefully done and the restoration of the photographs",
          "This is hands down the best War Exhibit I've visited. Real human characters of war were told (several characters) and each character started with a model of the person showing the human cost of war. Resignation and Helplessness, Despair, Desolation, Anger, Defiance, Grief,",
          "This exhibit is really well done, as good as or better than the Te Papa WW1 exhibit. We've been through twice now",
          "Such a good exhibition. We took a guided tour with Jackie who was extremely knowledgeable and gave us a unique museum experience. Wonderful visuals and storytelling.",
          "This is a great exhibition, such detail in the models, all authentic equipment and costumes, but the most amazing part was the photos. Weta workshops have painstakingly researched, restored and colourised old black and white photos and the images are really powerful. The guide",
          "I had the chance to live in the memories of the World war 2, Amazing people amazing Satutues, Could not hold my tears.",
          "An amazing walk through history.. a very well done museum.. very informative and we enjoyed walking around learning more about our history",
          "Complements the fantastic Gallipoli exhibition at Te Papa. Detailed and easy to follow information about WW1. Great exhibits - both real and manufactured.There is also a photographic exhibition and history of the Gallipoli campaign in a separate room.",
          "Certainly one of the most moving, sensitively and beautifully recreated exhibitions on WWl that I have seen. The guided tour was terrific and added immensely to the experience, adding context and meaning. Would love to go back.",
          "We stopped in here to get a different perspective of the wars that are still too familiar in our home country (France). This was a way of seeing what else happened, stories we have not seen or heard. This was what was so pertinent in this exhibition. The exhibition is very",
          "Ian was absolute fantastic. He was so knowledgeable and really brought the stories to life. Exhibition was excellent.",
          "with more history knowledge form my part, it will be more appreciate . You need abolutelu a guide to appreciate. Do not doit by yourself",
          "Masterful exhibition! Very emotional experience for me as a New Zealander. The large models are extremely realistic. Well worth the visit!",
          "Highly recommended - we took the guided tour with David as our guide. A pleasant orator and very knowledgeable on the history of WW1, background, displays etc. Well worth the extra $10 a head for the guided tour. Very humbling and a sad loss of life, but an exhibition well worth",
          "WOW! Don\u2019t miss the guided tour. Learning about the technology, sociology, and strategy of Germany\u2019s siege on Belgium was amazing. Life-size displays,scale models, and stories about the how and why of World War I, and the devastating effects on people and land was incredible.",
          "Wonderful representation. Wouldn't have wanted to miss it. We did Te Papa's Gallipolli on other trips, and I think that was the best way to see both... I loved how this one used life sized models... made it more real in a way, but that's not to detract from the other.",
          "I was awe-struck by this exhibit. The larger than life statues along with the stories of the people they represented really made a deep impression. This exhibition tells the full story of Gallipoli and one cannot help but be moved by the stories and dioramas.",
          "This is a very moving exhibit to the sometime futility of war.The bigger than life size statues must be seen in person to fully appreciate. You follow the battle day by day and are a party to the tragedy of it all. It is emotionally draining but something that I'm glad I was",
          "Waited in line for 45 minutes but worth every moment! The exhibit was amazing! The detail on the statues were unbelievable! It's a great way to learn about the war! A definite must do!",
          "War Memorial / Great War Exhibition This exhibition commemorates the role played by New Zealand in the First World War. There is 2 entry fees, one with a tour and the other do it yourself \ud83d\ude1c",
          "Another 10 out of 10 for Peter Jackson who is a huge world war one buff. Already went to the aviation exhibit in Osaka Blenheim and had a fantastic experience and this is equally as good. Absolutely not to be missed .",
          "Well organised exhibition. Provide so many information about WW1. Exhibition is a worth to go even it will cost $25/person.",
          "Am not a real big fan of war museums, but was with a friend who is really into this stuff. I admit this was by far one of the better ones. Nice displays, excellent quality photographs, and an easy to follow route. Not a real large museum, so I didn\u2019t lose interest. Would",
          "I was moved to tears at the conclusion of the tour. Stunning. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Wellington.",
          "We travel extensively and have visited many Museums and the like especially in Europe but this one is probably the best we have ever seen. It was done so well and a huge credit to everyone involved. Can highly recommend !",
          "Had a nominal fee to get in (well about 10 GBP) and was well worth it. Peter Jackson has excelled himself with this and helps bring a small insight of what the conditions were like in WW1. It is well set out and you walk through the timeline trying to avoid all the tour parties",
          "Abundant photos, memories, weaponry, history and amazing human figures that looked so real you wonder if they are real people!",
          "We took the guided tour of this exhibition - it was worth every cent. The exhibition is carefully and thoughtfully put together. It is a pity that we haven't learned from the disaster that it portrays.",
          "Fantastic display. So life like and poignant. Don't miss it. It's free to view too , the detail is phenomenal",
          "Wow the exhibit was amazing with the detail that went into creating the models to look so life like!!. Then as you stroll along you follow the journey of some of the people at war.",

          "This is a wonderful exhibition within Te Papa and is good for all ages. It is not frightening at all for children. We took our grandson aged six and he found it really interesting. It gives you a real insight to the 1st world war. You can take a long time or a short time to look",
          "So very happy to finally get to see this exhibit. Very touching. Very informative without being too lengthy.",
          "I had just seen the Anzac display in Te Papa and thought I might be a bit underwhelmed but I wasnt the Great war is a fantastic display, very informative and interesting - recommended.",
          "This is an amazing and informative exhibition and is not to be missed. There are work sheets and packs for kids to do (at a cost) and enough to keep them occupied and looking at the exhibits while parents get to read and look at things too (win win!) staff were friendly and",
          "My partner\u2019s grandfather nearly perished at Passchendaele we had to come here. We previously visited Te Papa so we knew that any Peter Jackson influence would amp up the experience. I was already feeling emotional after reading the sentiments in the National Memorial itself so",
          "This a fantastic , So well done , anything Peter jackson's involved in is great. Yet so sad . Go and see this .",
          "Having seen the Te Papa exhibition the day before, I wondered weather we would find this a little disappointing, however it turned out to be well worth a visit. A 30 minute walk from the town center and not easy to find, we eventually arrived, and, unlike the other museums in",
          "We saw this first before going to Gallico exhibition. That was the right order we think, as we first got the big picture of the great War. Fantastic.",
          "The Great War Exhibit is located in the Welling Museum. Which is located in the city center and a short walk from most of the hotels. Also, easily accessible by bus. The museum and exhibition are totally free. (This is an incredible deal). The Exhibition is very",
          "The Great War Exhibition is a must see when in Wellington, a fantastic insight in to what our soldiers had to endure while fighting for freedom. The displays are interesting even for small children. The tour guides are full of so much knowledge it is definitely worth paying",
          "A great way to spend a couple of hours. Was really impressed by how all the old photos had been touched up and converted into colour. Was like the photos of WWI had just been taken. The scale model of Chunuk Bair scene was also very good to see - and realise why we lost as",
          "So well done - I stood in awe - need to go back several time to read all the material. The listening posts with oral history interviews of actual veterans was fantastic - brought it all to life - i have learnt so much. thank you - such a valuable exhibition of such a horrific",
          "We visited this exhibition during Labour Weekend with another family. Luckily we took the guided tour and luckily we did this before seeing the Galipolli Exhibition at Te Papa. We had an absolutely fantastic guide who told so much of the reasons for WWI as well as what is meant",
          "Have been here twice and find it an amazing place to visit with so much history told in such a life sized way. A must visit if you are visiting Wellington",
          "i would say its not that awesome and to think they charge 15dollars to get in... if this is your first time in welly better go to the te papa musuem which has free entrance and nice cafe inside... the exterior of the building was quite cool though",
          "A must visit whilst in Wellington. Better than we expected and would like to go again. we have travelled a lot but got a real WOW moment walking through.",
          "This is a credit to all the staff that put this exhibition together. We visited with our children and grandkids making all the more special. The detail in the exhibits is some thing to see",
          "As opposed to the other museums we visited in Wellington (Te Papa & Wellington Museum), we had to pay to get into this one. But it was a good experience... pity the trench experience wasn't quite finished. In early 2018, I think, this will be well worth a visit.",
          "With standard admission being $15m it is worth paying the extra $10 for a guided tour. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable, adding great value to our overall experience.",
          "Went to The National War Memorial to see the Passchendaele media installation (by Story Inc) on the eve of the tragic Battle of Passchendaele Oct 12 1917. Quietly moving with graphic photos never seen before. The rain, the slaughter! Simply illustrated, short but enlightening.",
          "My only wish is that I had allowed more time to soak in the detail of this exhibition. It was incredibly detailed and fascinating. We did a guided tour, but unfortunately didn't have enough time to be able to go back around and take in eve3rything that was offered",
          "A wonderful immersive experience, with mock-ups of WW1 French towns, battle scenes and fascinating information and photographs. A must see.",
          "The guided tour was great bringing a new dimension to the experience, the guide was interesting and informative, the displays were life like giving a feel for the horrific experience of war. The photos from the time had been enlarged and coloured giving them a very realistic",
          "This is a great exhibition and shouldn't be missed. It's at the Dominion Museum and should not to be confused with the Weta workshops Te Papa exhibition. Brilliantly laid out for a more in-depth understanding but do arrange for a guided tour to get so much more out of it.",
          "Unusual for a museum, this is very visual with not much text. It's a nice change, for sure, but the guided tour definitely added content because I didn\u2019t know much about the war. With that said, the guide was a bit dry in his delivery. The regular entrance fee is $15 for a",
          "Life size exhibits,detailed dioramas and most amazingly of all, those horrific photos of WW1 now enhanced into colour. I was blown away with the clarity of all the photos. We easily spent 3hours but could have made it longer. The tea shop provided a recovery cuppa but time ran",
          "Had heard glowing reports so while visiting Wgtn to see WOW, thought we should also see this. If we had called the day before (on a Wednesday) as Goldcard holders we would have received a discount! Never mind well worth the entry fee.",
          "This is an incredible exhibit! There isn't a whole ton of information to read - it's more about understanding how the experience of the war felt and exploring it visually. Since I already know quite a bit about the war, I really enjoyed this aspect. The models by Weta are",
          "This was recommended to us and certainly didn't disappoint. Pay for the guided tour it is well worth it, the exhibits are world class and the information and history is a 'must do'.",
          "Well worth spending the extra and joining a tour, a truly amazing exhibit of facts, photo's etc thank you Peter Jackson, learnt quite a bit, the tour guide was enthusiastic, don't forget to go and see the weta workshop tree close to this building.",
          "This exhibition is always a touching reminder of the past and the sacrifices of young men and women but also the stupidity of war. Please keep even it it's a condensed version to allow for other exhibitions.",
          "Very very interesting afternoon, well worth the time to spend here out of the wind. We took all the kids and had a great time never seemed to get bored ( the kids ) ( all 4 )",
          "The realistic models coupled with the videos and various items from the battlefields bring the stark reality of war right into your thoughts. It is hard not to appreciate the opportunity to be there but you find yourself questioning the tragic loss of life and sacrifice made. I",
          "I had visited this museum on a few other trips to Wellington but was not prepared for the first world war display that captured my imagination. The huge models I am told were built by the people who worked on the Lord of the Rings and are outstanding even to the drops of",
          "I cannot compliment the museum more for their assistance and sensibility, I had rung and booked 2 wheel chairs for our two guests requiring assistance. We were welcomed on arrived by taxi and the staff assisted us up the ramp and to the wheelchairs in the entrance. We did not",
          "The displays were life like and the kids loved it. Both my children enjoyed it and wanted to go back. Well worth the visit. I would recommend that you pay extra for a guided tour getting more details of events brings the exhibition to life. There is a cafe for food but a little",
          "This is beautifully done and suitable for all ages. We recommend this to all our family and friends that visit us.",
          "A Must see! Very heart felt experience of what our soldiers experienced & went through! Sculptured models were amazing & Extreamly well made.. Definitely worth a visit for everyone..",
          "Peter Jackson has done it again - i spend over 2 hours wandering around the exhibit absolutely enthralled. A thought provoking and insightful glimpse into New Zealand's history. I would absolutely recommend this",
          "Sadly we only had a short time here but well worth the visit. Had a brilliant tour guide (sorry name escapes me) who was informative and interesting. The displays are phenomenal and we were amazed at the brilliance of the display and the surrounding park areas. The detail of the",
          "This marvellous exhibition has excellent displays and tableaux. This has not been created on a tight budget as is quite obvious in the quality and thought that has gone into its creation. A must to visit!",
          "We expected that it would be good and it certainly lived up what we'd heard. Took a guided tour which was informative and sensitively presented. Came away with a better understanding of the politics involved. A sobering lesson in how seemingly minor events can escalate so",
          "We enjoyed this as we love the War Memorial in Canberra. Some excellent displays and the diorama of the Gallipoli Penninsula was amazing seeing the scale that the NZ soldiers faced. Well done.",
          "After some persuading, we took the guided tour and were glad we had. The guide was knowledgeable and friendly. There is so much to see here that after the tour was finished, we went back through again to look at a few things we wanted to look at in more detail. Trench warfare",
          "Put together by the people who did Lord of the Rings, this is a pretty good account of the Great War, especially from NZ's viewpoint. It does this well, and, for me, the highpoints are a diorama of a battle at Gallipoli and the coloured Great War photos, which really bring",
          "I only went to this exhibition so that I could advise my guests, that were heading to the North Island, what was worth seeing in Wellington. I don't normally like paying for museums but this was worth every cent. Absolutely amazing display that showed the horrific experiences",
          "I absolutely loved going through and seeing the photos of the men who were over there fighting. Highly recommend",
          "We were advised at the front desk that the best experience was with a guided tour for an extra $10 each because there wasn't much written information about the displays. Our guide did his best to present the displays but we really could have read the same information he was",
          "If Disney were to create a museum about World War I, this would be it. It's hard to imagine a more fascinating exhibit. The sights and sounds make visitors feel as though they are traveling through the years 1914 through 1918. The attention to detail was not to be believed. Our",
          "Spent a half day on a self paced tour of the museum. Additionally you can pay for a guide. Outside there are some interesting sites as well. ANZAC memorial and chapel. Worth the money and I got my folks a WWI knitting kit to make some socks. All proceeds to the museum.",
          "A truly amazingly done exhibition - really has to be seen. Have been back since to take it all in again.",
          "This is an excellent place to visit and learn about the First World War. The exhibits are amazing - models of soldiers so lifelike you think they will start talking! it is all done to a very high standard.",
          "We did a 45 min tour with Jake who was fantastic and was very passionate and knowledgable about all the war aspects. We were very impressed.",
          "I really enjoyed the Great War exhibition. The displays and dioramas are incredibly detailed and well constructed, and the extensive photo galleries really encourage you to look longer, particularly in their Gallipoli exhibition. I felt that the exhibit really compliments the",
          "This exhibition is simply superb, incredibly thought provoking and time consuming Take the time to read the information if you can, don't rush it, it's worth spending the time. The attention to detail on some of the displays is amazing. You'll come away subdued about the",
          "The exhibition highlight was the colourised photographs from the war. The photos were so much more real for being in colour and gave an informal view of day to day life of the soldiers. Very moving portrayal of these young men.",
          "Being from the UK I knew nothing about the First World War from a NZ perspective but the exhibition was fascinating and I felt close to tears at times. Thoroughly recommended.",
          "What an amazing exhibition but you need to have time to read all the stories and take in the experience. Weta's models are amazing and you fee as if they are watching you and about to move. The most amazing detail. Fantastic flow around the story telling, beautiful models and",
          "Well worth taking time out to go and visit. So much time and care has been taken to ensure and amazing immersive experience",
          "We had already visited Te Papa WW1 exhibit (an absolute must) but we were recommended go also go see Peter Jackson's War Museum exhibit. Also of WW1, it was somber and very well constructed with fantastic dioramas and stories. We took a guided tour - it enabled us to ask Q's but",
          "Absolutely amazing to spend time at this expo and experience some of the issues and situations that our brave war heroes endured.",
          "We have travelled to Gallipoli and the Somme and this was probably the best exhibition we have seen on the story of the ANZACS. From the start to the end, you become totally immersed in the events of those war years, and came away with such respect for those who took part in the",
          "If you have the time, take the time. There is so much to read, but it is all so worth it! There can sometimes be large queues but depending on when you go you can also walk straight in. No real way to go through it, make your way through and enjoy reading some of the amazing",
          "A must see amazing presentation with very lifelike and true depiction May be a bit scary for young children",
          "All you could want to know about NZs involvement in WW1. Superbly done from actual uniforms and tanks to a great chronological walk thru",
          "Well placed exhibition at the old museum between Tory and Taranaki Streets, walking distance from central Wellington. It was a short visit (2 hours) for me and I did pay the extra $10.00 and take the guided talk. In hindsight, it wasn't really necessary in my case as I was",
          "Took my class of 10 and 11 year olds. They were totally engaged in the story of young Will, and in the extraordinary Gallipoli Peninsula model. The guides were amazing and so knowledgeable. Be prepared to spend 3 or 4 hours here.It is worth every minute.",
          "So life like and on an incredible scale. Was well worth the visit and if you see nothing else in the museum your trip would still have been fabulous.",
          "This is a fantastic exhibition and should be visited by every Kiwi when in Wellington. The queues are no longer a problem and the huge figures are very lifelike. There is plenty of information as you follow real people through the exhibition and is interactive as well. It is",
          "Peter Jackson did great on this work. The exhibition commemorates the role played by New Zealand in the First World War. It is really interactive and good for kids at any age.",
          "I know the norrow spaces of the Old Dominion Museum so I did not have high expectations. However I was amazed how they had managed to fit so many in such a wonderful way.",
          "Incredibly moving and exceptionally BRILLIANT. Could have spent hours there reading everything but didn't have time. The people were so lifelike, you could see hairs, freckles, beads of sweat. Absolutely amazing.",
          "You must take the time to walk through this. It is very informative , so real and so emotional. GO SEE IT.",
          "This is definitely worth a visit if you have the time when you're in Wellington. It's extremely well done (as you would expect with Peter Jackson's involvement). The scale of the battles are really well articulated through the modelling and you can easily while away a couple of",
          "This is an excellent exhibition created by film maker Peter Jackson. Located in Wellington's lovely old museum building, it comprises two parts; a section on the Western front and another on Gallipoli complete with large model of the beach, terrain, miniature soldiers depicting",
          "Not to be missed. A brilliant exhibit. Take the time and have a guide with you - some parts are so raw and real. You are literally taken back to what it was like for these young men and young nurses. The coloured photographs bring it home. The models of the soldiers. There is",
          "This was our second visit, as on the first occasion the exhibition was new, the Gallipoli photographic section had not been completed, and the large number of visitors only allowed a \"rushed\" viewing and did not allow time for reflection. A moving and at times overwhelming",
          "Not usually \"my sort of thing\" but found it very well presented - would recommend for anyone. Uses \"movie set\" effects very well.",
          "Excellent and worth a visit. Really well put together displays and easy to spend quite a lot of time taking it all in. Would recommend.",
          "The detail in the exhibit is phenomenal. From the replicated cobbled street of a Belgian village to all the recreation of what life was like for a soldier in WWI, this was a huge eye opener for all of us. We all learned so much about what things were like during WWI for a",
          "I originally was trying to escape the rain. So, I ran into this museum. I'm not a war enthusiast. But, I really learned a great deal about the start of the war. The exhibit does an entire timeline of the war. I definitely recommend this place.",
          "The look in the eyes of the characters in this exhibition was absolutely fantastic.You felt you were there wwith them,reliving their harrowing times at their sides,heart wrenchingly real.Also enjoyed the exhibit on Archie Baxter,who was my Uncle,recalled the memories of",
          "My husband dragged me to this exhibit. I'm not a lover of history. This totally blew me away. The sheer detail and size is amazing. It totally immerses you into the \"time\". Not ideal fir young kids because scenes pack quite a punch but they do warn you about that.",
          "The exhibition is very educational, well presented and definitely makes you ponder about the futility of war. The exhibits are highly detailed and very well made. Not too crowded when we visited on a Saturday late morning.",
          "I learnt a lot of information that I didn't know about New Zealand's involvement in WW1. The displays were so life like it was a sobering experience, and made me realise what a terrible experience it must have been for the soldiers. It was great to sit in the lovely caf\u00e9",
          "Awe inspiring exhibition, left with a feeling of what it must have been like, try and get there before it ends",
          "There isn't anyone of any age that won't get something out of this exhibition. It's so real and raw and you get really emotional reading through the stories of real people living through a horrible war.",
          "We started our visit with a guided tour which was fantastic. - a historical weave through some wonderful exhibits. The exhibition is so diverse and the setting is the superb. The colourisation of the black and white photos gave a different perspective than usual. I loved the",
          "Well worth a visit if you want to learn about WW1 history and New Zealand's role in that war. Well worth taking a guided tour that explain things very well the guides, There is lots of great real artifacts in the museum too.",
          "This is a fantastic visual display, especially if you are not up with the History of the First World war. Made even more lifelike thanks to the great work done by Weta Workshops.",
          "Lots of interesting photographs; actual equipment and weapons; interactive displays; and a spectacular diorama of a battle.",
          "Dramatic and realistic exhibition with a lot of information about the endurance of soldiers on both sides of the conflict and even their respect for each other in the most appalling conditions.",
          "A must see for anyone visiting Wellington. The grounds at Pukeahu are also very interesting. A great tribute to our soldiers.",
          "This was an amazing exhibition - I learnt more about the war in one visit here than I had all my life. It was informative and engaging. Our tour guide was a young lady who studied history and her knowledge was incredible. It is a very moving experience and truly brings home the",
          "Recently named on Lonely Planet\u2019s list of the Top 500 places on the planet, New Zealand\u2019s national museum, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, attracts more than 1.5 million visitors each year, making it the most visited museum in Australasia. You can discover New Zealand\u2019s",
          "absolutely impressive and at the same time shows futility of war. Amazing amount of historical material, great displays and displays so impressive",
          "Took my elderly mother to see this. It was fantastic, the detail was amazing. Really talented people who put this together.",
          "I highly suggest booking a tour here. It was nice to have someone take you around and explain all of the details of the exhibition. Very moving to see The Great War depicted in the faces of the exhibit.",
          "Our Family recently visited the above and were very impressed. As were we. It is extremely well done and a very informative and moving experience.",
          "A very moving exhibition, well documented with wonderful models and displays. Very informative. I learnt so much about such a tragic time. You can take a guided tour which I think would be worthwhile but my time was limited so unable to wait for the start of the next round so",
          "I stumbled across this exhibition when it was first opening in 2014, and was lucky to get an early bird tour free of charge. After seeing many museums in Europe, this really did surprise me and was absolutely brilliant. As would be expected of anything Peter Jackson is involved",
          "Absolutely amazing and absolutely do it! The atmosphere will transport you as soon as you enter the exhibit hall. The visual effects are fantastic and the information boards well written and not excessive. They are informative without being overwhelming in wording. Well worth",
          "This exhibit showcases the talents of Peter Jackson's Weta Workshops. The attention to detail and accuracy of the exhibit is amazing. Don't miss the large scale diorama with the hand painted figures. There are guided tours available if you want a more informative experience but",
          "I'm an American and thus do not really know much about the events specifically detailed here. This is a must see for anyone. It is extremely well done and informative. I would devote at least 4 hours to this. If you need reading glasses take them as there is much to read",
          "An amazing exhibition, such detail with personal stories and photographs. A real insight into the harsh conditions these brave soldiers faced each day, very moving.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the very life-like and informative exhibition of NZ's adventures in WW1 in particular the tragedy of Gallipoli. Very well presented.",
          "There is a charge of NZ $15 for adults to visit this well presented exhibition, children free. It takes you through New Zealand's role in the First World War. An ideal place to visit on a rainy day.",
          "The scenes and characters were so lifelike. Great interactive things to do and movies to watch. You really felt you were there. Very very moving.",
          "Well done. I learnt more in 45min than I did in all of my school years. Fascinating - here is perhaps a different way to teach!",
          "Excellent history and displays. The massive sculptures of soldiers were unreal. The level of detail was very impressive. Congrats on the fantastic exhibition.",
          "Recently visited this exhibition and found it exceptional! Took the guided tour which was well worth the extra cost. Sir Peter Jackson & his team are to be congratulated for the work they have put into the whole experience. To see photos from the actual time frame were very hear",
          "Worth a visit as incredible exhibits. Amazing for anyone to see and get somewhere idea of this history.",
          "This is a mind boggling experience. Quite emotional but the intricate detail and display of the terrible war is out of this world.",
          "This was a fantastic exhibition made even more compelling by our guide Chris. Once he heard our family connection to WW1 he made every effort to point out connections between our ancestor and the displays. My 9 and 10 year old both enjoyed it and felt they had learnt a lot",
          "Wonderful presentation. very emotional but informative and educational for all ages. We must never forget the huge sacrifices that were made.",
          "We had our office Xmas function here - I had organised it with tours and lunch at the end. It was fantastic - there is so much to see at this exhibition - and I am not necessarily the sort of person who enjoys war museums etc. There are many layers to the walk through -",
          "Allow lots of time. We had no idea we would spend so long. And we would still go back.Amazing, thought provoking, emotional. The cafe is great to visit afterwards. Parking can be a bit of an issue.",
          "Found the display of war memorabilia fascinating and informative. Was creatively put together with thought and sensitivity. It is a must see when in Wellington. Cost $15 for general admission or $25 for a guided tour.",
          "The exhibition was a realistic portrait of what life must have been like in the front lines in the First World War. The skill of sir PeterJackson's team is glaringly obvious with lifelike characters scenery and the instruments of war.",
          "We went on a guided tour which was well worth the few dollars extra. The exhibits were well laid out and presented in a way which was easy to follow and read",
          "What a fantastic exhibition. I visited with my Father who is a war buff, but we both found it extremely informative with some outstanding displays. You can join a tour or take yourself around. We chose to take ourselves around and everything is described very well. Most of the",
          "This is an excellent place to visit if you are interest in the ANZAC campaign during World War One. To take it all in you need not to be rushed and it is not suitable for young children (Under 10).",
          "This is one of the best exhibitions of WW1 that I have seen. The amount of detail in the exhibit was outstanding. If you have time when you are in Wellington- this is a must see!",
          "It is hard to imagine how a more comprehensive display could have been mounted. I was recently in the War Memorial in Canberra and this matches anything they have. It needs at least 2 hours and is emotionally draining. Just to see the lists of the Kiwi men and women killed day",
          "Me and my parents went there early to see the exhibition. We were very pleased only having knowledge from a European point of view. This gave us a great insight of the British and the Kiwi history revolving the great war. I can highly recommend going.",
          "We had a great time here. The trip was worth spending time and seeing it all. It was breath taking to walk around and see all the detail put into this. We would recommend",
          "I had been to the other Anzac memorial exhibition up next to the Carillon a couple of tears ago, and had been very impressed. The one at Te Papa was equally impressive. Some may say they glorify war, but I think they are important we don't forget, and the next generation are",
          "We went with no expectations, as we'd been told it wasn't as good as Te Papa's exhibition on Gallipoli. How wrong was that information. There is so much to see and learn not only about how WWI started but about the relationships between the Leaders. We were happy with the",
          "I did not realise the profound impact Gallipoli had on the Australasian psyche until I saw this exhibition. It is outstanding in very many ways - if you are in Wellington, go and see it. a fantastic museum exhibtion and a great wander.",
          "A truly amazing exhibition, from the very beginning this exhibition runs you through the chronology of WW1 and the atrocities inflicted and suffered, the weapons used, the pain suffered, the development of long lasting comradeships right through to the hospital ship caf\u00e9, this",
          "A little walk out of town but I needed the exercise. The display on Galliopoli is incredibly and the scaled model really helps the understanding of the scale of the event. Guided tours provide you with extra bit of information and the guides dont rush through it and allow people",
          "Don't miss this if you go to Wellington. Worth taking a guided tour to get the best out of it. Leave plenty of time to have a good look around again after the guided tour finishes.",
          "This was a very detailed and informative exhibition. Did not really know much about the wars but this totally blew me away. It is set up with figures,taped stories and real photos which made me feel very emotional.Well worth a visit",
          "Having already seen the Gallipoli exhibit at Te Papa the previous year, this one was on the list for Anzac this year. Did not expect the entry fee of $15 each to cough up but in saying that we were there for nearly 2 hours and both thought this was really worthwhile in the end."

        "wiki": "Wellington City Council is a territorial authority in New Zealand, governing the country's third-largest city by population, behind Auckland and Christchurch. Wellington City consists of the central historic town and certain additional areas within the Wellington metropolitan area, extending as far north as Linden and covering rural areas such as M\u0101kara and Ohariu. The city adjoins Porirua in the north and Hutt City in the north-east. It is one of nine territorial authorities in the Wellington Region.\nWellington attained city status in 1886. The settlement had become the colonial capital and seat of government by 1865, replacing Auckland. Parliament officially sat in Wellington for the first time on 26 July 1865. During the last half of the nineteenth century, Wellington grew rapidly from 7,460 residents in 1867 to 49,344 by the end of the century.The council represents a population of 210,400 as of June 2019 and consists of a mayor and fourteen councillors elected from five wards (Northern, Onslow-Western, Lambton, Eastern, Southern). It administers public works, sanitation, land use and building consents, among other local services. The council has used the marketing slogan \"Absolutely Positively Wellington\" in an official capacity since the early 1990s.\n\n\n== Council ==\nAll councillors are members of Council, the Strategy and Policy Committee, and the Annual Plan/Long Term Plan Committee.\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\n\nOne mayor is elected at large from the entire Wellington City district.\n\n\n=== Eastern Ward ===\nThe Eastern ward returns three councillors to the Wellington City Council.\n\n\n=== Lambton Ward ===\nThe Lambton ward returns three councillors to the Wellington City Council.\n\n\n=== Northern Ward ===\nThe Northern ward returns three councillors to the Wellington City Council.\n\n\n=== Onslow-Western Ward ===\nThe Onslow-Western ward returns three councillors to the Wellington City Council. \n\n\n=== Southern Ward ===\nThe Southern ward is the only ward that returns two councillors to the Wellington City Council (all others returning three).\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\nThe City of Wellington has a Coat of Arms. The Blazon is;\n\nArms: Quarterly Gules and Azure, a Cross Or between; In the first quarter a Fleece Or; in the second quarter on Water barry wavy proper in base a Lymphad sail furled pennon and flags flying Argent; in the third quarter a Garb Or; in the fourth quarter five Plates in Saltire Argent.\nCrest: On a Mural Crown Argent a Dolphin Naiant Azure, Mantled Gules.\nSupporters: On the dexter side a Lion gorged with a Collar and Chain reflexed over the back Or, and on the sinister side a Moa proper.\nMotto: Suprema a SituTranslation of the Blazon:\nThe shield is divided vertically and horizontally, quarter of which the first and fourth are red and the remaining pair are blue. A golden cross is placed over the entire shield centrally between these quarters. The top left quarter contains a golden fleece (usually depicted as a whole sheep with a band around its middle). The second quarter is depicted as a silver sailing ship (lymphad) with its sails furled as it would be in port but with its flags flying, placed on waves in their natural colour. The third quarter contains a golden wheat sheaf, and the fourth has five silver discs arranged in a saltire.\nThe mural crown (a crown depicted as if made of stonewalling) is common as a crest in city coats of arms. It is coloured silver, and from its top comes a swimming dolphin. Around the crest is mantling in red. The supporters on either side of the shield are a golden heraldic lion with a chained collar around its neck to the left, and a moa in its natural colouring on the right (the terms \"sinister\" and \"dexter\" relate to the shield from the holder's point of view, not the viewer's, thus dexter is the viewer's left and sinister is the viewer's right). The base on which the supporters stand is normally not emblazoned but is left to the artist to decide. The Motto may be translated as \"Supreme by position\".\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nWellington City had a population of 202,737 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 11,781 people (6.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 23,271 people (13.0%) since the 2006 census.

It also has two downtown campuses and in the 2000s briefly had one in the western suburb of Karori after absorbing the former Wellington College of Education there. It originated as a constituent college of the University of New Zealand. The Senate of the University of New Zealand operated in Wellington until its dissolution in 1961.\nA branch of Massey University is located in Wellington: it took over the site and some of the courses of the former Wellington Polytechnic. The campus is based at the former Dominion Museum, which has moved to Te Papa. The University of Otago also has a Wellington connection, as the Wellington School of Medicine and Health Sciences is a department of that university.\nWellington Institute of Technology serves Wellington and the neighbouring Hutt Valley. One of the largest polytechnics in the region, it dates from 1904.\nNumerous primary and secondary educational institutions operate throughout the city, see List of schools in Wellington, New Zealand.\nWellington has a number of museums and galleries, including Te Papa, the City Gallery and the Museum of Wellington City & Sea. The Wellington Museums Trust runs the latter two, and other museums.\n\n\n== Sister-city relationships ==\nSister cities Sydney, Australia\n Canberra, Australia\n Beijing, People's Republic of China\n Xiamen, Fujian, People's Republic of China\n Sakai, Osaka, JapanHistorical sister cities Harrogate, England, United Kingdom\n Hania, Crete, Greece\n \u00c7anakkale, TurkeyFriendly cities Tianjin, People's Republic of China\n\n\n== History ==\nThe City of Wellington has subsumed independent boroughs including:\n\nMelrose (established 1888) in 1903\nOnslow (Khandallah/Ngaio) (established 1890) in 1919 (Wadestown had joined the city in 1906)\nKarori (established 1891) in 1920\nMiramar (established 1904) in 1921\nJohnsonville (a Town Board from 1908), in 1953\nTawa (a Town district from 1951, then the Tawa Flat Borough Council from 1953) in 1989\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\nThe Wellington City Council owns and until May 2019 operated from a complex on Wakefield Street, with various extensions each representing a distinctive architectural period. The complex incorporates the Wellington Town Hall which opened in 1904, with the most recent extension completed in 1991 alongside the Wellington Central Library.\nThe Wakefield Street complex has been cleared of back office functions, and since 28 May 2019 will be closed completely for repairs and earthquake strengthening. In the interim, most of the council's central office staff are located in commercial premises at 113 The Terrace, and the council's public service centre is at 12 Manners Street. Due to repairs also being needed to the Wellington Central Library, and Capital E, all of the civic buildings on Civic Square are closed, except for the City Gallery.\n\n\n== Use of pseudoscience ==\nIn December 2019, at the New Zealand Skeptics annual conference, the Wellington City Council and the Downer Group were co-awarded the Bent Spoon by NZ Skeptics for \"showing the most egregious gullibility in 2019\" for the contractor's use of water divining to find underground pipes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWellington Region\n\n\n== References ==\nFootnotes\nCitations\nA Complete Guide To Heraldry by A.C.

          "Ugh. I am a fan of modern art but this was going too far. A huge installation for signs that float behind airplanes seemed a bit much.

          "Free gallery buy please drop a donation for them. Lots of interesting displays as well as being located in the very cool downtown Wellington area. The cafe inside is also very good.",

          "A classic example of wasted space. If I want to see a large building with TV screens on the wall and rope thrown about, I'll stay home. \nMy advice is, when you have a large art gallery, display LARGE artworks.",

          "Fairly small exhebition. My favourits were the \"this is new zealand\" film and the decorated piano. The free wifi is of course always a pro. Even though you can get creative on the top floor, I wouldn't recommend the gallery to families. 1-2 \u2026",

          "We called in here on 31 December looking for a cafe - although the Gallery was open, the cafe was closed for the holidays! What a disappointment! Don't they think that visitors would like a drink? That said, delighted to see that a Grayson Perry tapestry was on view. One of",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Beehive is the common name for the Executive Wing of New Zealand Parliament Buildings, located at the corner of Molesworth Street and Lambton Quay, Wellington. It is so-called because its shape is reminiscent of that of a traditional woven form of beehive known as a \"skep\". It is registered as a Category I heritage building by Heritage New Zealand.\nConstruction began in 1969 and was completed in 1981. Since 1979 the building has housed the offices of the prime minister and other ministers. Thus, the name  \"Beehive\" is closely linked with the New Zealand Government. It is often used as a metonym for the New Zealand leadership at large.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1960s the government proposed an extension of Parliament House, which had only been partly built in 1922. Prime Minister Keith Holyoake had wanted to complete the original plan, but the government architect persuaded him to approve a modern building which would house parliamentary offices. In 1964, Scottish architect Sir Basil Spence provided the original conceptual design of a round building rising in steps. The detailed architectural design was undertaken by the New Zealand government architect Fergus Sheppard, and structural design of the building was undertaken by the Ministry of Works. W. M. Angus constructed the first stage, beginning in 1969 \u2013 the podium, underground car park and basement for a national civil defence centre. Gibson O'Connor constructed the ten floors of the remainder of the building.\n\nBellamy's catering facilities moved into the building in the summer of 1975\u201376 and Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, unveiled a plaque in the reception hall in February 1977. The Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, formally opened the building in May 1977. The government moved into the upper floors in 1979. The annex facing Museum Street was completed in 1981.Renovations were carried out and the interior was modernised between 1998 and 2006 to plans by Christchurch architecture firm Warren and Mahoney. In 2013 and 2014, the roof was repaired and windows replaced.In July 2015, Heritage New Zealand declared the Beehive \"of outstanding heritage significance for its central role in the governance of New Zealand\". Blyss Wagstaff of Heritage New Zealand called it \"one of the most recognisable buildings in the country\". Heritage New Zealand assigned the highest rating for a historic place, Category I, to the building. The original application for the heritage designation was made by Lockwood Smith, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives. The heritage registration with the list number 9629 became effective on 24 July 2015. The tunnel to Bowen House is specifically excluded from the heritage registration.\n\n\n== Facts and figures ==\n\nThe building is ten storeys (72 metres (236 ft)) high and has four floors below ground. The entrance foyer's core is decorated with marble floors, stainless steel mesh wall panels, and a translucent glass ceiling.The Beehive's brown roof is made from 20 tonnes of hand-welted and seamed copper. It has developed a naturally weathered appearance. A tunnel runs under Bowen Street from The Beehive to parliamentary offices in Bowen House. The Beehive is extensively decorated with New Zealand art. On the inner wall of the Banquet Hall is a 42-metre-long 4.8 metre-high mural by John Drawbridge portraying the atmosphere and sky of New Zealand.The Beehive's circular footprint (see rotunda) is generally considered an elegant and distinctive design feature. However it is also quite impractical, as many of its rooms are wedge-shaped, curved or asymmetrical. An extension has been built out the front to allow for a new security entrance. A new, bomb-proof mail delivery room has already been built at the rear of the building.The Beehive has, since 1992, featured as part of the design of the New Zealand twenty-dollar note. A survey commissioned by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand found that the Beehive is \"a New Zealand icon and as such is readily recognisable\".\n\n\n== Offices and facilities ==\n\nThe top floor is occupied by the Cabinet room, with the prime minister's offices directly beneath on the ninth floor (and part of the eighth). The upper portion of the Beehive also contains the offices of other ministers; senior ministers are situated at proximity to the prime minister's office according to their ranking in Cabinet. The seniority of a minister is reflected in how far up the building they are. Some ministers, especially junior ministers, are instead based in Bowen House.Other facilities within the building include function rooms and a banqueting hall on the first floor of the Beehive, which is the largest function room in the parliamentary complex. The parliamentary catering facilities of Bellamy\u2019s include a bar known as Pickwicks or 3.2 (due to its position in the building on the third floor and second corridor), Copperfield's caf\u00e9, and the Member's and Member's and Guests restaurants. The building also houses, in its basement, the country's National Crisis Management Centre. The Beehive contains a theatrette, commonly used for government press conferences. Other facilities include a gym and a swimming pool. The parliament building is used by members of Parliament who hold meetings or are discussing bills or new laws.\n\n\n== Tours ==\nThe New Zealand Parliament's Visitor Centre, open most days from 9 am to 5 pm, is located on the ground floor of the Beehive. Free guided tours lasting up to one hour are available, as are educational visits for students.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Beehive \u2013 New Zealand Parliament website\nHistory of Parliament Buildings \u2013 NZHistory",

          "Very interesting 1 hour tour - we have been to NZ 3 times and this was the first time we began to understand the parliamentary system. So similar to that in the UK but very different too! Best to book if you want a specific time slot. The tour could easily have been for 2 hours",
          "Interesting round building where the common folks would say the nonsense goes round and round. The older buildings on the premises are very beautiful. One thing struck me and that is the public playground in the garden right in front of the parliament. What is that supposed to",
          "It\u2019s amazing how much you can learn in one hour! We were told all about New Zealand\u2019s democracy and parliamentary system, as well as the buildings that house it. There is even a part about the earthquake proof foundations. Our guide Wioletta made it fun and engaging for all the",
          "Seems it\u2019s a must do when visit the capital of New Zealand. But I am kinda disappointed.

          "We only visited the outside of the famous 'Beehive' Parliament buildings, but I must say that the next time we saw it on The News, it felt different that we'd actually been there !! They do tours etc. but we ran out of time",
          "We did the 1hr tour of the parliament and it was very interesting. We were exposed to the way New Zealand government runs and operates and how important the peoples opinions are when discussing bills and laws. Amazing architectural design and rebuild when part of the building",

          "Got to see the Parliament building from outside and found to have a unique shape. Didn\u2019t get a chance to do a guided tour, as it was a Sunday. Certainly worth a photo stop of the parliament and the surrounding buildings.",
          "The tour is very informative and covers 3 buildings, A great deal of information about how the country is governed. The only disappointment was you can't take photos inside; and the architecture is beautiful",
          "Our cruise ship shuttle stopped outside this funky looking government building. Worth a walk and a look.",
          "I really don\u2019t know why I am bothering to review this place - suffice to say a warning to check if they are actually open. We raced to get there by the 15 mins before the tour - only to be told they weren\u2019t going to do one! No signs, no publicity. There were other tourists",
          "A revealing and most interesting tour of the NZ parliament. Being from the UK, the similarities are clear, but the differences were also explained. Our helpful and knowledgeable guide went through the history of the site as well as the parliamenrary processes. Sadly, we could",

          "We took the free 1hr tour through parliament. Our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and was also able to answer all questions she was asked from the group. We got to go through the debating chamber and other areas you see on TV so it was great to experience it in person.",
          "Had a few hours to spare so dropped in here to spend some time watching my tax dollars at work in the debating chamber of the New Zealand Parliament. The ducking and weaving of Ministers trying to avoid answering questions is a true joy to behold. I watched the entire question",
          "The tour is free and full of interesting information about NZ parliamentary process and history. The guide did not rush and was accommodating to those who needed to use the lift instead of a few stairs. All in all, an hour well spent!",
          "As we know not all parliament we can enter, went at the weekend and you can park there freely, and just walk around there.",
          "If you can put an hour and a half aside then join one of the free parliament guided tours, the architectual beauty of the buildings cannot be enjoyed from outside. We arrived fifteen minutes early to pass through security, check our hand luggage in before watching a short video",
          "A lovely building but unfortunately full of people ripping into each other rather than working for the common good of our country.",

          "There are many parliaments in the world and this one is New Zealand's. It is full of elected members, civil servants and visitors most of the time. I went in through security, including a metal detector, sat on a chair and left through a door.",

          "Nicely laid out green space with New Zealand\u2019s three main government buildings. Generally a quiet area, unless there\u2019s a protest or big news event. Short walk ( 10-15 mins ) from the CBD or Te Papa. About 5 mins from the main bus depot.",

          "Good tour and the guide was really informative. The stupid thing is you aren\u2019t allowed to take photos which appears antiquated. I would love a photo in the debating chamber and library. Apart from this, would recommend.",
          "On our way back to the city from the botanical gardens we passed directly by the Parliament buildings, and decided to take a free guided tour. We learned so much about the workings of the lawmaking body, along with a lot of the history of New Zealand. Our guide (Violetta) was",

          "My husband, who is both a political junkie and an engineer, really \"geeked out\" on this tour. The tour goes quite fast. I wished it had been a little slower. I only got a chance to ask one question. I think the highlight for my husband was seeing the system of \"shock absorbers\"",

          "We were not allowed in to have a look-see since we had not signed up for an hour-long tour. In any case, the newer building, while impressive in a way, also seemed to be a rather odd bit of architecture. Others might love it though.",

          "I am particularly interested governments and the way they function so this was a rather interesting visit to me. Was very keen on sitting in for their debate but due to time constraints, I was not able to. One thing to note is that you'll probably need to bring your own water.",
          "You can go on tours at set times for free and when Parliament is in session you can sit up in the public gallery and see all the MPs debate and act like school children. Recommended for a couple of hours",

          "When driving towards downtown Wellington and someone mentions the beehive parliament buiding, you may wonder what they are talking about and if you might be able to notice this. You will notice the building for sure as itis very uniquely built. I read that it was built over",

          "I've giving this 3 stars only because I'm reluctant to give 2 for a tour which could have - should have - been much more worthwhile. I'm hopeful the problem was with the specific tour guide I happened to be assigned to. Questions clearly were an annoyance to her and I'm afraid",

          "A small tour through the parliamentary buildings along with its history. A description of how the system works and it\u2019s impact over the years. Very interesting - would have loved to have seen a live debate though! If you are interested in these sorts of things, worth a drop over.",
          "NZers, get in amongst it and find out your history! For overseas visitors this is an excellent way to understand our government and how it's structured. There are tours available but you can just go in an look at the gift shop. There is a security screening before you're",
          "Compared to Europe and UK nothing much of a building but worth while visiting. If you go there at the right time can take some good photographs for your travel album.",
          "Our tour guide glossed over the details. When asked and prompted she was very knowledgeable on topics but not forthcoming unless prodded. The architecture is amazing and very ornate in the library and Parliament house areas. The beehive is .. well, round.. Parliament was sitting",
          "Plenty of opportunity to see through this historical building. Even open in the weekend. Wear comfortable shoes.",

          "Whilst we did not have much time, we did walk around the building which is such an iconic shape and of national importance. We did not have time to visit the gallery but that is for next time.",
          "we found this to be a very interesting and informative tour which was free! Kids (5 &7) got a bit board but you were always moving so they handled the hour tour ok. If you have time take the tour.",
          "To see the buildings from the outside might be enough for some tourists. We saw their website where we found out that you can take a free 1-hour tour inside the parliament buildings. We showed up without an appointed time. The tour was full, but we were able to join when some",
          "The Bee Hive beside the earlier colonial buildings are a contrast. Although our tour did not give us the time, guided tours inside are available and would be of interest to some. These buildings are close to the CBD and added interest to our trip.",

          "Took kids to the Beehive and surprisingly they knew a bit about it. But other than that they were only interested in running up and down the stairs. They do free tours at certain times of the day. Check timings before heading out. We didnt do tours as kids didnt seem interested.",

          "Really enjoyed the guided tour and the chance to learn more about the government system in New Zealand. Actually stood on the floor of Parliament. Lovely new and old sections that both have a unique place in history. So glad we got this additional perspective of the country.",
          "Personally the beehive isn't my cop of tea so to speak. The old building is much nicer. We did not go inside.",
          "We took a Sunday afternoon tour of Parliament and learned a great deal about New Zealand's government. We selected this activity based on a recommendation in Lonely Planet. Luckily we booked the tour about a month in advance since we saw many people being turned away. Our guide",
          "We joined the guided tour at 12 noon which enabled us to visit the debating chamber and one of the select committee rooms. Debates take place from 2pm so later tours miss this. Earlier tours miss the select committee rooms so we timed it well. There is a lot to pack into the",
          "The Parliamentary tour is a privilege. The \"Introducing Parliament\" 60-minute, guided tour of the buildings, its various functions, rooms and how parliament 'works' in New Zealand is excellent value. The history, the artwork and knowledge of the guides makes it well worth the",
          "This 1-hour guided tour is a must-see attraction if you travel to Wellington. We were taken by the experienced tour guide to many locations, e.g. banquet hall, debating chamber, library and art gallery, etc. The special base isolator was installed under the Parliament House to",

          "Booked ahead online and it\u2019s free. Informative seeing a young country trying somethings in a different way. Tour lasts approx one hour good if you can spare the time not a must do.",
          "We were fortunate to get there in time to join a tour. During the tour besides seeing the important locations within the building, we also got information on how the government runs. For someone from the States, this was most informative. There were also flyers that went into",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the short video presentation and the hour long tour which runs a number of times each day. Expect security checks and allow time for this at entry. Learn the history and basis of New Zealand democracy. Worth every penny.",

          "We almost skipped this free tour... Don't! It was fascinating to compare how different a bill is passed thru their system. Our tour guide was knowledgeable about government, the buildings are beautiful inside. And they explain how they raised the building to make it earthquake",
          "We enjoyed visiting this area close to the water and some good restaurants nearby too. A friendly staff member even offered to take a picture of us - got to love these friendly Kiwis. The buildings overlooked a beautiful wooden building across the other side of the road .",

          "And I dont mean the beehive but the old parliament building is just stunning and if you are lucky enough to see into the parliamentary library it is just amazing. Thank goodness it has been earthquake proofed",
          "It was a great one hour guided tour of the parliaments. You'd get to see where the leaders seat during their talks and meetings. If you want to more about the history and government of NZ you'd want to go for this tour, It's free. But youre not allowed to take photos inside.",
          "This tour is well worth the time. The tour guides are extremely knowledgable.You are given a lesson in New Zealand Democracy and history. The tour takes you into buildings old and new, including an exhibit of the earthquake retrofitting. There is a lot of eye candy on this tour.",
          "One of the most interesting tours of a parliament i have been on. Full of interesting facts. Even walked past the recent Prime Minister. Had to wait to get into the debating chamber but well worth it for question time, Jacinda was on form!",
          "Very informative tours, which need to be booked. The tour is an hour long and is very interesting. It does pay to book as numbers are limited but there are tours run every hour.",
          "This is a prominent building, nicknamed 'The bee hive\" Unlikely you will miss this parliament building if you are walking around Wellington CBD. Interesting architecture.",
          "3 distinctly different buildings make up this set of buildings. The middle one was stopped for the war and the one side was not added afterwards we were told. From the beehive on one end to the completely different building on the other, this is surely worth a short stop.",

          "I can highly recommend taking a guided tour of the parlament. It is for free, and takes around 1 hour. The buildings are very Nice from the inside, and you get to see a lot. Also the information given by the guide is quite interesting. Last stop on the Tour was the basement,",
          "We visited the Parliament building but didnt want to do the tour. Happy to sit and view with a coffee, in the foyer. Clean toilets, nice seating area, somewhere to leave your bag whilst you are in the building. Great opportunity to participate in the 30 minute or 1 hour tour if",
          "This is a worthwhile visit, both to see the building as well as having the chance to ask the knowledgeable guides about New Zealand governance and history.",
          "We were only able to do the 30 minute tour. I would suggest checking the times and going for the 1 hour tour instead. It was interesting to hear about the government and take a look at some of the rooms.",
          "The old building is excellent but sadly destroyed buy something they call the beehive.The place was not open at the time of the visit so we enjoyed the grounds and the old building and wondered who was responsible and why they created the new building.",
          "We visited the Parliament Buildings as part of a walking tour. The bee hive is probably the most outrageous government building we have seen but is in fact only one of 3 or 4 structures that make up the government of New Zealand. We learned that there is in fact a tunnel linking",
          "is all we did, but it was worth it. Security vetting was pretty tight as would be expect3ed. The highlights tour was very informative, both about the building, the government and the electoral process, and how these have changed in New Zealand over the years",
          "Free tours are available every hour. The tour lasts an hour but allow time prior to commencement to check in your belongings, cameras etc. You don\u2019t need to be au fait with the politics of New Zealand to enjoy the tour. The guides are informative and you never have time to",
          "We did the 1 hour tour of the parliament which was well worth it. Our guide Euan was excellent, knowledgeable about the buildings and history with a sense of humour that we really appreciated.",
          "It looks pretty good and it is a special building, looking a bit tired though - however if you've never seen it up close then come and have a look .... its a good photo op :)",
          "So different to our baying 650 MP's. There was a little barracking but nothing really. The guided tour was fascinating",
          "Took the tour of Parliament today and was impressed by architectural features especially the round building know as the beehive. The tour guide was knowledgeable and gave an interesting presentation. Would highly recommend visiting this complex.",
          "We did this spontaneously while walking past the building, and were glad we did. Tour guide was articulate with a good sense of humor and took us thru several chambers while comparing and contracting NZ politics to other countries. Thoroughly enjoyable and recommended!",
          "Get a guided tour through the \"Beehive\" Parliament. You will then understand how coalition government is very different from the government in the U.S. Our guide was fabulous--she was very informative and knew the answer to every question, and knew our system of government so",
          "The tour is really good, informative, interesting and provides good information on the political structure in New Zealand. Access was wide and explained well. Very interesting.",
          "This is a free tour of about an hour. You have a short video to start which explains about the NZ voting system and then your guide takes you around the different areas of the seat of Government. We visited the historic chambers where Parliament sits, viewing galleries, select",

          "The Parliament Tour was approximately one hour and long and along with seeing the interior of the building, it provided detailed insight into the NZ political process. At the end of the tour learned about the earthquake modifications made to the building. Photos not allow in",

          "Close to the centre , these impressive public buildings are well worth a visit. The hourly free tours give an excellent insight into the workings of NZ parliament",
          "We just timed it right to join a tour and were very glad we did. Everyone was most accommodating and welcoming from the security people at the door to those on the reception desk. There is a cloakroom to leave all your belongings, as mobile phones and cameras are not allowed.",
          "Great buildings, very interesting, made more so by our amazing tour guide Kim, she was very knowledgeable and shared this, keeping the whole tour interesting at the same time, she is a real credit to your workforce.",

          "We were early for a train so popped across the road to check out the Parliament Buildings. As it was late Saturday afternoon they were not open and the tours were not running but it was really interesting looking round the outside. The grounds are very well kept and the old",
          "I don't think you can visit a nation's capital and not see their Parliament! This tour was exactly what you would expect from a Parliament tour. They explained the New Zealand political system well, show you all the chambers in Parliament, show you the library and committee",
          "I can\u2019t complain because it\u2019s free. The guide seemed new, and spent a lot of time telling us we were running late... we probably wouldn\u2019t have been if she hasn\u2019t brought it up so often. She also repeated herself a lot. We had our 6 year old who loves museums and tours and he was",
          "Took our 11 and 15year old for the hour tour, was really informative and could've stayed another hour. Thought we would see more of the Beehive though so was a little disappointed. The old parliament buildings have been restored beautifully and so nice to see. Kids came away",
          "Better things to see in Wellington really....beehive seems to need a bit of a facelift or at least a wash!!!",
          "A great way to learn about New Zealand and their government. Strongly suggest taking a guided tour as there is quite a bit to learn and see. Tour guides very impressive and able to objectively discuss their government and how it works. Stunningly well built and maintained",
          "Well worth a look at the Beehive and surrounding government buildings. An interesting tour giving good historic and current info. The surrounding grounds are quiet and lovely for a stroll. Benches in the shade made this a quiet spot to watch the world go by.",
          "Tours take about an hour. Very informative and interaction is encouraged. Great to go inside the Chamber and see where everyone sits during debates and question time. Tour guide was very enthusiastic. Not suitable for young children but older ones were interested",

          "Interesting tour of NZ's parliament free of charge, with very knowledgable guide. Get to go into the cool places you see on tv! Highly recommended.",
          "I think it is not inappropriate to say that the old parliament building complex is best piece of architecture in New Zealand. The Parliament House, Library and the more controversial Beehive form the best man-made landscape in Wellington. Having a picnic in the front lawn is",

          "The place looks better than the pictures that I've seen. Also much much bigger and really quite an historic place.",
          "The bee-hive building is perhaps the standout of modern 60s style architecture yet there are many buildings of interest in the same vicinity. For that alone it\u2019s worth s quit visit. We arrived without planning and spoke to a security guard on break. He gave a personal run down",
          "This interesting modern structure sits befittingly adjacent to the old Parliament buildings. Definitely work a look and can include old St Paul\u2019s church and Wellington cathedral nearby. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",

          "We walked from Mt Victoria down through the botanical gardens, cemetery to Parliament which was quite a steep but easy walk. There was no one around and we got to sit on a bench seat within the grounds to sit and ponder what was what. A tour group arrived with a guide and that",
          "We had a 1hr tour and it was great. As it was a Sunday we could go to all the locations and the tour guide was very knowledgeable. The highlight was being able to visit the debating chamber. This is a must do for visitors to Wellington, even for New Zealanders.",
          "We had a lovely tour with an enthusiastic guide. We got to observe the parliament in session. As Americans, we found this most interesting and exciting. The buildings are gorgeous, and the work to stabilize them in the event of earthquake is amazing. Each staff member we",

          "History of nz parliamentary system shown. Lovely building and worth a visit if you have a couple of hours",
          "If you want to visit Parliament, I recommend taking the free tour. You are able to learn a lot about the history of the buildings, workings of government and history of the country. They even explain how the buildings are equipped for earthquakes.",
          "Architecture is worth the time and like everywhere in NZ the landscape is beautiful. Worth the effort.",
          "Okay place, but not much there, and buckets of areas cant get into. I would make a short trip if a Kiwi and keep it for simple photo if from overseas. Just to tick the box.",
          "We took the free tour of the Beehive executive building, Parliament House and the Parliamentary Library and enjoyed it very much. There are many interesting and lovely spots (no photos allowed though) and the earthquake protection display at the tour end is fascinating.",
          "Nice for a few pictures but we honestly didn't spend more than 20 minutes there. I wouldn't take a detour to visit this place unless for special interests.",
          "My wife and I took the tour with Jennifer. A very good presenter and guide who certainly knew her craft. Very engaging and happy to take all questions and no difficulty in answering any of them! A rare treat to see the workings of the main buildings and at no cost aside from an",
          "An easy walk quite central in Wellington. Had a free guided tour of the beehive and the old Parliament Building and the library. The tour was about an hour long and very interesting. Then went upstairs to the gallery as Parliament was sitting. That too was very interesting. If",
          "Free and has a small security check when you enter. You then sit down and wait to be picked up by your guide at the time you booked for. Tour starts with an introductory video, then you are off around the various buildings. This is quite interesting and a lot is explained to",
          "Great to see the building and if you have time to go on the guided tour. Strict security to get into the building as you would expect but well worth a visit",
          "Always enjoy taking friends to see the NZ parliament ... not many countries in the world allow you to enter the chamber, or watch the live proceedings in person. Always interesting to know you have walked where the Queen has walked, and to see the artifacts and architecture.",
          "As it was our 1st time in Wellington we visited Parliament as it was one of those 'when in Rome' type things to do and were quite pleasantly surprised how informative and interesting the visit went. We took the tour - which I would recommend to visitors - as their tour guides",
          "It's nice to have pictures taken outside the Parliament buildings, but it's nicer to have the guided tour inside. The tours have scheduled timings and can be booked online earlier. You can also walk in, they will accommodate you. Photos are not allowed, but it'll make you focus",

          "Came to the Beehive and took a shot jumping in front of it. Saw a reporter I went to school with and had a nice chat. enjoyed.",
          "We strolled around the parliament buildings. Obviously the government welcomes ordinary people because they have made visiting its main buildings so easy - and made visitors feel very welcome. The architecture varies from classic colonial to modern off-style to the creative,",
          "Unluckily we picked the wrong day to visit and the debating chamber was closed to the public but we were still able to see limited areas. The tour was well worth the time and the guide had a good sense of humor and knowledge. I would definitely visit again when everything was",
          "We took a stroll to see the parliament buildings on the morning before we headed home as 8 year old we were with was particularly interested in seeing the beehive. She wasn't disappointed! Worth a look.",
          "We pre-booked the free tour for our party of six by simply calling the day prior. During school holidays booking makes sense, I think otherwise you can simply show up. Tours depart on the hour. The tour was very informative and pitched at the perfect level. My form of",
          "I've always wanted to see the Beehive and this time we were very lucky! The tour started at 10am and we were there at 0945 so that we didn't have to wait for long. Our tour guide spoke well and quite funny too. She knew the history of the buildings, how the parliament works,",

          "We really enjoyed the 1hr free tour. The buildings are magnificent and the tour was really infoemative. The guide was able to answer all of our questions and was enthusiastic about it. We did the 10am tour on a Saturday and didn't have a booking which wasn't a problem. I did",
          "Tours of Parliament leave on the hour and are free . It is worth every minute as so much information is given to you in that hour. You get to tour all the parts of the buildings and get real insight into NZ parliamentary systems and indeed NZ history. The building has meaningful",
          "Wellington, being the capital of NZ is steeped in history. There are 4 parliament buildings in the city. They look magnificent in their splendour. On this day it was not possible to go past the gates due to security issues but looking from outside you can imagine the grandeur",

          "A great way to spend an hour - a few hard core tourism businesses could pick up a tip or two here. Well organized, paced and structured, good mix of visual and spoken info, varied info given and delivered by an Excellent guide - she was an import to NZ and english her second",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Wrights Hill Fortress is a counter bombardment coastal artillery battery in the Karori suburb of Wellington, New Zealand. It was built between 1942 and 1947 and is predominantly underground, with numerous tunnels linking the war shelters, gun emplacements, magazines, plotting rooms and engine room - which are, at some points, over 50 feet underground. The fort was intended to house three 9.2\" Mk. XV guns, but only two guns were installed and the fort never saw action. After World War II was over, fort commanders fired both of the guns (Gun number one in 1946 and the second in 1947). The fall of the shot was observed in Cook Strait and these test firings (three rounds on each occasion) were deemed a success. In 1960, somewhat ironically, both of the guns were sold to the Japanese as scrap metal, the very nation Wrights Hill Fortress was constructed to defend Wellington against. The design of the fort is similar to the Stony Batter and Whangaparaoa 9.2\" Mk. XV batteries, near Auckland.\nWrights Hill Fortress is currently in the hands of a preservation society and can be visited, by the public, on Waitangi Day, ANZAC Day, the Queen's birthday, and Labour Day. Tours may be booked, at other dates and times, by prior arrangement. The Fortress is listed as a Category I Historic Place.\n\n\n== TV and Feature Films ==\nWrights Hill is frequently used by TV and feature filmmakers. The Fellowship of the Ring sound designers used the tunnels to record echo effects for the Mines of Moria sequence.  \nThe New Zealand horror film The Devil's Rock was filmed in the tunnels and gun pits, standing in for a World War II German bunker.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCoastal fortifications of New Zealand\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWrights Hill Fortress Restoration Society (Inc.)",

          "Rose aficionados would love this part of the Botanical Gardens. It is easiest accessed from the bottom level , rather than from the top entrance. The varieties are named and there are information boards located throughout. The gardens adjoin the cafe and the Begonia House, so",
          "Part of the Botanic Gardens but around the corner from the Main (Founders) Entrance. A nice peaceful, relaxing garden but the roses were past their best in March when we visited.",
          "We visited the Lady Norwood Rose Garden in February - just a little late in the season. Although the gardens were still quite beautiful and very well maintained, some of the roses had passed their peak for blooms for the year. And, being later in the afternoon, the highly touted",
          "Beautiful blooms, large variety of roses, cute amusing ducks, gorgeous range of potted coleus. Peaceful relaxing meander for an hour or so.",
          "Rose garden set up is really good in a large round garden area with fountain in the middle. All different types of roses with many colours but half of the them looked dead so visually looked so so. Maybe roses were not in bloom in early March but you have to grade it on the",
          "If you love roses, this is the dream place to be. A huge selection of roses in every colour to excite you eyes and nose. Visit the greenhouses as well. Didn't have time for the cafe but spent a lot of time in the gardens.",
          "My wife and I were on a tour and visited this lovely place. The flowers and plants were fantastic! It is great that they have labels on all their plants.",
          "This is a well laid out garden but was not at it\u2019s best when we visited ( late Feb ) . Probably looks great at peak flowering time.",
          "The rose beds were patchy and by this time the roses had become old blossoms so it was not great but an interesting enterprise.",
          "If you are into botanical gardens this is the place for you. Beautiful flowers plus close by there is a beautiful waterfall. Coffe shop/cafe on premises.",
          "This was a lovely rose garden and despite the decanting of cruise passengers provided easy access to all the planting. The Lady Norwood begonia house is well worth a look too and there is an excellent cafe next door.",
          "Coming from Cable car museum, we walked down to the city through the Botanical Garden and found this amazing place! Lots of varieties of roses! Great place to visit during summer.",
          "Fabulous flowers both in the Rose Garden and in the adjoining tropical greenhouse - pick the right time of year for the rose blooms",
          "About 80% of the roses were in bloom when we visiting late December. With nearly 200 roses, there are several that that should appeal to anyone. There is a cafe adjacent to the garden, and the Begonia house is also right beside the garden. The begonia house is worth checking out",
          "Nice rose garden. Interesting that they are transitioning to 'chemical free' rose gardening, and some of the roses are showing signs of black spot or something on their leaves, as you would expect... so interesting to see that some varieties are more resistant than others. I",
          "Well maintained and in full bloom it was wonderful. There is also a begonia house and cafe, very family friendly.",
          "Many colors of roses with ducks walking among them, probably attracted to the centrally located pond. A very relaxing atmosphere.",
          "Heaps to do here: the rose garden, the begonia house which includes many orchids, the cafe and a walk through the adjacent botanical gardens. Rose displays depend on the season, December saw the roses in full bloom. The Lady Norwood Begonia House is fabulous - full of exotic",
          "Excellent place if you are looking to go for a bit of a walk and admire nature at the same! The variety of different roses and all flowers in general is absolutely wonderful! must visit! Check the cafe next door while you there!",
          "So many beautiful types of Rose's. Lovely respite. There is a cafe and toiletries. Nice for a short break from a hectic tour.",
          "I don\u2019t love botanical gardens as a rule but this one was a pleasant surprise. Some of the biggest red roses I\u2019ve ever seen! A peaceful was to spend a few hours and they have a coffee shop as well.",
          "At base of the Botanic garden which situated on mount Victoria is the Rose garden.All roses blooming on our visit in early Dec and if one is a rose enthusiast it\u2019s a must visit . Very colourful with many many different roses. Extremely well tended to by gardeners.",
          "We were here when most of the roses were in full flower. A feast for the eyes with some truly vibrant colours. Very relaxing to sit and just enjoy being around such beauty. The perfume from some of the roses attracted plenty of bumblebees. Very well cared for garden that you can",
          "We were just in time for the start of the rose season. Beautiful beds with many colors and species. Easy to continue from here to town.",
          "While we only stopped here briefly. In addition to the extensive rose beds (just beginning the spring bloom), we saw the Japanese Peace Shrine. Set with a waterfall, a stone lamp on the water contains a flame carried from Hiroshima; it will burn as long as nuclear weapons",
          "The rose garden has a really relaxing feel to it, it is well laid out and maintained. They have a good selection of roses, which each bed labeled and what really struck me was the smell of the roses when I entered the garden which I have not experienced in other rose gardens I",
          "Pretty formal garden with groupings of the same species of roses. Some unusual varieties of roses. They have a good looking cafe/coffee shop. Plenty of benches.",
          "This was a beautiful park that has lovely flowers. My husband grabbed a coffee and friends had scones. The roses weren't up, but other flowers were. It was a nice stp",
          "I come here every week to walk around and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. Great to grab a coffee in the nearby cafe or just take a stroll around. A perfect date spot as well.",
          "we took the tour and walked around the grounds but unfortunately this was not the season for flowers",
          "While it might not have been the peak seaon to visit the rose gardens in winter, we did enjoy discovering the gardens, there were some flowers, it was a very peaceful place to visit. All was not lost as the Lady Norton Rose Gardens sit in front of the Begonia House and Picnic",
          "Great for the summer walks on the weekend or take friends from out of town. Kids love the fountain and there's loads more in the botanic gardens including the begonia house right there with tropical plants and water lilies.",
          "Lovely scents abound in season (about November to March). Well look after. Just by the Begonia House and fabulous Picnic cafe. Cafe very popular and rightly so. Still very good off season but you'll probably spend less time here and more in the Botanic Gardens.",
          "Even on a wet and rainy day, these gardens were beautiful to wander around and to simply appreciate the flowers. A lovely little cafe is on the corner, with hot drinks and food and a small greenhouse filled with tropical plants should not be missed either.",
          "The best time to visit is during the flowering season. However, even when the roses are dormant the beauty of the landscaping is striking. Being sited in the botanical gardens there is always something of interest.",
          "This garden is fantastic to have stroll and enjoy the roses. The design is really beautiful and the roses come in a wide variety of colours. The ducks that hang around the garden add to the lovely atmosphere and the cafe next to the garden is good to have a cup of coffee. Plenty",
          "We stopped here in the middle of a busy day of sightseeing. We felt rejuvenated after walking among the gorgeous roses and the indoor gardens. There is also a spot for lunch and we had a good coffee break.",
          "The roses were all in bloom but some were a little past their peak. Nevertheless it was a beautiful sight and the gardens are very well maintained. One of the workers was skimming the fountain pool and asked if I would like him to turn up the fountain water pressure, which he",
          "Lovely place to visit, even when the roses aren't in season. Beautifully kept gardens, flat and easy to get around, gift shop with some lovely NZ souvenir items (mostly 'nature' themed), begonia house, and one of my absolutely favourite cafes! The food at the cafe is absolutely",
          "We visited in March, the best time for the rose's would have been a month or so ago. Still a lovely place to see.",
          "Reached after the descent (from the Cable Car) through the beautiful botanic gardens, a large variety of roses are planted out in a majectic display. Many hybrid tea and floribunda varieties to delight the connoiseur. Nearby cafe, toilet facilities, gift shop and Japenese peace",
          "This is another wonderful New Zealand botanical garden. The flowers are stunning and profuse. There is an African section, an Australian section, an aviary, a vast rose garden and greenhouses with the largest tuberous begonias that I've ever seen. And of course the tallest",
          "The Lady Norwood complex of Begonia House, formal fountain, pergolas, and those lovely rose beds occupy 12,000 square feet which is a miniscule part of the nearly one square mile of Wellington Botnical Garden. But what a lovely part it is! The garden has more than 100",
          "This is a must for those exploring Wellington\u2019s Botanical Gardens. The rose garden is very beautiful and close to other lovely sights in the Gardens. The resident ducks are also very cute!",
          "We stumbled across this excellent rose garden in our walk down through the Botanical Gardens to the Wellington waterfromt. We were fortunate enough to visit in February when the roses were in full bloom. As an added bonus there is a nice cafe located in a corner of the garden.",
          "Going to this rose garden was part of our city tour of Wellington. Beautiful blooming roses and the facility had a wonderful gift shop. This is where we could find a nice picture book of New Zealand.",
          "After a beautiful walk through the Botanic Garden we came to this top of the line attraction at the bottom of the hill. The rose garden was in beautiful bloom late in January, and the hothouses were filled with color. A feast for the eye! There was no entrance fee. Still,",
          "The garden is at the bottom of the botanical gardens that come down from the top of the city. The rose gardens are well laid out and there is a cafe at one side. However what you must go and see is to one side- the peace flame. It is a small waterfall falling into a small",
          "Well worth visiting, roses of every colour well cared for and marked to easily read names and varieties",
          "As always the Rose Gardens are magnificent. No matter the time of year it's always a pleasure to view.",
          "What a beautiful spot away from the hustle and bustle of Wellington City Centre. What a glorious facility too for anyone working nearby to be able to while away their lunch break in such tranquillity. Unfortunately our visit was in early spring so we did not see the roses at",
          "I suppose it depends on the time of year as to whether this is impressive, but in late January..Not so much.",
          "As part of a walk thru the Botanic gardens well worth a visit but will not make the top ten of world rose gardens",
          "Nothing of great spectacle here, just a basic set up of a rose garden. Not especially large and easy to walk through in a few minutes.",
          "In the heart of Wellington you can find this oasis of calm and it's free. The botanical gardens are an amazing place to sit and reflect on life. Well worth a visit.",
          "What an incredible rose garden within the botanical gardens. It is beautifully laid out and is an absolute picture. The delicate orchids in the arboretum were simply stunning. The Lady Norwood rose garden certainly lives up to its reputation. It is a delight to wander",
          "Probably best viewed in November & December for the finest displays. However the blooms were still good & the sweet fragrance is a delight. Very good cafe on sight. The Rose garden can easily be fitted in a circular tour of about an hour with 3 other attractions. Funicular",
          "Found thru walking down from the funicular thru the botanic gardens. Gardens look nice and are of an age gone past. Cafe is a nice setting, run very militarily, normal food selection. Keep an ear out for the patter from the waiters and how many times you hear them say",
          "The variety of roses and their beauty is not to be missed. The garden was clean, the adjoining cafe was a delight, and the surrounding hillsides reminded me of Butchart Gardens in Victoria. This is nowhere near the expanse of Butchart, but well worth the time. Do not miss the",
          "This is worth a visit, especially if you like flowers in general, and roses in particular. The scent of all the roses is wonderful.",
          "Highly recommended, I can honestly say, that everytime, bar none, I've come away from this place satisfied with the service, food, coffee and atmosphere.",
          "Lots of ladies who lunch go to the cafe in the garden. The garden is nice when it's rose-blooming time. It's a formal garden, a bit severe. Years ago, people would spread loved ones' ashes in the gardens. But I think it's illegal now, though I rather suspect many folk still",
          "This is a nice sheltered and colourful place to visit on pretty much any day. You can usually find a park nearby so it is good for elderly folks, small children or if you just feel a bit lazy. When the roses are in full swing, the colours are superb and the blooms massive,",
          "Catch the cable car up and walk back down, the roses are in full flower at the moment and really beautiful.",
          "The view over the Rose Garden from the walkway coming down is incredible - such a wide variety of roses and the kaleidoscope of colours is amazing. So beautifuly laid out leaving room to wander among the beds and get up close to these beautiful specimens. There is also a cafe",
          "It should be a beautiful rose garden if you are coming in the right season, between November to April each year. However if coming in October, all the roses have not blossomed yet, not the right time. The garden is not really big, just medium size, but when full with roses this",
          "The roses are in full bloom currently as are the Icelandic poppies. Wander past the cricket on the adjacent oval or stop for a cup of tea.",
          "The rose garden is looking particularly good at the present time, and is the current highlight of the Botanic Garden. Good adjacent cafe, although it does get busy.",
          "We got off the cable car at Kelburn and took a leisurely walk through the gardens and all the way down to the Rose Garden. I have never seen so many colors on roses! Beautiful. They all had cute names like hot pants and heart throb.",
          "Nice rose gardens, adjacent to some glass houses with some more colourful plants and a small souvenir shop. The garden cafe is also next to the Rose Garden. A short walk from the top of the cable car.",
          "Well worth a visit if you like to see well laid out gardens with pleantiful information. If you are visiting the botanic gardens or the observatory it is worth going in.",
          "I was here in mid-November, which was likely to late in the growing season to be visiting a rose garden. In full bloom, however, I bet it would be beautiful.",
          "The entire botanical gardens is well worth a look. While the roses were only just starting to show colour, there was lots more in the same gardens to look at.",
          "An appealing menu, very friendly staff, great atmosphere, and you can visit the begonia house when you've had enough to eat.",
          "When we were there not many roses were seen but still we saw some. It is bottom of the botanic garden, some walk from the cable car station.",
          "As it was winter, the actual amount of flowering roses was minimal, but I could easily see how spectacular it would be in the proper flowering season. Nice to just leisurely walk around and enjoy the range of plants. Also very clean and well maintained.",
          "Some Friends from O/seas arrived for a coupla days.. First day.. clear blue sky... Rose Garden, here we come.. Drive up(7 seater) .. and let them loose... return in 90 mins...broke up into 2/3 groups, fotos everything , group fotos, individual selfies, etc, etc. lunch etc at",
          "A great spot for Wellingtonians and visitors right through summer and early autumn. Always well tended.",
          "Huge range or Roses and good range of tropical plants inside shed. Don't miss to visit at least once in summer for rose season. And whole year for inside tropical plants.",
          "Great coffee in the cafe and a wonderful place to look at some amazing flowers. Check out inside for more interesting flower species",
          "My absolute FAVOURITE part of the botanical gardens, the greenhouse is a close second. The cafe is close by and you can see the roses from inside.",
          "Nice place for a visit and morning tea - very pretty flower display - at the bottom of the hill from the Cable car",
          "There are plenty of Roses here with all different colors but it was raining so didn't get many photos. There are a cafe and indoor plants inside as well.",
          "What a lovely rose garden. So many different kinds of roses. A lovely botanical greenhouse with some amazing plants and a cute gift shop as well as a resaurant",
          "We visited Lady Norwood Rose Garden recently on a Celebrity Solstice Cruise Ship excursion. We enjoyed viewing the beautiful selection of roses on display and the photo opportunities afforded. We found the time we spent here on this shore excursion was not long enough and it",
          "A lovely series of rose beds, all the better because you get the beauty without the work. We took the cable car up and walked down the small hill via Lady Norwood's roses. Many of them smelled divine and it was lovely to \"stop and smell the roses\". I was surprised that so many",
          "Have visited many better rose gardens, tucked out of the way and if not driving a bit of a hike to get there. Instructions as to get arounfd the Botanic gardens not good, especially with its steep terrain.",
          "The rose garden is very nicely laid out. The blocks of roses are labeled, and appear to be well taken care of. There is a cafe on site to allow for a bit of refreshment, or lunch.",
          "This is a perfect ending to a ride up the Wellington Cable Car and a walk down through the Botanic Garden. There are greenhouses with begonias, palms, and succulents for winter or rainy day visits, but the roses are blooming primarily in summer. There is an excellent caf\u00e9 with",
          "We visited this garden after our trip on the street car and walking down hill. a formal rose garden and a real treat for anyone who loves roses.",
          "Caught the cable car up and strolled down. I planned on rewarding myself with a wine at the bottom but in reality the wine was totally forgotten. I had the most relaxing walk down the mountain, enjoyed flowers, waterfalls and birdlife. Finally ended up at the cafe enjoying a",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the huge variety of planting and had an excellent lunch at the well run conservatory cafe",
          "At the height of the Rose season this is a lovely place to spend an hour or so admiring the various variety of roses The tropical \"hothouse\" is well worth a visit (no charge) and a cafe adjoins it. Take the Cable Car up. If you have the energy and time stroll down through the",
          "We visited this garden on our way down from Wellington botanical garden. As it was autumn, the flowers were not in full bloom, but beautiful nevertheless. Found at the base of the botanical gardens.",
          "Roses in abundance here in lovely surrounds. There is also a tropical house and cafe with free toilets. The kids will love the very same ducks.",
          "We had a half hour for this site. Could have spent a lot more time. The greenhouse has begonias and orchids and lotus. BEAUTIFUL.",
          "We walked down to the Rose garden from the cable car, a nice downward stroll. Rose garden is spectacular, roses labelled. We were able to eat our lunch at the begonia house next to the roses.",
          "We visited after walking through the main botanic gardens - all of the roses are currently in bloom and there were lots of varieties to see and smell. We didn't spend a huge amount of time here, but definitely worth passing through.",
          "Otherwise you will be sorely disappointed at all the pruned and roseless rose bushes! They have ducks that wander about here, too, and a small greenhouse you can walk through.",
          "A part of the Wellington Botanic Gardens, this small garden is not to be missed. There are not just roses here but there are numerous other varieties. The greenhouse contains many varieties of exotic plants and flowers. There is also a nice caf\u00e9 next to the garden.",
          "Beautiful range and display of roses with an easy walk to view and smell them. This is a natural and enjoyable place to visit.",
          "We enjoy wandering around the rose gardens no matter what season. It is always peaceful. There is a small fountain/duck pond in the middle of the roses with seating around. Small children love to watch and play. The roses are spectacular when in flower. There is a good cafe here",
          "In the middle of a lovely stroll through Wellington's gardens the roses are phenomenal. We were about 7 to 10 days from seeing the full rose garden at its best but it was still outstanding. Lot's of different varieties, colors and something for everyone. GO!",
          "I am so jealous of the New Zealanders to have this beautiful garden to reflect. \"Smell the Roses\" Definately put this on your 'must see' list.",
          "if you are visiting the Wellington Botanical Gardens, don't miss out on the Rose Garden. Absolutely beautiful with so many varieties of roses.. my favourite one was called Rock'n Roll :)",
          "This is a must visit place if you enjoy Botanical Gardens. There is a cafe and hot house located nearby which are both worth a visit. Make this your destination after riding the cable car to the top of Kelburn and meandre downhill towards the Rose Gardens.",
          "We visited the gardens during a tour of the botanical gardens and were amazed at the displays. Unfortunately for us the displays were not their best as having passed their peak flowering but even so it was lovely.",
          "We spent quite a while here beautiful roses many varities well set out ducks roaming around there is a hot house as well and a gift shop",
          "Lots of lovely roses to smell and admire. Definitely take some time out to visit here. Has a cafe as well.",
          "I live in walking distance so I can visit whenever the mood takes me, the seasons change or when a special greenhouse plant is flowering. Beautiful roses outside and the greenhouse is full of wonders. Highly recommended - a slow way to enjoy Nature. The fun way to do it is",
          "Great variety of roses; amazing colour; old and new - plus those that might replace those not doing so well; delightful to walk around; great for photos!",
          "The lovely rose garden is a great surprise in the new year. So many blooming flowers presented in a clear and delicate way. Very worth visiting.",
          "These gardens have been a central part of the Wellington Botanical Gardens for probably more than a century. They are in a lovely sheltered valley and have a huge variety of roses. There is a good cafe in these gardens also a gift shop and Glass House full of all sorts of",
          "What a beautiful well presented garden very well maintained they have a cafe there as well but we didn't stop, just walked around the beautiful garden. We walk through the botanical garden and at the bottom of botanical garden down the road a bit further you see lady norwoods",
          "visited this garden a couple of times during the entire year, and even outside the \"rose season\" (ie winter) this is a garden worth visiting, combine it with the botanical garden then, that is located next to it.",
          "But then, what is? Nice tea garden to visit at the right time of year if the roses are in bloom. Does not quite live up to the rest of the Botanical Gardens standards.",
          "We went to the rose gardens yesterday. It was a lovely sunny day and the rise were in full bloom . The fountain water was dirty it could do with a clean out . I heard a little bit say to his mother , oh the water is very dirty for the little ducks who were sitting beside the",
          "I love roses and these would be some of the nicest ive seem!!! So many beautiful roses all in full bloom. Amazing",
          "Having ridden up the hill in the cable car, we walked down, through the botanic gardens, then along to this rose garden, and then down the hill all the way into the city. All very pleasant. Glasshouse is full of luscious begonias, bromeliads and ferns. Lunch at the Picnic",
          "We enjoyed wandering around the roses and had lunch in the cafeteria, which was very good. Not as extensive and as easily accessible as Auckland's Parnell Rose Gardens, but quite lovely.",
          "It was pleasant just sitting in the sun whilst my wife took scores of photos here and in the Boronia House. Take the Cable Car to its top and then walk downhill for 20 minutes. Lovely spot.",
          "This garden was created by Lady Norwood in 1953 and there are over 300 varieties of roses blooming. A very pretty garden and we think would be wonderful when in bloom. Just stroll through and ENJOY!",
          "These gardens are at the base of the botanic gardens. They're not massive but are beautifully laid out. All beds are labelled with the name of that particular rose plus details of the grower. We were there just before they were at their best but the bushes were very healthy",
          "A very nice place and when I was there way less touristic compared to other places. Maybe it is a 30 minutes walk away from the cable car? But worth to go there, and don't forget to drink your flatwhite there!",
          "The location is ideal and the rose beds are superbly laid out. As it is still October the roses are not yet in bloom but it is clear that they are very healthy.",
          "Nice place to visit in the Botanic Gardens. it's not such a big rose garden, but it's pretty to visit if you're close.",
          "Beautifully laid out, this rose garden is probably stunning in season. Right now there were just a few rogue roses in bloom, but we still enjoyed following the longish path to end up here.",
          "If you are a rose garden fan - and I am - then the Lady Norwood Garden is a superb example of the genre. The roses are well chosen and the beds maintained with skill and attention. This is obviously well-loved by staff and visitors. Don't miss it.",
          "We recently visited and there is nothing to see if it's not rose season. You can see that the garden has potential and I am sure if beautiful if it's the right time of the year. If it's not the right time of year, skip it.",
          "The dinning room is really too noisy but the service and food makes up for it. The food was well cooked and tasty. The service was helpful and friendly. Perhaps a little over priced for what we got but it's a bit of a touristy place and was a lovely way to end our tour of the",
          "Though the Botanic Garden in which it is located, is much older, the 1950's rose garden looks settled and lovely. We liked roaming around different rows of rose bushes and seeing the interesting names given them. I spotted one or two that I have in my own garden in California",
          "Well laid out gardens although at this time of year, winter, nothing in bloom. However a free visit to the Glass Houses are worth a visit. There is also a Coffee shop on site",
          "We walked through this on the way down from the hill. Take the cable car up and walked back down. Lovely walk of about 1 hour. Well worth seeing the flowers here.",
          "Stopped here as part of a tour, a fountain in the middle and paths going from there to the rose gardens. It was nice that the names were displayed on some of the roses. There is also a large glass house with indoor plants, a caf\u00e9 and toilets. Nice and quiet and a good way to",
          "This beautiful garden is lovely to visit and walk around in. The rose collection is fantastic. The greenhouse houses a fantastic collection of orchids. There is a nice cafe in the rose garden for tea. Lots of sculptures around the grounds and scenic views of the harbor.",
          "Although visiting on a rainy day in winter, it was still a beautifully calm & serene place to visit. There were still roses in bloom and the laid out pathway to the fountain in the middle seems typical of an English country house.",
          "Even in winter, the rose garden was a nice place to visit. We loved the layout. I can only imagine the beauty when the roses are in full bloom.",
          "The rose garden is a lovely spot to enjoy some sunshine on a cool Welly day. Obviously in winter the roses are few and far between but during the warmer months the roses and fragrance in the air is amazing!",
          "Any time of the year, this display of roses is well worth a visit, for beauty, contemplation, reflection, and a must for Wedding Photo shoots in Wellington. Peaceful and serene, surrounded by many other Botanical Gardens features, also worth exploring.",
          "There is always something to see, otherwise just go in the glasshouse where the tropical plants are.",
          "We went here when the roses were in full bloom and the scent and view was beautiful. It is a lovely walk to the gardens which is also overlooked by a cafe where you can sit and have a drink admiring the flowers.",
          "Not the best time of year to go, but I was in Wellington, and it wouldn't be the same without a walk up to the rose garden and a coffee at the cafe there. You have to feed the sparrows a wee crumb. If you are patient, they will pick it out of your fingers, on the wing.",
          "Have visited these gardens over many years. Always enjoy our walk around them. Always something to see throughout the year. Love their herb garden. Roses are the highlight.",
          "If you love roses this is the place to be. Me and my friends visited and was astonished how many different kinds there are. Some have no smell and some have a lovely rich smell. The cafe is really good, the fresh scones are tasty. You can either walk up from the city or get the",
          "came across this little place by accident as went for a walk , nice area and interesting history worth a visit if you have time spare",
          "No matter what time of the year you visit, there is always something lovely to see at the Lady Norwood Rose Garden. The garden is set around a geometric pattern and a fountain, where ducks often play. The roses are in their best splendour around November, but whenever I have",
          "This rose garden has over 300 varieties of rose! Some of them smell absolutely beautiful so its a good idea to get amongst them and see which ones smell the best. Its a minute away from the entrance to the botanical gardens, plus features a lovely warm greenhouse with more",
          "This is a well tended rose garden with many different types of the flower including one of my favourites: Honky Tonk Blue. Spend a few minutes strolling around to help you relax!",
          "We were there in early March and it was still beautiful. The garden is laid out like the spokes of a wheel. There is also a good greenhouse. We highly recommend Wellington Botanical Garden, but if you don't have time for that at least visit the rose garden. You won't be",
          "You can combine this with a ride up on the cable car, a walk downhill through the botanical gardens and then the rose garden before arriving back in the city centre. Well worth the effort!",
          "The garden was in full flower when we visited and the roses were completely wonderful. I've visited rose gardens from all over the world and this is one of the best. Staff were very helpful, getting us water, even when they had just closed for the day.",
          "I love this place whether the roses are in bloom or not. A chance to take time to \"smell the roses\". The garden is maintained very well and when the roses are in bloom, it's just magical.",
          "The rose were a little past their best when I visited but were still beautiful and one can visualise what the whole area would like at their best. Found downhill from the Wellington Botanical gardens, the Rose Garden has an excellent caf\u00e9, full of locals when I visited - which",
          "We were just looking for a place to sit for a while and enjoy a quiet evening. Although the weather hasn't been ideal, the roses are still in good order. A lovely area to just wander through and check out the fountain in the centre. If coming here during peak times, you are",
          "This is at the base of a hill. 9You vcan get he cable car to the top and walk down through the gardens to this res garden if you wish.) It is well laid out and, if rises are in bloom, would be quite lovely. (We were there towards the end of the flowering season and it was still",
          "We took the cable car to the top and then walked down to the rose garden and then back up to the cable car. Whole trip was about an hour. Got some lovely photos.",
          "Had lunch with a good friend here in November 2016. Lovely food and great service in the caf\u00e9. The garden is a lovely display of roses. A very pleasant and peaceful place, especially lovely on a summer day.",
          "I love the rose garden. There are so many varites in the beds, so many colours, and such a lovely scent. It is a lovely place to just sit and look and think. My son and daughter in law had their wedding reception there. There is a restaurant on site.",
          "We always take time to visit the rose garden when in Wellington. In summer and autumn there always seems to be plenty of blooms, a huge range of colours and roses which have the most beautiful perfume.",
          "A lovely place for a picnic. The flowers were beautiful and looked after well. There is a great cafe in the gardens so nice to visit on a sunny day.",
          "This is best visited after taking the Cable Car up the hill and walking down the hill thru the Botanical Gardens then it ends at the Rose Garden!!",
          "Very well laid out and a worthwhile detour when walking down through the Botanical Gardens after a ride on the Cable Car.",
          "Lovely place to visit, sit , relax. Lots of seating to admire all the blooms. Enjoyed the structure of the garden. Caf\u00e9 was a nice surprise. Definitely worth a visit",
          "Located in the Wellington Botanical Gardens the Lady Norwood Rose Gardens were so beautiful. I really enjoyed my easy walk to the rose gardens and the beautiful scenery I got to see. This would be a great place to have a picnic and is suitable for all ages. I really enjoyed this",
          "We went here on the same day as the botanical gardens nice roses , great collection of sub tropical-and tropical plants in the hot house, and a very good book shop",
          "The rose garden is located in one of the parts of the botanical gardens. It is a perfect place to stop for a cup of tea and a dessert in a small cafe located just on the spot.",
          "I'm not the biggest fan of flowers, but it was nice anyways. If you like flowers then it might be a very nice attraction.",
          "This garden is beautifully kept, and in the summer the roses are fragrant and colourful. There is also a conservatory showing lots of lovely plants, and a caf\u00e9 for refreshments.",
          "Great place to see many varieties of Rose then refresh at the cafe close by.before taking in the rest of the gardens.",
          "Again this is a part of the Botanic garden, a delight of roses. Supposedly 2,000. However the layout is not the greatest so the same disappoint that popped up with the Botanic Garden was again present.",
          "I loved roaming around this lovely rose garden and getting intoxicated by the fragrance of the roses! The lily pond and the begonia garden also worth a visit. If you like taking pictures, make sure you have enough battery left before going there. I took so many pictures and",
          "Formal design in intersected circle, this garden is lovely and traditional with a pond in the center. Wonderful place to sit and take in all the loveliness.",
          "Try not to miss this beautiful garden. It's full of colour and scents, and everywhere you turn, you'll want to take photos. Just gorgeous, and it has a lovely shop with gifts, plants, etc.",
          "Not only are the roses beautiful but there are numerous varieties and all are labeled. The names can be quite interesting in themselves. The greenhouse contains many varieties of exotic and sometimes amazing plants and flowers. Very nice!",
          "Gardens are beautiful and well maintained. Makes a great picnic spot or there is a cafe. Also playground near by for the kids.",
          "Holidaying in Wellington recently we visited the rose garden in the botanical gardens. Well set out, we found them very beautifull and obviously she was a lady who loved her gardening and roses. Nice that it has been named after her and also in the same area the Begonia House",
          "The rose garden and the Begonia House are a lovely spot to visit on a non-rainy day. Absolutely beautiful and so many different varieties of flowers and plants.",
          "We spent an afternoon walking through the Botanic Gardens & finished up at the rose garden It was a beautiful walk with amazing flowers",
          "If you love roses then this is the place! Beautiful and the air was filled with their perfume. Lovely lunch here too. Lovely to wander through this very pretty place.",
          "Actually part of the Wellington Botanic Gardens, this is a favourite stop for the cruise ship tours so is often quite busy. Go early to beat the camera-clicking crowds. The range of colours is spectacular during the long flowering season (November toMarch). There is even a",
          "The Rose Garden is certainly a highlight of the botanic Gardens. close by is a nice cafe and also the glass houses containing begoinias and also succulents, these are fantastic. Well worth a look and stunning on a lovely day.",
          "This restaurant is typical of a museum, with decent food and either indoor (loud) or outdoor (windy) tables. It fills a need.",
          "Lovely spot, peaceful being so close to the city. The roses are beautiful. Colours and scents are awesome. If you want an inspiration for making a tutu come here! Cafe and staff great.",
          "After walking through the botanical gardens, we stopped on our way back into town via the rose garden. Its laid out beautifully with lovely archways and trailing roses over them. I particularly like the water feature in the centre & the way the flowers seem to explode outwards",
          "Lovely display of different varieties of roses, beautiful fragrances, beautiful displays of colours..... lovely cafe just a couple of steps away... tasty food, reasonable prices, sit inside or out and still admires the Lady Norwood Rose Garden, well done gardeners, appreciate",
          "We stopped there as part of the City sightseeing tour and it was well worth the time. We have never seen quite as many different roses in a relatively small area. In early December they seemed to be at their very best. There was also a very pleasant outdoor much cafe.",
          "Go when the roses have their first flush, late Nov/ early Dec to see them at their best. A cocophany of colours and scents, you can spend ages smelling them all and finding your favourite. Easy access for wheelchairs too so its a lovely place to bring elderly family and friends",
          "A stop.on a city tour. Only a few roses in bloom but imagine it would be a picture when all the bushes were flowering.",
          "I would highly recommend a trip to the Botanical Gardens if you're in Wellington on a sunny day. The roses weren't quite ready to be in full bloom, but they were lovely.",
          "The roses were not out when we visited, the cafe and greenhouses were interesting though. The begonias and air plants were good. The lilies again,were not out much at this tome. But it does lead to the Botanical garden.",
          "I came upon this whilst wondering around the Botanical Gardens. Unfortunately the Roses weren't in bloom nor was the fountain working so I probably saw this on a bad day hence the 3 star review. I am sure it would be different in the height of the season. Begonia House is",
          "absolutely stunning, cafe adjacent, toilets, outside seating - do not miss this on your trip to Wellington.....",
          "Visited Sunday 11th September. I should have given it more thought that the roses only bloom at certain times of the year. Very disappointed that I didn't get to see them on this visit. I would imagine that they would be fantastic when in full bloom judging by the garden layout",
          "This is a wedding photo place as its truly beautiful and smells divine when all the roses are in bloom. Grab a nice coffee or lunch at the restaurant there and make a B- line for the begonia house with its indoor Lilly pond and exotic plants.",
          "Always love to come to this garden in summer. Nice to walk around and literally smell the roses. Kids can roam around freely and there's clear border to the Rose bed.",
          "My wife really loved this and I also found it very nice for a good walk around and looking at various roses",
          "The plan for this complex of gardens is the work of the Director, Edward Hutt. It was certainly the largest addition to the Botanic Garden established during his directorship (1947-1965). It was accomplished with the financial help of Lady Norwood who donated constantly for",
          "Beautifully laid out rose garden. Lots of beautiful perfumes when walking round the area when they are in full bloom. Beautiful range of colours to inspect. Nice to view from steps above to benefit with the circular layout.",
          "The gardens are lovely, especially when the roses are in bloom. So many different varieties and colours. The cafe is definitely worth a visit while you are here as well.",
          "Don't miss the orchids. Nice caf\u00e9. Located just below the Botanical gardens. Take the Cable Car up to the top of the Botanical gardens and walk back through the botanical gardens past the rose garden and through the historic cemetery.",
          "This is a huge circular garden just outside the begonia house. There are many different types of roses, beautifully planted, with incredible fragrances! We first saw it from the trail above which showed us just how neatly the garden was laid out.",
          "While walking down the paths from the cable car you come across this lovely garden of some of the most colorful flowers I've ever seen. It is a nice attraction and somehow quite calming as it was quiet on the day I was there. Make sure that you have your camera!! Lot's of",
          "Beautiful when the roses are in flower. Still going in May. Nice warm and usually sheltered micro climate. Sit in the Picnic cafe for morning coffee or lunch.",
          "High above Wellington is the garden built originally by a husband for his wife. During World War 2, US serviceman were camped nearby. This place has a history. Impressive, multicoloured roses extend across lawns. It is located in a sheltered bowl, so is hot in the afternoon.",
          "Beautiful setting for a rose garden, we went in April so getting to the end of the season, would like to go in summer when in full bloom",
          "This was my favourite part of the Botanical Gardens. There is a great variety of roses on display. I would love to see it when all the roses are in full bloom.",
          "On ones walk down from the train stop and see and smell the lovely collection of roses around a central pond.",
          "I think keen gardeners would enjoy a visit here - I'm not an expert on roses by any stretch, but I enjoyed visiting the rose garden. it's a nice place to spend a sunny afternoon, and seeing all the different varieties of roses was interesting.",
          "Lady Norwood Rose Garden is part of the botanic gardens and is located at the bottom of the botanic gardens, alongside an enclosed garden area and cafe and shop. The gardens are beautiful and some of the roses give off a beautiful perfume. Make sure thought to check inside the",
          "Being as we in the garden in March the roses were close to their past due date. The flowers were the same as the USA in September or October. A park side restaurant is on site.",
          "I believe this is part of the Royal Botanic Gardens, but is more accessible because one doesn't have to climb for it. A nice but somewhat limited and pricey cafe allows one to sit and enjoy the roses for a relaxing interval.",
          "A beautiful circular rose garden located in a sheltered part of the Wellington Botanic Gardens. With a collection of international and NZ varieties, the roses are well labelled and many possess enticing fragrance. On that sunny afternoon, several ducks were napping under the",
          "Lots of roses outside; Gardenias, inside. Great color, great presentation. Has the de rigeuer gift shop (very small, but there for those whose trip is not complete without a stop at the gift shop) and a caf\u00e9.",
          "The Wellington Botanical Gardens are a place to revisit many times a year. So many varieties of plants and flowers. A beautiful cafe serving excellent coffee. Colouring pens and paper supplied - really enjoyed this added touch. Great service.",
          "As part of our visit to the Botanic Gardens we discovered the Lady Norwood Garden. As we love rose gardens we spent quite some time simply wandering among the roses.",
          "Depending on the time of year, these can be a delight to walk around and smell the roses. Gets busy certain times of year.",
          "I visited rose garden as part of Botanical Gardens. Large display of roses beautifully laid out. I was there in mid March, still blooming but I think past prime time.",
          "After the Botanic Garden this is a more relaxed area to walk around. The variety of roses is immense. Very busy on our visit as tour buses from cruise ships were stopping.",
          "At the moment the roses are coming to the end but they still looked great. This is one of those things you have to come at the right time of year so anywhere between Nov and April is probably right. There is the Hothouses there too and the Botanic Gardens so always worth a",
          "beautiful roses, some colours i saw for the first time. there are also a glasshouse with enormous colourful begonias nearby, and a nice cafe.",
          "If you are the admirer of natural beauty, this would be your good stop in Wellington. Near the Botanic Garden. Here you can find varieties of roses, ranging from the classic rose to recently released varieties. Purple, pink, orange, white, red or combination of those colors.",
          "This is part of the Botanic Garden. From the Sculpture Trail we saw some very interesting trees. But when we really look at them, they are made of wire. Further down is the Rose Garden. There are many beds; each bed contains a different variety of rose, with many colours that",
          "Lovely and well tended rose gardens. Stop and have a coffe at the cafe and enjoy the scene. Also be sure to visit the begonia gardens (inside) as they are particularly good as well.",
          "At the stat/top of botanical gardens with a tea point close buy. Lots of variety's and well laid out but most of them didn't look in a great condition. It appeared to dry and well drained, not the best place for a rose. Not a patch on the one in Christchurch.",
          "February is probably not the best time but still a great place to pass a couple of hours. Cable car up walk down comes out on Lambton Cay behind the Beehive Parliament building.",
          "You'll find this garden at roughly the halfway mark of the walk from the top of the cable car back to the city through the Botanic Gardens. It's a great excuse to stop and literally smell the roses - very well laid out, plenty of variety, and even for those like me who aren't",
          "I'm surprised that there's a separate review for this because it's part of the Wellington botanic gardens. I only found the rose garden average - maybe it's the time I was there. By average, I don't mean bad, but I don't think you should make a trip just to see the rose garden..",
          "While we were visiting past the full bloom period, the garden was still lovely and well maintained, with some roses still flowering.",
          "Beautiful rose gardens with so many varieties so lovingly tended. Do not forget to go in the glass house to see some more tropical plant varieties and then visit the beautiful restaurant for a bite to eat.",
          "Pay attention to the Bolton Street Cemetery as you exit the garden. It is Wellington's oldest cemetery and the tombstones often state the cause of death.",
          "Another Wellington \"attraction\" that failed to enthuse! Maybe save this one for when you're over 70 as it may improve in appeal by then!",
          "A carpet of roses their perfume enticing you into this magic place of peace and tranquility a little slice of heaven in this small garden of Eden.",
          "This is really worth the walk. Take the cable car up the hill then walk down the hill through the botanical gardens and you end up here. A great cafe and a magnificent rose garden is your reward",
          "Spent well over an hour simply strolling and looking at all the roses and taking photographs of most of them. Do take the time to go inside the greenhouse as there are some amazing flowers that are not on display outside. The finish with refreshments (coffee, wine, meal) at the",
          "Don't miss this when you are in Wellington. Even if you have a few minutes, walk through this garden. It is very relaxing and you will be just amazed by the beautiful roses -- each bush is a photo-op! The Begonia House is also very interesting with a wide variety of tropical",
          "It always amazes me how well the roses stand up here to Wellington's notorious wind but they do! Its a compact, formal garden with a great selection of named roses that helps gardeners chose varieties. There's tea rooms/cafe beside it also.",
          "Not the largest rose garden we've been to, but we'll laid out. Some times too many can be overpowering but this was just right. Great colours",
          "After walking down the hill through the Botanical Gardens, one is greeted by a colorful suprise of a classical garden featuring roses of all types. Adding to the experience is the Begonia House and the tea house. It is a wonderful place for a peaceful pause.",
          "When the roses are blooming I love coming here to sit and read my book :) You can find it quite easily if you follow the signs :)",
          "Beautiful gardens! If you like roses and other beautiful and colorful flowers, then this is the place for you. They also have an excellent coffee shop and a small gift shop. It is a nice relaxing way to spend an hour or so while touring Wellington.",
          "The quality, variety and smell of the roses was fantastic. So much colour. Great to be located so close to the city. Locals were relaxing with their shoes off and enjoying the great weather.",
          "Make sure you spend time in this wonderful garden. All the roses are well sign posted. There are many unique specimens to look at. There is a cafe near the gardens if you wish to dine or you can bring your lunch and sit on one of many benches that surround the gardens.",
          "The perfume from the roses was evident as we approached the garden. It is traditionally laid out and most roses clearly identified in more than 100 beds. The Begonia House is well worth a visit too",
          "Always lovely in summer the roses are spectacular, very nice begonia house and cafe, limited on veg options. Poignant memorial water feature linking NZ with Hiroshima and the nuclear free movement in the wake of the bombings in WWII. Can walk through to the heritage Bolton",
          "Beautiful garden, a variety of roses very soothing. It was a stunning day weather wise so the overall experience was pretty good.",
          "One of the jewels of Wellington. Such a tranquil spot to spend some in. You van grab a coffee and sit out watch the beautiful roses come into bloom. If you get tired of that (doubtful) then you can always stroll into the tropical house or the rest of gardens.",
          "The cafe is a must try, our meals were delicious, the service was excellent, as was the coffee. A lovely and welcome rest up after a good walk through the garden.",
          "On the way down from cable car ride to the top we stopped to see the rose garden. Many species of roses.",
          "In the botans for the afternoon, we decided to visit the roses. Many had bloomed already but not all were done - we saw several gorgeous species and also visited the greenhouses nearby.",
          "The start of the rose flowering season. The rose bushes are healthy and in full bud, just starting to flower. This is a lovely spot for a short walk among a well cared for garden of rose beds. Parking immediately outside.",
          "Nice setting and very good lunch food but a little pricey. Recommended as a treat, especially for taking elderly parents.",
          "I was in Wellington to early to see the Rose garden in full bloom. It would be absolutely stunning when blooming but it was not to be. All the same the well pruned roses were a delight and the fountain centrepiece gave it character along with the Picnic Cafe view of the garden.",
          "Yes. I pass through here most days on the way to the CBD. I live over the road and got married here a couple of leap years ago! Great cafe and great gardens and glass house. If it's a nice day get up here and enjoy it's beauty.",
          "We love roses so are frequent visitors, epsecially in early summer when the blooms are fresh and new. We are never disappointed. It is nice to stay awhile, far removed from the busy world, on one of the many seats in the garden. The cafe on the fringe of the garden is well",
          "Always a crowd pleaser, a nice sheltered spot, just be patient with getting a park. Catches the sun, so take a sun hat",
          "We stopped in in late September and they had just pruned all of the roses so there really wasn't much to see in that sense but I would imagine that it would be quite the site. Inside they have two green houses with very nice plants of all shapes, sizes, and colors from all over",
          "Amazing Rose Garden. A must place to visit. The Rose Garden was a tranquil and peace place to sit and think whilst being in the city.",
          "A beautiful garden with a lovely restaurant. Quiet and delightful, a great place to rejuvenate oneself",
          "Enjoy a light lunch in the cafe there after smelling all the divine roses or watching married couples get their photos taken by the fountain.",
          "I had to laugh at a previous reviewer who said the roses were in poor condition. If he knew anything about roses he'd know roses are a spring to summer flower and they are dormant in winter. We never tire of coming to the rose gardens as we are avid rose growers. The roses are",
          "Somehow a part of the botanical gardens, this was, by far, the less attractive part of them. Most of the roses were poor looking, the area was not spotlessly clean as the rest of the gardens and the place did not feel safe due to the car thieves lurking around. You can easily",
          "The Rose garden is a beautiful oasis in a delightful setting. Visit the begonia house, walk around the lovely rose garden and see the Japanese peace garden. Have a coffee in the delightful Caf\u00e9 before walking the short distance back to the city. A must see.",
          "Enjoy the roses in summer and the hot houses during winter plus the cafe that is on the other side of the hot house is great for a coffee and great cafe food with lovely scones . Also there is a fish pond in the hot house so kids will love to see the big and little fishes .also",
          "This was absolutely charming & well worth taking the time to visit. As well as the roses there are indoor tropical gardens packed with a whole range of lovely flowers. The place is well looked after & there's also a cafe which we didn't have time to visit but I'm told is",
          "The rose gardens are absolutely gorgeous. At this time of year the Council provides opportunities to learn to prune roses as well. A gorgeous display in summer. There are sculptures in the surrounding gardens in the hills as well.",
          "WOW! If you like roses, you simply must see this garden. Enter the garden on Glenmore Street or for more exotic tropical beauty, take the Cable Car to the very top of Wellington and then walk down through the Wellington Botanic Gardens ending up at the Rose Garden. I am not sure",
          "Beautiful rose garden. Lovely fragrances. Also nearby is the beautiful begonia house. Plenty of colours. Nice place for anyone that loves nature",
          "Visited this place during winter and there wasn't much roses in bloom but the garden is still pretty and has beautiful flowers of various colors. There is a cafe at the gardens so it's a great spot to sit and have breakfast or brunch. My friends and I have takeaway coffee.",
          "Often missed because it has a completely different entrance to that of the Botanic Gardens, the Lady Norwood Rose Garden and Begonia House is beautifully laid out with hundreds of varieties of roses with ample room for the hundreds of people visiting whilst were there to walk"

          "Can\u2019t thank Kent enough for a hair raising yet exciting, fun trip on Saturday. Despite the chilly blustery weather we had a great time. The kids loved the 4wd down the rocky coast and seeing the seals up close. Kent was an awesome tour guide, who was more that happy to share",

          "We had a great time and Silly Billy was an excellent guide. It is a tour that should not be missed. And Billy quote of \"I said I was coming around.\" will always be the highlight.",
          "Really enjoyed our 3 tour tour out along Wellingtons wild coast line. Out of the city within 15 minutes and along the bumpy rocky foreshore where our driver half jokes about the risk of getting stuck. Such amazing scenery and not something I would normally do but the wild New",
          "Our family of all ages all loved the trip, full of the unexpected and a total escape to nature. Amazing scenery that is only accessible by 4wd, and the guide Ken was really pleasant and gave good commentary. We got the right weather to get the full length drive of the coast",
          "I would like to say our trip was amazing and a great adventure. Our kids still talk about it everyday. Was one of our highlights of our trip to NZ. Billy our tour guide was just awesome! Thanks again for the great memories.",
          "What we thought was going to be a great time, turned out to be a dud. Our driver started out up the mountain. Since we arrived first, he waited for the other three vehicles in the convoy. We did take in some majestic scenery as we traveled up high, but once we got to the beach,",
          "First, I would recommend this tour. It is entertaining, views are great, and has great potential to see seals. Just be sure not to go during rising tide and the off season of seals. My tour was training a new guide, so we got to listen to them banter at each other over",
          "Let me first preface this review by saying the only reason this did not get a perfect rating in my book is because I went off season so there were not too many seals to see. If I had seen a few more seals, or some of them at least moving, then I would have happily and easily",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed this tour. Billy, our guide was informative and had a great sense of humour. We only saw 6 seals as the rest of them had left for the breeding grounds. However, the scenery on the way to the seals was absolutely wonderful!!!! The drive on the beach was",
          "You can definitely see the undiscovered parts of Wellington as I had an exclusive entry to private land. There was an awesome views from hills, helpful commentary by Billy, and tasty muffins and delicious manuka tea! Thanks Billy!",
          "Was great to get out of the city of Wellington and our guide was very informative. Landscape was amazing and trip along the stony beach was exciting for those among the tour who had not done 4WD before. Enjoyed a hot coffee and lovely muffin on the beach, although the milk had",
          "I booked a safari for a saturday morning. Great fun. Around 3 hours being driven up and down the best landscape in Wellington. It has been really nice, weather made a great effort to support us. Viewing seals at 10cm from myself is a really \"diverse\" experience. And the",
          "My friend and I took this tour on a beautiful, clear day. We really lucked out because we were the only two passengers. The wildlife (seals, wild horse, and ostrich) were def. a highlight, but what stood out even more were the views of the city we got to see. We didn't realize",
          "Kent are tour guide was the best. He took on an amazing tour. His knowledge of the area was great add a lot to the whole trip. I saw a lot of great views and tons of seals. It was by far the best trip I went on well down in Wellington. I would do it again in a heart beat.",
          "Trip was ok, good weather. Very disappointed we were all crammed in to the back of one vehicle sitting sideways, no good access to a door in case of accident. Am surprised they are allowed to legally seat 8 people in the back of a truck like that for a tourist thing. Very",
          "We really enjoyed our tour on Monday with Billy. Billy was full of interesting information and stories about Wellington and the various places and animals we encountered on the tour. We were really lucky that the weather was sunny and warm. We saw deer, wild horses, seals,",
          "Enjoyed the 4x4 ride to the seals and the leaning lighthouse. It was a very small group which always adds to the enjoyment. We have some great photos of the coast line and seals and were given plenty of time to enjoy the area. Our guide was very knowledgeable and we loved his",
          "Despite a mix-up with the original tour, the group provided an excellent tour at a revised time. The guide/driver was well informed, lived in the area, was able to add local color to his commentary and provided an excellent experience for clients.",
          "Loved the whole experince, The 4x4 driving , the seals and the view. Can,t forget Kent either for his driving skills, his afternoon tea and his friendly personality. When I visit N.Z again I will be sure to go again. Antone who is heading to Wellington, don't miss the seal",
          "We very much we enjoyed the tour! The guide, Nathan, was amazing as was the actual tour! The scenery, the information provided by Nathan and the weather all contributed to one of the best tours I've ever had. I can't say enough good things about our tour with Seal Coast",
          "Awesome trip with Supaman! Even as a local Wellingtonian this tour is a must. You will be surprised at whats just over the hill in our own back yard - not just seals!",
          "We had a great time on our seal safari, despite Mother Nature's attempts to distract us with her cold, rainy, and windy ways. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable, and chatted throughout the trip, pointing out scenery, describing the private land we were on, and pointing out",
          "We had half a day free in Wellington with nothing to do. Have done 4WD trips before and been disappointed. Seal Coast Safari enormously exceeded our expectations. The terrain was quite exciting, the scenery spectacular, the commentary fascinating and the close up photo ops of",
          "On a very windy day our driver, Kent, impressed us with his local knowledge as he deftly steered our 4WD through treacherous beaches,over rocks and down steep unmade tracks. We did get to see the seals (and some pretty amazing waves whipped up by the extreme conditions.) A",
          "Action-packed 3+ hour 4WD trip along Wellington's rugged south coast, taking in an enormous isolated windswept farm featuring camels, goats, wild horses, plentiful bird life etc. The highlight is walking freely amongst large, mostly male seals in their natural environment while",
          "This 4WD Seal Safari tour was an amazing experience enjoyed by both young and old. We were captured by the stunning scenery and adventure we were taken on. Our guide was friendly and engaging and his knowledge of the area made our tour far more interesting and enjoyable than",
          "I recommend this tour for anyone wanting to see the 'other' side of Wellington....LITERALLY! They take you over the mountain to the coast very few would see. We enjoyed the few hours we spent with Seal Coast Safari.",
          "I expected the trip to be adventurous, but nothing like what we got. The 4wd was very crowded and I see from the previous comments this is not the usual - in saying that we were not given the option to cancel. If I had of known what we were in for - I would have saved my money.",
          "You can enjoy an amazing scenary, nice ride at the beach and much more. My family enjoyed so much! I will recommend to anyone who is going to Wellington!",
          "sorry to say this trip was a disappointment, 9 passengers crammed sitting sideways into a land cruiser over very rough tracks is not conducive to an enjoyable experience, especially 4 of the passengers were above average weight, we were so cramped that we could not turn around",
          "Billy was our guide, he was very kind, funny and informative! The drive to the coast was amazing! Billy stopped and several places, making for some great photo opportunities! Once we got to the coast, we were up close to many fur seals without even leaving the vehicle! At the",
          "This is one of the best trips I've ever been on. To experience the off road drive first and then on to see the seals which were the star attraction, is a memory I will never forget. I only have good things to say about this experience. Thank you Seal Coast Safari."

        "wiki": "Mount Victoria is a prominent hill 196 metres (643 ft) high immediately to the east of central Wellington, New Zealand. About 4 kilometres due south is a spur named Mount Albert and the two are linked by a ridge. Mount Victoria's residential area is on its north-western slopes.\n\n\n== History ==\nMount Victoria's original M\u0101ori name is Tangi Te Keo, though Matairangi is also used. The first name derives from a legend in which two taniwha tried to escape from Wellington Harbour which was then an enclosed lake. One taniwha became stranded and died, and its spirit turned into a bird named Te Keo, which flew to the top of the mountain and mourned (tangi). The second name translates as \"to examine the sky\".It was settled as, at its foot, Wellington's Te Aro filled with commercial activities. Residents needed to be close to the city but wanted more comfortable surroundings. For a long time it was one of Wellington's sources of fresh milk from its dairy farms.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Town belt ===\n\n\n=== Greek community ===\nA strong link was forged between Cretans and New Zealanders during World War II. New Zealanders left behind in the retreat from Crete were hidden from the occupying army by Cretans at great personal danger and they were able to harass occupying forces.  A commemoration of the Battle of Crete is held each year in May.\nLloyd Street which is the site of the Greek community centre and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral was renamed Hania Street after Crete's old capital. Wellington's Olympic Football Club was established by Father Ilias Economou for his parishioners.\nAbout 65 per cent of Greek New Zealanders live in Wellington and in the decades following World War II they were concentrated in Mount Victoria. The greatest concentration is now in Miramar and around half of Greek weddings are now with other New Zealanders.\n\n\n=== Boundaries ===\n\nThe suburb is almost entirely residential with commercial activity along Kent Terrace on its north-western boundary. The houses are on the north-western flank of the ridge above the southern end of the Wellington CBD, Te Aro. Adjoining suburbs are Oriental Bay with Roseneath, Newtown to the south, Te Aro to the west beyond Kent Terrace and Hataitai on the far side of the ridge beyond the town belt.\n\nWaterfrontWhat would seem to be residential Mount Victoria's frontage to the harbour is now technically a one-building-wide strip of Oriental Bay. The houses in Roxburgh, McFarlane, Hawker and Moeller Streets are all in Mount Victoria. The houses below those streets front onto Oriental Parade which is defined as Oriental Bay. The old monastery is in Mount Victoria. Palliser Road is in Roseneath.Wellington College and Government House, official residence of New Zealand's Governor-General, are beyond the southern boundary to the south-east of cricket's Basin Reserve. Beyond Government House is Newtown's Wellington Hospital.\n\nHouses\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Lord of the Rings connection ==\n\nMount Victoria was used twice as a location in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. The very first footage on the project was shot off Alexandra Road on 11 October 1999, called the \"Get off the road\" scene, followed by the \"Escape from the Nazg\u00fbl\" scenes a few hundred metres to the North. Later an old quarry at the top end of Ellice Street was used as the Rohirrim camp at Dunharrow.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary schools ===\nClyde Quay School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of 242 as of March 2020.St Mark's Church School is a co-educational Anglican private primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of 244.\n\n\n=== Secondary schools ===\nWellington College is a boys' state secondary school for Year 9 to 13 students, founded in 1867. It has a roll of 1780 as of March 2020.Wellington East Girls' College is a girls' state secondary school for Year 9 to 13 students, founded in 1925. It has a roll of 1113.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFull Moon Silhouettes The Mount Victoria Lookout during moonrise\nMt Victoria Community Website\nMt Victoria Historical Society",

          "Would have been a 5 star if venue was big enough to accommodate the school holiday crowd. \nAlthough there were plenty of volunteers around, the place could use an expansion so it doesn\u2019t feel so claustrophobic.\nEnough local and non local \u2026",
          "This is such a lovely experience for kids and adults alike, the staff are welcoming and very knowledgeable. It is a small place but has heaps to see and the kids just loved the interactive tanks, holding the starfish and looking at the anemones. Would definitely recommend to anyone, thanks for a great time!",

My son got to help feed the octopus. The touch pool is great!",

However, it's unique and fun and suitable for anyone. Highly recommend. \n\nWould have been 5 stars but the state of the bathrooms is inexcusable.",
          "Brilliant, took my adult kids 23 and 27, had an absolute blast. Im someone who loves a challenge.  My only critique. No where near enough staff.   Could do with a staff member on every challenge. Could do with one encouraging people on the \u2026",
          "Here to watch Miss nearly 15 & Miss 13 try & complete the course to level 6 - both have done to level 4.  Master 9's 1st time\nMaster 9 was able to accomplish to 3B & made the comment \" Now I know why they call it Adrenalin Park !!! \"  Miss \u2026",
          "Great fun on low levels, gets high very quick after level 3. Very helpful staff. Could do with a toilet upgrade.",
          "It's a place for those who likes challenging themselves. If you think that you want to push your limits of all your human body senses then visit this. While going through briefing I was bit concerned and thought I will not be able to do \u2026",
          "Wow. Intense. Great challenges for all abilities. The high levels aren't for the faint hearted but things are gradually introduced so you can build confidence step by step. Physically demanding as you get higher but just such a great thing \u2026",
          "So much fun! Been here twice now. Always a fun day out! :)",
          "Great activity! So fun! Nestled in the trees you don't have to worry about the heat or sunblock. Clear instructions, a level for everyone.",
          "I went for the first time without knowing what to expect. Having done lots of indoor climbing I'm used to dealing with the security of it. Had way more fun than I expected and the higher level courses really challenged me. The basic courses are easy enough for somebody who needs to step out of their comfort and try something new.",
          "Take a leap of faith out of your comfort zone and head on down to adrenalin forest. Tell ya friends and bring the family. And when your in the area why not check out all the local cafes and the fantastic housing nearby. My slogan would be a 'great experience for wholesome fun loving go getters'. Kia kaha.",
          "Kids absolutely love this place and the safety is really impressive.  Really helps them with their confidence but the instructors this last time we went were congregating over at the start rather than stationing themselves around the \u2026",
          "Loved the place!!! Quite a range of tracks from very easy ones till extremely difficult. We started from track 2, and it required already some phisycal strength. So if you really want to warm up, then probably better to start from the beginning. Otherwise all sections are different - awesome opportunity to use all your muscles. :)",

Note, I didn't say high wires course, because even though it's as high as you can get, you have the choice of staying close to the forest floor, I would rate this in the top 20 things to do in the north island.",
          "So much fun! They gave us all the info we needed to do it and pretty much just let us go and enjoy ourselves. There are 7 levels, but I only managed to make it to number 4. Still super fun, none the less! It does use a lot of energy though, so be prepared.",
          "Awesome place for a bit of fun with family or friends. Good levels of difficulty to play around with, and keep you occupied. Staff are great.",

          "Never done anything like this and it was super safe",
          "Great for team building, very easy to get to.",

          "Great outdoor activity!",
          "A real fun experience with plenty of challenges along the way",

          "Awsom fun leisurely time consuming safety measures could be better.",
          "Extremely fun! After course 3 though it does get a bit more intense physically, so be prepared to tire out by the end of your 3 hour session. Guides are on hand to rescue if you get stuck, but you can't go back up once they come to get you.",
          "My 12 and 13 year old loved it. After a quick briefing on how to use the harness clips by a staff member the kids were guided by whoever was in front of them until they got the hang of things. Yes staff are there but they weren't very \u2026",
          "Awesome place. Was alot of fun. Wouldn't go with children at least under 10 personally as it's quite tricky. But it was super great fun.",

          "Deffently gets ur heart rate up!",
          "Lots of fun for children and adults. Staff are helpful and friendly. \nI was very nervous at first but once I started I felt safe the whole time and I loved it.\nIt is tiring so bring something to eat and drink. \nLevel 4-6 is very high and quite challenging (well for me at least!)",
          "Great physically and mentally challenging course! Lots of levels so suitable for all ages and abilities",
          "Had a very poor experience here. The guy working here didn't explain anything well and was a little rude didn't give us the time of day. We paid for 2 adult tickets, stayed there for 5 minutes on the first activity then left. Really don't recommend this place",
          "Loved it. Bit of a work out though",
          "Tremendously fun,  highly recommend.",
          "Adrenaline forest is awesome I enjoyed 3-4 hours in the trees! With a great friend! It was challenging and fun!",
          "A wonderful challenge for anyone, different levels of skill required the higher you go, any able bodied person can do some of these thingd",
          "Very exhausting for level 3a and 4 but it was fun!",
          "Great for all ages, easy instructions, physically and mentally challenging!!!! Go for it!!",
          "Staff were really friendly and helpful, and the equipment and course were great. The fitter you are, the more you'll enjoy it, but there is still enough for kids or less fit people like me to feel like I got my moneys worth.",

          "A testing experience!! Must return to try again.",
          "Great fun, will definitely be back to do more",
          "Definately one of things you have try.  Completely out of my comfort zone!  Would go again but need to be a bit fitter!",
          "Been there before...great experience with my son. Cheers",
          "It's a great place to get rid of some excess energy. It's kid friendly. Be aware that kids under 16 have to be supervised by an adult for  the duration they are climbing. Join in the fun while they climb. Beats sitting around waiting. Also \u2026",
          "Great place,  would be nice if there was a vending machine or a tuck shop.a person or groups can get very thirsty after doing so much climbing \ud83d\ude42",
          "What an amazing workout. Managed courses 1,2,3,4,5 & 6 in 3:25h  .. \nWas completely exhausted afterwards :}",
          "Great place to go. For adults and kids alike.  Overcome all your fears",
          "Great fun for the kids. The staff were superb when my son got stuck because the next stage was too challenging for his confidence level",
          "Great experience, level 1-3 has a gradual increase in difficulty but 3 to 4 is a big jump. 6 levels altogether. Good to go early as you get first dibs on the courses. Helpful staff",
          "Caters to all climbing abilities from beginner to advanced.",
          "Place is very cool, staff are nice and helpful. Although I was too chicken to do more than level 1",
          "Awesome fun activity.",
          "We had to leave after just 30 minutes of climbing due to weather conditions (which is reasonable) but we didn't get a refund or were offered to come back later or on another day even though we paid for 3 hours of climbing.",
          "Everything you could ask for in adventure park,  the harness system enables you to go unsupervised and the staff are so helpful. Would recommend to all who want to expend some energy!",
          "Team building, Finishd level 3. Way better than our 1st time. Our young team members takng lead. Supa proud of us all. Thanx to the team @ Adrenalin Forest.",
          "Not for the faint hearted",
          "Awesome fun. They have six courses, in varying level of height and difficulty, and you have three hours to try to complete them. I was definitely under prepared and could only do courses 1-3 (in about 1.5 hours) before starting to get tired.",
          "Great Experience. Very nice Staff. Recommend!",
          "Was turned away from entry today just before 2.30pm. Was told last admission was 2pm. Opening hours are advertised as 10 till 2.30pm on the website. Didn't think the website made this 2pm last admission clear."

          "On arrival the welcome was less then welcoming as we were ignored for a few minutes, but during the visit the instructors proved to be very helpful and friendly. The course is very challenging, even for fit teenagers, and there is good variety to crossing types and flying foxes.",
          "I have no idea how some of the kids managed to do some of these crazy rope walks in the trees. Their legs are shorter than mine and I had to stretch at times. Maybe they don\u2019t fear falling even if you are strapped on the prospect wasn\u2019t a good one. The thought of getting rescued",

          "We took our sons, who are both great climbers and very active. It was the last activity at the end of our 2 week North Island holiday and an excellent way to end the journey. The staff are very encouraging and were always on the look out to help or assist climbers. Definitely",
          "My partner and I are in our mid 20s, reasonably fit, but both of us would say we're not the best with heights. We had an awesome time though! You can't fall off the wires because you are provided with two clips and it's impossible for you to take them both off at the same time",
          "Beautiful setting in the shady trees. After a training session to make sure you know the rules and how to be safe, off you go. there are 6 routes, each one harder and higher than the one before. While we were there, we noticied that most people stop after doing the first 3.",
          "I took a friend her for their bday and was totally enjoyable - a lot harder than it looks from the ground but such fun- we had an 8 year old and a 12 year old with us and although the 8 year old struggled he still had heaps of fun and was awesome watching him pick up confidence",

          "I took my two grandchildren to the Adrenalin Forest and they love it there. They climb the trees with their harness on at all times. There is always members of staff and there are many available to ask for help. A good exercise circuit for those who enjoy heights.",

          "I liked the people the contributed and help make this our class went there it was amazing and I would love to go the again it was a bit sad that it was raining really challenging thanks for all help",
          "I loved adrenalin forest it was awesome. I loved how you had to challenge yourself to get across the high wires.",
          "The kids and I went to Adrenalin Forest for about the 4th time. This place is amazing it will pysh you to your mental limits while still remaining completely safe. Staff are amazing",
          "My 10 year olds had a lot of fun completing level 1 and 2 on our visit during the school holidays. It was their first time on a ropes course. The safety demonstration and practice time was perfect and they set off on the course confident and happy. I love the click it system as",

          "Adrenalin Forest is great! Went out there in December 2016 just after Christmas. Quite busy but no delay for us getting on the course (other than the usual health & safety & demonstration). Staff were great and very friendly and knowledgeable about the course and safety, gave",
          "Unbelievable day out! I am a scaredy cat and was put to shame by some of the children there. Highly recommend it for people looking for their adrenaline hit.I went with 5 friends and everyone left buzzing.",
          "I took two 13 year olds to Adrenalin Forrest and they had a great day, reasonably priced great fun and wore them out! Shame the nearby cafe was closed for the day so unable to get a take away coffee but it's open most of the time/",
          "Brilliant fun filled activity for all! We took our 9 year old overseas visitors along and they couldn't get enough of it! The flying fox part was their favourite! Health and safety is paramount (minimum height of 1.30m to go on the activity) - plus all visitors wear",
          "Lots of fun as your rational brain ('I know I am safely harnessed') battles your racing heart. The various levels allow each participant to progress to their own limit. Staff were supportive and encouraging, especially for younger climbers. Note there is no food/ drink",
          "While the parents were a little concerned at the start (the safety briefing wasn't great and the guy gave two of the three kids the wrong harnesses initially which didn't instil a lot of confidence), the course was actually pretty mild (Levels 1 and 2 only) and the kids learned",
          "I have fear of heights and falling myself but I thought a visit to adrenaline forest would make a great gift for Christmas. So I took my partner here. The instruction was easy to follow and it was good to get a safety briefing. We both felt comfortable and safe and started easy.",
          "We took our 8 and 10 year olds. They could only do Levels one and two which annoyed them but they enjoyed the experience. They wanted to go round twice which wasn't allowed and the price was a little steep for us to agree - though we promised to return. The safety briefing was a",
          "Came for a stag do with a bench of friends from Auckland. We had great fun with a great view from above. It was hot and sweaty and for some of us were a great challenge. One of our guy had to be rescued ;P They have an excellent service and well observed. The only disadvantage",
          "Great afternoon of entertainment for our 14 year old son and 8 year old nephew. The various levels of difficulty offered good options for both age groups. Instructors were friendly and we did not have to wait long to get the boys started. As spectators there was no shelter from",
          "We happened to stumble across this and luckily we were the only ones there. This is not the easiest obstacle course! My friends and I were of average fitness and both us girls pulled out by level 3. it was still so much fun, but was exhausting and challenging.The guide was",
          "Took my 13 yr old and her friend in the school holidays. Despite raining on and off while we were there they absolutely loved it. Staff were great, helpful and kept a watchful eye over everyone. Please note adults this is not a babysitting service so you will need to stay if",
          "We went there with our extended family who were here on an overseas trip. All of us give it a go and loved it. Really- what's not to love hanging out of trees with your family! The guides were pleasant and very helpful as a couple people had to be rescued. The levels of",
          "I've been wanting to try Adrenalin Forest for a while, and a TreatMe voucher gave the perfect excuse. It's quite an experience, comprising six difficult to negotiate courses which climb through the trees and reach dizzying heights. You need to be very fit and have great upper",

          "What a laugh! Now I'm not a big fan of heights bur was talked into doing this. I was apprehensive to say the least. The staff put my mind as ease very quickly with the safety briefing etc. You build up confidence by starting low and working your way up. I had a great time, aptly",
          "I took my grandchildren aged 9 and 11 yrs old. We had an amazing time and I must say that safety is the first and upmost priority. The staff are excellent very helpful. Well recommended.",
          "Great fun for young and old who like heights and moving between trees high above ground or for those who just like watching on ground looking up\u00f1",
          "This was a wonderful family activity as our 12 year old was happy to learn his parents \"capabilities\" as he put it, however I was also happy to learn my own capabilities. It's exhilarating how independent you can be navigating yourself around the courses.",
          "Went as a group of 3 adults and 2 children. Instructors were great. Good information and good tackle. This was all that I expected and more. Thoroughly worth the money and if I lived closer I would comeback for more.",
          "Definitely a 5 star experience. Got this almost half price online but would have definitely paid the full price. We thought it was going to be a simple walk in the park. Oh how wrong we were! We were confronted with a multitude of levels which would test us both physically and",
          "I've done a similar course in Australia but without the 3 hour timelimit. I managed to make it through 5 levels, my partner 4 levels. It had some very difficult sections which required a lot of strength, balance and dexterity. Also helps to be comfortable with heights, some of",
          "This place is well run and equipment is safe, if you follow the rules and instructions you won't go wrong \u2013 you still need to be responsible and careful. We had great fun and wished we could stay longer. Kids 8, 10 and 11 loved the beginner course. There is a height restriction",
          "I have done similar things near Melbourne, and this was excellent. Will did a great job of leading us through the safety briefing and he was never far away to answer questions or offer a hint. I completed 6 of the 7 courses in the 3 hours and was tired by the end of it. Plenty",
          "Let me advise people that are scared of heights or not confident in their coordination skills not to go above level 3. I'm a fairly fit person but I screamed like a banshee on the flying fox at the end of level 3A. The staff member told me there wasn't any way she could actually",
          "We visited the Adrenlin Forest in December 2015 as a group of friends. Found the staff to be friendly and informative with their safety spiel but during the course of the day, I don't feel like there was enough staff watching all the courses. One guy kept having to run between",
          "Our teenagers picked the activities in Wellington. This was the first on the list and certainly deserved the top position. It was exciting and challenging for all ages.",
          "Had a fantastic time with my 3 children. The courses tested us all to our limits. Having to help and encourage each other was great.",
          "It is what it says on the tin. You start at lower levels & learn some skills that you bring forward on each level. Enough levels to challenge us all. Friendly staff & good value",
          "When travelling with a teenage son, we have realised we have to do two things, keep it interesting and use lots of energy. Adrenalin Forest is the place. This place has a level of suspended obstacles that will take you from the ground on level 1 to the tops of the trees on",
          "We are a family of 4 with 10 and 14 year old boys. Us parents managed to finish level 4 but the 14 year old finished all 7 levels and 10 year old finished 6 levels! 3 hours certainly goes by quickly! Staff were fantastic coaching us oldies through difficult obstacles! Feeling a",
          "As someone not fond of heights this place is really good to at least try and push yourself a bit further. The equipment is tip top and the staff give a great introduction/safety lecture. Then if you're unable to complete a level they will try to suggest ways to continue or",

          "Took the kids down here, even though I'm scared of heights... I was ok on the low one with Mr7, and the teenagers went higher and higher... I could barely watch. Great afternoon activity for the family. We took a picnic and went to Gear homestead (right next door) Wouldn't",
          "Good lesson and safety brief to begin with. We packed a light picnic which was nice after level 2 (our group were beginners) there's a few picnic tables in nice little spots. I had a small group of 10 year olds. Level 3a really pushed my son. A couple of the others could have",
          "If your looking for adrenalin then this is it! Low and high ropes course with various degrees of difficulty, from beginner to extreme. Fun and exciting to nail biting obstacles, suited for older kids, teens and adults. There are 6 levels and you don't have to go in order so",
          "We had an exciting experience here on a windy day. The two highest courses were closed due to the wind but number 4 terrified me with the swaying platforms so that was probably for the best! The double clasp system made me feel very safe and there was a great variation of",

          "Kids, adults, males, females - this is a great half day option for almost anyone with at least an ounce of fitness. Professionally run by friendly staff, it's a great few hours fun and challenge for people who are after something refreshingly different. Highly recommended.",
          "This is an amazing activity - you can really push yourself to your mental and physical limits. The staff are very friendly, and clearly explain the equipment and safety procedures. There are 6-7 levels available which get progressively harder, so people can choose to challenge",
          "Great fun and challenging. Wish there were more activities like this around. Staff were great and encouraging. We will certainly be back to have another go Unfortunately we were too tired to complete level 5, but next time!!",
          "We recently went to Adrenalin Forest for the first time, 4 adults and one child. The staff are very helpful and supportive and ensure you are comfortable and enjoying yourself. Safety is paramount and the equipment is designed to ensure you can't fall. Our 8-year old god",
          "Had a great time with three children aged 9, 11 and 13. They completed pathway 4 and said it was the best activity they had done in the holidays. Good explanation of the clip system to start with. Only area to improve would be to have a snack/ vending machine there. We took",
          "Adrenalin forest is fun for all ages, went with the girlfriend who had to stop half way as she was to afraid of heights (my fault taking her there) staff were great at explaining how to operate the harness and clips . This is a safe, exciting and challenging experience . Will",
          "Our kids (11 and 13) went on this. Starting at the lower levels and moving on up they were constantly challenged. We were limited for time so the kids didn't get to complete the course - i think they allow you three ours. Both got to somewhere along level four when we had to",
          "Been to one in Auckland and this one is far more challenging. I would give this a 5 out of 5 but my smaller son was disappointed to only be able to do 2 of 6 challenges. That was hard for him. The taller members however were out-challenged by the course, which is a HUGE",
          "The challenge is a lot of fun for my grandchildren who have absailed, climbed and met the many challenges that this experience offers.",
          "i didn't participate but went with my grandkids 11 & 12 and their friends. The course is well laid out and designed for varying skill level and age. Staff are well trained in providing assistance and rescue if required",

          "Had an great time in the trees and a nice setting. Starting at a low level then gradually getting higher and more difficult tests. Well organised and very safe. Made it to the end of level 4 gave level 5 a miss. Shame there is no where there to get drinks or crisps (a vending",
          "While in wellington for a Awsome week Adrenilin forest was on the list, I was with a large group from Queenstown, and to what we were told you needed to have a fear of heights to get the real adrenilin but when I got on to the course it was not that scary as I skipped level 2",
          "We didn't do true course, but just went for a look. Looks to be a really professional operation and very safe. I'm terrified of heights so won't be taking part but it was fun watching people doing the course, which wouldn't be for the faint hearted ! Appears that all safety",
          "Great for all ages and adventure spirits. There are 7 levels, the first 2 available for young children (under 145cm height). Level 4 was my limit; I spent 2 hours doing levels 2, 3 and 4. Plan to go more than once if you want to achieve all of the levels. No food available.",
          "I was a bit apprehensive about taking my youngest daughter to this attraction. But my fears for her safety were very quick to disappear. The staff made sure that both of us really knew how to operate the equipment and what we were doing. Since my daughter was the minimum height",
          "This high wire adventure facility is located in a small patch of very tall pine trees just north of Porirua. Seven routes (pathways), each with 10-20 individual challenges, criss-cross at different heights, from 3m for the early ones to 26m for the later ones. Climbers wear a",
          "Today I took my son out to the adrenalin forest at Porirua and I can honestly say that it was well worth the visit. We both tried out the high ropes set amongst the pine trees and were thrilled with our experience. It was challenging, exciting and scary in places! The staff were",
          "We enjoyed our first visit to Adrenalin Park so much, we came back for a 2nd visit. About 15 min drive from Wellington CBD. Friendly, professional staff. System for attaching to the cables is very secure, so you feel quite safe. Only downside is the rustic toilet facility.",
          "Was so looking forward to doing this but broke my finger the day before we went so had to watch the hubby and kids do it. Youngest was then 10, and managed to get to level 5. Safety briefing was good, and guides available to help, encourage and assist if required. Defnitely",
          "I took my 9 year old with some friends, for his birthday. They LOVED it and there were tables so we could have a snack and drinks between routes. It is a lovely setting if not all your party want to go up. I felt safety protocol was good - or I wouldn't have taken other",
          "It was an amazingly challenging experience. I was worried before going on the pathways (they all look high somehow). I asked if I could be taken down when I'm half way on the path, and the answer was yes (by staff with ladder), but won't be able to get back to the pathway. The",
          "We had the best day here - so much fun. I can't recommend it highly enough. The brief training session was clear and well done. The staff were all friendly, helpful and definitely knew what they were doing. The level of safety was extremely high. There are several different",
          "Pick a non-windy day for this visit unless you are happy swaying 20 metres above the ground on a single wire! We had perfect conditions and even this ageing female found it great fun. would have helped to have a bit more upper body strength but managed to feel fairly satisfied",
          "Huge fun for all ages and definately a challenge. I'm in my 60's and have taken my 11-year old daughter a couple of times now. We both had a blast. It's a bit scary in places but you'd struggle to injure yourself (unless your ego is fragile). Level 3 was enough for me but if",
          "Fun, slightly terrifying on the higher trees (which sway significantly in the off sea breeze), right level of physical challenge for the borderline fit like us. The youngest in our group was 10 and he managed to complete 4 of the courses happily. We experienced a lovely outdoor",
          "I had my niece and her friend from out of town staying - both aged 13. I assumed they would want to spend their time visiting shops, but they were keen on an activity. I was surprised to find this most amazing facility on my doorstep. It is fun and challenging and there is a",
          "This place is absolutely a must do for things around the Wellington region! It has 6 awesome stages that range from activities 3m off the ground, to 30m +!!! The first 3 levels are the nice and easy, cruisy ones that you can do if your not afraid of going too high off the ground",
          "Wow- wasn't sure what to expect but had a fabulous day! Wear long sleeves, pants and good shoes- you want to feel as safe as possible 12m in the air! I only made it to level 3, was exhausted but had a great time! My boyfriend zoomed ahead and got 5 of the courses done. I will",
          "Went with my teenage daughter. Lots of fun initially, then fun and very challenging. There are 6 levels and although I'm very fit, was glad to get back on the ground at the end of Level 4! Wear long pants and long sleeves to avoid grazes from the steel cables if you don't",
          "What a day of fun! I went with my husband, and I took photos the whole time as just looking was nerve wracking enough! The first three levels are quite fun, but the rest is quite labor intensive. Make sure you wear at least sleeves to avoid hurting your skin with cables. Wear",
          "This is a great half-day out, more fun than I thought it was going to be, and more challenging as well since I had sore arms, thighs and abs for a couple of days afterward ! I'm not very good with heights so hoped to at least complete level 1 but was rapt to go on and finish",
          "We brought our two young kids here and we all had a blast. The staff were so friendly and helpful and they really encouraged everyone to keep trying as we went through. There attention to health and safety made us really comfortable, especially given we had our children with",
          "Holy crap I am not one for heights, and Adrenalin Forest is allll about the heights. My wife was keen as but I figured I'd flake at about level 3. But you know what? I loved it and I got all the way through to the top. There is no question that the last couple of stages were",
          "I've been to Adrenalin Forest both on an 'Extreme Networking' business trip getting local business people to network in all new ways, and also with friends visiting from the UK. Both times the staff were fantastic, training/briefing very clear, so that we were instantly able to",
          "We had a great day there my daughter came away buzzing for days. Even though she could only do level 1 and 2 she was so excited. The level of safety was fantastic but gave her independence to try and achieve new experiences. Already booked her birthday party there."

      "name": "Wellington Cable Car",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Wellington Cable Car is a funicular railway in Wellington, New Zealand, between Lambton Quay, the main shopping street, and Kelburn, a suburb in the hills overlooking the central city, rising 120 m (394 ft) over a length of 612 m (2,008 ft).\nThe one way trip takes approximately five minutes. The Wellington Cable Car is widely recognised as a symbol of Wellington.\n\n\n== Track and stations ==\nThe line consists of 628 metres (2,060 ft) of mostly straight 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in) metre gauge single track with pine sleepers. The only curves are at the passing loop in the middle, at Talavera station. Except for the lowest part the line rises at a constant grade of 1 in 5.06 (17.86%), through three tunnels and over three bridges.\nThe lower terminus is in Cable Car Lane, off Lambton Quay (41\u00b017\u203203.3\u2033S 174\u00b046\u203228.7\u2033E). The upper terminus is next to the Wellington Botanic Garden at the city end of Upland Road, Kelburn's main street (41\u00b017\u203207.25\u2033S 174\u00b046\u203204.17\u2033E).\n\n\n== Cars and propulsion ==\n\nThe Cable Car has two cars, which start from opposite ends of the line and pass in the middle. They are attached to each other by a 30 mm diameter cable, supported by 120 rollers, which runs round a pulley at the top of the hill. A 185 kW 550 V DC motor at the top of the hill drives the pulley. The Cable Car is a funicular rather than a true cable car: the cars are permanently attached to the cable, which stops and starts as required, while a cable car grips and releases a continuously-moving cable. Wheels on the south side of car 1 and the north side of car 2 have double flanges, while the opposite wheels on each car have no flanges, directing the cars to the correct side of the mid-way passing loop at Talavera.\nThe cars are designed to fit the grade, using internal steps to provide horizontal floors.\nThe normal operating speed is 18 km/h (11.2 mph) (5 m/s or 16.4 ft/s), with a maximum passenger load of around 100 (30 seated, 70 standing). Each car weighs approximately 13.5 t (13.3 long tons; 14.9 short tons) when empty and 21 t (20.7 long tons; 23.1 short tons) when full.\n\n\n== Passengers ==\nThe Cable Car is used by slightly under a million people each year. In the mornings and evenings, it is used by commuters travelling between Kelburn and the city; at other times of the day, it is used by people travelling between the city and the Wellington Botanic Garden, by students attending Victoria University and living in nearby student hostels, and by many tourists, especially during summer.\n\n\n== Ownership ==\nThe Cable Car is owned and operated by Wellington Cable Car Ltd, owned by Wellington City Council. Wellington Cable Car Ltd also owns the overhead wires for Wellington's trolleybuses. Operation was contracted out to Australian company Transfield Services until early 2007, when it was brought back inhouse. Wellington Cable Car Ltd is responsible for all operations of the Cable Car, including the maintenance of cars and track, employing drivers, selling tickets and providing customer service. Unlike buses and trains, the Cable Car does not receive a subsidy, and is profitable.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe Cable Car Museum was opened in December 2000. Located in the original winding house, and with a new extension completed in 2006, it houses original grip cars 1 and 3, with the electric winding gear still in working order. Car 1 is in red 1970s livery, including contemporary advertising. Car 3 was restored in 2005 to a green livery dating from about 1905, and a bell from the San Francisco Cable Car was added. The winding gear is still in working order and runs a loop of cable, but the cable no longer leaves the building.\nThe Cable Car Museum is operated by the Wellington Museums Trust. It has a Category II listing with Heritage New Zealand.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The original line ===\nAt the end of the 19th century, Wellington was expanding rapidly, and, due to the city's hilly terrain, good building land was at a premium. When new residential developments were proposed for Kelburn, it was suggested that a cable car or funicular could be built to provide easy access. In 1898, a number of people prominent in the development of the residential subdivisions founded the Kelburne & Karori Tramway Company. The plan was to build a tramway between the city and Kelburn, and link it by carriage to Karori, a settlement on the far side of Kelburn. The company began purchasing land for the construction of the tramway, and negotiated with the Karori authorities for a new road (now Upland Road) to link the upper terminus with Karori. In 1898, the City Council granted permission for the venture, on condition that it had the option to purchase the operation at a later date. The location of Victoria University of Wellington was influenced by the company's offer of a donation of \u00a31000 if the university were located in Kelburn, so students would patronise the car when travelling between the city and the university. Several of the Company investors like Martin Kennedy were supporters of Seddon, who stalled on releasing land on the alternative Mount Cook Gaol site for the university, although this site was widely supported in Wellington.\n\nThe designer of the system was James Fulton, a Dunedin-born engineer. Fulton was responsible for both selecting the route and deciding the method of operation, a hybrid between a cable car and a funicular. Like a cable car, the line had a continuous loop haulage cable that the cars gripped using a cable car gripper, but it also had a funicular-style balance cable permanently attached to both cars over an undriven pulley at the top of the line. The descending car gripped the haulage cable and was pulled downhill, in turn pulling the ascending car (which remained ungripped) uphill by the balance cable. There was a Fell type centre rail, used for emergency braking only. The line was double track, of 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge.\nConstruction began in 1899, involving three teams working around the clock. The line opened to the public on 22 February 1902. Demand was high, with thousands of people travelling each day. In 1903, a number of old horse-drawn Wellington trams were converted into cable car trailers, increasing capacity. By 1912, the annual number of passengers had reached one million. In 1933, the steam-powered winding gear was replaced by an electric motor, improving control and reducing operating costs.\nIn the 1940s, the Cable Car suffered from increased competition: City Council buses ran to Karori and other western suburbs, bypassing it. The company believed that it was inappropriate for the City Council to compete with a private company, and a legal dispute broke out. The argument ended when the City Council agreed to purchase the company, which occurred on 13 February 1947.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Cable Car was the subject of complaints about safety and comfort. The old wooden cars were increasingly considered antiquated. On 10 May 1973, a worker on the new motorway suffered serious injuries in an accident when he stepped in front of a Cable Car at the Clifton stop, prompting a review. The Ministry of Works concluded that aspects of the Cable Car were unsafe, particularly the use of unbraked trailers, and called for the system to be scrapped. The trailers were withdrawn, considerably reducing capacity.\n\n\n=== 1978\u201379 upgrade ===\nDespite public protests led by Mayor of Wellington Michael Fowler, the line closed on 22 September 1978 for re-gauging and installation of new steel cars and equipment by Habegger AG of Switzerland, becoming a full funicular. The contract was managed by Wellington engineering firm Cory-Wright and Salmon. The line re-opened on 22 October 1979.\n\nInitially, the refurbished Cable Car suffered a number of problems. The service was frequently interrupted for technical reasons and for extensive safety checks. Largely as a result of these problems, patronage dropped to a low of 500,000 in 1982. After a serious accident in 1988, which put the cars out of service for months, the system underwent a major revamp. This solved most of the problems and patronage has steadily increased since then. A safety survey is conducted annually at the end of October and takes four days.\n\n\n=== Deregulation ===\nIn 1991, when passenger transport was deregulated, there was speculation about the future of the Cable Car. Councils could no longer provide transport services directly, having to either privatise or corporatise their operations. The City Council sold its bus operation, but due to public pressure it retained ownership of the Cable Car and the trolleybus overhead wiring, with operations and maintenance contracted out separately.\nInitially both contracts were won by Harbour City Cable Car Ltd, a joint venture between the Stagecoach Group, which had purchased the buses, and East by West, a Wellington ferry operator. In 1994, the City Council decided to carry out its own maintenance, and Wellington Cable Car Ltd established its own maintenance capacity. In 1997, the operations contract was won by Serco, which was later purchased by Transfield Services. Wellington Cable Car Ltd took the operation in-house in early 2007.\nCracks were discovered in the tunnel below Talavera station during the 1999 Annual survey. These were fixed with metal anchoring and by coating the tunnel with reinforced concrete.\nIn July 2006, renovation of Lambton station began, to improve its looks and accessibility. The works were budgeted at $1.3 million, scheduled to be completed in early November. On 18 December the renovated station came into use, with automated turnstiles (and a substantial price rise). Lingering problems with the ticketing system upgrade were fixed during the October 2007 annual survey. A new computer was also added to the winding mechanism during the survey which has caused a few temporary issues with how smoothly the cars run.\n\n\n=== 2016 electric drive and control system upgrade ===\n\nIn 2016, the Cable Car underwent a major equipment upgrade to replace the electric drive and control system. Since the 1979 upgrade, each car has completed more than one million trips. The Cable Car also took the opportunity to cosmetically upgrade the existing cars and make changes to the staff facilities.\nWhilst the Cable Car was out of action, the Wellington City Council also carried out construction work in the Cable Car Lane and Lambton Quay Terminal. This included: \n1. replacing the old leaky canopy with an elegant new glass one that will let the sunshine in (Phase 1)\n2. building a new ticket booth and moving the entry gates to make queuing and buying tickets easier (Phase 1)\n3. new paving, signs and colour scheme for the heritage-listed Stonehams building (Phase 2 \u2013 final phase of work on the lane in 2017)\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe landmark Kelburn Kiosk was built at the Kelburn terminal in 1905. It was burnt down in a suspicious fire in 1982. The Skyline Restaurant was built to replace it in 1984, with a design that won an award from the Institute of Architects in 1986.In 1996, Paul Lambert rode 80 trips in one day, setting something of a record. The Cable Car waived the ticket price, and he collected funds for the Life Flight Trust throughout the day.In 2001, Josie Bullock ran for the Wellington mayoralty on a platform of bringing the wooden cable cars back into service. She claimed this would only cost about $300,000 to accomplish, even though this would require relaying the entire track and refurbishing the cars to bring them up to modern safety standards.On 24 February 1909, John William Wakelin, aged 30, was accidentally killed by the tram.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCable car (railway)\nFunicular\nList of funicular railways\nSan Francisco cable car system\nPeak Tram\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBurdett, Ron E.

          "Fun & affordable experience for the whole family.  Family pass was $22 for a return trip.  Great views over wellington city from the top.  Would've been better if they have audio commentary on the ride up explaining what's up the hill or \u2026",
          "It is not expensive to up there and the trip is worth it. The cable car takes you to Botanical Garden on top. I suggest to go up by the cable car and walk down. It is not far.",
          "Lovely drivers and nice trip. Could have done with a loo at either end (or clearer directions if there was one), but overall pretty good.",
          "Great experience for anyone visiting Wellington, but also really easy to ride, no need to book in advance. It is a good idea to ride to the top and walk down through the botanical gardens.",
          "Scenic and lots of flora and fauna to see. Good to buy a one way ticket to bring you to the top. Enjoy the park by slowly making your way on the downward slope. You can exit the park and make your way to the city centre once you reached the huge red gate.",
          "A blast from the past. A real kewl family outing. Awesome views of Auckland.",
          "Lovely we ride up to a fab cafe. Great coffee , food and staff.",
          "Unique experience, affordable price, great views. Another reason why I Loved Wellington.",
          "I've been here at night. It was nice experience. Especially space place was amazing.  The telegraph is 150 years old but still work fantastic. Staff were so kind. \nNight view of city was also lovely and sometimes you can find kaka flying around. \nNice place!",
          "It's a short ride but a bit of a climb and incline which is why it works best by cable. Fun for the kids and ticketing is easy enough. Up on the hill make sure you walk it as it's not too long. The cafe up there needs to bring it's prices \u2026",
          "This was so much fun! For a return fare of $9 it's a must do in Wellington. We caught the car from Cable Car Lane in Lambton Quay to the top, had a coffee and breakfast at the cafe and enjoyed the museum before heading back down. The lights \u2026",
          "This was even better than I thought! Though a very short journey it was a pleasant one. The lights in the tunnel were amazing and made the journey that more spectacular.  We unfortunately were a bit late to visit the museum at the top it \u2026",
          "Great fun ride up to the top of the city. Fairly cheap, $5 one way, and quite quick only taking 5-10 minutes. Great views from the top, opportunity to catch a free shuttle bus to Zealand, or walk back down through the botanical gardens (up to an hour depending on your walking speed).",
          "Fun ride! Very short but fun ride.",
          "Iconic, this is a great trip all the way up from Lambton Quay on the waterfront to the hills above the city and up to the Wellington Botanical Gardens. It has great views across the city and the harbour, both from the top and all the way \u2026",
          "Iconic Wellington landmark attraction!\n\nDon\u2019t mind breaking the bank paying a return trip; love the museum as it emphasises a lot of rich history from its humble beginnings. \n\nA must do for anyone whom is visiting Wellington. \n\nPanoramic \u2026",
          "Must see attraction in Wellington. A unique experience given its New Zealand\u2019s only funicular railway. Very cool light displays in some of the tunnels. And it\u2019s pretty good value too at only $9 for a return ticket. Plenty to see and do at the summit with a museum, cafe and observatory.",
          "The current Wellington Cable Car was built in 1979 (although it was originally built in 1902!) and has become one of the best things to do in Wellington, particularly as the botanical gardens are situated at the top (free entrance). Lovely views of the city!",
          "Awesome really enjoyed the cable car trip. Thank you",
          "Awesome experience, clean cable car, good service",
          "There was quite a long line when we arrived, which nearly put us off as we didn't have much time. The staff said the line moves quite quickly and we would be looking at 15 minutes max. 10 minutes later we were riding the cable car:). Well worth the wait.",
          "Good views of the city and nice botanic garden at the top. Slightly pricey in my opinion but definitely worth the trip up there. The cable car service is fast and efficient.",
          "Service was good and it ran fairly quickly. Couldn't see much from the cable car but the view at the top was good. The gardens up there were nice and very big.",
          "Nice and Quick ride. Beautiful views of Wellington from the top. Its 9$/adult for a return ticket and 5$ for a one way ticket. The botanical gardens are at the top as well.",
          "Must see if you visiting Wellington, Amazing view at the top. Worth it.",
          "This is a must do in Wellington. I suggest to take the cable car up the hill, then walk back down to the city through the botanical gardens and by the cemetery. The views are great and you\u2019ll get a nice stroll as a bonus.",
          "Nice place... Wow!! Wonderful... I will be back if I come to Wellington..",
          "would be nice if they put public stairs alongside the tracks or something, the cable car is a great time saver to get to kelburn from town",
          "Things you must do in Wellington!\nThere are not many activities to do in Wellington, but Cable Car is one that must do. It has history and very comfortable, only $10 for return ticket. The only cons I think is the length of it and not much \u2026",
          "Nice and fun way up the hill. If you plan on popping in the cable car museum, it closes at 5 and I didn't check the time it would close. Oh well, maybe next time.",
          "The cable car is a must do experience with the kids. It is a short journey and a very reasonable price. You reach the top and check out the amazing views. There is also a cable car museum at the top. It is small but also free. We also \u2026",
          "Oldschool transportation. They have student prices as well. Takes you to the top of Wellington, which offers nice views. Unfortunately there is a wee bit much vegetation blocking a lot of the city view. There is also a nice cable car museum that is free to enter at the top. You can also buy single way tickets.",
          "Awesome ride in the Cable Car, views were fantastic. Lunch at the Cafe very nice. Cable Car Museum really interesting. We'll worth the trip.",
          "Great little journey up and down.....\nLovely cafe at the top..\nGood wander down through the Botanic Gardens...",
          "It's something different! Enjoyable despite only a short ride, and beautiful view from the top. Staffs were profesional and friendly.",
          "It's something that people of Wellington r proud of n it connects to the starting point from top of Botanical Garden. We liked it.",
          "Best way of linking the city center and the beautiful botanical gardens. Free with the super gold card makes it even more enjoyable.",
          "Wonderful views, Great time for cheap (which is rare in Wellington) Be ready to walk once you are there though. Gave a 4 only because most exhibits aren't open during Cable hours even though you can visit during those times. Still, it's a must do while there, You won't regret it!",
          "Historical cable car with modern mechanics. Safe and efficient. It certainly makes you feel like riding Hong Kong Peak Tram!",
          "Wonderful way to travel to the Botanical Gardens and the Observatory. A call back to days of old. The cable cars are in immaculate condition. And the view!",
          "The cable car is a exciting experience for young and old people",
          "The price is reasonably around 5 NZ dollars for single ride and 9 NZ dollars for round trip. Yoh can easily walk down the hill so probably a single ride would be better if you aren't sure what your plans are. There are a variety of plants along the pathway on the Victoria Hill.",
          "You do not want to miss this in Wellington. Really good experience and view. Can visit the museum and the gardens. Brilliant landscape.",
          "Awesome this is fantastic, loved it heaps. Will be back.",
          "We bought tickets online so escaped the massive line to purchase tickets. It was chaos to get in and as crazy inside. I do think the rush was because there were more people than usual - we were there on the 31st of Dec which I suspect is \u2026",
          "Excellent tourist attraction. Well designed with cafe and great views. Free museum nicely set up showing history and development of the technology.",
          "Cute little uphill ride - nice views and gardens at the top, drivers and nice and seem happy in their job\nalso got a free memento from the local jewellery store s we were walking back out to the street",
          "If you are visiting Wellington please don't miss to visit this. It's cost a unique experience. Once you reach at top you will have stunning views and many places around to be explored on foot. Definitely an appointment experience to take \u2026",
          "It was a good experience, nothing to wow you but it's a tram like car into which you get. The car then goes up the hill, if you have a return ticket, you can get back. On the top there is a museum and botanical garden which are quite nice. \u2026",
          "Worth going up the mountain to Victoria University and the amazing botanical gardens. Cable car is an absolute treat with stunning views.",
          "A Wellington must do. The views are good with a window seat and the experience is good for the price. Walk around the botanical gardens while you are there and you have a great morning in Wellington.",
          "It's really choice, children love it. Nothing to do at the top though. Well nothing interesting except to wall back down through the garden if your keen.",
          "Great experience! We enjoyed the views but also the tunels decorated with flashing, colorful lights.",
          "Always a favourite ride for grandkids",
          "Inexpensive fun ride from the city centre up the hillside to the botanical gardens. Great views of the city and bay from the top.",
          "Beautiful ride....and outstanding view.  Worth doing as a tourist.  The museum was cool too.  \ud83d\ude0e",
          "Great to get on this old tram, the views on the way up are great and the tunnels are great fun too. Fantastic views of Wellington at the top.",
          "Nice and cute iconic transportation in Wellington. It is better to check out if you have time.",
          "We enjoyed the short trip up to the great views of the city. I will note we managed to miss the entrance.....it's next to McDonald's!",
          "Love the cable car, if you haven't been on it then give it a go. Especially if you have children",
          "Great views. Only a short journey but good access for walks and to view gardens.",
          "A short ride -- but amazing. The highlight is definitely the lights in the tunnels. But I would recommend visiting at night to enjoy the lights even better, because the operator will turn off the light in the cable car and thus, you can fully enjoy the lights in the tunnel. I wasn't prepared for this level of the beauty of the night!",
          "Cool. Especially for a gold card holder",
          "The staff at the cable car today we're phenomenal today.  They helped me with my pram and baby and everyone was friendly and kind.  Thank you so much it was much appreciated!",
          "Nice, inexpensive trip to the top of the city. Very short, so if you want to save money, you can just walk back down.",
          "I like transportation by rail. This was good. Probably do not need it to come down.",
          "A very nice experience. Would definitely recommend if you are going from in the city to the Observatory or to the Gardens. \nNot a very long ride--- only 5 minutes one-way. But a definite must do if you are in Wellington.",
          "Lovely scenic ride, short about 5 mins but was nice to sit back & enjoy the view. Liked going thru the tunnels & seeing the sparkling lights.",
          "Great for kids but could do better to allow more people in one go. Too slow have to wait for  another cable car to go past to move. Two separate  tracks might work",
          "Was great to get back on after 40 years of riding this and being able to take my son and granddaughter",
          "A short but enjoyable ride up to the Botanical Gardens, Observatory and close to Zealandia. Best part of the trip though we're the friendly Wellington locals who had lots of good advice on hand for our short stay.",
          "Offers great view of city once at the top. With nice coffee shop.",
          "Amazing expierence to get up with a cable car, short drive for a few minutes. Free shuttle to Zeelandia",
          "Short trip with good views. Takes you to the top of the botanical  gardens. And some good views across Wellington and the harbour.",
          "Highly recommended as the view of Wellington from the top is awesome.  We also enjoyed the walk back down via the Botanic Gardens",
          "Nice Walks up the top interesting museum good way to spend a few hours. Views over Wellington are great",
          "Just BEAUTIFUL view from the top. You MUST get on the Cable car & see for yourself!!!",
          "Nice attraction in the city. It's cheap and have opportunity to see the city from the nice point",
          "Super kool, lovely view from the top and friendly and helpful staff at the bottom. Only one big map though so not that great when others are using it for a long time.",
          "Awesome view, and a fun ride.\n\nRecommend arriving a little before the departure time, cable car was very full seats are first in Best Dressed.\nRid up is very smooth for those concerned but rickety rails.\nMuseum at top of cable is quaint and has a few good souvenirs, the botanic gardens are clean and beautiful as well.",
          "Loved the trip on the cable car, and exploring the gardens at the top!",
          "Cool views. !! And cool ride !!",
          "Unique and clean not a busy site with a less overgrounded people",
          "A must to do in Wellington we took the free shuttle at the top to Zalandia great",
          "Good with a snapper card. Nice lights in a tunnel definitely do this if you are near",
          "The Tram may be a outdated piece of transportation when moving from point A to point B. But this is definitely different from everything from buses to trains. Moving up the tracks you get a lovely view of the place and even get a little \u2026",
          "Entrance is exactly in the city center and it takes you in a short ride. Most of the time is really crowded and you need to make long lines (or purchase your tickets online) but I was lucky this time! No lines at all.",
          "Loved it. Actually if you do go there than please do take out some time to check the cable car museum as it has really great history behind its latest and old version and how it all started.",
          "Loved the views, shame about my fear of heights I got over it so.  The ride was good.",
          "Great. And dont forget you gold carders free between 9 and 3 weekdays",
          "A great way to explore the beautiful city, the to and fro journey gives a good view from height of the mesmerising city and the botanical garden is fabulous",
          "Well maintained cable car..convenient to go to botanical garden. Available every 10 min.\nCost per adult For round trip $9.00.",
          "Smooth and short ride\n\nThe station right located in the city center\n\nCost one way $10 is worth a ride, a great view of the city, suggest to take one way by Cable car and walk down through the Botanical Garden & Rose garden\n\nHighly recommend",
          "A must do in Wellington...great view from top. Nice walk through gardens.",
          "The wait for the cable car was long and painful - book tickets online if possible and don't go during the cruise ship season.\nLovely experience, more information about the workings would be great.",
          "Scenic drive up though not as long as I would have thought. Saved us the walk up though! Would recommend you take the car up and walk down if you are able.",
          "Very interesting nice trip up the hill and staff were polite and very helpful.",
          "Such an iconic part of Wellington, always a great ride & amazing views.",

          "A nice cable car ride with a visit to Zealandia",
          "It's always fun to ride the cable car to the top of the hill.  I love the addition of special lighting in the tunnels",

          "Beautiful view from the top. Also nice place for walks",
          "I never seen or been on this b4. But it was a awesome experience",

          "Fist time experience for me so I really enjoyed it ,would recommend not going during xmas season tho the cues can get a bit insane,other than that it was a really awesome time",
          "Worth doing to get to the to of the hill but very quick and not much of a view. And being pedantic, it's a funicular not a cable car.",
          "You can see a beautiful scenary by riding a cable car",

          "This little gem is truly worth seeing.  Must ride when you are in windy Welly.  \nReturn trip right on the front seat, is worth the money, as you can truly watch how the pulley mechanism works. \nBest transportation invention ever for hilly cities.",

          "The long line moves quickly, it was decently priced and great scenery",

          "When you get on from the top NO signs to explain how the cable car works or how you pay is very confusing. We asked the driver who is the only one at the top how do we pay etc he was extremely rude and sarcastic, which we didnt appreciate \u2026",

          "Interesting experience. Very helpful staff especially to first timers. Just a little hard to locate.",
          "Classic tourist activity for Wellington and worth the fare. Was my first time on it in years and went with someone who had never been on the cable car - both really appreciated the upgraded tunnels with light installments now doing varied \u2026",
          "If you visiting Wellington must go really good experience",
          "Beautiful scenery at the top. along the cable car trail there are few stops. Stop at the last one, to go to the botanical garden etc. Wellington is beautiful, we got to see the view from the top.",
          "Great experience. Reminds me of Jason's sky rail",
          "A nice side trip while wondering around Wellington. Very happy with the friendly and helpful service of the staff . Excellent value for money.",
          "A must do in Welly. Nice quick ride, and isn't  expensive",
          "Been here many times just loved it every time",
          "Fun and quick cable car ride with nice views at top of the hill. A nice attraction that is reasonably priced. Probably best time to go is near sunset so you can see daytime, sunset and night views of Wellington",
          "It was a fun ride but much shorter than I thought",
          "hard to find the station, nice view",
          "Wellington is a very hilly place. This funicular celebrates historical yet practicl means of traversing these steep inclines and descents.",

          "Always love a funicular tram with it's \"angled \" seats.\nSmall tunnel beautifully illuminated as you go through.",
          "Great trip up the hill and for a reasonable cost!! Well worth the trip and our granddaughter loved the lights in the tunnels!",
          "Enjoyed the experience, the day was beautiful and view stunning. It was my first time on the cable car and if I had known how wonderful it is, would have been sooner. Happy that I have finally done it.",
          "You must try it ,when you come to Wellington here .",
          "It was good fun going up and down on this with the lights in the tunnels. But I think it would be better during the day to get the views of the city on the way. But very worth doing and is really cheap!",
          "It has spectacular view on top.",
          "It was very well done with seniors not having to pay for tge trip to the top. A great cafe there and parfumerie also the museum was very interesting. Didnt have time to do the botanical gardens.",
          "Yesss cool. Reaches the top. Promenade at the botanical garden. Heaven",
          "Cute and a very good view from the top!",
          "I was a bit disappointed with the short period of the ride, and we were just visiting magnificent viewpoint at Mt Victoria so it made cable car views not that breathtaking",
          "Beautiful historic cable car ride to Wellington's beautiful botanical gardens. When you reach the beautiful botanical gardens you will get also a scenic view of Wellington city and its surroundings. It is a gorgeous place to stay for a \u2026",

          "Its nice but nothing exciting",
          "Fantastic view!",
          "Great option for something to do in the CBD. Awesome views at the top, cool light show in the tunnels, and a museum at the top with great content. Awesome family pricing too makes it a great choice for the kids.",
          "Still nice view of Wellington... a lot shorter ride than the Hong Kong cable car that works the same way... I think these are the only 2 operating still? At least Wellington doesn't have the huge waiting crowds I have experienced at the HK cable car.",
          "Brought back memories from my childhood. Was great to look at the cable car museum at the top. Loved the view.",
          "Overall a quick way to get up the hill. However warnings on permanent or temporary flashing light art in the tunnels should have been given more prominently as it can cause epilepsy to some.",
          "A really nice ride to take the littlies on stunning scenery.",
          "Loved the ride, gold card riders free, museum and other places of interest to see at the top, cafe, and fabulous views.",
          "Really cool light tunnel at the beginning and it has stops en route like a bus which I was not aware of. If you're interested in seeing the botanical gardens at the top, you actually have to walk quite far down (and then back up a big hill) \u2026",
          "Awesome ride! And amazing light show through tunnel!",
          "Very clean and efficient. Stunning views!",
          "Short but nice trip to the top of the hill",
          "cool transport system and great lookout at the top.",
          "\"Tick the box\" place of interests. Photos taken at the top are greater than the actual experience.",
          "Interesting way to get from CBD to the Botanic gardens, great views at top, and fascinating cable car museum too.",
          "Easy ride from the city Street to the top of the hill / Botanical Garden.",
          "fee=9nzd (with return); alternatively buy a one way up and walk your way down from the botanical garden. it's a fun little 10 minutes ride with nice views at the top.",
          "Has a cool light show in the tunnel",
          "Not worth the wait. It would have been quicker for us to walk up the hill. The amount of people waiting for the tram was crazy. Some Wellington people got no patience and cut the queue.",
          "Totally loved it. Great way to see another side of Wellington",
          "Great views of welly when you reached the final stop.... really enjoyed the ride, not just once but all the time I used it. Expect a long long wait when cruises arrive welly harbour.",
          "Very convenient getting one place to another. The lights in the tunnel are cool. Different from other modes of transport. Prices to expensive though.",
          "Best for all people particular thouse  heading to botanical gardens and living near by",

          "Fabulous a fun way to see the  sites",
          "So interesting, unbelievable views",
          "Cheap rides and the quickest way to climb the hill. Top stop, city lookout!",
          "I use the Cable Car to get to uni almost every day. It is a great experience with lovely views over the city. The staff are always very friendly and helpful. At the top there is a little museum, views of the city, and varying length walks \u2026",
          "Cool experience though a bit expensive. However one gets Also free entry to the cable car Museum which is located at the top and access to the botanical gardens where also the space place observatory is situated.  All in all a fun \u2026",
          "Nice old trams feel on a short steep climb up to the botanical gardens. 2 stops before getting to the top.  Can buy tickets at cable carts or buy on line,they run every 15 minutes.",
          "The ride was short, but sweet! The views were good, although they are a little bit obstructed. The museum at the top is also worth the ride. Dissapointed that the student discount only was for New Zealand students, and the guy selling the tickets was rude.",
          "Keep an eye out for the sign to the entrance down an alley. Vintage trams and amazing views on the way up and at the top. Museum st the top is free and worth a visit.\n\nCan get busy on days when cruise ships are in port. Advice is to go early to avoid queues and a crowd.\n\nRecommended",
          "Make sure you get a Snapper card, even if you're a tourist. Makes the cable car and buses much cheaper.",
          "Really short ride but I was very grateful that I didn't have to climb the hill. It has a very unique design.",
          "A classic  Victorian engineering feat that needs to be experienced.",
          "Cute little funicular (not sure why it is called a cable car) nice half day trip on the train up to the botanical gardens for a walk and the victorian parfumerie is a must visit if you are worried about chemicals in your perfume. Apparently \u2026",
          "Just strolled about at the top of the cable car while waiting for a prescription at the nearby pharmacy. Lovely views. Good coffee from the cafe, kinda pricy tho even for Welly prices.",
          "Short ride to the top but nice experience, I expects it to be a bit longer but the view from the top is breathtaking...be sure to go on a sunny day and take a picture of the Cable car leaving with the city backdrop:)",
          "Quite a cool novelty for an out of towner. Lighting and art help it look good",
          "As a local, I love the cable car but tend to take it for granted. I was pleasantly surprised on riding the cable car recently to see excellent light shows have been put up inside the short tunnels. Very cool.",
          "Awesome view from the top, friendly driver. they could just give the grumpy guy selling the tickets a course on being helpful and friendly. Happy people go there with their kids, he just ruins the atmosphere",
          "A short trip, but worthwhile.",
          "A couple minutes walk to enjoy the top view of the city of Wellington.",
          "Fun, short, nice views toward the top. A good way to tour the gardens from the city. Very cheap for students, discount turns it from a 9$ round trip to 5$.",
          "Love the cable car, a must do when visiting Welly.  Catch it on Lambton Quay, Walk through the Botanical Gardens and through the Bolton cemetery back into the city    :)",

          "Fabulous views from top although was disappointed at ticket prices anf thought they could be less.",
          "Amazing was definitely worth the trip \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Nice Cable car with cool light-show inside the Tunnels, altought it's a little bit expensive.",
          "What a view ,but only buy 1 way ticket you will want to walk down its easy and beautiful, views +++",
          "Something everyone should do when visiting Wellington. So cheap. (NZ$5) A short ride with a free museum atop. Stunning views await. Allow at least an hour to enjoy.",

          "Beautiful weather and fantastic cable car! It made my first visit in Wellington wonderful! Unforgettable moment! \n\nDue to the long queue, a bit worried about wasting time but my turn came to me so fast. Want to say \u201cthanks to the team!\u201d",
          "It\u2019s like a must do thing when in Wellington so it\u2019s good for an experience, the ride is very small though (it is a way of commute for many people). The little museum is free and totally recommended which preserves the early cable car.",
          "An interesting way to get to city centre",
          "Great day trip idea for locals and tourists alike. The trip up and down is fun with sprawling views of the Wellington area and a great light show as you go through the tunnels. \nInexpensive and a wonderful value. \nThe Botanical Gardens at the top is a wonderful place to stroll or have a picnic!",
          "Loved the cable car. Beautiful when you get up the top. Parklands to walk around. Cafe toilets and there is a perfumery shop up the top. Brought perfume to bring back home.. Go to the museum on the cable cars. Learnt a lot.",
          "It's cool but more expensive.",
          "This cable car is unlike anything I had ever seen before. Sooooo cool. The lights in some of the tunnels were a lovely surprise. The cable car museum (free admission!) had very informative displays.",
          "Nice day out. What a view.",
          "Great but could have the opportunity to make this a more extensive ride. Very clever",
          "Stumbled across this cable car by complete accident but seemed like an interesting thing to do. Was pleasently surprised but how fun it was. The tunnel has flashing lights in it and looks very cool - once at the top you're basically in the botanical garden and can start exploring!",
          "View at the top interesting perfume shop",
          "Great Experience but prefer older cable car that used to be when could ride on outside. Loved coloured lights in tunnel area!",
          "Great way to get to the top and see some amazing views of Wellington up there. The tunnel is pretty specify. Very short trip. Walk down after you take it up if you have lots of time and are feeling fit.",
          "Best way to visit the beautiful botanical Gardens",
          "My sister and brother in law were over from Australia so of course we had to go on the iconic Wellington cable car. What's a trip to Wellington without a cable car experience? So many things to do and see at the top or bottom of the cable car!",
          "Quick ride to see an amazing view",
          "Took my four year old to the cable car and she absolutely love it. There lights inside the tunnels wow her so much that she asked to go back the next day. Once reach the top we had a great walk and had so much fun at the play ground.",
          "What a ride. Great place to visit.",
          "Busy cable car up the hill to the botanic gardens. Historic technology in the museum but a more modern drive system now. The cars still seem ancient. Busier than normal because it was s cruise day.",
          "A unique way to see Wellington, from up high, and literally a few tweeks by the operator will brighten up your trip. Takes you to the top of Botanic gardens etc.",
          "Good way to see welington from top view",
          "It is a very brief ride & appearance wise it resembles a tram car ...used it one way to go up...& Got picked up by the tour bus. The rose garden was not in bloom ( it happens in December ) but im general, it was ok.",
          "Nice ride it is. Can be done once for experience. Nice views from the top. Cable car museum and botanical gardens are nice too.",
          "Greatest view from Wellington. Love it!",

          "Great landscape views.Excellent cafe.New experience.",
          "Nice view from the top and it leads botanical garden do it's great to spend some time there then get back. The cost is also reasonable and even less if you have student concession. It's right in the middle of city so getting there is pretty easy too. Might be crowded at times.",
          "Wellington is a beautiful city and great to walk through.",
          "Really lovely way to travel up to the Botanic Gardens and Observatories or return to the city from the gardens. It passes through a couple of nicely lit tunnels and is not expensive. The perfect way to get to the top part of the Botanic Gardens if you don't want to walk up the steep paths to get there.",
          "Good experience going up in the cable car. Now they have 2 cars as opposed to one plus a counter weight. Great way to get up to the top and then walk around the Botanic gardens. Also look at the Cable Car Museum at the top also.",
          "Good fun",
          "I had a fantastic day in Wellington.  The cable car was only a short trip up to the Museum but it was a fantastic day out.",

          "If you\u2019re in Wellington, riding the cable car is a must do experience, and while you\u2019re at the top I recommend visiting the cable car museum",
          "Lovely ride and not too much expensive",
          "Wellington Cable Car was truly disappointing. It's not worth the money. It's much better if you take the time to go up the Botanic garden, Space Place, etc by foot.",
          "Cute and historical and good lightining",
          "The cable car is great for getting up the hill quickly and easily, though overpriced as heck!",

          "Fun to ride\ud83d\udc4c Nice views.",

          "Fun Wellington experience. Great views.",
          "Lovely short ride.",
          "Iconic attraction located up Cable Car Lane off Lambton Quay in Central Wellington. As you ascend or descend you get great views of the Capitals harbour, cityscape and the Gardens.",
          "My sisters and l went recently on a road trip to wellington with our father who is 90 and we often visit the cable car whilst revisiting our home town and checking out the sights.My younger sister had never seen the cablecar due to us moving to hawkesbay when she was very young.",
          "Great views and free ride with gold card",
          "Great technology with spectacular views",
          "Very fun. Museum is a fraction the size of Te Papa but 100 times better in my opinion.",

          "Great view with beautiful botanical garden",
          "worth doing if your in Wellington",
          "Quick ride up to the gardens. A nice spot at the exit for a view of the town below and for a picnic. The tram signals when it is about to leave so you can be ready for a good photo. Like the one in Penang.",
          "We had fun riding the cable car. It was the first time me and my daughter had been on it.",
          "Cashier claimed to have given us change but hadn't and lied about it. Old snapper cards don't work here despite working on the bus and can't be exchanged for the new ones onsite. The ride itself was good",
          "Neat views, interesting if you're keen on a bit of well kept and well restored local history. Affordable time waster if you have a few hours to spare and appreciate a good view and a bit of botany.",
          "Good panoramic view of Wellington on the way uphill. Classic transportation leaves an unique landmark of the capital city. The whole trip is less than 5 minutes without any description, which makes the ticket a little pricy.",
          "A slow and lovely cable car ride that takes you to the top where you can see the botanical garden as well as the observatory. We didn't have enough time to visit those places but we will next time. Zoolandia also has a shuttle from the top. Beautiful views of the city and the tram operates every 10 minutes",
          "Very good looking but and clean and well maintained. Staff great",
          "Its a fun thing to do , if a little expensive",
          "The Cable Car Lane from Lambton Quay leads to the CC Terminal, where you can board the upward-bound carriage to the Kelburn Terminal, and the CC Centre, Mall or Foodcourt. There are a handful of eateries offering sushi, bento, sandwiches \u2026",
          "Very nice tourist ride. It did give an idea of how the original people got to and from work. It might have been nice to try the old Car but I guess modern rules just don't allow it, plus I am allergic to pain \ud83d\ude01",
          "It's a great way to see the full scope of Wellington. Even though there was a cruise ship in, the wait was only about 15 minutes. Best way to see the best views and Wellington's Botanical Gardens.",
          "Free ride with Supergold card. Great view from top",
          "Great views and stroll around the garden",
          "Awesome  views on clear  day",

          "Neat",
          "Loved this on our last visit",
          "This is a quick and easy way to get from the hilly residential area to the city centre, and lucky it was only a ten minute walk from my sister's house.  I really enjoyed this experience.",
          "commuter route for locals and a cool way to get to the botanical gardens from he city or vis versa.  always clean and tidy staff are always helpful.  can become busy at peak tourist time.",
          "It's a small ride up to the gardens, but a really nice experience",
          "Great treat travelling up and down through the tunnels. The lights are amazing at night and the view awesome",
          "Not as grand as it i thought it is. Though its of historical significance. Can try once. Fun for children.",
          "If you visit wellington, going to cable car ride is a must! One way-ticket only costs 10 dollars per person and ride takes about 5 mins. From the top there is a good view of Wellington. There is also a cafe and cable car museum. Museum is \u2026",
          "A quick trip up the hill - that is unless there's a cruise ship in town:-) Then the queue to get on at the bottom can be quite long.  Worth the wait though.",
          "Lovely ride. $9 for return trip per adult.",
          "Go ahead and take the trip. Go to the top and enjoy the park that overlooks the entire city. The ride is up a historic path on a now modern car. The museum shows how the original cable car was built and the history of the men who built it. Of course the views are spectacular.",
          "I took a one trip ride right up to the Botanic Garden. Had a quick look at the museum where the old cable car is on display. It was a short but sweet ride. I think the lights in the tunnel makes you feel like you are about to enter a new dimension.",
          "Wonderful abd the view at the top was breathtaking.",
          "excellent. fun n inexpensive",
          "Best $9 I've ever spent!!",

          "Great trip. $5",
          "Nice view but unfortunately under maintenance during our visit.",
          "One of the main highlights of Wellington City. Recommend to take the short ride up, visit the cable car museum on the top and walk all the way down to the city through the gardens. There is a little souvenir and coffee shop next to the Rose garden.",
          "Hilarious. The first time in years apparently that it's broken down. The driver had to get a ladder and help us out onto the tracks so that we could walk the remaining distance. But health and safety in NZ is very good so it was no problem, we were well looked after. It actually added to it being a fun experience. Lol.",
          "Lots of fun to ride and a great view from the top.",
          "Heaven on earth beauty of kane Williamson",
          "Really nice experience. Would recommend going on a clear sunny day",
          "Easy way to the top.",
          "A Wellington icon. A wonderful experience to try for tourists. It stops right next to Wellington Botanical  Garden.",
          "Didn't take any photos cause the ride is really short. Excellent service. Very comfortable and educational, you end up learning about its history and a bit of engineering",
          "lt was great the view was amazing",
          "Great time and fun my hubby and love our tune together.",
          "It was really good to explore in the cable car",

          "Nice ride, great views",
          "Short trip up the hill through led lit tunnel. Small cable car museum at top. Free, closes at 5. Good view at the top. Walk down through the gardens.",
          "Neat experience, would recommend to every tourist. Fares are NZ$9 round trip for adults, might be cheaper if you use the public transportation card, not absolutely sure of that. The car is four stops and has lights in the tunnel, which was \u2026",
          "Such fun!  Little ones insist we ride whenever we visit town.  The light display is always lovely.",
          "Nice little activity for everyone to enjoy. The botanic gardens and Space Place on the top was great.",
          "Beautiful ride,Great view at the top and an entrance to the Botanical Gardens.Loved the tunnel lights",

          "Cable car ride itself is really just ok nothing special or WOW factor to it, but once you get up top lots to do and see with amazing gardens, landscape, walking tracks and lots of other things for all ages. I would recommend cable car up $5 and walk down only 30 minutes with",
          "Definately a cool way to get up to the botanic gardens, kids thought it was very cool and the views from the top are amazing.",
          "I personally loved my little ride up the Wellington cable car. It really is a must-do and so quirky for the city to have this. At the top you get a great view and have direct access to the beautiful botanical gardens as well as the observatory. I would recommend getting a single",
          "Excellent way to see the city and harbour. Good price - with opportunity to walk the Gardens from the top. Checkout the Cable Car history museum & slide show at the Top.",
          "You might think this is a conventional cable car but it is not. It\u2019s a quick ride up to the top of Mt. Victoria . Walk down ( leisurely) amid rose gardens, playgrounds, lovely views. Not to be missed!",
          "Cable car goes from downtown shopping area to the botanic gardens. Brilliant trip goes through two tunnels which give a light show as you go through. It\u2019s quite cheap and well worth doing. Lovely restaurant at the top and the gardens as well as o lovely view of the whole of",
          "Its great when old pieces of infrastructure remain, and work efficienty and effectively. For $5 each we ascended by the Cable Car and we rewarded with a glorious view of Wellington and its surroundings. We chose to return by via the Botanic Gardens where there is a signed route",
          "The cable car or funicular is a bit of fun and an easy way to see Wellington from above, though not the most exciting looking city compared to Sydney Australia, where we are from the $9 return ride is reasonably priced in fact it cost us more to park in the city also we found",
          "Was an awesome journey, great for families, beautiful lights in tunnels, lots of people on board for our trip so had to stand, but that was fine.",
          "My wife and I were on a tour and took this funicular cable car up to the summit. It takes about 5 minutes to get to the summit which is 120 meters high.",
          "This is a fun activity to do if you have an hour to spare, have a walk aroud up the top through the gardens and get some great photo shots of the city, there are public toilets at the top but a little grubby, Its not the best place to eat but good to take a picnic lunch",
          "Great way to see two areas of Wellington at a very low price and also experience a bit of history. We first enjoyed the shopping areas at the base of the cable car and then at the top of the cable car we enjoyed the museum, views and gardens. We had purchased the hop on hop",
          "One of the great cable car rides in the world, to one of the great views. Ride up and enjoy a long downhill walk through the botanical gardens.",
          "Although the journey doesn't last long, about 5 mins I think, it's worth every cent! The lighting effects in the tunnels and the destination at the top make it worthwhile.",
          "very reasonably priced at $9 return......thank you. Take the ride up and stroll back down through the Botanical Gardens. Lovely Lady Norwood Rose Garden and Begonia House. There's a coffee shop at the top should you feel the need as well as a nice little museum. A very nice way",
          "What a great view of Wellington on a warm clear day, the Cable car is only minutes ride but worth to see Wellington at another level from the hill. Cheap and easy to ride.",
          "You have to get up the hill one way or the other and this was a great way to go. It is a rather short trip, but scenic. The walk down thru the Botanic Garden was well worth it.",
          "Good value at $9 return , Queenstown is $44. The view is good and there is a cafe up top. Coffee at $5.80 is the most expensive I have ever had apart from Switzerland but at least it was good coffee",
          "Had an afternoon in Welly so had to go do this.. $9 for a return ticket... but I would consider a walk down so a son tip for $5 would be my recommendation.. Very nice tho and great view going up.. and down too.. Open until 22H so would Great to see with the city lights on o",
          "This is another one crossed off the bucket list. Had done it 50 years ago but the modern carriages are more comfortable and comply with Health and Safety regs. Still have to queue for tickets as it really has become a tourist attraction. The museum at the top gives the history",
          "Great cable car ride can\u2019t believe how windy Wellington is until you get to the top great museum also nice little cafe too if you want you can take the cable car up and walk back down through the Botanical Gardens",
          "A must do in Wellington NZ. A 10 minute ride up the mountain followed by a great view of Wellington You can walk back down through the beautiful Wellington Botanical Garden or ride back on the cable car.",
          "This was a nice little afternoon ride during our stay in Wellington. It doesn't take long to get to the top of the ride, where we exited and walked back down through the botanical gardens. Maybe some better signage to start you toward where the Botanical Garden is located, but",
          "Had fun going in cable car, looking round the museum and then walking down through the incredible botanical gardens, fantastic views of Wellington from the top, well worth it just for that!!",
          "Really enjoyed riding the tram to the top of the hill - and walking down through the Botanic Garden, Historic Cemetery and back down to Lampdon Quay.",
          "We paid our $9 each and hopped aboard with the seat at the lower window - great for photographs. This steep ride is a must do in Wellington, for the ride , the views and the panorama at the top.",
          "Walked up through the botanical gardens, had a great coffee at the cafe near the top and caught the cable car down. Job done!!!",
          "Enter the cable car from bottom in the middle of a terrific downtown shopping district or from the top where you have some terrific views. At the top is also a nice little museum and a cafe.",
          "As this is an icon of Wellington, you have to do it! The base station in the CBD was a little hard to locate, as it's basically down an alley. We bought roundtrip tickets, but ended up exploring the Botanic Gardens and then walking back into town through the Bolton Street",
          "The best way up to the top of the Botanical gardens. Spectacular views at the top. Always good to ride on an historic transport system",
          "It's just nice, being the traditional Wellington thing. Beyond that, it's not a special ride, just a uphill 5 minute trip. However, you can enjoy the views from above, once you get off the cable car, and walk through the gardens.",
          "short ride - nice museum at the top - cafe there a bit pricey. walk down through the botanic gardens a good way down - weather permitting !",
          "This is a MUST-DO activity when in Wellington, NZ. But, at only $5NZ (US$3) you can go up to the top for the best photos in the city! I'd recommend the 20 minute easy walk down back to town. On a clear day, you can see forever! This is highly recommended tourist activity for a",
          "Something fun to do if you are in Wellington. We were only there for the day so it was nice to take the ride to the top of the hill to get a panoramic view of the city.",
          "Cheap way of going to the top of the botanic gardens. It will save you a hilly walk. Take the cable car lane from lambton quay.",
          "Cute and different option to get to the Botanic Garden, the rio takes less than 10 minutes (or at least that\u2019s how it feels). O. The way you are not able to see the city but the tunnels have cool lights shows. The view from the top is nice!",
          "Spent the day in Wellington and had to go up in the cable car to see the views. Well worth the ride for the stunning views from the top.",
          "The cable car ride was short but well worth it. I would recommend the walk back down to the CBD through the Botanical Gardens (the gardens were beautiful even though it was raining lightly) as an alternative to returning on the cable car.",
          "You get a good view o Wellington. Recommend that you take the car up the hill, then an easy walk back down through the botanical gardens. When a cruise ship is in, there are plenty of guides to show you the way.",
          "Definitely worth of your time. It may be a bit challenging to find it at first, but the ride up hill will def be worth it. If you\u2019re lucky to get clear sky, the view will be amazing!",
          "Very regular service with great views over the city. Cable car in extremely good and clean condition. As a NZ Gold Card holder the \"up\" trip was free but as my return \"down\" journey was after 3.00pm I was charged $5 for a single trip. No big issue but a 3;00 cut-off is surely",
          "Great way to see the city. Takes tou up to the top of rhe city, and you can walk down through the fardens.",
          "Didn't have much time because we were visiting on day trip from cruise ship. The queue seemed to be neverending but eventually we made it (about 30-40 minutes wait). Great views from the top. Enjoyable ride. Walk around at top. Great little cafe and friendly staff - yummy food!",
          "Took us to the top and started our garden walk. The cable car was very clean and was on time and driver was very friendly .",
          "Friendly staff and good value for money. It was not luxury and the view on the way up was not particularly exciting, but the Botanic Gardens were beautiful.",
          "Well established for us tourists but did not realised still a very active part of transportation for the residential community to get into the city and return home We rode the cable car up, where there is a cable car museum with the history layed out, then we miander back down",
          "Can say we've done it. They take gold card. Awesome view from the top. Worth the trip. Got to do it while in Wellington",
          "Really enjoyed our ride on the cable car. Great cable car museum at the top which is really interesting and amazing views over Wellington. Lso a cafe. Walked back through the botanical gardens which were lovely.",
          "I guess it is a must to take the cable car in Wellington, even when the ride is just a few minutes. The car is kinda cute and the view from the endpoint is nice. After the cable car ride the walk in the botanical garden is a must. I enjoyed a lot.",
          "We took some friends who were visiting from Adelaide on a cruise ship to the Cable Car and they were hugely impressed, so much so that rather than us driving them back down, they took the return journey by cable car - very impressed!!",
          "Our two 6 year old grandsons really enjoyed their ride up and back. The little museum is interesting, as was watching the cables pulling the cars up.",
          "The actual ride is very quick. What you are going for here is the experience and the nice views on top of the hill. There\u2019s also a trail through the botanical garden to get down to the starting point without taking the cable car back. Just make sure you don\u2019t pay for the return",
          "This is a fun tram to ride to get up to where you can get a nice view of part of the city There is a restaurant/snack shop at the top. Some locals,use this for their commute to work.",
          "Short but memorable journey to reach the Botanical Gardens and Wellington Observatory. Marvellous piece of engineering affording great views in comfort.",
          "It's a nice way to get a good view from the top, a bit confusing on after being at top how you pay to get back down which is pay again back at the bottom but some great views and nice ride",
          "Nothing special, but always neat to ride a cable car. Very good view overlooking the central business district and bay.",
          "Worth using to go up To the botanical garden, good museum at th3 top very detailed history of the cable car and its popularity.",
          "Really enjoyed the Wellington Cable car. Once up good views of the City and wonderful walk down through the botanical gardens.",
          "We took the cable car up to the top which was a cheap way to travel. Once at the top we sat with a coffee and enjoyed the breathe taking views before walking back down through the botanical gardens.",
          "This is a great way to get up the the Botanical Gardens where there are great views over the city. The cafe/resaurant on the summit offers good food and great coffee. A must see if you are in Wellington.",
          "This is an easy place to visit on the main Street, and is a cheap $5 trip to an excellent view over the city. You can also go on to Zealandia eco park, or walk down through the botanical gardens. Nice half day out.",
          "Nice, but short, ride to the top. While not like the San Francisco cable bars it does the job. Best part is the top area with museum & shop, views overlooking Wellington along with other amenities. Well worth the time.",
          "Despite having to battle with a cruise ship of passengers all wanting to get on the Cable car, the queues moved very quickly and the wait not too long to get onboard. What a great, quick, picturesque way to get to the top of the hill! Enjoyed the small museum at the top of the",
          "Enjoyed the short ride in the cable car to the top of a very steep climb which has a terrific view at the top. It\u2019s busy at times but the cable cars run regularly- we paid $5 for a one way trip to the top, and walked down via the botanic gardens, and cemetery. It was a",
          "The cable car provides a fun way to the hill above Wellington for an overview of the city. Watch out for the queues for tickets and the large bus tours that queue jump you! Adult tickets $5. The ride is smooth with great views. The tunnels have a disco light effect... Once",
          "Suits it\u2019s purpose, nice simple ride with a lovely view. Only issue was the attitude of the man who greeted us. We\u2019d bought a city pass at the information centre for three attractions, one being the cable car. The older gentlemen behind the kiosk didn\u2019t recognise this voucher,",
          "We got a return ticket but walked back via rose garden and cemetery. Some nice houses and views on the way up, more a means of transportation than an attraction? Still cool though.",
          "Although the ride itself was pretty fast, the sights along the way are great! A transformation from the lively city to the picturesque hills of Wellington. Also, nice view at the top.",
          "It is a definite must to ride the Wellington Cable Car up the hill from Lambton Quay to the botanical gardens and to catch the shuttle to visit the Zealandia nature refuge. It is also a short walk from the bottom station of the cable car run to the Queen's Quay to find excellent",
          "The cable car itself isn\u2019t very exciting, but it\u2019s a great way (defined as quick and easy) to get to the top of the hill.",
          "A nice, quick, and fun way to get to the top of the hill for great views.We rode up and walked back down. It does not take long but is worth it for a bit of fun and to save your legs going up hill!",
          "Not worth the hype. Better for people who have intention of using it as a form of transport to get to one place to another, instead of coming to experience it as an attraction. It is a fairly short journey (less than 5 min) at $5 for a one way ticket with no view",
          "The ride itself is fairly short, but worth the price for the experience. You go through a few tunnels and two of them had light shows that were neat. Once at the top, you had a great view of the city & water, plus the cable car museum was right there. We only did a one way,",
          "Good way to get to the top of the hill...iconic experience in Wellington. Once at the top you have easy access to the cable car museum, the observatory and a leisurely walk down through the gardens. A well spent $5!",
          "Loved the cable car and psychedelic tunnels with cool colourful lights. The view from the top is great and walk through botanical gardens magical. We took a return ticket but there are at least a couple of exits that one can take to reach Wellington on foot.",
          "You travel in a very old cable car. The ride is short about 5 min to the top. There you can visit the. Cable Car museum and then walk through the gardens. Also from the top you have a view over the city. It is a great location to take a picture of Wellington. The city is not",
          "Its not long, but it's handy, especially you are going to th botanical gardens. A shuttle to Zealandia also leaves from the top. The view is nice but not earthshaking.",
          "This is a must do when in Wellington , it is cheap with family and student discounts , we went up to botanical garden , down past the Henry Moore sculpture to the graveyard , we then walked further past the old government building , the beehive then through the railway station",
          "The cable car trip is worthwhile in itself for the scenery and the experience. At the top there are numerous treats, such as the museum, the cafe, the perfumery, the gardens, and more in addition to the amazing views from the lookout.",
          "The starting point of the cable car is hidden in a ugly shopping center like area and you find it easy when you follow the queue. The way upwards with the light effects is a nice start. Arriving at the top in the botanic gardens you will be welcome from multiple city volunteers",
          "Great trip! Terrific views, very interesting cable car museum at the top - make sure to visit the perfumery too, across the courtyard.",
          "I always love a trip on a cable car and the Wellington funicular was a great way to get up to the Gardens. It's only a short, five minute journey and is very reasonably priced. The views from the top are stunning so it's well worth the trip.",
          "It was my first time riding a cable car! They really did a cool job with lights in the tunnel. It reminded me of warp speed from Star Wars or Star Trek. You don't have to buy the tickets in advance, you can just buy them in person. We took it up to the Botanic Gardens which",
          "A must-do. A wonderful way to spend a few hours. Take the ride to the top and walk down through the gardens.",
          "SO reasonably priced and such fun. We rode up, walked back. No need to book ahead, pitch up and enjoy.",
          "Walked to Cable Car from our Hotel. Buying tickets was quick and efficient. No concessions for seniors unless you are a NZ resident. The cable car is relatively quaint, but a great way to get to the high area in Wellington wher eon can visit the Space Place and the Botantic",
          "Cable car goes through tunnels, not a scenic trip up as we Expected. Cafe, museum and observatory all closed by 5.30 pm, although cable car runs until 10.00 pm. Botanic Gardens are not actually in evidence at the top, need a bit of a walk to see them. Some views of city, but",
          "A short and brief ride up the hill. Aside from a nice view it was unimpressive. The walk down through the gardens was the best part.",
          "Only a short ride but worth the $5. You travel to 3 stations through lit up tunnels. Only took the tram up as you can walk back down through the botanical gardens which are beautiful but steep in places. At the top is the tram museum - definitely worth a visit.",
          "We were given a complimentary one way voucher to use the cable car by our hotel (The Bolton), it\u2019s a quick efficient way to reach the top of the Botanical gardens and is also wheelchair accessible.",
          "It is a very pleasant way to visit the Botanical Gardens. Runs pretty frequently and is comfortable.",
          "This journey is only short but good value. I bought tickets online to avoid queues but there weren\u2019t really any queues. The views at the top are great as are the gardens. Cable car can be rather crowded which reduces the enjoyment. Zealandia bus goes from the top which is",
          "Took a return trip on the cable car. Super value for money and the view at the top was amazing. Well worth a visit",
          "The Wellington Cable Car is a \u201cmust do\u201d event for tourists. It\u2019s inexpensive to ride, is quite unique for it goes up and down a very steep incline but the actual distance it travels is only one km or so. I recommend that you take the cable car ride one way - upwards, get off",
          "Don't be confused that this is a sight seeing adventure. It is just a mode of transport to get from the top the bottom in Wellington. It is not a cable car where you will have lovely views but a funicular. It's great if you are using it to get from A to B but don't waste your",
          "This was one thing i was truly looking forward too but i was disappointed with the cable car as you are in a tunnel 99% of the time and only a brief moment (less than 1 minute) before you reach the top that is out in the open. Whole ride up goes quick over in a matter of",
          "Even better for Senior Gold Card holders being free at certain times I preferred the previous cable car ~ more vivid experience and not cocooned by electric doors, windows and air conditioning. Still a great experience and great for all ages",
          "There are not many activities to do in Wellington, but Cable Car is one that must do. It has history and very comfortable, only $10 for return ticket. The only cons I think is the length of it and not much to see during the trip. Of course you could take more photos of the city",
          "With the hype, I thought this cable car ride would be a longer ride, but the lines for ticket and a seat is longer than the trip. Once on the car ride, you can't really see much of Wellington from the car. but the view from up the top is great. the cable car museum was",
          "The cable car takes you to the top of the hill where there are museums, hikes, and various gardens. It is lovely.",
          "The cable car goes from Lambton Quay in the centre of the city up to the botanical gardens. It is 5 NZD single and 9 NZD return. It is sensible for the visitor to combine the cable car trip with a tour of the gardens, so ride up and walk down. There is also a cable car museum at",
          "The ride is short. Kind of disappointed. Should have just drive up to see the scenery. Waste my $ on the tram.",
          "I was expecting a network of cable cars that were connected to the city's most vibrant neighborhoods. I got a ride on an amusement park type ride that tried to give the flavor of San Fran. It dropped me off at the Wellington Botanical Gardens and did connect me to a free taxi",
          "It was an unique experience and easy way to get to Botanical Garden or Zealandia. We purchased the family ticket in advance over the internet, so it was just a matter of scanning in the QR Code at the turnstile. The cable cars come frequently, and there were no queues, so no",
          "The cable car is a quick (but inexpensive) trip up the hill. The bit that\u2019s really great is firstly the birds over the city and then the access to the botanical gardens. The walk down from the top is delightful, and well signed.",
          "We took the cable car on the downward journey, there is a small building at the top housing an original museum piece cable car along with a very small souvenir shop. There are obstructed views over the harbour outside the platform. Once you board the cable car there really is no",
          "Before you buy a round trip ticket I would consider buying a one way up then walk down through the botanical garden. You can also view the parliament buildings as well. Saves a few dollars and you get plenty of exercise.",
          "Enjoyed our trip up the mountain. Had a walk around the botanical gardens. Views were worth the trip",
          "A tradition stretching back to the early 1900s and the only way some people have of getting to work. Great views over the harbour and the Botanic Gardens and Observatory there for you to visit also so well worth a trip. Look in the free cable car museum for the history of this",
          "Must see in Wellington New Zealand was the billing... they were right. we were very impressed that in the middle of a busy city there is an outstanding Cable Car that takes folks to the top of the mountain, the botanical gardens and magic vistas",
          "Although a normal form of everyday public transport for Wellingtonians it is a must if you are a visitor to Wellington. The whole thing is steeped in history and if you like to know the ins and outs of things as I do you will most likely find this attraction quite the",
          "After a nice walk to the top of the botanical garden we decided to experience the cable car going down. A great service and terrific views across the City and water.",
          "It\u2019s so affordable this tram ride up to the top and the view is outstanding but the feel of being on the tram is really nice And it\u2019s kept so clean too",
          "The cable car runs regularly and is very clean. The ride up to the Botanical Gardens only takes a few minutes and the panoramic view of Wellington is well worth the trip.",
          "Found in a mall along Lampton Quay, the cable car takes you up to the botanical gardens. From which you get great views of the city. You purchase a one way or return ticket at the ticket office then go through the turnstiles using your ticket to board the cable car. On the way",
          "A quirky mode of transport but like the disco lights in the tunnels and the view from the top was lovely. We bought a one-way ticket and walked back down through the Botanical gardens which were stunning. The museum is worth a visit and has a restored original streetcar on",
          "This was the long activity done on a day trip to Wellington. We were blessed with brilliant weather so had amazing views. Great way to finish a great day...and not expensive",
          "The actual cable car is cool if you have never ridden in one. It is confusing on how to pay. We went down and you pay after you get off. It's weird as there are no signs.",
          "The cable car runs regularly and is clean. The ride is smooth and the tunnels lights are funky. Use this to get up to the Space Place and Botanical Gardens. The view of Wellington is great from the top and there is a cable car museum, toilets and cafe.",
          "my daughter and I took my grandson who is almost 2 on the cable car. He was very impressed with the lights in the tunnel. Also as we haven't been on it for sometime it is always nice to see Wellington from the cable car",
          "The cable car was nice, we went uphill through tunnels that had different lights in them. The view from the top was amazing and the botanic gardens were super nice too!",
          "Short ride but impressed, the view at the top was remarkable, didn't have time to go around the gardens, will try another time.",
          "The Wellington Cable Car was born of necessity in the early part of the twentieth century to develop the hills above the downtown port area. Wellington is some ways evokes San Francisco in that there are steep hills surrounding the city and its lovely Lambton Harbour. The",
          "Loved the trip up and back the mountain in the cable car. The views from the top were awesome and my son loved the LED lights in the tunnel. I have been to Wellington about 10 times but this is the first time I have been on the cable car and thoroughly enjoyed it.",
          "Only $5 each for a ride up the cable car. It's only a 5 minute ride, but rather cool and saves a slog up the hill. Then you have a nice view over the city, a cafe, museum, perfume shop and Zealandia you can visit, and then take a meandering walk down the hill through the",
          "When we have friends over we take them on a scenic Wellington tour and the cable car is where we start. It is a quick ride up, but I think it is nice and I like the lights in the tunnels. On the top, the cable car museum is worth a visit and of course you need to take the",
          "Used the cable car to get up to the gardens. Then we had a nice stroll down enjoying the well manicured gardens.",
          "The views from the top are well worth the price (which was very reasonable). We loved the illuminatated tunnels - very cool and something I haven't seen before. There weren't any waiting lines when we were there, and the cable cars come frequently. We also had lunch at the",
          "Great way to easily marvel at the topography of this city and the engineering prowess of our forefathers! Kids loved it. Cable car museum at the top (free) has dressing-up clothes which entertained for an hour as they got into role!",
          "Exciting and comfortable. Very nice and pleasant way to climb the hill to Botanic Garden. With a very nice cafe at the end of the cable car",
          "We did this up and down as we had limited time. We had a smoothie and a scone at the top and both were very good. The view if you have done things like this in the past was average at best. I can't speak of the gardens you could walk through on the way down as we didnt do that.",
          "The 3.5 minute ride up the mountain goes very smoothly. Once up the top you need to walk around the gardens to make it worth the trip. Interesting views from the top.",
          "Loved our trip so much. Wandered around botanic garden with terrific views. Short trip up but take time to do an adventure while at the top. Enjoy daytime & evening rides for more great photos",
          "We took a one way trip up in the cable car having decided to walk back down through the lovely gardens which was fantastic and ending down at the Rose Garden and Begonia House. While at the top we had a relaxed coffee and then took in the cable car museum before walking back",
          "Over far too quickly, but magical just the same, we rode the Cable Car to the top and walked leisurely back down the Botanical Gardens, which is a lovely circuit. The best bit about the Cable Car was the light show through the tunnel.",
          "Was expecting a bit more, over in about 4 minutes, go one way and walk back. Nice coffee at the top and quite a cute spot.",
          "The cable car was really fun to take up from the centre of Wellington. Its not very long but worth the $5. Getting to the top is the best part. There are 2 free museums at the top - the cable car museum (great for kids and adults) and the perfume museum. The perfume museum is a",
          "great lookout not too commercial, but if you want you can find souvenirs as well the museum is ok...",
          "Really interesting cable car and history. Was quite a short ride, but the view from the cable car and the tunnels was cool!",
          "The Wellington Cable Car is land-based, not an aerial gondola. When you arrive at the top in the suburb of Kelburn, there are beautiful views of Wellington. There, you may visit the free cable car museum and/or the free botanic garden. The cable car museum is rather small.",
          "The cable car was an excellent way for us to go to the Botanical Gardens. It was easy to get to and reasonably priced, not to mention a fun ride.",
          "Only takes a few minutes to get to the top worth it for the views. You can then do museum and space centre which is worth a visit. I would walk back down through gardens rather than take cable car back down.",
          "A very short trip but well worthwhile as the views on the way up are spectacular. Easy to access & reasonably priced",
          "The cable car was very good but the wait appeared long but it moved within 20 minutes. The venues at destination were excellent esp the Space Museum.",
          "The ride only takes 5 minutes, and you may need to queue for 10 minutes to get on, but the views of Wellington and the harbour from the top are great! The free cable car museum at the top is well worth a short visit, and a stroll through the streets of pretty Kelburn up the top",
          "This is a must do when you visit Wellington. The view of the city from the top is beautiful and then you can walk through the Botanical Garden.",
          "Bit of a queue to use but once on a quick assent up the hill side. Good views of the harbour from the top . Cafe and small museum at the top with nice botanical type gardens to walk around. Bit of a damp day when I went but on a clear day views would be fantastic. Cable car is",
          "If you are visiting wellington, you just have to have a ride on the cable car - Swiss engineering in the Southern Hemisphere at its best The lower terminal does get crowded and busy. My advice is queue in the upper boarding section if you want a good hillside view - queue in",
          "A short ride with a few stops upward with panaramic views of Wellington, NZ. The Botanical Gardens and cable car museum among other sights are on the route.",
          "The cable car gets you to Kelburn in just 5 minutes. Brings you to a pick-up point for Zealandia. Also brings you to the top for a great view of Wellington.",
          "Well organized & a good outing for the full family in Wellington. Staff are amazing & friendly making family visits so easy. It\u2019s must to do in Wellington",
          "A $5 little cable car ride was good value and the walk back down to the city was beautiful. Don\u2019t expect anything amazing. It\u2019s just a cable car ride up the hill. Amazing feat of engineering and the little museum is worth a quick look.",
          "Very long queue but it went surprisingly fast to get onboard. The trip is nothing special, not like Hong Kong, the \"famous\" light tunnel is nothing. Very nice view from the top. I recommend walking down thru the wonderful botanical garden.",
          "We were staying near the top of the cable car, so using it once I was a must do. At five dollars one way per adult, it is not a multiple trip activity given it takes about three minutes. The tram goes every 10 minutes and is clean and extremely well maintained.",
          "It was a good experience, nothing to wow you but it's a tram-like car into which you get. The car then goes up the hill, if you have a return ticket, you can get back. On the top, there is a museum and botanical garden which are quite nice. The view from the top is awesome. I",
          "We went on the cable car as with it was not far from where we were staying. We had heard that it was a quick ride and great views. This is correct! We bought return tickets as we didn't think we would like walking back! The cable car was very quick!! The light tumnels were good",
          "Bargain at the price for an amazing view out over Wellington and out to the harbour. Worth a trip up, and a wander across the botanical gardens!",
          "The views from the top of the cable car are magical looking over all of Wellington and the harbour and the actual ride is very comfortable but quite short. Excellent little attraction.",
          "This cable car is actually used by locals because of the steep hill they live on. As a tourist I felt it was worth the $4 because we were there and wanted to experience it. Don't need to do it again.",
          "A short but fascinating trip. Weather was not the best with Wellington living up to its reputation as 'Windy Wellington' The rain added to the ambience! So views from the top were limited and the walk back down through the Botanical Gardens damp! Nonetheless a 'not to be",
          "At $5 each way it ends up being about $1 per minute but it\u2019s a cute ride up and an easy way to get great views of the City. Suggest a walk down again through the botanical gardens which are lovely and takes about 45 minutes down to the city via the historical cemetery and",
          "We went to the botanical Gardens with the cable car it was a lovely experience. The first ride we had was lovely was nicely interacting with the tourist. Going down was a very grumpy young man he hated his job you can see that. He could have a little smile on his face when we",
          "Stayed at Kelburn for 3 days so bought a 10 trip card. Regular service so 10 mins wait max. Worked well for our visit",
          "It is a short ride but at the top there are some great views. Also, from there you can start some very interesting walking itineraries going down through the botanic garden. First, you may want to visit the cable car museum.",
          "Enjoyed the ride. It wasn\u2019t long but gave an amazing view from the top of the track. Loved how the cable cars ran every 10 minutes so time was of no issue.",
          "We understand that this is more like an icon of Wellington and we for sure wanted to visit and we did whoever it wasn't what we were expecting.. but certainly we recommend as it's of course one of the things that you must do while visiting Wellington!",
          "This is a great way to access the attractions 'up top'. Although called a cable car I think of it as a funicular railway. I took the up journey. My first surprise was that it had intermediate stations before reaching the upper terminus. Indeed, some locals used it as a 'commute'",
          "A must if visiting Wellington and once at the top you can see all the history relating to these cable cars from the beginning to now.",
          "It was a great experience travelling on the cable car. What a great way to see Wellington. Have a great look around the museum and especially the bottom level to see the original cable car. The lights through the tunnel were very pretty.",
          "Great experience, short ride, but lots to see when you get to the top. Well worth a trip up. Don't pay cruise ship tour prices !!! There are free shuttles, this actuation is a short walk from shuttle. The cable car cost $9 return, there are gardens, cafes, shops, museum , space",
          "We rode up on the cable car and wandered down the hill through the botanical gardens. The Rose Garden at the bottom of the hill was a highlight. The roses are huge here. We exited through the cemetery at the bottom of the gardens. It was an enjoyable way to spend the",
          "A unique way to reach a great view. Cafe at the top (great service, good food, reasonable prices) made a for a pleasant stop and many walked back down the hill via the Botanical Gardens (immediately adjacent). Buy return only if you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll travel both ways via the cable",
          "Beautiful clean car with clean windows for clear views. Be sure to go before 3:00 because the Zealandia tour bus offers it's last ride at 3:40.",
          "Great must see and do when in Wellington Very affordable Great views Great museum at the top very informative Great coffee shop and eatery at the top",
          "We got on the first cable car to arrive. Nice but short ride, partially through tunnels with coloured lights. The botanical gardens were beautiful to walk through, but pretty steep on the way back up to the top if you buy a return journey!",
          "This Funicular Railway is a fun way to get up to the top of the hill in order to hike down through the Wellington Botanic Garden.",
          "The cable car mainly goes through lighted tunnels (understandable, given Wellington's windiness). However, this means there is not a lot to see on the trip itself. The real gem is the botanical gardens at the top and the grand views down to the harbour (again from the top, not",
          "It was very short ride up, under 5 minutes. They also really pack you in, so it can get very crowded. The cable-car itself is reminiscent of an older version of the one in Hong Kong (going up Victoria Peak). We bought one-way tickets, then walked to Parliament House, then along",
          "We purchased our tickets online to save time and walked straight here once we were dropped off in the city. I loved the ride up to the top (especially the light tunnels). The walk down was fantastic as well - really handy guides helping",
          "The ride was fun, the lines not so. We had to stand in line for almost an hour to get up. The cable car was fun. Had two stops on the way. Takes you to the top of the mountains, from where you can see the city. Don't buy RT ticket! Instead, ride to the top and then walk down",
          "We jumped on the Cable Car in the city and rode it up the top. It is worth the trip just to see the city of Wellington from the highest point. The houses at the top are equally impressive. It doesn\u2019t take long if you time it right. Try and avoid cruise traffic, go early.",
          "Took cable first thing in morning and experienced no crowds at all. Later we noticed a line due to 2 cruise ships in town. Had good coffee at restaurant at top cable car stop. Checked the nice little museum. Free. Space observatory up there but not for internal viewing. Then",
          "An exciting journey steeped in history and surrounded by beautiful gardens. Walking down to town from the top is recommended as the botanic gardens are well worth a look. The history museum at the top is great. There is a nice cafe at the top as well.",
          "We went up the hill in the cable car a couple of times. This is definitely one of those must do things when you are in Wellington. At the top you have a magnificent view over Wellington. There is also a cafe to stop and have a coffee, something to eat or even a drink at the",
          "Many tours will drop you off at the top and collect you at the base. Interesting museum to look at before the descent which is quite spectacular.",
          "Located in the city center, this is a great way to get to the top and see Wellington on a clear day. After taking in the views, we descended onto the paths that took us through the beautiful Botanic Gardens. Some of the paths are a bit steep, so good walking shoes are",
          "Convenient method to reach scenic views of city. Once you reach mountain top there is cafe where you can grab small bite or beverage while enjoying the view.",
          "The ride itself is not long but certainly offers a bit of a novelty and nostalgia. Originally opened in 1902 the cars have been replaced but the route and tunnels remain historic. $9.00 return for an adult, operating Monday-Friday 7am-10pm, Sat 8.30an-10pm and Sunday 8.30am-9pm.",
          "On a fine day visiting the Botanic Gardens via the cable car is highly recommended. Excellent views on the journey up and at the top. It is an easy walk back into town (emerging near the Parliament buildings) down through the beautiful Botanic Gardens and Rose Garden (no signs",
          "Make the most of the cable car and try go on a sunny day. We started on Lambton Quay and went up, make sure you walk around the gardens when you are up there and go to the cafe in the gardens or one on Lambton Quay at the bottom cause the cafe at the top is quite overpriced. So",
          "Took the cable car to the top of the hill. It was cheap and better then walking. I do not know if you would call this an attraction, more of just a transportation.",
          "We took the cable car going down the hill. It is a comfortable ride and it takes you through two tunnels on the way down. At the top you have great views of downtown and the harbor. We found outcasts lot of people ride up and walk down through the botanical gardens. Because of",
          "The cable car trip was a nice unique experience that was really well priced. It was something that can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. The museum was interesting and worth a look. Great views from the top stop. Well worth it.",
          "Traveling in the Wellington cable car is worth it. The entrance is conveniently located in the city center on Lambton Quay. Those who have a fascination for cable cars will certainly enjoy the ride. The views from the top are okay. By reaching the top, one can get easy access to",
          "Seriously it's just a cable car; but it does get you to the top, and it's a really steep hike if your don't take it",
          "Quick ride to the top of Wellington. Good experience and well worthy the effort. Climb 120 metres in 5 minutes.",
          "Enjoyable trip to the top of Wellington, town lived up to it reputation wet and windy so we pasted on the walk down from there to the beehive, instead we rode the cable car down again. Good view from the top and on a dry day would have enjoyed the walk. Merchandising store at",
          "Cleverly decided to visit after lunch..no lines and straight up.. cute little train with a great view from the top.. an easy walk to get to the top.. nice and quick and well maintained",
          "The cable car takes you up to the top of the mountain in a couple of minutes. The ride is not spectacular, but it is nice enough and costs only 5$. It is a good idea to take the cable car up and walk down.",
          "Convenient, comfortable trip to the top of the Botanical Garden. We did walk past the entrance and luckily only walked about a block too far before we asked. Locate it on your maps ap.",
          "We went for a ride on the cable car because the last two times we had been to Wellington it had been closed for routine maintenance, both times about the same time of year. Loved the ride and the tunnels are cool. Particularly enjoyed the cable car museum at the top. Thought the",
          "We rode the Cable Car up the mountain and enjoyed the view from the top. Because it is springtime, the trees and bushes were flowering and their was a nice pungent smell in the air.",
          "Very poor signage, if it is such an attraction in Wellington they must have better signage. Staff must explain that botanical garden is a steep walk for a cable ride back. feel sorry for the senior citizens as there is no facility.I recommend buggy cars for those who want the",
          "Possibly because it was a Cruise ship day, the line was very long and took over half an hour. The cars are cute and well maintained. The ride is short, but better than walking. We walked down thru the old cemetery.",
          "Not only is this the easiest way to access Wellington's 'high country' like the Botanic Gardens, Observatory and even Victoria University it is an experience in itself. The cable car operates regularly from its base tucked away in Cable Lane (quite logically).The steep climb",
          "Nice ride to the top and walk down via the botanical gardens. Great way to exercise and get fresh air in the city",
          "Nice but nothing overly exciting, the view under the excursion is ok, and the staff is really friendly",
          "The cable car is really a vernacular and costs $9 return. There are good views at the very top so bring your camera. There is also a small free museum at the top.",
          "If you take the cable car from the center of town you don't have to climb all the way to the top of the botanic gardens. At the top there is a shuttle bus to Zeelandia.",
          "Is a lovely ride. By the end of the way you arrive in a massive and amazing park, reserve all day for enjoy the whole place.",
          "If you visit this lovely capital city in New Zealand, the cable car ride to the high point of the city is a must do. A relatively short journey, but tad guess are stunning. Easy access to the botanical gardens - another lovely experience.",
          "There was a lovely view from the top of he cable car and it's a great fast way of getting to the top for zealandia or the botanical gardens but the ride itself is not supper interesting. There are some great murals and lights in the tunnels that the cable car goes through but",
          "We took a one way ticket and then walked back via the Botanic gardens. Great views and fairly priced at $5 each one way!",
          "Cute historical ride up the hill in Wellington. Get off and go to the museum and the botanic gardens which are lovely.",
          "We took the cable car up for 5$ and took the great touristy foto and walked back down through the botanical gardens. Can totally recommend that as a trip. We also visited the small museum, it was interesting but I really loved the view up the mountain. Totally worth it.",
          "Wonderful ride up to Botanical Gardens (free), Planetarium, Cable Car Museum (free) and free shuttle to/from Zealandia eco-sanctuary. Short ride but worth the cost. Get the \"Return\" (roundtrip) ticket.",
          "Lovely and enticing, this is an experience to be had by all. By taking a ride you also have a ride to the Wellington Botanic Garden. Great experience.",
          "This was part of a tour but It cost $5- for the one way up the mountain side. Views up the top were wonderful. Very unique & something you should try & do in Wellington",
          "We went on the cable cars to the top . We grabbed a cup of hot chocolate at the cafe at the top. The view is amazing. Its a smooth ride to the top and only takes a few miniutes then a lovely walk down into the gardens. It was a little chilly when we took the cable cars but well",
          "Five dollars, three minute so probably not the highlight of your holiday but why not? Cable car museum up top well worth a look.",
          "Great way to see the botanical gardens and get a great vista of the city. Runs every 5 minutes and costs NZD 9 return but you can get a 1 way ticket and walk back (downhill) to be the city centre",
          "It is a must do in wellington and while it is not a spectacular cable car it is please ride to the scenic view of the top of hiill. The walk down is nice - about 30 minutes",
          "Great to get you to the botanical gardens & back! We only got it back down but it was a cute little trip! Reasonable priced & goes every 10 minutes!",
          "We took a return trip on the cable car passed through several will lit tunnels with coloured lights, it is a very steep descent but we felt safe. Two stops on the way up and down were you can get off at either.",
          "What a wonderful experience we had, from the start of being able to travel free with our SuperGold cards, to the magnificent views of Wellington. Thoroughly enjoyed the trip.",
          "Having visited the city for the first time we had to give the cable car a go. Great ride and spectacular scenery from up top.",
          "had a lovely ride up to the top in the cable car. Good price to! Had a great milkshake at the cafe at the top, and also saw a New Zealand Native bird close up, singing away, it was a Tui! you could tell by the two white bells on its kneck, so cool..... looked also at the cable",
          "Our cruise ship the Majestic Princess called in at Wellington for a day during our cruise around both islands of New Zealand. We took a coach tour to see the main sights and finally ended up at the cable car ride to the top.. The carriage was really old style and we made our way",
          "Went up the cable car with my daughter and grandson. A cool wee trip. We had lunch at the cafe, wonderful views of Wellington. Went to the wee museum then strolled through the gardens. Lovely way to spend an afternoon.",
          "Very cool small trip up the hill. Kids love it, and brings you to the top of Wellington's beautiful botanical garden. Do it on a nice and sunny day and you'll get a great view of the city!",
          "If you havent done it, it is worth the trip on yesteryear transport. Take stroll around the garden at the top and the observatory is also very good.",
          "A \"must-do\" as a visitor to the city. Great views, followed up with a wonder around the museum and the sprawling botanical gardens. A pleasant return trip down later in the day topped of our overall experience.",
          "A short but lovely ride up the mountain. With spectacular views & a comfortable cable car at very reasonable prices. Ended up spending more time than planned wandering the botanical garden & hillside. Plenty of places for little kids to enjoy & the playground was a fantastic hit",
          "This is the quintessential Wellington. The ride on the cable car is pretty funky, spotlessly clean and a bright roomy vehicle. There is easy access for walkers, prams and wheelchairs alike. We didn't feel rushed to get on or get off at the stops. The view from the top on our",
          "Booked tickets online for when our cruise ship docked, Everyone else seemed to have the same idea so spent the day exploring Wellington. What a lovely place!. By 3pm there were no queues and no waiting to get on. Could have spent hours up there just admiring the view except for",
          "Great cost and it was a quick beautiful ride, tucked into a little lane, which we actually walked past twice looking for it, but once we saw it we wondered how we missed it. Cues looked long, but moved very quickly, great price, and lovely gardens and cafe at top. Highly",
          "A short but enjoyable ride which we did one way down as part of a day tour of Wellington. Specially enjoyable as our last attempt was aborted when we arrived in Wellington on one of 2 huge ships and queue was just too long.",
          "This was very affordable and something you don't get to do everyday if you don't live in Wellington. The coffee at the top yum and the walk down through the Botanical Gardens was beautiful",
          "Kids loved the awesome light tunnel, driver was lovely and very accommodating and helpful with us having two infants in prams. Great views of Wellington from the top would recommend to anyone visiting this city.",
          "What a nice ride, There were colorful lights in a tunnel. The ride was short, but I was impressed with the views",
          "Bought the round trip cable car ticket\u2014 Went up and had a great snack a the Cable car cafe at the top and being that we didn\u2019t have a lot of time we went back down. Worth doing.",

          "An enjoyable trip up the hill . The cable car museum is extremely interesting and well worth it. We didn\u2019t walk all around the gardens, but if you took the time it looked lovely.",
          "We got a one way ticket up and then did the city walk going down. Great way to see many different things in this part of the city.",
          "Nothing extraordinary, although a nice view. If with a car, better to access the same view and atop location via the nice botanic gardens",
          "5 minute trip to top. Runs every 10 minutes until 8pm then every 15 minutes until 10:00. A bit pricey but worth it. There are discount family and senior fares. Small museum and cafe at top open until 5 pm. Botanical Gardens are just yo right side of gardens just to right side",
          "Yes, do this if you can tho I would give the Museum and parliament buildings priority if time is short. You go up in the car, learn quite a bit about how land speculation and development happened in this area, enjoy a tea or beer at the top and get some nice views of the town.",
          "We took a ride on the cable car (funicular) on the last morning of our stay. It\u2019s quite expensive for what is quite a short trip, but still enjoyable, given it\u2019s not something you do every day. Two of the tunnel sections have multicoloured lights lining them, which made me",
          "This was really good, only a short trip up and back, but worth the ride. Tunnels all light up like a disco as you go through them, well done with that.",
          "Very economical, up to the top. Plenty to do and see, go for the night and take in the night sky. Great walk through the gardens",
          "Not to be missed- right in the heart of city shopping centre so easy to locate. Not expensive and lovely Cafe at the top.",
          "Short ride up the hillside to a panoramic view of Wellington and the harbor. Tram was clean and quiet. Worth a few minutes on a nice day. Not well marked but a three minute walk to the Dominion Observatory provided even better vistas.",
          "A fun one-time experience for me during my first few weeks in Welly, with stunning views of the city. Ride down from the botanic gardens for the full experience. Not worth using if a local, in my opinion.",
          "The ride is very short but the views from the top are good. The well sign posted walking route back down via the botanical gardens was thoroughly enjoyable.",
          "The cable car was excellent. We chose to ride up and walk down. The scenery was stunning. The big let down was the appalling manners of the cable car man who was boarding us. He was one of the rudest men I have ever met. I am stunned he has a job there as he really should not",
          "Great trip up the mountain to see the city and harbour. Well priced and easy short trip that runs regularly. Cable Car museum at the top was interesting. Also beautiful garden walks at the top. I will make sure I allow more time next trip to explore the gardens more.",
          "Having done the cable car in Hong Kong I wanted to do the same in Wellington. We went up just before 8pm and got some lovely night views across the city. I wish we\u2019d had more time to do it by day and walk back through the gardens.",
          "The entrance to Cable Car Alley is a bit hidden but located right in the centre pf town. On a sunny day, you'll get the best views of the city (from a central location- Victoria Peak is also great but further out) from here. You go through some slightly random flashing lights",
          "Great, inexpensive service. I recommend this place for a quick, cheap meal. Plenty of choices and fantastic value for money.",
          "The cable car is a must do experience with the kids. It is a short journey and a very reasonable price. You reach the top and check out the amazing views. There is also a cable car museum at the top. It is small but also free. We also enjoyed the walk through the botanical",

          "The cable car is easy to get to, reasonable ticket price. There wasn\u2019t a lot of things to do at the top (I didn\u2019t go to Zealandia though). Beautiful view of the city from the top.",
          "A fun wee trip up the cable car. Great colours through the tunnels and spectacular views at the top easy access onto Zealandia or to the botanical gardens. We visited the planetarium while up there also",
          "Good activity if you want to experience a bit of history and get nice views over the city. The LED light show through tunnels on way up was a nice touch",

          "Everyone loves a cable car ride and they will enjoy this one. Friendly helpful staff and a smooth comfortable ride 600m up the side of the hill to great views at the top. You go through a tunnel with lots of fairy lights, must be good at night. If you have a Gold Card make sure",
          "This attraction continues to perform, with modern, clean and efficient cars and terminals. We enjoyed our return experience. There are excellent vistas from the summit over the Wellington CBD, harbour and towards the Hut Valley. At the summit, we enjoyed a short loop walk which",

          "Entering Cable Car Lane and purchasing a return ticket on the Cable Car is a great way to view wellington both on the Journey up/down but the view from the top is magnificent. The Cable Car Museum is also worth a visit particularly if you have an interest in the history of the",
          "Great tourist attraction - only takes 5 minutes to ride the cable car to the other end, which is where you can purchase a ticket. Family with one adult & 3 kids was $15 return. There\u2019s a few eateries where you get off so we grabbed some lunch and then we got back on the cable",
          "We took the cable car uphill ($5) and then walked down through the Botanical Gardens (free). The ride is quick so just a trip up and back down would seem pretty expensive. The view from the top is glorious! And the casual stroll downhill through the gardens is a very pleasant",
          "Was a bit expensive if only going for the return trip, which isn't very long. We started at the base and rode up, got off and visited the Cable Car Museum (worth doing, interesting), walked around some of the gardens (very pretty), had lunch at the Cafe (average food, but nice",

          "The cable car journey is rather short but the view at the top is beautiful. I went in the evening so the view of the city lights was breathtaking. I felt it was little pricey (NZD9) for a short journey though.",

          "A quick and practical way of getting to the top of the hill behind Wellington. Great lookout at the top and an enjoyable walk back through the Botanic Gardens, past Parliament House into the foreshore. Efficiently run, seems well operated.",
          "Fun ride to the top of the hill Reminds me of the cable cars in San Francisco but on smaller basis- there are only 2 of them Not a bargain",
          "Not worth the time as a cable car ride except if you want a arial view photo, but one would get better photos from the Mt Victoria lookout.",
          "Well worth a trip on this cable car. Plenty of room and worth the wait. Great ride to the top and then a walk through the gardens to the bottom. Have your cameras ready and a cup of tea in the cafe on the way down.",
          "I\u2019m not quite sure why this ride is $9 return. It literally takes fives minutes. The view is lovely and Carter observatory staff friendly. Nice blustery walk away from city life.",
          "The ride was smooth, short and fun! I love the view on top of the cable car, the wellington botanical garden and cable car museum is also at the top of the cable car. While at the bottom is the CBD just walk for 4 mins and you\u2019ll reach the wellington museum. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "This ride on the cable car only takes 3 1/2 minutes, so it\u2019s worth getting the return ticket just so you can ride it for a little longer. A ticket for a family of 5 is $20 return. The lit up tunnels are nice, and the views from the top are worth it. The museum up the top is",
          "What a fantastic little tram / cable car! The history is there and the walk down through the botanical gardens well worth doing!",
          "And before you know it, the funicular ride was over, but as a visitor to this beautiful city a ride on the bright red cable car was all just part of exploring. Our single ticket journey began at Lambton Quay rising up one hundred and twenty metres to the Botanical Gardens in",

          "The cable car is very much like Angles Flight in Los Angeles, Ca. but the views of Wellington at the top are spectacular. From the top you can see the entire bay and most of the city. The park is also a wonderful place for a relaxing stroll and fantastic views. The ride up is",
          "A very quick trip up, but a nice experience. Takes you up to the gardens where you can look around. There\u2019s also a cable car display. Beautiful views of the city. Perfect on a nice day.",

          "We were treated to two stunning days in Wellington and the weather was absolutely beautiful. With weather like that it meant a definite ride up on the cable car to take in the amazing views from the top and we wre not disappointed! Well worth it.",

          "Visit to Wellington is incomplete without taking a ride in this lovely little cable car. One should go up the hill in this and come down walking through the Botanical Garden.",
          "Well they talk it up but it comes with no punch. Waist of time really. Get to the top and they have souvenir shops to buy from and a bar but that's about it.",

          "What a ride in this rail that has been in going for 100 years. 2 Trams going in opposite directions. Great ride with fantastic views over Wellington, with Historic homes on either side. Once at the top you can take photos of Wellington and take a walk around the Botanical",
          "The ride was fun, and we didn\u2019t know to expect such a great view from the top of the hill, so that was even more of a bonus! There\u2019s also a free museum and a cafe at the top of the hill, and we went back again the next night to visit the space centre. It\u2019s a cheap bit of fun ($9",

          "We did not know what to expect with the cable car, but we paid our $9.00 each, (pensioners), and hopped on board for what turned out to be a fairly short trip of less than 10 minutes up the rather steep hillside. I think the car could also be described as a tram as that was our",

          "We took a family trip on the cable to enjoy the scenic view from the top. This was indeed amazing. There is a small museum at the top which is well worth a visit. The trip is worth it but quite expensive for the 4 tickets we needed as our children were not quite young enough",
          "Definitely a must do when you are here. We sat next to a local who pointed out various landmarks going up. The view up the top is amazing and although windy we had a perfect view.",

          "It's a short ride up and down on the cable car, but oh so worth it. It gets you to the botanical gardens and the space museum, and along the way your treated to a wonderful little light show. It's unique and fun and worth the price. I recommend sitting all the way in the front",
          "5 NZD for a one way ticket, it's a cool experience if you are interesting on doing something new in Wellington Would say it's cool to do it but it isn't a must do. The ride up is about 8 minutes or so and if you are looking for a great view, I would rather recommend going on top",

          "I don't intend to annoy any Kiwis with my title, but having spent time in San Francisco before, I couldn't help except make that connection. In fact, much of Wellington reminds of San Francisco in terms of some of the topology as well as the general vibe of the city. I",
          "When we went, there was a slightly long line since it was the Easter break but we didn't wait too long - the cable car conductor let us on since we were okay with standing-up (Tip: You don't need to be sitting down to enjoy it so if you get offered to get on, take it rather than",
          "It was a bit difficult to find the lower entry. The ride up was comfortable and suited for someone on a mobility walker. The view from the top was magnificent and the centre had good lookouts and a souvenir shop.",
          "Great way to catch some amazing views across the lovely city of Wellington! There was a little bit of a queue, but worth the wait! As the cable car makes its way up the hill, look across to the harbor and city...wonderful!",
          "This short cable car trip takes you up to the botanic gardens for lovely views of the city. Expensive for the duration of the ride but a fun activity to do while in Wellington.",
          "Our hotel was very near the entrance to the cable car. We took it up and wow what a fantastic view. We walked around the botanic garden for a bit, we saw space place and then saw a show at the observatory. Seeing the southern sky for the first time was absolutely phenomenal.",
          "Loved this experience of the cable car in Wellington. Situation on Lambton Quay the process of ticket purchasing is simple and the cable car itself is such a nice treat",
          "I used to travel on this as a child and I really enjoyed revisiting this experience. The museum at the top was awesome and the views of the city were spectacular!",
          "Nice scenic trip to the top of the hill. Well worth alighting and taking in the views. Best taken on a fine day. Very well priced. Used by tourists and locals alike. A must-do on a trip to this city.",
          "Great view and smooth service ...good turn around so the wait is never too long . Nice cafe at the top to enjoy lunch or a snack after walking around the botanic gardens .",
          "Cost effective way to reach the top of the hill. Fun trip for families and people of all ages and abilities",
          "Great way to start our journey through the botanical gardens. Museum at the top was interesting. Checked out Space Place at the top as well. Kids loved the lights in the tunnels.",
          "We were so happy to ride the cable car in this city of lots of HILLS. The cars are very clean. Getting on and off is very orderly and the ride is fun.",
          "The Cable Car ride is a very popular attraction. It climbs 120 metres in 5 minutes up the side of a \u201cmountain\u201d to a beautiful lookout over the city and the Wellington Botanic Gardens. We took the Cable Car to the top where there are toilets and a free Cable Car Museum. We then",
          "The cable car is a short ride, not over-priced, and once at the top of the steep incline you get some great views across the city and bay area. A good cafe is also open up the top, and you can also catch the Zealandia shuttle from here.",
          "Shame they didn\u2019t have the Easter egg hunt on Good Friday. Went up on a great day and the views of Wellington were amazing. The lights in the tunnels and people on the cable cart were lovely. Always a good trip to take visitors and a favourite is the gelato at the top.",
          "We were dropped off by a shuttle bus from our cruise ship into the centre of Wellington. Our friendly and helpful bus driver told us to walk \u201cjust a wee way\u201d down the street to the cable car. It was very easy to find and we were so impressed with the organization at the ticket",
          "I\u2019m pleased we didn\u2019t pay for a return as the walk back down through the botanical gardens was outstanding. We waited a while to get on the tram and the ride was over fast. Views are limited. Hard to give this more than 3 stars",
          "We used the cable car on a sunny bright day so good views all around! Inexpensive at NZ$9 return. Very busy on Easter Saturday... at the top there is a cafe and several other tourist attractions..eg botanical gdns. We enjoyed!",
          "As a form of transportation to get to the botanical garden or to experience the cafe then it is worth it. But as an attraction in itself it\u2019s a bit overrated. I accept it is an engineering feat and could appeal on that basis and definitely a Wellington icon.",
          "Good fun way of getting to the top of the hill and visiting the planetarium and getting a view of the city and bay.",
          "to the top station and boy, this is steep! Fun, but steep! But then one is rewarded with great views, and the ride down is really enjoyable. I love that this is not a tourist thing but real mass public transport. Think Istanbul or Budapest more than Heidelberg. Note: If you",
          "Great little cable car and easy to access. Great trip up with excellent attention to detail in the car. Lights in the tunnels were a bonus",
          "A great affordable family activity. The views at the top are great and the planetarium is awesome, nice place to walk amongst the gardens",
          "We travel on the cable car every time we come to Wellington. It\u2019s such a unique experience with great views. Now we have led tunnels too! Great stuff"

        "wiki": "In 1998 the Wellington City Council set aside 200 hectares of retired farmland in Karori southwest of Wellington, New Zealand, for a mountain bike park. Development of the Makara Peak Mountain Bike Park began almost immediately with volunteer work parties planting trees, removing pest animals and digging new tracks.\nBy 2014 the park had grown to 250 hectares with over 40 kilometres of hand-built single track and over 35,000 native seedlings planted. Pests such as goats, sheep, and possums had been dramatically reduced with volunteers maintaining possum traps and bait stations and mustelid traps, allowing new vegetation to flourish.\nThe park is free to use and open to both cyclists and pedestrians. Approximately 30% of its users are pedestrians.\nThe Makara Peak Mountain Bike Park was visited by 8% of the Wellington population in 2003 according to research carried out by the Wellington City Council. It has received a recreation award from the New Zealand Recreation Association and two conservation awards from the New Zealand Department of Conservation.\nThe park is jointly managed by the Wellington City Council and Makara Peak Mountain Bike Park Supporters Inc.A swing bridge was added to the mountain bike park in 2017 after a successful donation campaign raised over $35,000 .\n\n\n== External links ==\nMakara Peak Mountain Bike Park\nWellington City Council\nMakara Peak at Tracks.org.nz\n\n\n== References ==",

      "name": "Weta Workshop",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Weta Workshop is a special effects and prop company based in Miramar, New Zealand, producing effects for television and film.\nFounded in 1987 by Richard Taylor and Tania Rodger as RT Effects, Weta Workshop has produced creatures and makeup effects for the TV series Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess and effects for films such as Meet the Feebles and Heavenly Creatures. A digital division, Weta Digital, was formed in 1993.\nWeta Workshop's output was used in director Peter Jackson's film trilogy The Lord of the Rings, producing sets, costumes, armour, weapons, creatures and miniatures. It supported the creation of Reclaiming the Blade (2009), a documentary film on stage combat, historical European and Asian swordsmanship.The company is named after the New Zealand weta, one of the world's largest insects, which is also featured in the logo.\n\n\n== Innovations ==\n\n\n=== Chainmail ===\nFor the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, realistic looking PVC chainmail was made, not just for the lead actors, but also for the hundreds of extras that appeared throughout the films. PVC pipe was cut into rings, assembled by hand into armor, and then electroplated. A total of 82.9 million links were manufactured from 7 miles of PVC pipe.\n\n\n=== Bigatures ===\nThe term bigature is Weta Workshop's nickname for a very large miniature model. They are used in the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, with the largest of them measuring some 9 metres high. Extensive computer graphics techniques and computer-controlled cameras were used to seamlessly mesh the Bigature photography with live actors and scenes. Weta also used Bigatures in Peter Jackson's King Kong.\nBigatures used in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy include:\n\nThe Hornburg \u2013 the mountain fortress of the Rohirrim\nThe Grey Havens \u2013 the Elven harbour\nMinas Tirith \u2013 the White City of Gondor\nRivendell \u2013 Elrond's city for the Elves\nCaras Galadhon \u2013 Galadriel's city in Lothlorien\nArgonath \u2013 the gateway into Gondor, two statues of Elendil and Isildur\nOsgiliath \u2013 the ruined City of Gondor\nOrthanc \u2013 Saruman's tower\nCirith Ungol \u2013 the tower that guards the pass of Shelob\nPaths of the Dead \u2013 City of the Dead Men of Dunharrow\nMinas Morgul \u2013 Sauron's 'Dead City'\nBarad-d\u00fbr \u2013 Sauron's massive tower\nThe Black Gate \u2013 the gate guarding the gap between the Ered Lithui and the Ephel D\u00faath\nGrond \u2013 the battering ram that smashed down the gates of Minas Tirith\nM\u00fbmakil \u2013 large war elephants used by the Harad armies\n\n\n=== Weta Legs ===\nThe name \"Weta Legs\" is Weta Workshop's name for a \"low profile, professional grade reverse leg stilt\" developed by Kim Graham and Weta technicians and manufactured by Performing Legs Ltd. Designed and largely hand-made by their sculptor-designer, Kim Graham, these digitigrade leg extensions are intended for \"creature and costume performances in movies, television, theatre, circus, street performances and other creative performances.\"Originally reserved for \"commercial film and television projects\", Weta brought them to market \u2013 in relatively limited quantities \u2013 for online purchase by members of the public in 2010. With the ability to take extra prosthetics such as layers of fur or skin \"to resemble a digitigrade leg, from canine and feline to fantastical demons, dragons, satyrs and even robots\", these devices are promoted as being easy to get used to, partly because they \"allow for realistic and natural movement as they are jointed at the knee and the ankle.\"Citing low pre-order numbers, Weta unceremoniously canceled the commercial production of Weta Legs by informing those who did pre-order by email.  The Weta Legs page has since been removed from Weta's website.\n\n\n== Weta Tenzan Chain Maille ==\nThe workshop now has a division, Weta Tenzan Chain Maille, making chainmail for film work. PVC injection was used for the armor in Kingdom of Heaven, giving better results than the process for Lord of the Rings. Versions electroplated with a thin layer of metal have the same look as real chain mail, move like metal at one third the weight, and are much cheaper. Aluminium or steel mail for high-impact stuntwork is also produced.\n\n\n== Special effects filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeta Workshop\nWeta Digital",

          "Great 45 min bubble tour, felt more like a conversation and a good laugh with a friend than a prepared speech - would be cool for an expansion of more movies and props Weta have worked on, as well as more DND related + board games in the gift shop",

          "Must visit for all movies and games enthusiasts! The tour was a bit too rushed and sadly, lots of it was a \"no photos allowed\" zone. (they will politely explain why) Staff were all amazing and knowledgeable. Hope the tour times/run will be better in the future. Cool exhibits tho!",
          "Must go place, did tour with them. Really enjoyed. Tours are bit expensive but worth it. They also have merchandise shop if you want to buy something but as usual all stuffs are very expensive. In my opinion just do combo tour.",
          "Well worth the full combined tour, dress warm if it's a cold day as they are warehouses no heating",

          "To be in the presence of these awsome details and bits and pieces is awe-inspiring.\n\nWhile the Weta staff were very good the whole process was let down by the lack of involvement in some of the projects and the hokey rooms you are led \u2026",

          "Very informative tours, worth every cent if you are a fan of the Lord of the rings/Hobbit films. The location is a little far out from downtown Wellington but the car rides were very scenic along the coast.",
          "A bit pricey but overall worth it. The staff were great and the tours were very informative and at points hands on which I enjoyed greatly. I loved being able to see what goes into so many classic and high end movies with a down to earth \u2026",

          "A Special moment spent with my son.",
          "Enjoyed the visit, really a lot of incredibly creative people and projects going on. The sheer amount of work that goes into a production is astonishing. Neat that our tour guide was in all three of the LOTR films and in the Hobbit film as \u2026",
          "A great inside look to movie production industry. For LoTR & The Hobbit fans it's must when visiting NZ. \n\nI'd advise jumping on a tour of the Wellington area which includes Weta. The information/stories they give are top notch! This way \u2026",
          "We did the Thunderbirds tour, absolutely loved it.  Was the right amount of time as we took our 3 kids aged between 3 - 9 yrs old.  The tour guide was great - very informative and enthusiastic.",
          "Great visit. The workshop is totally worth it! Only down side is that it is too short. \n\nThe explanations and what you see is truly interesting but I wished we had seen even more. It misses someone doing something while you are visiting. \u2026",
          "Such a fun experience. Great people! We only had time for the miniatures tour so we\u2019ll definitely be returning for more on our next Wellington weekend.",
          "So much to see and learn, even for the little ones. Very interactive and the staff are great with letting kids touch and hold props. Well worth the trip.",
          "A fantastic place to visit for fans of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies. They do show case their work in other films and TV series like Thunderbirds are Go and the recent Ghost in the Shell movie. Plenty of keepsakes can be found for \u2026",

          "Went at the end of the day so went to just the store but the staff were very helpful and informative.",
          "Have been here way too many times. Every time it brings more surprises. A must-see spot in Wellingtons. Just love the works and the arty vibe.",
          "Being LOTR nerds we really enjoyed it. Need to do the tour thing along with thunderbirds which I also enjoyed but didn't think I would. A few spots for pictures. Can visit the store without going on tour.",
          "Highly recommended. The tour guide Austin was very very good- informative, friendly and entertaining. Keep up the fantastic work!!",
          "This is a good place to go if you're a fan of the movies such as lord of the rings and the Hobbit, however it is still good even if you're  not because on the tour they talk you through the general process of how props are made etc.",
          "Went with my friend. A lord of the rings fan. Didn't buy anything too expensive. But I just had to go while I was in Wellington on holidays..",

          "Awesome to see original props",

          "Brilliant, great to see the props first hand from some great movies. Guide was really interesting",

          "Absolutely awesome. 2hrs of wonder well spent.",
          "The workshop tour was insightful and awesome! There were so many props of all sizes from tonnes of movies made over the years. Unfortunately, we couldn't take any photos inside as it's not allowed due to copyright laws but there was a spot \u2026",
          "Took the tour, which was underwhelming. Sat in a room with roughly 20 others and watched a 25 minute video, and then the actual tour consisted of being talked to in narrow rooms with props which you could not touch except for in the final \u2026",
          "These tours are awesome",
          "Have to buy a tour.",
          "Took our family in the weekend, cost was $240 and it was sadly underwhelming!! What a shame. We only heard about thunderbirds and Lord  of the Rings and if that wasn't your thing, there was nothing else on offer. Quite boring really. Bummer!",
          "Super fun, amazing tour guide who was great with our daughter... thanks so much!",
          "Awesome short tour. Loved it.",
          "Awsome experience only problem is that the shop is to expensive",
          "Great tour and souvenir shop, there's also a cafe inside. 2 tours is about 1.30hrs. Pram accessible. Off street parking. Guided tour with bus transfer between sites (walking is only 5min away). There are costumes you are allowed to touch, play, wear at the end of each tour. They have weapons for you to take photos with too.",
          "Great place for a tour if you're into your movies, esp Lord Of The Rings fans. Had a great tour guide who although had probably done that tour a million times did it with the excitement of a rookie. Lots of things to touch and see, really great tour. Highly recommended thing to do if you're ever in Wellington",
          "Best thing to see while I'm Wellington",
          "Great tour, guide very knowledgeable and friendly",
          "Amazing place... superb art work",
          "Absolutely loved this when I did it. Our guests that go on the workshop tour absolutely love it too. Showcases the results of the skill of the crafts involved. From a process point of view it is informative too. Fantastic guides",

Concerning miniatures: only \u201aThunderbirds are go\u2018 miniatures are shown at this time, not a single one left over from LotR. It\u2019s ok, but I expected something much more in detail and also",
          "Very interesting tour of WETA, with a great deal of background on the filming of \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d trilogy. If you\u2019re going to visit any of the filming locations in New Zealand, this should be your first stop!",
          "Good chance to hear about the projects Weta has worked on. See cool props from Lord of the Rings and Hobbit and how they are made. Other movies too. WOuld have been cool to see more on how these things are made, not just the final product.",
          "We opted for the studio tour, but beforehand we were able to enjoy a free but reserved closed door half-hour documentary which only left us wishing there were more. The tour itself was 45 minutes in length and brisk, but it showcased the extent of Weta's projects and underscored",
          "This just goes to show the amount of work these guys are involved in from making props to digital mastery. You will be shocked by the scale of what they do and as Peter Jackson is a shareholder all of his films will go through this company. We did Cave the tour which we felt",
          "We did the workshop tour and saw the movie on how Weta began. Our guide had lots of information to give us. She answered all questions that were asked clearly and completely. This is a real treat for anyone with an artistic inclination and an imagination.",
          "We did a combo tour to see the workshop and the miniature set used for Thunderbird. The guide we had was excellent. He was very knowledgable, entertaining and had a lot of insights in the movie makings using special effects, and he seems to be genuinely interested in his job.",
          "Sadly I found this a huge let down. It\u2019s more an informative trip of the life of Peter Jackson and not LotR as we were lead to believe. This first part of the tour is just okey but the rest I don\u2019t recommend unless you\u2019re a Thunderbirds fan. Wouldn\u2019t recommend",
          "A very interesting tour. The female guide was extremely knowledgeable and very engaging. We did the combo tour and although it seemed a little expensive it was well worth every penny. Some fascinating exhibits and a real insight into how they make the props and sets. This is a",
          "I have just finished the Weta Workshop Tour, and my first impression is frustration. The tour is 45min, which is way not enough to enjoy each room. The guide is \u00ab pushing \u00bb you forward to go in the next room, and everyone is like staring the most things he can like in the race,",
          "Great trip. Saw some great pieces and followed it up with a visit to the Gallipoli exhibition at the museum",
          "We did the combo tour of Weta workshop and Thunderbirds. Both were brilliant. Our guide Isaac was awesome - super knowledgeable, providing a fun and informative behind the scenes experience. So many interesting, fascinating inights and some hands on experience too with some of",
          "Amazing experience, collected from the city centre and only a short 15 minute drive later we were at Weta. Well worth it a highlight of our trip to Wellington.",
          "The Weta Cave Studio Tour Is pretty disappointing. I have done the Harry Potter world in London and expected something similar but not as large. This was very tiny and disappointing with not that many props. It was cool that there was an area to touch different props to see the",
          "My wife and I visited the workshop (and did the double tour) in mid-December. Positives first - the energy of the staff and the clear enthusiasm they have for what they do. Moreover, there is clearly a lot of skill that goes into the work there and that was impressive to see.",
          "Weta have worked and collaborated on many films and this behind the scenes tour is well worth it. We did the combo tour, which shows you mainly the behind the scenes prop making for Lord of the Rings to start with and also the Thunderbirds tour, which gives you a great",
          "A very exciting and informative visit to the Weta Workshop. To see the way they actually create backgrounds, etc in a movie is so creative and clever. Works of art!!",
          "How amazing! Do not miss this informative tour. The studio was a highlight for me. To see how they actually make the scenery/back ground for the filming is unbelievable and extremely inventive, so very clever.",
          "An excellent tour in an inspiring location! Our guide had so much enthusiasm that it was contagious, it's so obvious to see that this is a great place to work. We got to see so many items used in WETA productions, and also glimpse into the processes used to make movie",
          "We went for the Combo Tour of about 90 mins, led by a guide. Apart from slight disorganisation due to different tours starting it followed on very strongly with real enthusiasm and knowledge from our approachable guide. The creativity of the team working here is mind-blowing,",
          "Visited the Weta workshop for the first time with 2 young children - probably better suited to kids 10 or older, however the guides are fantastic and the staff there are passionate about what they do. Amazing props and getting to see them work on actual things while on the tour",
          "I dragged my wife here off of a cruise ship and it turned out she loved it. I really liked the gift shop but I don't know how I would have gotten the $900 Gandalphs staff on the plane. There are some smaller gifts but a lot of expensive stuff. We just took a cab from the Isite",
          "Was absolutely amazing and awesome how much detail there was in all the movies created. It was great to get some funny and exciting photo opportunities",
          "We very much enjoyed the Weta Cave tour, being able to see props and costumes from recent and current movies, led by a person who actually worked on some of those movies. The tour was interesting, informative, and fun. As well, we were able to see props being worked on for a",
          "I really enjoyed the guided tour in the WETA cave and loved seeing the costumes and props from a lot of well-known movies like Avatar, Mad max, I am Mother and LOTR. The makeup class was fun too although not a must for me personally (probably fun with kids though). Could have",
          "Whether you are a Lord of the Rings fan or not, you will definitely appreciate the work (and workmanship) that goes into making all the sets, special effects, characters, accessories, and paraphernalia of making movies. This has several layers of tours available - we chose to",
          "This is not just for Hobbit fans. Just visualising the work involved in making the realistic props is an eye opener. Visiting the set of Thunderbirds are go was fun.",
          "A must for all fans - casual or hardcore. I would absolutely adore going back and getting to see the props and hearing the stories again.",
          "I design sets for middle school productions and LOVE movies like Lord of the Rings, Hobbit, And Avatar for their amazing creativity in costuming, color- use and detail to set design. While visiting New Zealand\u2019s North Island on a 2 week bike tour, discovered the Special Effects",
          "This was the second time I have been to Weta and I loved it even more. I experienced the weta cave tour and the miniatures tour. As usual it opens my eyes to how they did there movies and made the magic we see on screen. Everyone was very friendly and happy to answer questions.",
          "We loved this tour! After having done Hobbiton we did not expect to hear much new information about the lord of the rings films, however we were wrong! The workshop tour had so many interesting props and a lot of interesting information and we were even allowed to touch some",
          "We're huge LOTR fans, sister not so much (has not read the books or seen the movies). Knowing that, she had a good time...may have converted her. Start off with two of the (huge) trolls out front, let your imagination flow for the photos. If you are a LOTR fan this place is",
          "An amazing experience for any film fan. Our tour guide was Reece who not only leads tours but works at Weta. He was amazingly knowledgeable, passionate, and truly the best tour guide I have ever seen. Totally worth the experience and more! Thank you Reece & Weta!",
          "Forget any preconceived Disney type ideas. This is real working sfx workshops! Pay extra and do thunderbirds as well! This was the highlight for me. Remember that cameras can only be used when advised. The gift shop is pricy, but for weta nerds, they will be like the proverbial",
          "We had a very interesting tour here led by the very knowledgeable and friendly Isaac. As huge lord of the rings fans we found this absolutely fascinating and I highly recommend it. The tour lasts about 45 mins and you get to see so many real life props from the films, it's",
          "The workmanship and level of detail it amazing. Not just a hobbit tour, although the are a big part of it. Add on the Thunderbirds tour if you want to experience set design and model making at an unreal level. No strings attached.",
          "We went here as my 18 year old son is attending the QLD School of Film and TV in Brisbane in 2020. He was blown away and it has made him even more passionate about what lies ahead. Thank you to the fabulous staff at Weta Cave for the inspiration they provide.",
          "If you come to Wellington you just have to visit weta workshop. We had a full tour with pickup in central Wellington and return trip. The driver Sue so marvelous, funny and a good driver. She told us many great stuff about peter Jackson. To see props and how they do stuff for",
          "Absolutely loved the combo tour. Staff were amazing but they also had so much passion and knowledge about the Weta Productions. Loved every second of the tours and would highly recommend if in Wellington and you love movies.",
          "We really enjoyed our tour at Weta Workshop. It was great to be in such small tour groups and get up really close to real movie props and models. Our guide Anthony was fab and really knew his stuff. Being able to chat to one of the design team at work on the stage was fantastic",
          "Many friends have mentioned the Weta Workshops and we decided to have a look. Well worth the visit plus value for money did not realise how many movies they have been involved in and the props they have made.",
          "Enjoyed this behind the scenes look at the film industry. We took the first tour of the morning and I recommend getting their early. We had a small enough group that we were able to see and interact with the exhibits easily. After our tours the gift shop was packed with",
          "We love films and learning about them and booked a tour from our cruise ship which took us here and to some of the Lord of the RIngs film sights on Mount Victoria. It is a really fun and interesting place to visit. Our tour guide was also very knowledgeable. The tour however",
          "Awesome place to visit We did the 45 min tour So informative Amazing skill and craftsmanship Great tour guide Lots to see",
          "We did the combo Weta workshop and miniatures tour. Our guide was great, lots of interesting info. Our 11 and 9 yr old stayed engaged and interested the whole tour. It\u2019s a great experience, and much more then just LOTR, Hobbit. There is a room where you get to interact with some",
          "Our group of 31 teenagers had a very interesting tour, full of inside information and knowledge of how special effects are done. They were able to feel several props and to also watch a short movie. No photos are allowed. Many of the costumes were original. We were taken through",
          "What an amazing place to see! The tour gives an up close look at some of the fantastic creations and special effects created by Peter Jackson's talented crew for \"Lord of the Rings,\" \"King Kong,\" \"District 9,\" etc. In one section, you are actually permitted to touch bits of",
          "It was great we had a great guide and loved every minute of it pity u cant take more fotos but fully understand didnt realise how big it all was and nz involvement in so many movies 1 way it another",
          "We had already been to Hobbiton, so the visit to Weta Workshop on our visit to Wellington was extra special. We saw how props were made, met some of the clever folks who created the objects and got to see some of the actual props used in films. If you can, make sure you include",
          "We did the tour and learned many things about the process of special effects, got to hold some prop weapons, armor, touched a wax face, among many other things. If you are in Wellington, this is a must. We did the two our tour and time flew by! Most picture-taking is not allowed",
          "We took the drive out to have a look without doing a tour. A good range of trinkets and models on display. Free video session. Most people were taking tours. Half hour to go through the free section will do it.",
          "Very interesting. Also did the prop building tour which was informative. The cafe on the next corner has the best food and is a must to add to your visit.",
          "Our expectations of this tour was that it would only be about the Lord of the Rings movies and while there is a large part of that it covers many other movies as well. We were surprised just how many movies, going back a number of years, had involvement with this workshop. The",
          "Plenty so see, photograph and buy. Obviously there are a lot of fans and tour groups that visit so if you travel independently try getting there early.",
          "We had a great tour of the weta workshop you got to see a lot of behind the scenes costumes and props and we had good explanations of the process behind everything. However, we had a lot of people on our tour and the first two rooms you could barely move around or hear the tour",
          "Picked up by a lovely lady who gave us a jolly talk on the local area and where a lot of the film stars lived whilst filming for Lord of the rings and important landmark around Wellington. You have to have seen the films of Peter Jackson to get the real flavour of this tour. I",
          "Really enjoyable as a fan of film, particularly if a LotR fan.! Everyone here, notably the crew member guiding us, is SO passionate about the work they do it is really exciting and inspiring to see. You get to learn about the whole process of how some of the most famous props",
          "The tour takes 45 mins, during this time no photography allowed. Viewing of real props in major Broadway movies can be seen such as halo jeep, power ranger helmets, lord of the rings weapons. Explanation was given on how these props has been made and process workers have to go",
          "This tour was one of our main reasons for visiting Wellington. We did the regular tour (not the combo one). It was fantastic! Our guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. You get a chance to see so many amazing things that Weta has made over the years. I would recommend this",
          "We did the Weta Combo package. Fantastic day, great guides - informative and good fun. Did not know they have been involved in so many films! Absolutely fascinating to see behind the scenes. Leave plenty of time to get street parking and walk to Weta Cave.",
          "As an avid Lord of the Rings fan, Weta Workshop was at the top of the list for my visit to Wellington. After reading some reviews, it's always best not to have super high expectations of something you've dreamed of seeing. With that in mind, I went on the full day There and Back",
          "A very very slick operation. They tell you turn up at a certain time- and your tour starts 30 minutes later. So you have to mill around and wait in the hideously expensive gift shop. Our tour guide, though very friendly was a novice and not a native English speaker. So with her",
          "Did the excursion to Weta and was blown away by the exhibits. The guide was really knowledgeable and you could imagine the scenes from Lord of the Rings and other movies as he explained how they did the scenes. A worthwhile visit.",
          "It was great to see behind the scenes of alot of great movies and how things were created. The guide was great and full of information, highly recommend.",
          "I am blown away by what this workshop has been able to accomplish, and seeing it in person was a privilege. It really wasn't overpriced in my opinion, compared to some of the stuff we've paid good money for on our NZ trip only to be left wondering where the value was. I was",
          "My Australian partner is a huge fan of LOTR and was excited to visit Weta Workshop which is his dream place to work. The tour was very interesting and there was lots of cool things to see. Photos arent allowed because some of the stuff backstage is for current projects.",
          "Our tour guide was great. She's an artist and Weta and really knew her stuff. She was great (but I can't remember her name). Although we enjoyed seeing all the props and sets and other memorabilia from Lord of the Rings and many other movies, the tour was still a bit of a",
          "Enough said. If you are a big fan (or not) of the movie Lord of the Rings, you should go to the Weta Workshop. They will let you see what they have done for the movie, and a LOT of other movies as well. I am not a big fan of the Lord of the Rings, but their works really",
          "Having visited Wellington we had to give WETA a go. The Viator bus driver was knowledgeable and we had fun visiting the locations however the actual WETA studio was a little disappointing.",
          "A must for all fans of WETA productions including Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit and the new Thunderbirds tv series. This was my 3rd visit for the past 12 months, as each time I travel to Wellington, my travel companions al want to be a part f the experience!",
          "Kind of small and worn out but the tour was interesting . Did it as a package deal tour to kill a weekend day.",
          "My husband and I spent all day here. We did the cave tour and the miniature stage tour and then two workshops. It was great seeing all the props and where the work is done. We thoroughly enjoyed the workshops. We had Taylor doing the workshops with us, he was very friendly and",
          "After visiting Hobbiton 3 years ago, I was looking forward to the Weta tour this trip to New Zealand. However, I was terribly disappointed in the tour. We spent $45US/person to then have to pay $21NZ to park (since the pick up/drop off area doesn't have parking). The bus showed",
          "The visit is very interesting, the guide being a staff from the workshop himself and thus having both extensive knowledge and passion over the different topics. The place is a small workshop, what makes it amazing is Weta work, truly fabulous.",
          "We did the leather and chain-mail making workshop, along with the Weta Workshop tour. We had a lot of fun crafting and making our own keyrings, as well as hearing more about the creative process that goes on behind the scenes at Weta. A tip for finding the crafting location",
          "Unfotunately I did not have time to go on a tour or workshop but it is still well worth checking out. The shop has lots of very cool movie merchandise and props.",
          "So my wife and I are huge LOTR fans, own hundreds in memorabilia (she even has swords and a replica ring), art books, video games, etc and seeing Weta studios we thought was going to be one of the highlights of our trip to NZ. The day started with a barely marked bus and a",

          "The workshop gives you a great overview of the prospering movie making scene in Wellington. There's a lot going on. You get to see some props from Lord of the Rings, King Kong and other projects undertaken by Weta. This isn't a studio tour. It's a small workshop in a",
          "We really loved our visit to the Weta workshop. We did the combo tour, which also covered the Thunderbirds set. Our guide was excellent and interesting, and we were amazed to discover how many artists and specialised artisans and craftsmen are involved. The enthusiasm, skills",
          "After visiting Hobbiton and seeing the gorgeous vistas of New Zealand that embody the world of Tolkien, I was thrilled to be going to the Weta Cave and Workshop, where all the magic happened. This ended up being one of the disappointments of our trip, however, not without some",
          "Interesting tours. Guide very enthusiastic. First tour a little overcrowded really. Would have got more, if there had been less people. Sometimes difficult to hear the host, and hard to see. But interesting never the less. The second part was the thunderbirds tour. This was",
          "Did the four hour tour and found this whole trip so enlightening and amazing. Did not have a clue that so much of this stuff goes on in NZ. Amazing and incredible place. Loved the Avatar, Lord of the Rings and Thunderbirds displays etc. Really amazing.",
          "It was OK, I wouldn't go back again. I would rather spend more time in the other places around Wellington. I enjoy the movies but not that much.",
          "We did the \u2018There & Back Again\u2019 shuttle for the Half Experience. It was the best 2.5 hours we have experienced and well worth every cent! The shuttle driver was so informative on the journey there and back and the actual tour at Weta Workshop was incredible! Knowledgeable and",
          "Weta are involved in so many movies because they do damn good work. Was great to see some of the props up close and hear about it. They said parking was hard to find but it was no issue for us on a rainy weekend in the school holidays with all tours full.",
          "This is great if you're interested in how things are made for the movies. It's not so much a studio tour, but very informative and interesting. You can't take many photos, but there were some fun photo options at the end. Really enjoyed this.",
          "A tour of the Weta Workshop gives you an insight into the movie making process, with a specific emphasis on props and effects used in films such as LOTR and Avatar. We had a very knowledgeable guide who explained many processes involved in making costumes, props and set pieces.",
          "Really enjoyed learning about Weta and how it grew from humble beginings to now. Loved being able to play with some plasticine at the end too",
          "This could be so much more! The shuttle from the centre was great, driver was friendly and informative and then you're dropped off at the cave. What you then get is an overpriced shop, a short self-promoting video that you'd normally get as a blu ray extra and an incredibly",
          "Had Rhys as a tour guide,he was extremely fun and comedic as well as very knowledgeable. Amazing exparience.",
          "I love the weta experience so much! Learned a lot from it! Will definitely come back and bring more friends with me! \u2764\ufe0f",
          "We booked just the visit to the Weta Cave and it was so worth it. The display of how things are made and being able to handle items like real chainmail compared with what they made the chain mail from. Fascinating. The life-like characters and a wonderful shop where you can buy",
          "A good tour for adults who are interested in how movie props are made. The tour guide was informative and interesting.",
          "Our tour guides name was Matt (from South Africa) he was absolutely fantastic! He was such a chill dude, cracked a few funny as jokes and made us feel really welcome! He definitely deserves a pay rise and I think a roller coaster added would be awesome!! My friend and I both",
          "A fantastic few hours for film and special effects nerds. The guide was engaging and made the tour more fun. The thunderbirds set tour was fantastic. Only down side is no photos \ud83d\ude29. Highly recommend this tour.",
          "We went as a family and absolutely loved it. There's so much to it that you end up with your head spinning. The lady bus driver was fantastic and kept up a very informative chat on the way there and back, she was a great introduction to an awesome experience. Highly",
          "I decided on doing the combo tour to get a good sense of what the Weta business is all about. It was worth every cent. The tour guide was friendly and knowledgeable and threw in the humour as well. The exhibits were amazing. I can highly recommend this for any movie geek!",
          "The Weta Cave Workshop Tour was amazing! Not just for LOTR or Thunderbirds fans but also for any aspiring artists! Lots of amazing works and how they are made. Pretty lucky to have a personal tour and my guide was informative and great! Thoroughly enjoyed it!",
          "These tours have been running for years now so today we went along to experience them ourselves. We got the combo of the Weta Cave tour and the. The Miniature Thunderbirds tour. They were both very enjoyable and we particularly liked the Thunderbirds tour, where we got to see",
          "As my kids are LOTR fans, we decided to visit this place. It took us a long time commuting thru bus from CBD to Miramar. The cave was small but full of props and souvenirs. Entrance was free and we had fun taking pictures with the TROLLs outside the cave.",
          "We enjoyed our visit and tour. Guide was good from pick up. Relaxed easy going. Gave us bit of info about weta etc and also some history lesson of the area. Got a lot of pics and driver gave us \"sting\" for our pics out front. Ride was good as it saved hassle with parking and",
          "I went w see the Weta workshop because I used to own a prop shop in the states. Their work is outstanding and unequaled by the business standards. It was informative and interesting and I enjoyed it immensely.",

          "Issac was excellent as a host. Very interesting displays and background information. Questions answered quickly and expertly and very friendly. Was very patient with the smaller girls questions. Great thing to do on a wet day and with family.",
          "I really fabulous experience. We attended a workshop making leather and chain mail before the tour. The range of props in display and enthusiasm of our guide made the experience.",
          "I love movies and getting a tour with real movie props and explanations on how everything is made is super cool. You get to discover how the hidden parts of filming are while still feeling the wonder and magic of cinema. I loved it!",
          "I expected more from this place. The tour guides are great and engaging. You will see many movie props, sets and hear many interesting stories. However, knowing the capability of what goes on here I really felt that the Weta Workshop experience was lacking and as a result,",
          "Thank you to our guide Reece for such an entertaining, funny, and informative tour! I love that the guides are artists/designers themselves so you can see the passion they have for the work displayed and also know firsthand all of the hours and hours and dedication that goes",
          "We caught the Metlink bus from town across to Miramar. So easy and cheap. Visited the cave first (shop) and booked a workshop tour. The guides were passionate and it was like a mini museum to the things they have created and are continuing to create. Great for Peter Jackson fans.",
          "I live in LA, I work in tv production and I was slightly disappointed by this tour. I felt like I could have skipped it and watched a behind the scenes feature on one of the LOTR dvd's. I think I would have preferred to have gone and seen actual sets or film locations than this",
          "I went into the world that I have known and loved and saw the parts that make up my escaped world when the world is too tough! Seriously magical and breath taking!",
          "We did the workshop tour and the Thunderbirds tour, it is well worthwhile doing both.Weta Workshop tour was very insightful in howcthey make props and the history of Weta. Thunderbirds tour was very good as you could walk around the models and sets they are still using to film",
          "The whole family really enjoyed the tour. The address all fans of the lord of the rings and the hobbit, but weta do so much more from Narnia to district 9. Tour guide was funny and informative. Wonderful to ar so many props close up. We're also duds the Thunderbirds tour which",

          "We had a wonderful time on the tour seeing how they made the props for the movies. The staff was great and let us try out some of the props. We also got to see the old Thunderbirds set, which brought back some old childhood memories.",
          "Artisans at Weta Workshop have created models, props and settings for hundreds of films. The tour showed us how much attention to detail goes into every creature, tool and weapon. From the moment we were picked up in the city, we learned about the incredible film-making",

          "Really enjoyed the 'there and back again' Weta workshop tour... The tour was great, the insight into prop and movie making was cool, but a special mention about Ron, our bus driver... A gentleman, informative, friendly, and a great ambassador for Weta and Wellington...",
          "My fianc\u00e9 and I were greatful of our trip to Weta workshop. We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the workshop with the highlight being the talk from one of the sculptures at the the end of the tour of the west cave. Definitely a must on your trip to Wellington, they have worked on",
          "The tour was less than an hour which was just right for our two children, unfamiliar with most of the film props etc. The guide was very knowledgable and approachable.",
          "Paid NZD88.00 for the full tour, which includes a pickup and drop-off in downtown Wellington. Reading some other reviews it is possible to get this cost down if you UBER to there HQ. Our tour got off to an inconspicuous start due to an officious Weta worker who had absolutely no",
          "I wouldn't rave about is, but I found it interesting and at $48 for a 2hr tour was pretty good value. Basically you are lead through several rooms of props and sets from various movies that Weta have been involved in; and there are many movies . Tour guide was informative. Good.",
          "I went here because a friend wanted to. Just a couple of things bothered me about this tour. First off it\u2019s WETA, they make a ton of money, and the tour isn\u2019t cheap. The \u201ctheater\u201d for the documentary could be improved upon. For a company that does such amazing creative things,",
          "The Weta workshop is where some amazing stuff happens for some great movies. Unfortunately most of it is protected intellectual property so photo ops are limited. It\u2019s worth it to see the breadth of Weta\u2019s work and to hear about some of the projects but i was a little",
          "This is well worth the money (didn't get picked up, arrived by ourselves, so it only cost 28 NZD each). While this isn't really a LOTR tour, there are enough trolls, dwarves, and orcs to satisfy a fan. I highly recommend this tour. It's short and very informative. The gift",
          "We had a tour here as part of the social activities associated with the conference I was attending and the whole experience was amazing. I was left in awe with the modelling techniques and realistic appearances of the props on display, this is a visit not to be missed if you",
          "We booked in for the two tours (weta workshops & thunderbirds). The tour guide was really good and knowledgeable. The tour of the weta workshop was amazing and to learn the history of the company was great and how they make a lot of the costumes and effects was awesome. The",
          "It is very interesting, and nice to hear people talking passionately about their craft. However the tickets need to be lowered by $15-$20 in my opinion, for what it is. They stress that they have done much more than the Hobbit stuff, yet they are happy to sell Hobbit items at",
          "Took some friends visiting from Christchurch to have a look at Weta cave and gift shop with a view to going on a tour. To say the staff were unhelpful is an understatement, some were just plain rude! When enquiring at the entrance about the documentary at the cave, we were NOT",
          "Being big fans of the LOTR and Hobbit movies, my family obviously included WETA Workshop as one of the top locations to visit when we decided to do the New Zealand cruise. We purchased tickets for the \u201cThere and Back Again Tour\u201d directly from WETA\u2019s website. We were instructed",
          "I took this tour because supouse i will see how the movie the lord of the rings was did but the true ia that in the place you dont see much about it, is a nice place but when i bought the tour was for that movie and i didnt see much. I dont recommend this place.",
          "We did a tour and the guide was amazing. He was very knowledgable and we have the opportunity to met one of the technicians at work. And the gift shop!!",
          "Being at Weta Workshop in Miramar feels like being in the house of God. Cause this is the craddle of creation. We had the There and back again full experience so we were picked up in the center of the city by a wonderful driver named Grant! He showed us various sites on the way",
          "The tour was just my wife and me, and Reese (spelling) was a great tour guide who knew heaps of really cool details about Weta. We ended up talking to Warren, one of the experts at Weta, for longer than we should have because we had so many questions and he was so easy to talk",
          "The tour was great, showing you wonderful movie gadgets and models and costumes from 100's of movies. There is visual displays, displays you can touch and feel and our tour guide was hilarious and knowledgeable. A must for Lord of the Rings fans but also fans of cinematic props",
          "Loved this tour. They had all the big props out and even a room where you can touch things. The gift shop is pretty cool too. A must do for lord of the rings fans.",
          "Gift shop and tour location for fans of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings movies. Weta is the studio that built all those amazing monsters and special effects and this is their shop.",
          "you have to book your tour here and they have a variety including lord of the rings film locations, we booked just the workshop tour it was really good and so interesting, covers all the LOTR characters and show you the Thunderbirds sets, and some of the tricks they use to form",
          "Weta Workshop was easily my #1 pick and most memorable experience. The tour shows you how Weta Workshop designs and manufactures effects for films like The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia and others. I made advanced reservations for the Combo Tour -- highly",
          "Our guide Jericho was enthusiastic, informative and passionate about the work Weta Workshop does. And with good reason! The workshop tour was interesting whether you have seen the movies they have worked on or not. What they have done and continue to do is fascinating and the",
          "We booked the Workshop And Studio tour and got a peek at how models are made from the fight scene props like armour and weaponry to strange animated creatures. The Weta studio have been quietly churning characters and props from the early 90s for movie makers in Hollywood and",
          "Very interesting tour of the Weta workshop, giving a history of the studio and its projects. Our tour guide was great. He was very animated and it felt like he really enjoyed his job. Great to have a behind the scenes tour and explication of how the processes work. We highly",
          "Booked the $88 per person tour named \u201cthere and back\u201d for Weta workshop & Thunderbirds tour only to discover the \u201ccombo\u201d ticket for exactly the same thing was $48 pp. How can they justify $40 per person for a short shuttle bus ride from the city to Miramar? We could have gotten",
          "Guide was very enthusiastic and passionate about the work done by Weta and I had no idea that besides LOTR, they also do /did Avatar, Thunderbirds, King Kong, etc. Props, masks, weapons and also a view behind the scenes of the production of Thunderbirds was definitely worthwhile",
          "This was the second tour we did on the day having done the workshop tour. Only 4 of us from the first tour had booked Thunderbirds so it was a more personalised tour with a very knowledgable guide who brought the whole thing to life. What stunned us was how what was in effect",
          "We last visited Weta in 2012 and the whole experience has shifted up a gear. First off the complimentary video in the shop (about 25 minutes long) has been totally remade and it is a fascinating account of how Weta came to be, and what it does. Then we did the Workshop tour and",
          "I really have no idea about this Weta Cave Workshop Tour because none of my friends in New Zealand have been here before. I just knew about this because I heard that this is where most of the films produced by Peter Jackson were made or, not really, some of it were just props",
          "I had fun; I'm a Tolkein nerd. Others in the group were not and it was not as good for them. It was a little commercialized but it was still fun.",
          "My husband and I are not into Lord of the rings movies and I didn\u2019t \u2018think\u2019 our kids (12,10 &7) would get much out of it! I was totally wrong. This is definitely worth the visit, an amazing bunch of talented artists, it\u2019s changed the way we will look at movies! Weta is out of",
          "They do all kinds of special effects for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy series. Lots of suits of armor that are actually that look authentic but extremely comfortable for actors and actresses",
          "We took this tour during excursion day on our 18 day cruise with Radiance of the Seas. It was completely worth the day out and given it not only included a quick tour around the hamlet of Miramar on the way to Mt Victoria filming location for Lord of the Rings and an",
          "I'm a huge fan of Lord of the rings, and I had a great time seeing all the creatures and swords they did there. It's a museum of amazing stuff from movies, not only LOTR, also Avatar, Thunderbirds, King Kong, etc. Unfortunately I didn't do any tour, but I strongly recommend to",
          "Great tour you will hope to not miss in Wellington. Not a regular tour you will find everywhere. The guide was professional and kind. \u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5230\u7f51\u7ad9\u9884\u5b9a\u3002\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\u3002",

          "Picked up central Wellington..very pleasant and informative driver, dropped off outside Weta workshop door..met new tour guide who took us through stage 1..amazing work done inside by all who work in this industry..mind blowing how involved Peter Jackson and his team are with",
          "We signed up for the workshop tour as well as the Thunderbirds tour. The guide was nice and very knowledgeable, he especially knew a lot about LOTR related work but didn\u2019t talk a lot about other works that Weta contributed to.",
          "Left on time and had a friendly coach driver. Had to wait a bit for the tour to start but the guides were friendly and informative.",
          "Absolutely loved this tour, it was so interesting to learn all the behind the scenes information about one of my favourite film series (Lord of the Rings). All the technical processes behind costumes, props, and anamatronics were fascinating, and the quality of the work they do",
          "I really loved the tour of the workshop, and learning about the behind the scenes of film props, costumes, etc. Particularly as a Lord of the Rings fan it was awesome so see some of the work they have done, and understand the process of putting things together. The quality of",

          "The tour itself was informative, interactive, and led by a friendly and engaged guide. Pro tip: sign up for the earliest time in the morning. When I did this, the group size was four people including myself. This means more opportunities to ask questions of the tour guide and",
          "Was interesting 45mins tour with a very good guide. But didn't think it was worth $120 for a family ticket. Did think Warren? Was a great character.",
          "Do the full tour! Informative, interesting. Really great opportunity to see the work and vision of creative people. Awesome staff who are excited by the work they do. Highly recommended.",
          "Hubby and I enjoyed the tour. I'm not much of a fan of LOTR but I still thoroughly enjoyed myself and found it very interesting. Our tour guide Cam was such a cool dude and very informative and passionate about everything that goes into making movies. It was school holidays so",
          "We did the combo tour, great value and so interesting. Our guide, Kylie was knowledgeable, interesting, inspiring and friendly. Her passion and humor were contagious. As a huge fan of Lord of the Rings this experience was very special to me. The miniatures tour was fascinating",
          "Tour picks up in Wellington near Te Papa so we parked there for convenience. A short transfer to the very low key film industry district with good commentary en route from driver. Amazing to see such hi tech work gong in buildings dotted between residential houses. A short intro",
          "Well, one of the best tours I've ever been on. Very informative about the movie industry and what goes on behind the scenes and the level of detail that goes on to make those amazing props.Tour guide was great. Very friendly & did a awesome job showing us around the workshop.",
          "We booked on the double trip of the main studios and thunderbirds with a pick up from and back into town. As fans of Peter Jackson we were never going to be disappointed but the over use of movies that you have to watch was a let down. Best times were with the guides and the",

          "We did the combo tour and to be honest it was one of the most enjoyable tours I have EVER done. Yes I am a complete LOTR nerd so it\u2019s biased but I have to say the information provided, insights and quality of our guide was exceptional. We did the Thunderbirds miniature tour as",
          "I always love coming here. I\u2019ve been several times due to visiting New Zealand a lot now, and I always enjoy going back. It\u2019s such a good place.",

          "Operating since the 1980s (Peter Jackson joined in the mid-1990s), Weta Worshop (aka Cave) is probably best known for the six Hobbit movies. An energetic tour guide explained how Weta Workshop creates the props and special effects, and many of these are on display, plus you get",
          "Visited Weta Studios as a group of 10 and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. They are a world class special effects and props group but the tour is still intimate in that friendly and down to earth Nee Zealand way.",
          "You don\u2019t have to be a Lord of the Rings fan to enjoy Weta Workshop, just someone who appreciates movies and special effects, though it's fabulous for fans of the Ring movies as well. We knew the work was labor intensive, but had no idea just how much effort and skill it",
          "This tour gives an amazing insight in the behind the scenes preparation for movies and shows how they do the costumes, props and silicone faces, etc for movies such as King Kong, Avatar, The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.",
          "On researching what we should try to see while in Wellington and having recently seen the Peter Jackson movie; They Shall Not Grow Old, we decided to visit the WETA STUDIO, the special effects part of Jackson's empire. Not being fans of Tolkien or the movies based on his books",
          "We did the combo tour and they were both amazing. Our tour guide was very knowledgable and the tours were well organised. I never realised how many films weta had been involved in and seeing the thunderbirds birds miniatures was very interesting.",

          "What a fun day out. As a family, we are huge LOTR, fans and we weren't disappointed. It was great to see all the backstage info, and how to make the models. From Tom the tour guide, making the whole bus roar with laughter, to the guide around the Weta cave, and backstage on",
          "Amazing to see and hear all about the behind the scenes work in movies and especially \u201cLord of The Rings\u201d this was the highlight of our visit to New Zealand!

          "Although I am no fan whatsoever of sci fi and have never even watched a slasher movie, this was a very interesting tour. T seems fairly expensive for what you get- an hour plus wandering through a wee bit of items made by the Weta Studios- it is most remarkable in that this is",

          "A visit to the Weta Cave is s great introduction to the magical world of the talented people who work on movies such as the Lord of the Rings series, The Hobbit etc. Entry through the yellow door is an introduction. There was no entry fee to the Cave. It\u2019s quite small and",
          "I took my grownup children and their partners for a combined tour of the Weta workshop and the Thunderbirds workshop. Both were well worth doing to see the tricks of the trade and some pretty awesome beasties. A common reaction in our group was: 'I never knew Weta were",

          "A must if you have a few hours. Cost was great for both tours. We learnt so much and the tour guide was great. Thunderbird's tour was our favourite. Really sore abit more than expected. Thanks Weta",
          "We arrived to find that tours were sold out until later that afternoon, which threw a wrench in our plans. However, the guy managing the reservations was able to work us into an earlier tour. We appreciated it! We loved the video and enjoyed browsing the shop and various Weta",
          "Although the tour wasn't long, it was informative and our guide was great. Very humble when compared to a visit to Universal Studios, but I think that's what impressed me is there is still a small, family feel to the Weta family. If you're interested in moviemaking secrets or",
          "Visiting Weta was at the top of my list of things to do in Wellington and it definitely didn't disappoint. I booked the Weta Studio Tour Combo which includes the 45 minute Weta Cave Workshop Tour and the 45 minutes Miniatures Stage Tour: Thunderbirds Are Go. (One little thing",
          "A very interesting tour to see behind the scenes magic of how so much of what we see in the movies is made. I followed this tour with the Gallipoli tour in Te Papa, which Weta also helped create. It was a great combo!",
          "Our family of 5, with 3 pre-teens/teenagers, loved both of these tours! The guides were brilliant, interesting, informative and fun. The props, set, etc you see are amazing! It's a little cold in the set studio in the middle of winter so make sure you dress warmly.",

          "This is a little smaller than the workshop tour but in some ways even better. there are more props to touch especially if you like LOTR and Hobbit. I went on it as part of a conference tour and was really impressed. This is top marks from me and is the best tour I have ever",
          "I took my family to see this one a short holiday in Wellington. My daughters were a bit reluctant but I was keen and had already been to the Weta Cave tour on a conference. (the tours aren't the same). The workshop tours was really excellent. We have an informed guide who took",
          "Really enjoyed this tour. The time went so quickly because our guide was interesting and knowledgeable. There are some things to touch and look at but most of the exhibits were not to be touched. Guides are all members of the team and so they know their stuff. Loved hearing",
          "I love this cave but I wish the retailers wore costumes and were involved more, but also enjoyed the little movie in the beginning. It is a pity it is not fully themed.",

          "When we arrived in Wellington we had to see Weta so we headed there straight from the airport! We went on the behind the scenes tour and were able to see some of the models and techniques used in the LOTR movies as well as others. Nice to see even if you aren't a fan and the",
          "We did this on our arrival day from USA and we had a great experience! We got hung up in Auckland due to long security lines and missed our connecting flight, meaning we would miss our tour. We emailed them and they were able to move us to the last tour of the day. Our leader",
          "My inner LotR nerd was screaming. So very interesting and well put together tour of the behind the scenes look of Weta workshop. Loved been able to get up and personal and to see the ideas/ designs and props. If you are a Ghost in the Shell or Halo fan - you will get something",
          "An interesting half day. We did the Weta Cave tour followed by the Thunderbirds tour. We found the Thunderbirds tour a little dry with its cultural relevance lost on our 19 year old son (not us). However the Weta Cave tour is well worth it.",
          "Such an Amazing place to see, a workplace of talented and knowledgeable people. We did the Tour of the Workshop, well worth the time for a visit, and Thunderbirds = OK.",
          "We had a wonderful morning at the Weta Cave. So much to see and really interesting. The staff were friendly and informative as well as entertaining.",
          "Visited on 18th July, with 8 & 10 yr old children. We booked and did both the Weta Workshop & Thunderbirds Tours. We all really enjoyed the Weta Workshop Tour, and thought there wasn't much to the Thunderbird Tour. After seeing all the faces/figures that Weta had produced at",

          "This place is a gem, as cool as it would be to see more on the tour I understand how it must be protected and what we are shown gives a good sense of what goes on around the sizeable premises. Our tour guide was awesome and very enthusiastic as were all the staff - Very obvious"

      "text": {
        "wiki": "St Mary of the Angels is a Catholic church on the corner of Boulcott Street and O'Reily Avenue in Wellington, New Zealand. It is the parish church for Wellington Central and one of the major churches of the city. The Marist Fathers have provided clergy for St Mary of the Angels since 1874 in succession to its founding and long-serving parish priest, the Capuchin Franciscan, Father Jeremiah O'Reily. The church was used by Archbishop O'Shea as his pro-cathedral (1936\u20131954). It was the site of the funeral of Suzanne Aubert in 1926 and is well known for its church music tradition.\n\n\n== Sacraments ==\nThe normal mass times are:\n\nSunday \u2013 7am, 9am, 11am (Choral), 5pm\nMonday \u2013 Friday \u2013 7.30am, 12.05pm & 5.15pm\nSaturday \u2013 11amThe church provides frequent opportunities for Reconciliation or Confession \n\n\n== History ==\nThe first Catholic Church built on the site of St Mary of the Angels was a small chapel (\"the chapel of the Nativity\") built by Father O'Riley in 1843. It was blessed and dedicated by Bishop Pompallier on a visit to Wellington in the next year. This building was gradually enlarged and was completely replaced by a large wooden church in 1874. Fr O'Riley named this building \"St Mary of the Angels\" after the Portincula chapel which was precious to St Francis of Assisi. This church was extended until it was badly damaged by fire in 1918 and then demolished. The present building was opened and blessed on 26 March 1922 by Archbishop Redwood and a solemn pontifical Mass was celebrated by Bishop Liston of Auckland. A sermon was preached in the evening by Bishop Whyte of Dunedin.\n\n\n== Architecture and features ==\n\nThe building is classified as a Category I (\"places of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'\") historic place (being opened in 1922 with uninterrupted church use of the Boulcott Street site from 1843) by Heritage New Zealand.Plans for the church were prepared by architect Frederick de Jersey Clere in 1919. Architecturally, the design is traditional Gothic of French influence. The front facade was said to have been modelled on that of the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels. The structure is reinforced concrete and brick with a timber roof supported by concrete arches with steel tie rods. Its  construction was innovative in that it was 'the first occasion ferro-concrete was used for a church of Gothic design'.The church is noted for its collection of stained glass windows, especially in a continuous series completely around the clerestory interrupted by the rose window above the narthex, a window of the crucifixion above the high altar and two spacious banks of 15 windows, one finishing the north transept (fifteen decades of the Rosary) and one finishing the south transept (the life of St Joseph). These windows flood the liturgical spaces of the church with light.The church also houses an extensive collection of statuary, including a reduced, marble, copy of Michelangelo's Moses and life-sized representations of the Piet\u00e0 and the Holy Family. In the transepts, the Our lady and St Joseph side altars are of brown-mottled marble and include prominent statues of Our Lady of the Rosary (in Dominican habit with blue veil) and Saint Joseph, with votive candle racks in front of each of them. Other large statues in various parts of the church include the Sacred Heart, St Vincent de Paul, St Marcellin Champagnat and St Peter Chanel.\nThe Gothic marble high altar and tabernacle, in front of a blue backing, includes a sculpted, reredos with statues. The altar was detached from the reredos and moved forward in the 1960s in the implementation of the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council (the celebration of the Mass facing the congregation). This altar is fronted by a carved, Last Supper set under an incised arch along its width. The ornate columns in the sanctuary are topped by marble statues of angels.\n\n\n== Suzanne Aubert ==\nThe church is particularly revered as the site of the funeral of Mother Aubert whose cause for canonisation as a saint is proceeding. The funeral was held on 4 October 1926.  It was the largest funeral held for a woman in New Zealand. The church was packed for the solemn pontifical requiem mass, celebrated by Archbishop Redwood and other clergy, and vast crowds gathered along the funeral route to the church and from the church to Karori Cemetery to see the passing of the cortege of the 91 year old. One passerby asked \"What religion was this woman?\". A workman leaning on his shovel by the roadside answered: \"That is a question she would never have asked you or me!\".\n\n\n== Music ==\nSt Mary of the Angels is renowned for its Gregorian Chant which began in 1905. With the opening of the present church in 1922, a choir of 70 voices sang Mass under the direction of Edward Healy. This was continued and strengthened by Maxwell Fernie for 40 years from 1958 until his death in 1999 and continues under his successor and former student, Robert Oliver.  The organ of the church is a unique instrument, originally built in 1958 by George Croft and Son Limited from Auckland, but extensively redesigned in 1984 to Max Fernie's specifications.\n\n\n== Strengthening ==\nThe church was closed following the July 2013 Seddon earthquake and the August 2013 Lake Grassmere earthquake sequence for structural strengthening. The church had been assessed as being between 15%\u201320% of the standard a new building would be built to. In New Zealand, buildings assessed as below 33% of standard are considered \"earthquake prone\" and strengthening is required or a compulsory demolition can be ordered. The church re-opened in April 2017 after earthquake strengthening to 100% of code, costing $9.5 million, collected in a well-supported public fund-raising campaign. The look of the interior was largely unchanged except for the shear walls built in two locations on each side of the church near the entrance, and beside the sanctuary. All the ornate columns supporting the roof, the foundations and the copper and slate roof were replaced. Certain clerestory stained glass windows were obstructed from view on the outside of the church by the new shear walls but inside were  unchanged, with the images illuminated as through the other windows, by means of artificial lighting. The effect of the seismic strengthening was generally perceived to be a restoration rather than a reconstruction, although the latter was the true situation. The project was undertaken by Clendon Burns & Park as the engineer and LT McGuinness as the construction company and was awarded a heritage restoration award in the 2018 New Zealand Heritage Project Awards.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington\nSociety of Mary (Marists)\nSacred Heart Cathedral, Wellington\nSt Gerard's Church and Monastery\nSt Joseph's Church, Mt Victoria\nRoman Catholicism in New Zealand\nSt Patrick's College, Kilbirnie, Wellington\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nFearnley, Charles (1977). \"St Mary of the Angels, Catholic\".

        "wiki": "Te Raukura, otherwise known as Te Wharewaka o Poneke (\"the waka house of Wellington\") is a building located on Taranaki Street Wharf, Wellington waterfront, New Zealand. It houses a conference venue (whare tapere), Karaka Cafe (whare kai), and waka house.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTe Raukura, Te Wharewaka o P\u014dneke is located on the Wellington waterfront, between the Civic Centre and Te Papa Tongarewa on the lagoon known as Te Whai Repo (adjacent to Frank Kitts Park). Other attractions in our immediate area are the Wellington Museum, the City Gallery, and a variety of cafes and bars.\nTe Raukura is of special significance to descendants from Taranaki iwi of Te Atiawa, Taranaki, Ngati Ruanui, Ngati Tama and Ngati Mutunga.  Previously the area where the building is located was harbour frontage to Te Aro P\u0101, one of the largest M\u0101ori communities in Wellington up until the 1880s.  The building sees the re-establishment of a M\u0101ori presence on Taranaki Wharf, notably absent on the waterfront since that time.\nTe Wharewaka o P\u014dneke was officially opened at a dawn ceremony on Waitangi Day, Sunday 6 February 2011.\nThe unique building design is based on a korowai (cloak), signifying mana and prestige. The korowai roofline recalls the traditional sails of the waka fleet and is home to waka (canoes).  The elements of the building include whakairo or carvings and modern renditions of traditional design which transform the building symbolically into a ceremonial waka (canoe) linked to the ancestor Kupe and the voyaging traditions of the Pacific peoples.  Many of these facets about the building and the landscape are conveyed in the korero (stories) as part of the waka and cultural walking tours.\nTraditional waka have been reintroduced into Te Whanganui a Tara (Wellington) in recent times with the arrival of the waka taua Te Rerenga Kotare and the waka tete Te Hononga. The most recent addition to the waka fleet is Poutu, named after the late Sam Jackson (Poutu Wipa). With its fibreglass hull, Poutu will be used more regularly for the waka tours, alongside Te Hononga. Te Rerenga Kotare remains for ceremonial occasions such as Waitangi Day, ANZAC day, Matariki and alike. The waka were built under the guidance of Master Carver, Hector Busby and are made out of swamp kauri.\n\n\n== Te Rerenga Kotare ==\nWaka taua are the largest and most elaborate of the single hull carved waka used by M\u0101ori for ceremonial engagements and in the past as war canoes. The waka taua has an elaborate carved prow called the tau ihu with a large variety of designs such as this highly stylised prow from Taranaki. The hull of the waka has been formed by a single log with the size of the waka determined by the size of the log. When the waka is used in ceremonial occasions it has two poles protruding from the prow covered with feathers called ihiihi. It has two large \u2018eyes\u2019 or karu atua through which the way ahead is viewed.  The presence of a waka taua signifies self-determination, prestige and strength. The name, Te Rerenga K\u014dtare (flight of the kingfisher), refers to the native kingfisher, a bird that strives to complete tasks and protect its own.  When the kingfisher takes flight, it is strong, balanced, focused and effortless.\nThe waka carries a crew of male kaihoe/paddlers of around 18-20 and is used around Te Whanganui a Tara/Wellington Harbour and at times to other places for waka regatta. For ceremonial occasions the kaihoe on the waka will wear traditional pake or raincapes which tie around the shoulders of the paddlers.\n\n\n=== Te Hononga ===\n'Te Hononga\u2019 and \u2018Poutu\u2019 are waka t\u0113t\u0113kura, or canoes that embody the hopes, dreams and aspirations of our ancestors. These waka stand as an acknowledgement of the relationship between M\u0101ori and all races, a relationship that includes and accepts all people regardless of where they originate from. As both men and women are welcome on this waka it is envisaged that the unification of people, the environment, communities and goodwill will elevate the pride and prestige of Wellington.\nWaka t\u0113t\u0113kura are multipurpose canoes used for fishing and transportation.  Te Hononga is less elaborately carved than Te Rerenga K\u014dtare.  It has a distinctive prow known as a t\u0113t\u0113. The bow piece typically takes the form of a face with a protruding tongue.  The name \"Te Hononga\", means to bind together and form alliances.  Traditionally the main purpose of the waka t\u0113t\u0113kura was for fishing, and as a work horse waka to transport people and goods. Nowadays it is a multipurpose waka able to be paddled by both men and women. It has a distinctive prow known as a t\u0113t\u0113. The bow piece typically takes the form of a stylised face with a protruding tongue, described as t\u0113t\u0113, or pakoko, by which the vessel is classified.  The hiwi or hull of the waka is made from an ancient kauri tree recovered from the swamps of Te Taitokerau/Northland.\n\n\n=== Poutu ===\nPoutu was launched on Waitangi Day 2014 and built in remembrance of our Kaumatua Sam (Poutu Wipa) Jackson. This waka is lively and a pleasure to be on board. A little more comfortable, the hull is fibreglass and has beautifully carved Ihu and Taurapa. Poutu is constructed of fibre-glass for strength, durability, lightness and for the comfort of the users. Each paddler has considerable leg-room and can be comfortably seated. This waka has buoyancy compartments through the centre of the waka and at each end which keep it afloat even if filled with water.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Sir Francis Joseph Kitts (1 May 1912 \u2013 16 March 1979) was a New Zealand politician. He was the longest-serving mayor of Wellington, holding the post from 1956 to 1974. He was the Labour Member of Parliament for Wellington Central between 1954 and 1960.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKitts was born in Waimate, the son of an Australian quarryman, and attended Marist Brothers primary school alongside his half-brother John before completing his education at Timaru Boys' High School. He was an active athlete and was a talented swimmer also having an interest in both boxing and rugby. He was a firm believer in physical fitness and had a lifelong twice a day exercise regimen. Whilst still at high school he joined the Timaru branch of the Labour Party at 16, with his fathers encouragement, and was branch president at from 1936 to 1938. In 1938 Kitts stood unsuccessfully for the Timaru Borough Council as a Labour candidate. Kitts enlisted in the Royal New Zealand Air Force in July 1940 during World War II and served for five years with the home forces as a staff sergeant. Whilst posted in Otaki he met Iris Woodcock at the local racecourse and the two married in 1949. The couple had no children.Following the war he moved to Wellington, and worked as a civil servant for the Government Stores Board. He became the vice-president of the Wellington Central branch of the Labour Party in 1947. He was a competent debater and was a team leader for the Wellington Metropolitan Debating Club. He held Saturday morning talks along a walking route down Bowen Street Lambton Quay and Willis Street with residents from all around Wellington, which earned him a public reputation in the city. Kitts walked the route nearly every day for the next 25 years.Newspaper reports after his death say he was a \"man of mystery\" as little is known about his early life, and his Who's Who in New Zealand entries in 1971 and 1978 both start with his election to Wellington local bodies in 1950. His brother Father John Kitts, who was chaplain at the Villa Maria Convent in Brisbane, stated that Kitts seldom spoke of his private life and his wife Iris was the only person who truly knew him.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Local body politics ===\nAt the 1950 local-body elections the Labour Party had no obvious mayoral candidate, and Labour activist Gerald O'Brien suggested to Kitts should stand. He likewise stood for the Wellington City Council, Wellington Harbour Board and Wellington Hospital Board. He polled far better than expected for the mayoralty, but was defeated by Robert Macalister of the Citizens' Association. He was however elected to the City Council, Harbour Board and Hospital Board. In 1953 he stood again for all four offices but was again defeated by Macalister for the mayoralty. His popularity had grown significantly and was not only re-elected to the three local bodies, but topped the poll for all three, gaining more votes than any other candidate the first time this had been achieved in Wellington history.In 1956 Kitts was elected mayor on his third attempt, exploiting a split vote on the centre-right with Macalister running as an independent after losing the Citizens' Association nomination to Ernest Toop. He became Wellington's first Labour mayor in 46 years. He would remain Wellington's mayor for the next 18 years. In 1962 he recorded the highest ever number of votes in a mayoral election in Wellington. In 1969 he surpassed Thomas Hislop to become Wellington's longest serving mayor. He was unexpectedly defeated by a narrow margin in 1974 by Michael Fowler. The result was so close that several re-counts were required before the final result was known, ending Kitts' record tenure as mayor, though he was still re-elected as a member of the Harbour Board.As mayor Kitts travelled overseas as an ambassador for the city and made a point of visiting every city named Wellington in the world. In 1971 he visited Antarctica. Like Norman Kirk, also from Waimate, he was \"a big man, using his imposing six foot two inch, 17 stone frame to overshadow his opponents.\"He also served on the Wellington Fire Board from 1954, and the Wellington Hospital Board from 1950 to 1956, and the Wellington Harbour Board from 1950 until his death in 1979. He was also the chairman of the Wellington City and Suburban Water Supply Board, director of the New Zealand Municipalities Co-operative Insurance Company and patron of the City of Wellington Highland Pipe Band.\n\n\n=== Member of Parliament ===\nKitts stood unsuccessfully for Labour in two elections, in 1949 for Waitomo, and in 1951 for Mount Victoria. He was also speculated as a potential successor to Peter Fraser in the 1951 Brooklyn by-election but declined to stand. He was finally elected as the Member of Parliament for Wellington Central from 1954 to replace the retiring Charles Henry Chapman. He was to hold the seat to 1960, when he was unexpectedly defeated by the National candidate Dan Riddiford. He later failed to win back the electorate in 1963. Kitts was one of a group of three Labour MPs (the others being Mick Moohan and Bill Fox) who were deeply critical of the decisions made in the \"Black Budget\". Kitts' brother said that not remaining in Parliament longer had been his biggest regret.\n\n\n=== Post mayoralty ===\nTo the surprise of most, the Third Labour Government did not appoint him to any higher office. Labour city councillor Joe Aspell said \"Thousands expected Frank Kitts to be given something to make use of his considerable ability\". He did become President of the Sporting Clubs Association of New Zealand.In a surprise move, Kitts attempted a political comeback in 1977. He was again defeated by Fowler with his vote share falling further, though contrarily his vote increased for the Harbour Board, to which he was again elected. A Dominion editorial said of Kitts' candidature \"No one knew what Frank Kitts did during his three years in the political wilderness and no one knew why he wanted to come back\".\n\n\n== Death ==\nKitts died suddenly on 16 March 1979, aged 67, collapsing at his home after completing a morning shopping trip with his wife. His funeral was held in St Mary of the Angels and attracted over 400 mourners. Tributes were given by Kitts' successor as mayor Michael Fowler and former prime minister Bill Rowling among others. Following the service his body was taken in a civic cort\u00e8ge along his famous walking route along Willis Street, Lambton Quay and Bowen Street to Karori Cemetery where he was buried.He was still a member of the Harbour Board at his death. A by-election was avoided when Terry Brandon, the highest polling unsuccessful candidate from the 1977 election, was appointed to fill Kitts' vacant seat.\n\n\n== Frank Kitts Park ==\n\nFrank Kitts Park on Wellington's waterfront is named after him. The park, on the site formerly used for a row of wharf sheds, was opened in 1976 and extended in the late 1980s. There is a children's playground, the orange foremast recovered from TEV Wahine, and a water sculpture The Albatross by Tanya Ashken.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nKitts was known for his tireless public service, which continued after his retirement, including helping Wellington's immigrant community. In the 1966 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor for services as mayor of Wellington.The Kitts Trophy for Impromptu Speaking is awarded by the Wellington Speaking Union every year. The trophy is named after Kitts, who donated it in 1967 to encourage excellence in impromptu speaking.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBetts, G.M. (1970).

        "wiki": "Garage Project is an independent New Zealand brewery based in Aro Valley, Wellington. The brewery was founded in 2011 by brothers Ian and Pete Gillespie and Jos Ruffell, who transformed a dilapidated car garage to begin brewing 50 litres at a time- 24 new beers in 24 weeks. The 24/24 project produced many beers that are still in production- Aro Noir, Pernicious Weed, Venusian Pale Ale, Cockswain's Courage, H\u0101pi Daze, Bi\u00e9re de Garage, Red Rocks, Golden Brown, Day of Dead, Hellbender, Summer Sommer, and Rum & Raisin. \n\nGarage Project's aim is to create unique and beautiful beers, to push boundaries, reinterpret styles and challenge the notions of what beer can be. To date the brewery has created over 300 different beers.The brewery has grown considerably since 2011, winning the Deloitte Fast 50 in 2015 with over 660% annual growth, and distribution in New Zealand, Australia, Norway, Sweden and California. \nGarage Project established a Cellar Door and Taproom in their Aro Valley, Wellington site, a mixed fermentation and barrel location in central Wellington dubbed the \"Wild Workshop\", and most recently a Cellar Door in Kingsland, Auckland. In 2017 Garage Project announced a partnership with brew house bStudio in the Hawkes Bay.Garage Project has won numerous awards- In the 2018 GABS Hottest 100 Kiwi Craft Beers poll, Garage Project claimed 19 spots, including #2 for Death from Above, #3 for Pernicious Weed, and #5 for Party & Bullshit. They were named NZ Brewery of the Year in 2017 by the New Zealand Brewers Guild Awards, edging out 111 other breweries and claiming 26 medals.In 2017 Garage Project announced they would also begin production of natural wines called GP Crushed, made at their central Wellington location. The initial launch features four wines: a Riesling bottled mid-fermentation and spiked with Lactobacillus, a 100% Brettanomyces fermented New Zealand Chardonnay, a Pinot Noir that has undergone carbonic maceration before being spiked with Brett, and a Sauvignon/Semillon blend that has been bottled p\u00e9t-nat. More wild wines are due to be released in 2018.H\u0101pi Daze pale ale is served aboard Singapore Airlines flights to and from New Zealand.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "The Wellington Cathedral of St Paul (also called St Paul's Cathedral or Wellington Cathedral) is an Anglican church in the city of Wellington, New Zealand. It is the mother church of the Diocese of Wellington and the cathedral of the Bishop of Wellington. Situated in Thorndon, the main entrance to the cathedral is on Hill Street, at its junction with Molesworth Street; it is located close to the parliament precinct.\nThe building was designed in the 1930s by New Zealand architect Cecil Wood. Construction began in 1954, and was completed in 1998. It was constructed in reinforced concrete due to the effects of the 1931 Napier earthquake making other choices impractical. The church was initially envisioned as a war memorial cathedral, and it was designed on a monumental scale. Archbishop of New Zealand Reginald Herbert Owen declared in 1958: \"Every nation needs in its capital city a great church to express its belief in the things of the spirit\". The building began to be used as an Anglican cathedral in 1964 (replacing Old St Paul's), and was consecrated in 2001.\n\n\n== Services ==\nAs well as being a popular attraction, St Paul's Cathedral is a working church with daily services. The cathedral, as the largest church in Wellington, also plays a role in many state occasions. As of 2019, the normal services are held:\nMonday\u2013Friday: Morning Prayer, 8.15am\nMonday\u2013Wednesday and Friday: Evening Prayer, 5.15pm\nThursday: Choral Evensong, 5.30pm\nSunday: Choral Eucharist and Choral Evensong, 10am and 5pm respectivelyChoral services often involve the Cathedral Choir. Services normally follow the New Zealand Prayer Book, or other modern printed liturgy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nThe first Church of St Paul stood behind where the Beehive stands today. This served as the first Anglican parish church for the early British settlers.As early as the 1840s preparations for a cathedral had been made and bricks were laid. However, the first project came to an end in 1855 after an earthquake hit Wellington, which highlighted the unsuitability of brick buildings in such an area.\nConstruction of a second church, today known as \"Old St Paul's\", located behind the Pipitea Marae, began in 1855. It was the pro-cathedral church for the Anglican Diocese of Wellington from 1866 to 1964. Old St Paul's is still consecrated, owned by Heritage New Zealand.In 1907, the diocese acquired land for a permanent cathedral, a site close to the Basin Reserve. In July 1917, the diocesan synod approved preliminary plans drawn up by architect Frank Peck for an elaborate Gothic structure on the site. It was to include a memorial military chapel in the west wing, in which the names of all New Zealanders who had fallen in the Boer War and First World War would be commemorated, and flags of the regiments displayed. Fund-raising for the proposed \"Wellington Memorial Cathedral\" began the following year, with collections even in England. However, in 1923, the synod decided the original ambitious plans were too costly to proceed with.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nPlans were revived in 1937, when it was decided to make the cathedral a project for the national centennial of 1940. The diocese selected Cecil Wood, a New Zealand architect, to design the building. A new site was acquired on Molesworth Street, close to the Parliament Buildings and the Roman Catholic Cathedral. After the 1931 Napier earthquake, the decision was made to construct the cathedral primarily out of reinforced concrete, which was deemed to be more earthquake-resistant. Wood was inspired by the Art Deco architecture of Southern California, and the neo-Byzantine-style of the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral, London. His final design, which has been implemented relatively unchanged, was a 88 m (289 ft) long and 18 m (59 ft) high building.\n\nConstruction of the new cathedral was delayed by the Second World War and its aftermath, and ultimately the project took about 50 years to complete. The foundation stone was laid by Queen Elizabeth II on 13 January 1954; the first stage was dedicated on 17 May 1964; the second stage was dedicated on 5 November 1972. The cathedral's bell tower was added in 1984, and dedicated on Easter Day, April 1984.In 1992, the diocesan synod decided to raise money for a third and final stage of construction. The completed cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1998 and consecrated on 15 October 2001; finally, on 24 February 2002, the Queen unveiled the consecration stone.\n\n\n== Chapels ==\nThe wooden Lady Chapel is along the ambulatory to the left of the pulpit. The Lady Chapel was formerly the parish church of St Paul's at Paraparaumu. Designed by the diocesan architect Frederick de Jersey Clere, the chapel was opened on its Paraparaumu site in 1905. It was moved to the grounds of Wellington Cathedral in 1990, and consecrated on 12 May 1991.A second smaller chapel space is located to the left of the entrance. It is furnished plainly with a small altar.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Artwork and memorials ===\n\nThe cathedral's nave contains many stained-glass windows by church artist Brian Thomas, who had previously designed windows in Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral, London. Thomas took as his theme words of St Paul at the Areopagus: \u201cThe Unknown God: Him I now proclaim\u201d. The windows were created by Whitefriars of London and depict figures and scenes such as the conversion of St Paul; Jacob, the patriarch who wrestled with an angel; Moses, the law giver; David the hero King; the nativity of Jesus; and Christ's crucifixion and the resurrection.The narthex (lobby) is separated from the rest of the nave by a wall consisting of glass panels depicting figures representing angels. The etchings are the work of New Zealand-born artist John Hutton. Similar work by Hutton exists in Coventry Cathedral in England.\n\n\n==== Holm Window ====\n\nIn 1970, the Holm Memorial Window was installed above the three doors leading to the cathedral's Loaves and Fishes Hall. It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, a leading New Zealand stained-glass artist, and made by Roy Miller of Dunedin. The window is a memorial to prominent Wellington businessman Ferdinand Holm, founder of the Holm Shipping Company, and his wife Mary. St Paul, the patron saint of the cathedral, is shown at the top of the centre panel; the top of the left panel depicts the stars of the Southern Cross and the flag of the Company; three ships represent stages in the development of the Company.\n\n\n==== War memorials ====\nAlthough plans for a military chapel had been abandoned during construction, the cathedral authorities did allow for the installation of three sets of memorial windows in the Sanctuary\u2014allocating two lancets each to the Army, Navy and Air Force.Fund-raising for the two Air Force windows began in September 1957.  Designed by the English artist Edward Liddall Armitage, these were installed in April 1962. They are dedicated to the members of the Air Force and New Zealanders who died in the service of the air forces of the Commonwealth during the Second World War. The four remaining windows were designed by New Zealand artist Howard Malitte and adapted for stained-glass by Brian Thomas. Governor-General Brigadier Sir Bernard Fergusson unveiled the Army memorial windows on 9 August 1966. They stand on either side of the organ loft, with the memorial tablet placed on the wall to the left of the Bishop's cathedra (\"The two windows above this tablet were installed by serving and former members of the New Zealand Army to commemorate those who have served in the New Zealand Army at home and abroad since the foundation of our country\u2026\"). The naval and merchant service windows were unveiled on 22 October 1967. They were dedicated in memory of the men and women who lost their lives in the navies and merchant services of the Commonwealth during the two world wars. All six military windows incorporate a rich visual symbolism. A range of memorial flags is also housed in the bell tower.The Memorial to Chunuk Bair, installed in 1998, is one of four memorials erected to commemorate New Zealand soldiers who died in the Battle of Gallipoli and whose graves are not known.\n\n\n==== Dossal ====\nThe Sanctuary is dominated by a large altarpiece\u2014a hanging artwork referred to as a dossal. It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, and installed in 1990. It consists of three panels, in total measuring approximately 8.8 metres (29 ft) by 4.5 metres (15 ft). The centre panel depicts the Risen Christ; the two side sections contain symbols used in historic Christian art.\n\n\n=== Font ===\nThe wooden baptismal font, designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, is designed to be moved around the cathedral. During Eastertide it is placed in the centre of the nave. The base is decorated with four silver panels of cherubim; the cover depicts a dove, symbolising the Holy Spirit which descended on Christ after his baptism.\n\n\n=== Organ ===\n\nIn 1980, the cathedral organ was rebuilt and enlarged. It had been first installed in Old St Paul's in 1877 as a two-manual tracker action instrument blown by water pressure. The console now has four manuals, 81 stops and there are some 3,500 pipes. The organ suffered \"significant damage\" after an earthquake in November 2016.Following the damage to the old organ, the cathedral used two temporary digital organs. In October 2018, a replacement digital organ, a Viscount Regent Classic, was installed in place of the old one; it features four manuals, 85 stops and 42 speakers.\n\n\n=== Bells ===\nThe cathedral's bell tower is one of only seven in New Zealand where change ringing takes place. It has 14 bells, ranging in size from Little James, weighing in at 4 cwt (200 kg) to the People's Bell at 27\u00be cwt (1,400 kg). The bells were installed in 1984; seven of the bells are over 100 years old and were moved from a demolished church, St Edmund's in Northampton, England.\n\n\n== Deans of St Paul ==\nThe Chapter of St Paul has had eight deans:\n\n1948\u20131962: David Jones Davies\n1963\u20131977: Walter Edmund Wilmshurst Hurst\n1978\u20131985: James Thomas\n1985\u20132002: Michael Henry Brown\n2003\u20132004: Douglas Everett Sparks\n2004\u20132012: Frank Nelson (afterwards Dean of Adelaide, 2012)\n2012\u20132018: Digby Wilkinson\n2018\u2013present: David Rowe\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cathedrals in New Zealand\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Wellington Cathedral of St Paul at Wikimedia Commons\n\nWellington Cathedral of St Paul \u2013 official website\nOld St Paul's \u2013 New Zealand Heritage website for the second church",

          "Built in 1998, a very nice cathedral with a huge 4000 pipe organ. Not all cathedrals have to be old! Built on to this cathedral is the old parish wooden church from the Kapiti coast, known as the Lady's chapel. So you can still get your \"old\" fix",
          "The new cathedral in Wellington has replaced the old St. Pauls and is very very different. From my point of view The \u201cnew\u201d Cathedral of St Paul is a too massive building as well as the scale of the interior is too huge. Not very nice at all. I must admit that I do not like the",
          "This is a special place for me as my late Dad helped build it. It's a beautiful modern cathedral. I love architecture, churches especially.",
          "After having seen the old St Pauls church which was lovely I was really disappointed with the new cathedral. It is a huge peach coloured brick building spacious inside. It doesn't have any character and feels cold and forbidding. I wouldn't go again if I was inWellington.",
          "The new cathedral in Wellington has replaced the old St Pauls and is very different. The outside of the building is extremely plain. It the inside is rather more decorative. A service was about to begin when we visited, but a member of staff was very keen to show us around,",
          "Well worth visiting. So much history & beautiful stained glass windows everywhere. A nice, quiet place to sit & reflect on things.",
          "We visited this cathedral before going to visit the Parliament building. This is an modern church with some interesting elements like a memorial plate and a beautiful pipe organ. It was a short visit but interesting.",
          "Our visit to the Cathedral became one of the highlights of our visit to the North Island. Just walking into the church from the humdrum of the city to peace, light and beauty of the interior was lovely. The story of gorgeous glass at the entrance, the beautiful stained glass",
          "Specially when you visit the old cathedral it is nice to see the new cathedral. It is a modern cathedral not like you expect in a church.",
          "As churches go this one is not stunningly beautiful when you look at its exterior. It is a pinkish tone and very tall in its structure and does not have the wow factor. When you step inside the high ceilings, stained glass windows and wooden interior give you a different feel",
          "Wow, this has to be the only cathedral I ever saw that I can best describe as ugly. Its exteriors are horrific with a pinkish tone and mold in numerous places. The interior isn't any better and with the exception of the mosaic figure at the altar, the entire place does not feel",
          "The core of this building is very differnt to most modern designs. the shere size of it is also the very cool would not recomed for kids under 16",
          "After spending some time at the Parliament precinct, very close by is the 60-year-old St Paul's Cathedral (not to be confused with the Old St Paul's which is another block down east at Thorndon). This is another free time walk-in tour when there is no service taking place. I",
          "Somewhat stark but nice in its own way. Not your conventional building, but that's what makes it interesting. Close to other, perhaps more, popular sites, so easy to add on.",
          "I was quite shocked by the austerity and severity of the building which is already in need of stone cleaning. The stains [?algae] on the pink stone do not help the sight. In other words, it did not look welcoming. Once inside, I grew to like the quiet spaciousness. There is",
          "It is right by parliament so can be added to any other visit. it will only take 30 mins and is right next door to the other cathedral and just up the road from the national library Mike",
          "I love seeing churches, particularly Anglican/Episcopal churches, but with respect, I think the exterior of this cathedral is the ugliest I have ever seen. Its architecture looks like Mussollini's Fascist architects of the 30's designed it--can't imagine what they were",
          "The new St Paul\u2019s Anglican Cathedral stands close to Parliament House, and is certainly a landmark. It is built in earthquake proof concrete, and is very large and austere. I really wanted to enjoy this Cathedral, but it didn't resonate with me as a spiritual space. The on",
          "We went here whilst on a excursion form our cruise ship in Wellington. As we were on a tight schedule due to the ship only being docked a few hours we had very little time here. This I a nice looking, quite modern cathedral from the outside and even better from the inside. This",
          "We went just after going into the parliament buildings ,as it is just across the road, when inside lots of details of how the cathedral was built. Stain glass windows hidden away in corners is wonder to behold. Must be a blessing to inside when a service is being held. Not",
          "First impressions of the cathedral from the outside are not great...it's an ugly concrete block construction in faded pink which looks a bit dirty. Inside it is better though, as it is light and spacious and the windows are lovely. Overall it just feels rather cold and empty.",
          "This is a modern cathedral a replacement for Old St Paul's. The outside is nothing special but once you step in you are amazed by the beauty of such a modern yet beautiful building. I loved the stained glass windows and the beautifully embroidered kneeling cushions for each",
          "in Mid-May this year, on a cold and rainy afternoon, a guide took us (our group) to see the Wellington town and in that tour took us to the Wellington Cathedral of St. Paul. what impressed me the most was the simplicity of the building and the rich history that forms an integral",
          "I wasn't expecting such an amazing building - it is absolutely beautiful. I especially loved the Chapel which was an old church brought in from the surrounding area - lovely all in wood. Would definitely go back - very peaceful",
          "Rather like a power station from without, the white concrete interior is very plain, but very beautiful because of its simplicity. Some of the modern stained glass is stunning.",
          "I originally visited the Cathedral before walking the two streets over to Old St Paul's. What a contrast in styles and warmth. From the dirty looking pink exterior stucco cladding to the cold interior space the Cathedral definitely fails to impress in offering much to engage",
          "In New Zealand's Capital City, Wellington, not only is the former Pro-Cathedral: Old St Paul's, a most rewarding visit, but so is its replacement: New St Paul's! Although, perhaps not so instantly appealing, the new coloured concrete 20th century \"Moderne\" cathedral church",
          "I wasn't impressed with the fabric hanging behind the altar; a bit primitive. But the stained glass is lovely, as is the Lady Chapel, which is a relocated wooden church.",
          "We first toured Old St. Pauls, which we loved, and then came here. The interior is somewhat cold and unimpressive despite the large size. If you can only go to one, choose Old St. Pauls - it has a much better gift shop as well!",
          "The Cathedal is lovely. Definitely have a look at the Lady Chapel and don't miss the Dossal behind the main altar. It's unique and absolutely gorgeous. Well worth spending a half hour in the Cathedral. At the main entrance you will find a map with good information about",
          "Sorry, not what I expected and most definitely not what I like. Think 1960's concrete \"modern\" monstrosity of an edifice. Now think of the same but given a coat of pink paint. Over thinned pink paint, applied over a very large surface by a man with a defective roller. Got",
          "When I walked in and saw the large textile hanging behind the altar depicting Christ, I was reminded of the very similar cocoon design in Coventry Cathedral, England. There is also a cross made from the nails from the ruins of Coventry Cathdral. There is much to admire here,",
          "The vaulted ceiling and ambience of the cathedral is wonderful and the accoustics brilliant. The wedding service was conducted very well.",
          "A big pink blockwork edifice outside; reasonably immense and impressive inside. But, sadly for such a building, it lacks soul.",
          "When I first came to Wellington 40 years agao was half built. It has been finished for years now and I am pleased that even though new it is a reasonable buliding.",
          "The fantastic accoustics when my daughter and her choir sang there. The organ being played was outstanding.",
          "The place is an easy walk from the parliament grounds and the train station. Worth the trip if you are sightseeing in Wellington. Classic architecture, very warm and inviting feeling inside.",
          "My second visit to the Cathedral, it is so serene, and so interesting with all the information supplied. Last time someone came and gave us a guided tour, this time it was so quiet and peaceful, but not as easy to find our way. Thank you for allowing us to visit you wonderful"

        "wiki": "Kathleen Mansfield Murry (n\u00e9e Beauchamp; 14 October 1888 \u2013 9 January 1923) was a prominent New Zealand modernist short story writer and poet who was born and brought up in colonial New Zealand and wrote under the pen name of Katherine Mansfield. At the age of 19, she left New Zealand and settled in England, where she became a friend of writers such as D. H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf. Mansfield was diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis in 1917; the disease claimed her life at the age of 34.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nMansfield was born Kathleen Mansfield Beauchamp in 1888 into a socially prominent family in Wellington, New Zealand. Her grandfather was Arthur Beauchamp, who briefly represented the Picton electorate in parliament. Her extended family included the author Countess Elizabeth von Arnim, and her great-great-uncle was Victorian artist Charles Robert Leslie. Her father Harold Beauchamp became the chairman of the Bank of New Zealand and was knighted in 1923. Her mother was Annie Beauchamp, whose brother married the daughter of Richard Seddon.\nShe had two older sisters, a younger sister and a younger brother, born in 1894. The Mansfield family moved from Thorndon to the country suburb of Karori in 1893, for health reasons. Here Mansfield spent the happiest years of her childhood, and she used some of those memories as an inspiration for the short story \"Prelude\".\n\nHer first printed stories appeared in the High School Reporter and the Wellington Girls' High School magazine (the family returned to Wellington proper in 1898), in 1898 and 1899. Her first formally published story \"His Little Friend\" appeared the following year in a society magazine, New Zealand Graphic and Ladies Journal. In 1902 she became enamoured of Arnold Trowell, a cellist, although her feelings were for the most part not reciprocated. Mansfield was herself an accomplished cellist, having received lessons from Trowell's father.Mansfield wrote in her journals of feeling alienated in New Zealand, and of how she had become disillusioned because of the repression of the M\u0101ori people. M\u0101ori characters often are portrayed in a sympathetic or positive light in her later stories, such as \"How Pearl Button Was Kidnapped\".\n\n\n=== Moving to London ===\nMansfield moved to London in 1903, where she attended Queen's College along with her sisters. Mansfield recommenced playing the cello, an occupation that she believed she would take up professionally, but she also began contributing to the college newspaper with such dedication that she eventually became its editor. She was particularly interested in the works of the French Symbolists and Oscar Wilde, and she was appreciated among her peers for her vivacious and charismatic approach to life and work.Mansfield met fellow student Ida Baker at the college, and they became lifelong friends. They both adopted their mother's maiden names for professional purposes, and Baker became known as LM or Lesley Moore, adopting the name of Lesley in honour of Mansfield's younger brother, Leslie.Mansfield did not become involved in much political activity during her time in London. For example, she did not actively support the suffragette movement in the UK (women in New Zealand had gained the right to vote in 1893).\n\n\n=== Travelling across Europe ===\nMansfield travelled in Continental Europe between 1903 and 1906, staying mainly in Belgium and Germany. After finishing her schooling in England she returned to New Zealand and only then began in earnest to write short stories. She had several works published in the Native Companion (Australia), her first paid writing work, and by this time she had her heart set on becoming a professional writer. This was also the first occasion on which she used the pseudonym \"K. Mansfield\". She rapidly grew weary of the provincial New Zealand lifestyle and of her family, and two years later headed back to London. Her father sent her an annual allowance of 100 pounds for the rest of her life. In later years she expressed both admiration and disdain for New Zealand in her journals, but she was never able to return there because of her tuberculosis.\nMansfield had two romantic relationships with women that are notable for their prominence in her journal entries. She continued to have male lovers, and attempted to repress her feelings at certain times. Her first same-sex romantic relationship was with Maata Mahupuku (sometimes known as Martha Grace), a wealthy young M\u0101ori woman whom she had first met at Miss Swainson's school in Wellington and then again in London in 1906. In June 1907, she wrote:\"I want Maata\u2014I want her as I have had her\u2014terribly. This is unclean I know but true.\"She often referred to Maata as Carlotta. She wrote about Maata in several short stories. Maata married in 1907, but it is claimed that she sent money to Mansfield in London. The second relationship, with Edith Kathleen Bendall, took place from 1906 to 1908. Mansfield also professed her adoration for her in her journals.\n\n\n=== Return to London ===\nAfter having returned to London in 1908, Mansfield quickly fell into a bohemian way of life. She published only one story and one poem during her first 15 months there. Mansfield sought out the Trowell family for companionship, and while Arnold was involved with another woman, Mansfield embarked on a passionate affair with his brother Garnet. By early 1909, she had become pregnant by Garnet though Trowell's parents disapproved of the relationship, and the two broke up. She then hastily entered into a marriage with George Bowden, a teacher of singing 11 years her senior; they were married on 2 March, but she left him the same evening, before the marriage could be consummated.After Mansfield had a brief reunion with Garnet, Mansfield's mother, Annie Beauchamp, arrived in 1909. She blamed the breakdown of the marriage to Bowden on a lesbian relationship between Mansfield and Baker, and she quickly had her daughter dispatched to the spa town of Bad W\u00f6rishofen in Bavaria, Germany where Mansfield miscarried. It is not known whether her mother knew of this miscarriage when she left shortly after arriving in Germany, but she cut Mansfield out of her will.Mansfield's time in Bavaria had a significant effect on her literary outlook. In particular, she was introduced to the works of Anton Chekhov. Some biographers accuse her of plagiarizing Chekhov with one of her early short stories. She returned to London in January 1910. She then published more than a dozen articles in Alfred Richard Orage's socialist magazine The New Age, and became a friend and lover of Beatrice Hastings, who lived with Orage. Her experiences of Germany formed the foundation of her first published collection, In a German Pension (1911), which she later described as \"immature\".\n\n\n=== Contributing to Rhythm ===\nSoon afterward, Mansfield submitted a lightweight story to a new avant-garde magazine called Rhythm. The piece was rejected by the magazine's editor John Middleton Murry, who requested something darker. Mansfield responded with \"The Woman at the Store\", a tale of murder and mental illness. Mansfield was inspired at this time by Fauvism.\n\nMansfield and Murry began a relationship in 1911 that culminated in their marriage in 1918, although she left him twice, in 1911 and 1913.The publisher of Rhythm, Charles Granville (sometimes known as Stephen Swift), absconded to Europe in October 1912, and left Murry responsible for the debts the magazine had accumulated. Mansfield pledged her father's allowance towards the magazine, but it was discontinued, being reorganised as The Blue Review in 1913 and folding after three issues. Mansfield and Murry were persuaded by their friend Gilbert Cannan to rent a cottage next to his windmill in Cholesbury, Buckinghamshire in 1913, in an attempt to alleviate Mansfield's ill health. In January 1914, the couple moved to Paris, in the hope that a change of setting would make writing easier for both of them. Mansfield wrote only one story during her time there, \"Something Childish But Very Natural\", before Murry was recalled to London to declare bankruptcy.Mansfield had a brief affair with the French writer Francis Carco in 1914. Her visit to him in Paris in February 1915 is retold in her story \"An Indiscreet Journey\".\n\n\n=== Impact of World War I ===\nKatherine Mansfield's life and work were changed in 1915 by the death of her beloved younger brother, Leslie Heron \"Chummie\" Beauchamp, as a New Zealand soldier in France. She began to take refuge in nostalgic reminiscences of their childhood in New Zealand. In a poem describing a dream she had shortly after his death, she wrote:\n\nBy the remembered stream my brother standsWaiting for me with berries in his hands...\"These are my body. Sister, take and eat.\"\nAt the beginning of 1917, Mansfield and Murry separated, although he continued to visit her at her new apartment. Ida Baker, whom Mansfield often called, with a mixture of affection and disdain, her \"wife\", moved in with her shortly afterwards. Mansfield entered into her most prolific period of writing after 1916, which began with several stories, including \"Mr Reginald Peacock's Day\" and \"A Dill Pickle\", being published in The New Age. Virginia Woolf and her husband Leonard, who had recently set up the Hogarth Press, approached her for a story, and Mansfield presented to them \"Prelude\", which she had begun writing in 1915 as \"The Aloe\". The story depicts a New Zealand family moving house.\n\n\n=== Diagnosis of tuberculosis ===\nIn December 1917, Mansfield was diagnosed with tuberculosis. For part of spring and summer 1918, she joined her close friend the American painter Anne Estelle Rice at Looe in Cornwall, in the hope of recovering. There, Rice painted a famous portrait of her dressed in red, a vibrant colour Mansfield liked and suggested herself. The painting known as the Portrait of Katherine Mansfield is now exhibited in Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand. Mansfield wrote in a letter to Murry about being Rice's model:A. came early and began the great painting \u2014 me in that red, brick red frock with flowers everywhere. It's awfully interesting, even now. I painted her in my way as she painted me in hers: her eyes \u2026 little blue flowers plucked this morning.Then, rejecting the idea of staying in a sanatorium on the grounds that it would cut her off from writing, she moved abroad to avoid the English winter. She stayed at a half-deserted, cold hotel in Bandol, France, where she became depressed but continued to produce stories, including \"Je ne parle pas fran\u00e7ais\". \"Bliss\", the story that lent its name to her second collection of stories in 1920, was also published in 1918. Her health continued to deteriorate and she had her first lung haemorrhage in March.By April, Mansfield's divorce from Bowden had been finalised, and she and Murry married, only to part again two weeks later. They came together again, however, and in March 1919 Murry became editor of The Athenaeum, a magazine for which Mansfield wrote more than 100 book reviews (collected posthumously as Novels and Novelists). During the winter of 1918\u201319 she and Baker stayed in a villa in San Remo, Italy. Their relationship came under strain during this period; after she wrote to Murry to express her feelings of depression, he stayed over Christmas. Although her relationship with Murry became increasingly distant after 1918 and the two often lived apart, this intervention of his spurred her on, and she wrote \"The Man Without a Temperament\", the story of an ill wife and her long-suffering husband. Mansfield followed her first collection of short stories, Bliss (1920), with another collection, The Garden Party, published in 1922.\n\n\n=== Last years and death ===\nMansfield spent her last years seeking increasingly unorthodox cures for her tuberculosis. In February 1922, she consulted the Russian physician Ivan Manoukhin, whose \"revolutionary\" treatment, which consisted of bombarding her spleen with X-rays, caused Mansfield to develop heat flashes and numbness in her legs.\nIn October 1922, Mansfield moved to Georges Gurdjieff's Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man in Fontainebleau, France, where she was put under the care of Olgivanna Lazovitch Hinzenburg (who later married Frank Lloyd Wright). As a guest rather than a pupil of Gurdjieff, Mansfield was not required to take part in the rigorous routine of the institute, but she spent much of her time there with her mentor, Alfred Richard Orage, and her last letters inform Murry of her attempts to apply some of Gurdjieff's teachings to her own life.Mansfield suffered a fatal pulmonary haemorrhage in January 1923, after running up a flight of stairs. She died on 9 January, and was buried at Cimetiere d\u2019Avon, Avon (near Fontainebleau), France.Mansfield was a prolific writer in the final years of her life. Much of her work remained unpublished at her death, and Murry took on the task of editing and publishing it in two additional volumes of short stories (The Dove's Nest in 1923, and Something Childish in 1924); a volume of poems; The Aloe; Novels and Novelists; and collections of her letters and journals.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe following high schools in New Zealand have a house named after Mansfield: Whangarei Girls' High School; Rangitoto College, Westlake Girls' High School, and Macleans College in Auckland; Tauranga Girls' College; Wellington Girls' College; Rangiora High School in North Canterbury, and Southland Girls' High School in Invercargill. She has also been honoured at Karori Normal School in Wellington, which has a stone monument dedicated to her with a plaque commemorating her work and her time at the school, and at Samuel Marsden Collegiate School (previously Fitzherbert Terrace School) with a painting, and an award in her name.\nHer birthplace in Thorndon, Wellington has been preserved as the Katherine Mansfield House and Garden, and a park is dedicated to her.\nA street in Menton, France, where she lived and wrote, is named after her. A fellowship is offered annually to enable a New Zealand writer to work at her former home, the Villa Isola Bella, and New Zealand's pre-eminent short story competition is named in her honour.Mansfield was the subject of a 1973 BBC miniseries, A Picture of Katherine Mansfield, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The six-part series included depictions of Mansfield's life and adaptations of her short stories. In 2011, a television biopic titled Bliss was made of her early beginnings as a writer in New Zealand; in this she was played by Kate Elliott.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Collections ===\nIn a German Pension (1911), ISBN 1-86941-014-9\nBliss and Other Stories (1920)\nThe Garden Party and Other Stories (1922), ISBN 1-86941-016-5\nThe Doves' Nest and Other Stories (1923), ISBN 1-86941-017-3\nThe Montana Stories (1923) (Republished in 2001 by Persephone Books)\nPoems (1923), ISBN 0-19-558199-7\nSomething Childish and Other Stories (1924), ISBN 1-86941-018-1, first published in the US as The Little Girl\nThe Journal of Katherine Mansfield (1927, 1954), ISBN 0-88001-023-1\nThe Letters of Katherine Mansfield (2 vols., 1928\u201329)\nThe Aloe (1930), ISBN 0-86068-520-9\nNovels and Novelists (1930), ISBN 0-403-02290-8\nThe Short Stories of Katherine Mansfield (1937)\nThe Scrapbook of Katherine Mansfield (1939)\nThe Collected Stories of Katherine Mansfield (1945, 1974), ISBN 0-14-118368-3\nLetters to John Middleton Murry, 1913\u20131922 (1951), ISBN 0-86068-945-X\nThe Urewera Notebook (1978), ISBN 0-19-558034-6\nThe Critical Writings of Katherine Mansfield (1987), ISBN 0-312-17514-0\nThe Collected Letters of Katherine Mansfield (4 vols., 1984\u201396)\nVol. 1, 1903\u201317, ISBN 0-19-812613-1\nVol. 2, 1918\u201319, ISBN 0-19-812614-X\nVol. 3, 1919\u201320, ISBN 0-19-812615-8\nVol. 4, 1920\u201321, ISBN 0-19-818532-4\nThe Katherine Mansfield Notebooks (2 vols., 1997), ISBN 0-8166-4236-2\nThe collected poems of Katherine Mansfield, edited by Gerri Kimber and Claire Davison, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, [2016], ISBN 978-1-4744-1727-3\n\n\n=== Short stories ===\n\n\n== Biographies ==\nKatherine Mansfield: The Early Years, Gerri Kimber, Edinburgh University Press, 2016, ISBN 9780748681457\nKatherine Mansfield, Antony Alpers, A.A.

          "A great way to spend an hour. Well maintained tracks through lovely native bush, emerging at the top to expansive views across Wellington harbour and city, south and west to the Mainland, north to Pauatanui inlet. Very popular - lots of people doing the same as us though some",

          "Takes no more than half and hour to reach the top, can be a little steep in places, but generally can be done without stopping. You're rewarded with 360\u00ba views of the Wellington region and South Island once you reach the top. Stunner on a warm sunny day.",
          "This walk begins with a climb through gorgeous native bush. It keeps going up and up but the views are totally worth it. If you go slowly you don't have to be that fit. You can see the panoramic views of greater Wellington. Just beautiful",
          "Quite steep depending on which entrance to the park you take. The Johnsonville access is probably the nearest and easiest. Climb up through bush and open hilltop to the goodnight kiwi beacon at the top. Glorious views all round...but prepare for exposed conditions and weather",
          "It is a long and hard walk up to the summit, but the scenery (the ocean, the city, the windmills and the hills) makes it worthwhile.",

          "If you want to get some great views, take the track up Mount Kaukau. It is steep, but well maintained with lots of steps cut into the path. The path is stony in places, so good shoes are a must. Go at your own pace - I'm not even moderately fit, so there was some serious puffing",
          "If you're moderately fit and up for a quick ascent to enjoy the stunning panoramic views from the summit (elev. 445 m or 1460 ft), it'll take about 30 minutes from Simla Crescent, 4th stop from Wellington Station on the Johnsonville Train line (a bargain at NZ$ 8 round-trip).",

          "Climbed Kaukau as part of a long run recently. Requires a reasonable level of fitness and very exposed on a windy day. The views are well worth the climb though. You can carry on along the tops down towards the south coast if you are really energetic.",
          "Mt. Kaukau is located north from Wellington CBD, and can be accessed by foot from Khandallah. Easiest way to get there is by catching the train to Simla Crescent on the Johnsonville line, and walking up the hill. Alternatively you may do the Skyline Track, and end up on the",
          "We took the train out from Wellington and then hiked the Northern Passage back into the city - about 10 miles. There are some gorgeous views from the tower and, if nice weather, a picnic table to sit and enjoy a lunch. But even in bad weather, we enjoyed the hike and the scenery.",
          "Reasonably steep walk. Would highly suggest doing this if you don't have time for the entire Skyline route, however, if you have a about 5-6 hours, do the whole thing! Do it on a clear day, as there is minimal shelter. Parking shouldn't be an issue.",
          "There's a few approaches to the top of Kaukau, all get steep and sometime s slippery so dress appropriately. Probably the easiest is from Broadmeadows as you can drive up most of the height of the hill. You'll see all kinds of folks at the top, young kids, runners, cyclists and",
          "My friend suggested we went for a walk - on a beautiful fresh sunny day well worth it for the views at the top - can be a little muddy in places where the light doesn't get through the trees. Some fitness required - is steep in places and lots of steps - views are awesome",
          "Mount Kaukau is a nice walk just outside of the Wellington CBD. It offers nice views of the city after the walk. I recommend visiting on a dry sunny day, as the track can get all muddy just after the rains. I strongly recommend this walk.",
          "Steepish walk uphill from the station, for up to an hour. Great views. Can be included in longer day walks, such as to Johnson's hill in Karori. Avoid in bad weather - exposed.",
          "There are several tracks leading to the summit. Most are straight up, steep and short but the one starting at the end of the Old Coach Road has an easier gradient but is a bit longer. There's a track to suit everyone's ability. From the top, on can link up with the Old Coach",
          "You have to go up here whilst in Wellington. Great views of the city and rolling hills. The walk isn't challenging, just well built steps up and up.",
          "I love the views once you reach the top of Mount Kaukau. This is a steep, uphill walk up a number of steps but will take you less than 1 hour. A great walk for a city lighting the great variety and diversity in Wellington city.",
          "The highest point in the immediate Wellington area, it is readily accessed from well graded walking trails leading from public transport routes. For example enter from the Crofton Downs or Awarua stations, walk along the ridge to the summit and descend via the Khandallah or",
          "A great walk up to the summit, can be a bit of work the first couple of times but worth it. Walking amongst beautiful forest, mountain streams and listening to beautiful song birds, is an experience. The walk is cool due to plenty of shade and the views at top are beautiful.",
          "Mount Kaukau is a good above Wellington city, it takes approximately an hour from the car park to the lookout at the top and is a fairly steep climb comprising of sloped track and stairs. You'll need good footwear, and the useful stuff like sun screen, water, food and a jacket",
          "Many entrances and exits to reach the summit. We started in Box-hill area. Took us about 30 minutes to reach the top. Lots of stairs once you pass about the half way point. It was a warm day and it was a work out to get to the top. A little slick with wet ground and it had not",
          "If you are going to make the trek up Mt KauKau make sure you have some sensible walking shoes and check the weather forecast as it can change pretty quickly up there with dramatic results! On a calm sunny day the view is sensational - you can see right across Wellington and over",
          "I love this amountant - it is better that you do the Skyline Walk to this mountain. It is worthit. So beautiful mountain ranges. But it can be a long walk.",
          "I'm a local to Mt Kaukau, having lived in the area for over 20yrs, and consider it a 'must-do' for anyone living in or visiting Wellington who enjoys a hill walk. The main tracks are well maintained and as easy as a fairly steep uphill walk can be and you can get up and down in",
          "Such a fantastic workout - and when you get to the top, wow on a good day that view is just breathtaking. You can see the South Island when it's clear. Lots of walking tracks to choose from",
          "Beautiful views and well worth the huff and puff to get up there - lots of different entry points, but the one from Khandallah pool is easy for tourists. Cant beat it on a good day!",
          "This is a decent walk and a good run. Many different tracks to choose from. Even if you are not that fit, there are spots along the way to sit and take in the view. Worth going to top to get a super view and a sense of achievement.",
          "It is definitely worth the walk up to the top, especially on a beautiful clear day. You can sometimes see the top of the South Island! Great walk, great views!",
          "This is my local \"top bush walk\" and I do it 2 - 3 times a week. Many locals do, and most of the time there is a handful of others on the walk up or back, regardless what time of the day or week... There are multiple access tracks up the hill, some steeper (and therefore",
          "This walk is amazing. I do it for fitness purposes, but nothing beats that view at the top. On a nice day, I can sit there for hours just looking around Wellington and out to the Hutt Valley. If you are an active person then I would definitely recommend you do not miss this.",
          "We visited Mt KauKau for a lovely walk. Its a decent climb up, but the views at the top are wonderful. Great for fresh air and to get that heart pumping. Worth the walk to see the beautiful city from up high.",
          "This is an awesome little walk you can do in an hour or so. The views from the top over the harbour are awesome.",
          "Mount Kaukau is renowned as one of the most strenuous bush walks in Wellington. At the same time, it is definitely doable for amateurs if you just pace yourself. It is so worth it! Through the native bush on the way up with the peaceful atmosphere, you can hear many of NZ's",
          "Regularly walk to the summit from Old Coach Road, Truscott Ave, Khandallah Pool or Simla Cres entrances and it is always a great workout. Usually rewarded with stunning views from the top no matter the route. It is a good walk with lots of steps no matter the starting point.",
          "This has got to be one of the best free short walks anywhere. There are a number of different tracks up Kaukau - those from Simla Crescent and Clark Street, or from Khandallah Park (car parking at end of Woodmancote Rd) are all well maintained and regularly upgraded although",
          "I caught the train to Simla Crescent from the CBD, and walked up the walking track, that is really well signed just a minute or two from the train station. the track is well formed, and there is no fear of loosing your way. The views from the summit are spectacular, I was lucky",
          "The view from the top is rewarding. Mt Kaukau is a must do in the Wellington region, especially for those who enjoy the outdoors and a bit of push play. I have seen individuals run up from the Johnsonville entrance to the top, or groups of families; with kids as young as 5",
          "Have run/walked every track on this beautiful mountain. So many tracks starting from different suburbs like johnsonville, Mandalay, Ngaio, Simla Crescent & Crofton Downs. Some people have asked about the best view of the wind turbine, which is actually not from the top of",
          "My son, a couple of friends and myself decided to do the walk up Mount Kaukau. A fairly steep and uneven climb took us est. 45 mins. Up and another 45mins. down perhaps a bit longer as we lost our way back. Beautiful views from the top a bit windy typical of Wellington.",
          "Mt Kau Kau is a lovely place to go. The walk up to the top is do-able for most people, but it does get the blood pumping and the heart going due to lots of steps and being a good uphill walk. The views are worth the effort it takes to get to the top, stunning panoramic views and",
          "A very pleasant walk initially through dense woodland (bush) on well maintained paths. We started from the car park in Khandallah and slthough the sign post states 1 hour walking readonably briskly we reached the lookout in just over 30 minutes. Although the weather was not",
          "Tough climb but the views at the top are worth the puffing and blowing! We suggest you start at Khandallah and walk past the caf\u00e9 which is next to the swimming pool and head through the park to the start of the walk. Pool only open is summer but reward yourself coming down with",

          "It's a bit of a hike - 45-60 minutes of hard slog if you're unfit like me - but the 360 degree view from the top on a clear day is breath-taking.",
          "Decided to head up to my favourite spot in Wellington on a beautiful hangover free Sunday. What a day it was. 23\u00b0 and a bit of wind too cool you down. I maybe biased buy this is the best view in Wellington.",
          "A walk up through beautiful native bush, which is well worth the uphill trek..At the top the views over Wellington city and harbour are spectacular if you can visit on a sunny day. If you go in Summer visit the khandallah fresh water pool for a dip at the end to cool down or a",
          "It is incredible, you can view wellington city, eastbourne and south island from the top. Not really hard to get to the top but very enjoyable walk",

          "We started our climb up to Mount Kaukau at Truscott Avenue in Johnsonville. Wow, what a climb it was too!! 445 metres above sea level. Unfortunately the day we chose to do this walk the weather was very misty, so we didn't get the spectacular views at the top that you would",
          "Well worth walking up Mount Kauakau whether from Ngaio, Khandallah or Johnsonville. We recommend going early, ideally 8am latest to avoid too many people and take water. A great way to see Wellington.",
          "I was lucky to visit Wellington recently over an amazing stretch of fine weather. The views from Mt Kaukau were stunning - the Marlborough Sounds looked close enough to touch. We took 45 min up and then carried on south for 2 hr along the Te Araroa Trail and descended through",
          "The way up is a really tough one. The main way uses stairs that never seem to end, but you can take an other way, much more interesting and beautiful by starting in Otari Wilton's Bush. From Otari Wilton's Bush (which is a very nice forest park, by the way) take the Blue Trail",
          "When you are in the neighbourhood of Wellington and you have a reasonable fitness, walk of Mt Kau Kau. It is part of the Northern Walkway. There are several starting points. We always take the starting point at Simla Cresent. Easy when you come out of town by train. ( take",
          "We went up here with neighbours who said they'd lived in Broadmeadows for 20 years but had never been up here despite it being right on their doorstep! We started from Sirsi Crescent in Broadmeadows so it's already part of the way up. The walk really only steep at the beginning",
          "Legit my fav walk - when I was fitter, i'd run it! Lots of people and dogs head up - also lots of children. So it's walk for everyone! People are generally polite and move to the side. There is a cafe down the bottom, and the Khandallah swimming pool is open during the summer",
          "This walk is approx 45 mins uphill, there are a number of steps to climb but many lovely views overlooking Wellington along the way. The view from the top is worth all the steps, it's a 360 degree view. Take your time and also a water bottle and enjoy the amazing views. Plenty",
          "What a fantastic walk to the top! Nice, steep and challenging. Beautiful through the bush, with some parts open to the sky. The view from the top is spectacular, especially when the sun is out and no wind like today. Definitely bring your water bottle and camera, even a picnic",
          "You can start on Huntleigh park way and go up Crows nest. This will then link onto the skyline track which takes you to Mount Kaukau summit. Once at top of Crows nest you can see all the wind turbines. Definitely one of my favourite runs to do, but not for the faint-hearted!",
          "Really enjoyed our 8am walk - took about 1.5 hours return. A pleasant hilly walk and then great views from the top. Well worth it, enjoyed it more than Mt Victoria.",
          "The view from the top of Mt Kaukau is stupendous. On a beautiful day it might actually be the best place in Wellington. The walk up is pretty steep, and there are a lot of steps! The path is really well maintained and very clear. Next time I'll take a picnic up so we can hang at",
          "Walked the skyline walkway and this was definitely the highlight and perfect place to stop for lunch. Would say the walk wasn't easy, but easier than city to sea.",
          "A great hike up but well worth it. Go on a clear day. Take some sandwiches and a flask. Great panoramic views 360. Beautiful landscape.",
          "It's a steep, but enjoyable and not too hard walk up here. The views are excellent too. Be prepared for the winds.",
          "Great walking track with multiple entryway. Good incline challenge and the view is definitely worth seeing. If you take the north route via McClintock you go through a farm and if you are lucky, cows and sheep will greet you along the way.",
          "A reasonable standard of fitness may be required to climb to the top of Mt. Kaukau from the cafe in Khandallah, but the views are well worth it. On a clear day you can see from The Kaikouras in the South Island to Mount Taranaki near New Plymouth.",
          "If you have a reasonable level of fitness and knees that will cope with a number of stairs, this multi-faceted hike will take you through bush or river valley, and open scrub to a view worth puffing over. The top affords 300 degree views from the tip of the South Island up to Mt",
          "While Mt Kau Kau provides a good workout and great views, it gets very windy at the very top where it is mostly exposed. Tip - bring sunscreen, water and a jacket. It is nice to get dropped off at Johnsonville's entrance to walk up and then come down through Khandallah",
          "It's a steep climb but worth it for the views. I really doubt you'd regret making the effort to go up here, just probably try and go when the weather is alright!",
          "Views will wow you as you start climbing up the track from Khandalah. You can see all the way down south to the inlet in Porirrua on a nice clear day. Not a place to go to when it is raining coz it can be slippery on the way down.",
          "We walked up MT KauKau for Guy Fawkes last year. Make sure you take a couple of torches and something warm to drink at the top as it can get windy. It's a lovely walk up especially at sun rise or sun set. The view is amazing and most of the time you can see the South Island and",
          "Started the hike from Simla Crescent and ascended to Mt Kaukau. The hike is energetic but not too taxing and the views at the top are worth it.",
          "The walk up is a bit challenging for the less sporty ones, but a very nice walk anyway. The views of Wellington are great from the top. Watch out for the wind...",
          "Couldn't resist the challenge to walk Mt Kaukau. Word of warning - WEAR APPROPRIATE FOOTWEAR WITH GRIP. About 2.9k on constructed stairs and basic walking track with exposed tree roots, and rocks, so watch what you're doing. Hard haul up to the top - be warned if you're not so",
          "A great 360 degree view. Plan to do it on a nice day with no wind however. Great either biking or walking",
          "After breakfast at a local cafe Dunshea's ( only a short walk away) - climbing up to the top of Mt Kaukau was just the coolest thing to do ! Highly recommended for anyone with 'some level of fitness'. Getting there does involve a fair amount of uphill and long sections of",
          "Walk it, you'll love the 360 view from the top. It is not difficult, and will take about 30 minutes from the Kandallah Pool car park. Bush covered most of the way, good walking track opens out onto a grassy track near top. Stop there for a picnic and enjoy the vista!",
          "If you are in Wellington & want to get some aerobic exercise do this! Catch a train or bus to Simla crescent, walk up Simla a little way and there's the start of the track. Plenty of steps, good quality track, very nice bush. As you climb look back at the views. Or do as I do",
          "The walk was quite tricky in places but i only have a mild fitness level and managed ok....the walk took a while we went from simla terrace at the bottom by the khandalla pools.......but was absaloutely worth the walk when you get to the top and see such a spectacular 360 view",
          "Go on a clear day. It's a steep hike up but well worth it when you get to the top. Magnificent views. Take a picnic up with you and enjoy and take the time. Then in summer there is a pool at the bottom to enjoy.",
          "Enjoyed a great walk on a lovely day. Be prepared for a steep climb, so not for the unfit.mthe views of Wellington are spectacular! Well worth a morning excercise.",
          "We walked up from Simla Tce (?), took under an hour for the return trip. A good climb up, gets the heart rate up. Awesome view and well worth the effort. Glad we found this walk. Will definitely be back for more walking in Wellington, a great place fir walking. Wear good",
          "One of the first trek in wellington, you will enjoy the changing shades of green around while you trek. It will test your lungs and your fitness.",
          "If your feeling fit and its a good day then you really should take a trip to the top of Mt Kaukau. It has 360 degree views accross the city. If its windy dress warm. The Skyline walkway is also a good option for people who have a spare day (around 3 hours to Karori from Kaukau",
          "Just an hour walking takes you to a view all over Wellington. Take a camera and binoculars. It was a fine day when we went, the turbine blades stood still.",
          "You need to be fairly fir, but if not just take your time. Its worth it for the great views. I walked up in about 30 minutes and 10 minutes to run down",
          "Start your day off at Khandallah Park, a suburb within Wellington with an outdoor swim or on the playground. Then, take one of the many dirt trails through the foliage to the top (which is the highest point in Wellington). Sometimes you can see bulls or sheep grazing at the",
          "As detailed by other contributors the 360 degree views are fantastic and certainly the best I saw in Wellington. I walked up and back via Bells Track which starts at the top of Awarua Street in Ngaio. A few days before I had walked most of the way up via Simla Cres Khandallah (I",
          "The best view of the city and surrounds we have found, and we have walked a lot around Wellington. We take all our guests here. Originally we walked up from Khandallah park which was very steep but totally worth it when you come out at the top, or you can walk to it from Karori",
          "I loved the Mount Kaukau walk my brother and I did yesterday morning. We took the alternative route up, which is quite strenuous but provided absolutely stunning views of the city all the way up to the top. The track is well sign posted once you get to Khandallah pool. The views",
          "There are several routes up the hill, from long and steep to short and, well, maybe a bit less steep. I think there is also a long and relatively gentle one but I haven't tried it. Worth the pull, for the panorama of Wellington and suburbs which is spread st your feet from the",
          "Having lived locally most of my life I have walked up Mt Kaukau several times. The walk up the mountain can be taken from various pathways, the most popular being through Khandallah Park or from Truscott Ave. The walk up the mountain varies from closed in bush to open farmland.",
          "Do this walk on a fine, still day and you will be well rewarded with spectacular views of Wellington, the harbour and surrounding farmland. It is steep in parts, but generally with well constructed steps. Gets the heart rate up and exiting via Crofton Downs gives you a nice,",
          "The walk through the bush to the top has lots of stairs and will get you sweating, need to have a reasonable fitness however there are plenty of resting places along the way. The 360 degree view at top is very rewarding.",
          "As cities go, Wellington has some amazing scenery. From the lookout you can get an almost full 360 view, which includes dainty Wellington city nestled into the harbour as well as meandering coastlines and mountain-top panoramics . It took me 30 minutes to climb (fast paced) with",
          "A long hike up the Mount, through the bush. Lots of different gradients on several walkways. But the view at the top, over the harbour and Wellington is worth it all.",
          "A 360 view of Wellington that is unforgettable. The rolling green mountains are nothing like you would have seen before.",
          "I've been walking up here ever since I was a kid, it's a great walk which boasts a great view of Wellington.",
          "A good steady up hill walk, which at some stages can become a bit congested but when you arrive at the summit, you can get an amazing view of Wellington. It is certainly well worth the effort. This a great thing to do on a calm Summer's day.",
          "We love Mt Kaukau, quite easily accessible from Wellington City, get a train to Box Hill station (Johnsonville train line from Wellington railway station) or taxi to Clarke St, Khandallah. The walk is gorgeous amongst bush and open sky with plenty of birds, and an amazing view",
          "i used to live on the foot of Mt Kau Kau on the Johnsonville side. i ventured up the alot in my childhood and only once as an adult as i no longer live in wellington. i tried to climb up 2 days ago but the weather was so bad that i thought id leave it and climb up when i return",
          "What a view. It is hard and if unfit, take many photos on the way! This is a must do for a Wellingtonian, just like Wrights Hill. Take the kids and some sandwiches and a flask, have a picnic at the top. A group family photo every year as they get older.... Mike",
          "Wonderful walk through native bush then climb for 30 minutes or so quite steep at times. Magnificent views from the summit of Wellington on a good day, or invigorating on a windy one.",

          "Easy access from Khandallah Park to one of the most spectacular views of Wellington city, Porirua Harbour, and the northern part of the South Island.",
          "I went up there last Saturday. It's pretty much 2.5-3 km uphill walk (`400m elevation) with a few stairs in between. In average you will need 25-40 minutes to go up there and yes i'ts a bit of a small workout. The big bonus are the awesome 360 degree views from up there.",
          "Wellington weather certainly turned it on for us with no wind, yes no wind, and a sunny day. Views were excellent and well worth the walk up. Would recommend this to any body to walk up and see the spender of the capital city.",
          "A group of us made the trek to the top of the hill to enjoy amazing views of Wellington - able to see down to the city and across to Makara including the wind farm!! Although a definite climb all the way up, there was a sense of achievement at reaching the summit and taking in",
          "Walking up this hill every second day will be the ebst work out you've ver doen to your body. When you reach the top, You can see wellington and suburbs hidden behind mt kaukau, its a beautiul view and there is a large large platform for viewing purposes. I highly recommend",
          "It was a Mother's Day outing to climb Mt Vic and then Mt Kaukau, this the second held different and magnificent views of Wellington. My first experience of wind turbines and not a negative one, they have their own beauty. I loved the windy arrival at the top and to see many",
          "when I had been there I was luckily plenty of sunshine that day, its one of the best place to visit and must do thing in wellington. Situated next to khandalla park. You need to trek around 45 mins to reach to the top next to the tower. Quite stiff way but once you reached at",

          "This is a great place to go to see 360 degree views of Wellington on a fine sunny day. It is a bit of a hike up the hill and depending on which track you take depends on the difficulty. It is steep in parts and some tracks have steps in places. Most of the tracks start in the",
          "I used to do the walk to the top most weekends when I lived in Wellington. Starting from Khandallah Park (by the open air pool and the cafe), the track is clear but is steep in places. Be prepared for lots of steps! Once you get to the top the views are amazing. On a clear day",
          "Mt Kau Kau is a mountain located north of the city and has a number of different tracks to choose from so you can reach the top and the stunning views of wellington harbour for free. The track I usually take starts in johnsonville and can take about an hour round trip to get to",
          "It's been many years since I trekked up to Mt KauKau, but I'm writing a review anyway, as I regularly used to pack a lunch and head up for a walk on my own, with the family, friends or with our family dog. Visiting recently with my husband, I so wanted to take him up there,",
          "The walk had options of moderate or difficult tracks. The moderate one had some track and some steps with various places to stop and catch your breath while looking out over Wellington city and harbour. At the top ( which takes about 45 mins) is a seating area and a plaque",
          "After a coffee and cake at the cafe at the btm, we were primed for the steep bush track leading up to the barren grassy hilltop where the view of Wellington harbour to the south are astounding.we sat and ate our picnic lunch near the top, in a sheltered spot where the wind din't",

          "We walked up Mt Kaukau one day with our girls aged 8 & 5 from Truscott Avenue, just over 200 steps up but well worth the walk, it took us an hour but stopped lots & explored the tunnel on the way up at the top we were met with fantastic views of Wellington.",
          "Fantastic view on a good day. Walk up it from somewhere a bit less steep than the Khandallah end - nearer Jville there are other entries that are prettier and involve less stairs. A bit hard on the knees.",
          "We did a walk back in March 2013. It took us a while to find the entrance, and then getting confused where to go as the signs were not clear. The trail is considered easy walking. The view on the top is stunning.",
          "We spent 90 minutes doing a circle hike up one side of Mt. Kaukau, and then down the other, starting and ending at Khandallah park. Would recommend this hike to anyone wanting a bit of physical exercise with lovely views over Wellington and surrounding countryside as the",

          "Stunning views of Wellington - an effort to get here but once on top, you will appreciate the effort. Wellington looks much better when you look down from above.",
          "I've been up here twice now, once at night and once in the day. Both view were very nice. I was lucky enough to have a clear, calm, and warm evening looking out. Great walk to bring a cup of tea and enjoy at the top in the evening or bring up a picnic in the day.",
          "I went on a guided summer walk put on by Wellington City Council. WCC put out a brochure of all their walks early December. I figure we hiked up and down every saddle on the Wellington skyline just to get to Mt Kaukau, puff-puff-puff ... Mt Kaukau, itself, was the hardest",

          "Had a nice day exploring the various play areas and lovely walks around Wellington Country Park but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s good value for money. The entry fee is very steep and even my 3 year old had to pay full child price and then all rides like train and jeeps were extra which I",
          "This is my favourite place to bring my granddaughter who is 3 years old. Visited again today, it was dinosaur weekend so very busy, however it is all very well organised and so much space in the park you never feel that you are completely on top of each other. The dinosaurs were",
          "Really good day from start to finish. Staff were excellent with communication, setting up the day and our program. Lots to see and do, one of the cafes not yet open but enough facilities for the children to use the loo etc despite this. Lovely new play area too! Strongly",

          "Visited with a 1y old and a 3y old. Plenty to keep them occupied for the day. Beautiful play areas, nice petting farm, dinosaur trail and small splash pad. Limited food in cafe. Somewhere I would definitely go back to, if it wasnt for the price. Cost \u00a327 for the three of us",
          "We stopped here to break up a car journey from Bristol to London because our youngest is a dinosaur fanatic. The dinosaur tail isn\u2019t very big, but for a 3 year dino fan he could walk around those large models for hours. The rest of the park has plenty to other older kids and our",
          "My girls love going to this park. There\u2019s so many activities to do that we can easily spend 4 or 5 hours here and not get bored.

          "Love it here there is so much for young kids especially to do and we spend hours here they loved it! The splash park was a big hit as was the farm and train ride. I don't think it's expensive at all I've paid double the entrance cost for adults just at local farms and there is",

          "Got young children then this should be on your go to list. It is an excellent place to go for a good day out. The new pirate ship was well liked by our grandchildren. Spent ages just playing there. Was warm enough for them to use the splash area too. A great day",

          "With a young family we have visited \"Welly\" many times over the past few years - it's a great day out for pre-teen children. On arrival you park in clearings in between trees. This can be muddy if the weather has been poor and is also quite uneven. This can make it difficult",
          "We went to this park with a four-year-old and it was great. There were dinosaurs, a sand pit, and fairy doors to find. Not so great if you went with older chidren or just with adults.",
          "I think that the places were good to see, but the prices were too much for not that much. To start with, I think that because you pay such a high price for both adult and child [\u00a311 a child and \u00a312 pound an adult] that everything would be all inclusive like the nearby attraction",
          "It was wet, it was muddy, it was cold. The kids loved it! Lots of free stuff for them to play on, pay extra stuff reasonably priced. If you're going regularly, price up a season ticket, it can save you a fortune.",

          "This is a superb park for young kids, i would definitely recommend visiting. The only thing that i dont like about it, is that i think a train ride and a welly wheels ride should be included in enterance fee. It works out really expensive for a family to first buy entry tickets",
          "Beautiful country park with some nice walks round the lake where you will seee people fishing and lots of different birds if you are a bit of a bird watcher! Activities for children there is an activity area and sometimes they do painting and pottery classes. Food and beverages",

          "Just walk around and enjoy the nature that is so close to the city. I found more nature places around this beautiful town and not just the city centre which is just fine from my point of view. The Oracle area is nice, but that's it. I think it's a nice place to visit but GREAT",
          "We love Wellington! It's so beautiful at any time of the year. There is the petting zoo and various walks of differing length and places to have a picnic. We go there a lot and will continue to do so. The staff Are always helpful and friendly. Many thanks!",

          "Stayed here for 2 nights on the campsite. It was quite simply fabulous !! The pitches are a great size and you can pick your own before you book. Toilets and showers are basic but very clean. What makes this place is the surroundings. Acres of parkland and lots of",
          "A lovely venue and campsite and a great way to spend the weekend. Sadly let down by the lack of facilities on the campsite and too few shower & washbasins, and only one clean a day, for the number of pitches. As a result on a busy bank holiday weekend the toilet and shower block",
          "We went as a group of 6 families camping on site. Camping means you get unlimited entry to the park and out of hours. So (for some) early morning runs, for others after hours scooting and playground with the children really added to the experience and was great value. The",
          "A lovely place to spend the day. You can take children and dogs! Lots of activities to keep children busy and occupied. Plenty of space to walk around. You can take a picnic or have lunch in the caf\u00e9 which has a great menu and good quality food. Children under 10 would be best",
          "So much to do from slides to petting animals... a jumping pillow and a spinning plate. It knackered me out let alone the kids",
          "Had a wonderful day here.. Came with family which included two under two and our dog Charlie. What a find. The kids had a blast and it was awesome being able to take Charlie too. He was even allowed on Arthur the train! For the toddlers they loved the toddler play park, farm",
          "Very good value for money. Lots for children to see and do. Though car park appeared busy once through the entrance it did not appear so busy. With the amount of people there the lack of litter was impressive. Toilets very well maintained and clean. Though what I assume was",
          "Slightly disappointed with the lack of rides. The pantomime was fun for our kids age 6&3, lots of slides & swings ample climbing frames. However considering adults and children pay to get in, surprisingly we still had to pay for the bumper car style experience and the train",
          "We had the pleasure of spending an august day here with a 3 and 7 year old who had a great time. It is \u00a339 for a family to get in and then some rides are extra which is a bit much, good time had by all.",
          "This place is a good family day out in the sun and hot weather. It took us about an hour to walk around and see all the fish and turtles in the water. Lots of places for kids to play and enjoy seeing. Would recommend.",
          "Went in our caravan with 3 children ages 7,9 and 11. Lovely large pitches all secluded very quiet. Only one small shower block and toilets ( 3 showers in ladies) kept reasonably clean. With a pay to use hairdryer. Good outside washing up area. Nothing in actual camping area",
          "We've been to wellington 3 times now & it is by far the best place we've taken our toddler. Really good price in comparison to other similar places. Lovely areas for picnics, fantastic parks (several different ones varying in activities depending on age group), really friendly,",
          "We have have been camping here for 7 years as we love the scenic camping spots and the park is great. We have always camped with kids and were allowed to cycle in the camp area and then in the park after 6pm. This was always one of the highlights. Sadly, cycling is not allowed",
          "Stayed over the wettest weekend in July that I can remember and despite it raining all weekend the campsite was very well kept and cleaned at least 4 times a day, the poor warden was trying his best, I watched a few people walking into toilet block with muddy welly boots and",
          "This campsite is more expensive than others in the area, and the shower and toilet block is very substandard for the price you pay. I have stayed in other campsites that have much nicer blocks. It really is a vital part of a civilised camping weekend to consider the cleaning",
          "We had a family camping weekend at the Campsite over three nights starting on 7/07/2017. Both the Friday and Saturday nights we were disturbed by noisy teenagers with loud music until 2:30am. The campsite rules are quiet after 10:30pm, we won't be booking again!",
          "Not a cheap day out for a young family, however there is lots to do. Don't forget your swimming gear is the weather is nice, as the splash park is great!",
          "we stayed here for one night in our motorhome during the week - it was really empty - but I suspect at the weekends and in the school holidays it would be packed. The toilet block was clean and nice - but only had 3 showers - which i think is a bit limited if the place was full.",
          "We visited on a nice hot sunny day, taking our two granddaughters; 7 and 2. The park is very well laid out and there are so many varied activities for kids of all ages to do. Plenty of toilet facilities and playgrounds galore. We took a picnic and found a nice spot by the lake,",
          "Firstly I was rather disappointed that I couldn't book on line on the day & get the discount. When I asked at the desk I was told it takes 48 hours to process.... The play areas are really good & are plentiful. Disappointed that I had to pay for the train ride I feel this should",
          "We had a lovely day out here meeting some friends halfway between where we live. It cost \u00a332 for a family of three which we thought was great value, the park has tons of areas for children packed in, from play areas, to splash zones to trains and the animal area was fab! My",
          "Great place lots to do we were 3 adults and 2 children ages 3 & 4 very reasonable entry price we loved it ,the kids loved they cud ride there scooters it's all very flat , the train is fun at extra cost but not much - \u00a31-50 I think Splash pool great fun farm petting area was",
          "Not been for many years and went with toddler grand kids I was very very impressed with the attractions, so much added . Every one I saw was a great, thoughtful idea, and well made . Sometimes relatively simple but so well done as to give a great time for youngsters The pillow",
          "Took my 4 year old son out to the park and he loved it. Lots of fun things to do, the park is clean and all the attractions are kept in good condition. We vistited on a Sunday but it didn't feel crowded as there was plenty to do. Would definitely go back for another fun day.",
          "Myself, my partner and his children spent the day here weekend just gone. Well what can i say amazing place to go. The kids had the best time ever. There is so much to do here. The only sad point was that the splash zone was not working but that didnt stop the kids enjoying all",
          "We hadn't visited for at least one year, and surprised to see so many new attractions and improvements. The splash park was very welcome, as well as another new climbing apparatus close by. Park is kept extremely tidy considering the crowds, and we didn't have to queue for",
          "We had a very nice time at the park. The kids loved the splash park and the dinosaurs particularly. The train was also great fun. With the farm animals to see and the walk around the lake we had a full and lovely experience. Thoroughly enjoyable. A fab day!",
          "The kids enjoyed wandering round and climbing on things. They had fun on the bouncy pillow and half of the family went to play mini golf whilst the other half had a coffee in the nearby cafe (that thankfully sells ice creams). There are some great picnic spots that will leave",
          "My family and I had a lovely day out at WCP when the big inflatables were there. There was so much to do with our 6 year old son, he loved the inflatable, parks, dinosaurs, go karts, mini golf and strolling round the lake. It was just lovely. Also, the caf\u00e9 was fantastic,",
          "This park is so big it never feels crowded even when the car park is busy. There are lots of small play areas, perfect for young children. My kids love the sandy areas and the splash park. The new train is great too. The food in the cafe is good, and there are plenty of rain",
          "We have been going here regularly since our boy was very young. It has developed since then and now has an upgraded train and a splash park. A season ticket is good value for us, as we definitely use the park enough. As long as the weather is good we've had a great time. There",
          "I visited Wellington Country Park this weekend, taking my little girl (2.5 years old) and we had the most wonderful day. The whole day was fantastic and my little girl had so much fun and we thought it was a great price, booking online in advance it will only cost \u00a39 per adult",
          "Fab country park, between reading and basingstoke. We live nearby and have an annual pass (\u00a374), as my little one is 2, it works out a cheap day out for us, as under 3s dont pay admission. Theres loads to see and do in this park for toddlers, not so much for older children. They",
          "Quite a nice day out but cost me \u00a330 entrance for me and 2 young children and then had to pay \u00a34.50 extra for the train ride and a further \u00a36 for them to go on the go karts. Park was nice but animal farm was just fine. The gem sifting was a further \u00a33.75. I just felt a bit",
          "I visited with my daughter who is 3 years old and there is plenty to do. The price to get in I think is quite expensive it's only \u00a31 dearer than a child's admission which I think is a bit expensive. The grounds are beautiful and there are a few walks to do which is really nice.",
          "super sunny day when we went along to this park near my parents. After a long walk we sat at the lake and watched the easter events going on around us for the small children. Facilities on site could be better in terms of toilets |(not enough) but otherwise a lovely place to",
          "Went here with my whole family, age ranges 1-77, for my grandsons 1st birthday party. My daughter hired a private area which came with picnic tables, barbecues and a tables for laying out food under a large gazebo/tent structure. This meant we had our own space and a safe place",
          "A visit by 3 generations with the youngest being our 3 Year old grandson who had a fantastic time. Catering for children the park is very good and it is great watching the youngsters enjoying themselves on the facilities. The park is well thought out and offers good value for",
          "We paid \u00a311.00 each for my wife and I and \u00a310.00 for my Grandson aged 5 for entry to the park, ie. \u00a332.00. The restaurant was ok with reasonable food. There is plenty of walking to do with play areas for small children. However unlike many other Parks that charge a fee for entry",
          "Beautiful setting with its own lake. Nice different areas, including an outdoor play area, train, small farm, dinosaur walk and splash pad. There's enough to do, but a bit pricey overall. Have been several times but usually when I haven't had to pay due to children's classes",
          "We've visited all of the family parks / farm parks in the Reading/Newbury area over the years and Wellington is our favourite. We like how spacious it is and our kids love the playgrounds, dinosaur park etc. We've just come to the end of our season pass which was really good",
          "We caravaned over Easter. The park is fantastic with stunning woodland around the lake. The pitches are generous with some seclusion afforded by the woodland location The pitch price includes admission to the park. Some minor grumbles. Although the price is reasonable (but not",
          "This is our second visit to Wellington Park because it half way between family homes and an easy place to move around. The kids love it but I imagine teens would quickly become bored. The activities are perfect for young children and there was a magic show during our visit.",
          "I am lucky enough to live locally to Wellie Park & therefore invested in an adult annual pass \u00a369, which includes 3 free train rides (normally \u00a31-50), 5 free regular coffees & 3 passes for another person. My son is not yet 3, so he goes free. Normal admission would be \u00a311 for",
          "It was our first time camping and the part if the campsite we were on we were the only tent, in amongst caravans and motorhomes, which felt rather odd as there were plenty if other tents around other areas. Open access to the park before and after opening times was nice buy I",
          "We have a one year old so it restricted us to what we could do. However our daughter loved the farm and the ability to get close to the farm animals. The play areas were really good apart from the indoor soft play. This was very average and freezing cold. Also what was with the",
          "Well, the park was a nice day out for children but it seemed focused on preschoolers. I went there with a 9 and 12 year old who had plenty to do but felt too old. The splash park and the indoor play area were definitely aimed at younger children. I don't think they were too old",
          "Had a wonderful day here with our Granddaughter and oldest son . Lots of nice walks and fun things to do . The Dinosaurs were very authentic and well made . The enchanted forest was really good but could I suggest just one thing to be added which our Granddaughter was hoping to",
          "We visited the park on the weekend. It is huge with lots of playground. The dinosour trail is interesting and the animal farm too. 1 mini golf game included and jumping pillow but if you want to take the train (and of course every child wants ) you have to pay for it,, Also you",
          "We go each year with a group of friends of mixed camping experience and enthusiasm. We go there because the facilities are good, good private camping spots where if we book early enough we can be together. The children can be free and go off and play in the park which easily",
          "So starting with the negative it was cold cold cold and we should never have gone this early (31st March) but that made the facilities i.e. Shower/toilet block even nicer as they are heated! On a practical note it is well worth investing in some super strong tent pegs designed",
          "My family and I had a fantastic day with our three year old grandson.. entrance fee is a bit high but the attractions ,rides are awesome. Lots to do and next time we shall have a full on barbecue and picnic.",
          "Lovely place to wander around and enjoy the surroundings. The views were great and we got some lovely pictures.",
          "Travelled half an hour to go on a nice walk in the sunshine and saw the entry price of \u00a311. Jaw dropped. How can you justify \u00a311 to walk round a lake with a couple of swings????!!!",
          "We go here often with our young grandchildren. There are lots of things to do. Several play areas to suit all ages. Separate areas for young children so they are not bothered by older children enjoying themselves. There is also a small farm where at certain times of the day",
          "This is a really great day out. Mainly suitable for 3 years plus but still a great day nonetheless. Pack a picnic and a picnic blanket and you are set for a full day there (unless you little one gets tired beforehand). The facilities are good. Ample toilet and baby changing",
          "Had a lovely time here today with our granddaughter. Will be better when she is 3 or 4 rather than 1. Not much open in March though. Plenty of work going on in preparation for the summer season. Quite expensive for a visit at this time of the year. Advice would be summer visit",
          "As it's local to us, we've been many times. Ideal for younger children with plenty of play areas, sandpits galore, bouncy pillow, a lovely little train ride and a small and clean child friendly farm at the end! The setting is beautiful on a sunny day, the lake is serene with",
          "I got an annual pass for myself as my 2 year old daughter goes free. I will really be looking forward to going again in the summertime. The annual pass also allows for 5 free drinks and 3 free adult passes so my partner can come along sometimes too. I went in March and it was",
          "Came with baby grandson and daughter. Lovely warm day. Expensive coffee and cake in cafe. Had a lovely walk around the lake. Shame that the timing of the refurbishment of the railway coincided with half term. No concessions for senior citizens.",
          "Wellington Country Park has plenty to do with the family. There are many play grounds. Walks along the lake and trails through the woods. There is a small animal petting farm at the rear. It has a shop and cafe located at the entrance/exit. There are small children's go-karts",
          "Enjoyable family day out. Lots of green areas and a park or 2. Has events on. A picnic must. My kids enjoy the big slides.",
          "An enjoyable place to spend a day doing the more simple things of life with the kids, like walking, boating on the lake, woodland trails and alike. It's quite expensive so plan for a full day & take things to do, like a frisbee.",
          "A lovely setting, beautiful surroundings, nice playground for the children but I found it really expensive considering that there isn't a lot of activities available for children. There is an adventure playground but that really isn't suitable for young children . A beautiful",
          "Lovely place to visit on a good day. Plenty of exercise with a great walk round the lake. Bird spotting. Good play area for the children. There's also food available, ice creams and gift shop",
          "It's great for a day out with primary and KS1 age. Lots of walking. Not many places to hide or not much to do if it is raining. Nice but expensive, so go on a day when children get in cheaper.",
          "Ive been twice, I find it a bit pricey for what it is although its a nice place with quite a bit for the kids to do. When friends suggest meeting up there I tend to now suggest someware else as I don't see it as value for money.",

          "Good place to relax for parents and good for children to explore. It is expensive and more offers should be made available. Children under 5 years old should not be paying the entrance.",
          "It's not cheap but a really good day our for children up to about 8 I would say. Little train ride, walks, park, farm where you can feed the animals, big lake to walk around, model dinosaurs etc etc! We think it's great and live close by so a family membership is definitely",
          "Had a fantastic family day at this place. enjoyed a picnic and tea with the kids. We had excellent weather so very very good place.",
          "Went as a family with grandparents, parents and a toddler. So much to do for all ages. We enjoyed a walk round the lake and then into the woodland where we saw lots of deer. The toddlers soft play and outdoor play area were brilliant. We had a picnic for lunch and tea in the",

          "Really great day out with my 20month old son and my friends 3yr old and 6month old. So much to do for lots of ages. Lovely open space and beautiful lake in the sunshine. Whilst I agree that it is slightly cheeky to ask for more money for optional extras, at \u00a38 per adult and",
          "Nice day out in the open air but \u00a336 entry for me and three kids and then more once in there. Decent playgrounds (free). Kids like the train but it's \u00a31.50 each (you used to get one ride free with entry, not any more). Animal feed \u00a31 for a tiny bag, make sure you buy it on entry",
          "The park itself is lovely, and great for little kids. What let,s this place down is the catering. It reminded us of Butlins in the 1970s. A very limited and unhealthy menu, ran by teenagers, and your food is brought out one plate at a time. Really awful. At the end of the",
          "We bought our annual pass about nine months ago and not a week goes by where we don't benefit. My wife and two children (2,5) love it. Most weekend we will spend an hour or so wandering around the lake. The kids can play on the equipment or walk around the farm and rain or shine",

          "We used to take our boys here when they were young as it was close to home and cheap. Based on this we decided to take our 2 year old grandson and boy has it changed! They have added loads more for kids to do and see and the entrance fee hasn't changed....how do they do it??",
          "Visited on a weekday in September (when schools had gone back). The weather was great so it was surprisingly (luckily!) not very busy. Entrance fee is reasonably priced for a day of fun. There's are animals to feed, lots of play areas, dinosaurs to hunt, slides, waterplay,",

          "A few things to do however ...I found with my well behaved teens it was just as good taking a picnic to beach or to a forest or rIver as realistically there was nothing fpr them. For tiny tot mum meetings or suchave like it's great. But solve they stopped fireworks display",

          "Lovely day out with the family. Lots of play areas, train, bouncy pillow, mini zoo and dinosaurs... What more could you want!?",
          "Visited here with some friends recently and discovered a real treat for adults and children alike, you can escape from everything around the lakes, or play with the children, enjoy the wildlife and animals, ride on the mini train, etc or just relax with a coffee. Very well run",
          "Plenty to see and do but a bit expensive for a family day out. This area is beautiful and plenty to keep you occupied for a day",
          "Worth going to the annual music event 'Marvellous' - been a few times & had gazebo pitch & picnic. Such fun. Tribute bands are fun and there is food / drink & entertainment for kids. Also been to the annual firework display. Recommended.",
          "We visited with our 3 boys (9, 7 and 5 years old) and have been many times before. There is so much to do and the entrance fee is worthwhile as it is definitely a place that you can spend the whole day. There are additional costs for rides although the bouncing pillow (for",
          "Went here with grandchildren. Entry price was reasonable but virtually every ride cost extra which soon mounts up over the day. Some of the facilities are looking a bit dated but kids seem to enjoy the open space and variety. I thought that only letting the kids have a couple of",
          "Great day. Fantastic place and spent all day. Train ride is great with friendly driver, the play areas are great for little ones and the dinosaurs add a different dimension. Farm was good but quite small. Would be great if they could do handling if small animals. Love that the",
          "Great country park if you've got young kids. place is a bit dated now not changed since I was really small. Still worth a visit. Big fishing lake too. However don't bother taking a teenager who hates the outdoors. No wifi, not much 3G signal. Expect moods!",
          "Loads, to do for young children and can easily spend a while day here. Can't complain at \u00a320 for two adults and an under 2 for a whole day out with kiddy toys, sand pits, rides, slides, swings, animals, soft play and lots of space to walk/ run and play/ picnic. Loved it so much",
          "We really enjoy coming here, but I was slightly disappointed by the ticket price as I think it is a bit too much to pay \u00a38.50 or so for 2 years old toddlers. Also I would expect more animals. Apart from that our kids really enjoyed day out here.",
          "We took a picnic and got there early, very welcoming staff. Nice to play golf without being charged any extra. We were actually pleased that the train wasn't working that day as it would have cost us a lot more. The children loved all the play parks, golf, farm, sand pits but",
          "we stayed on this lovely campsite for just under 3 weeks. in the heart of this beautiful forest, the site was peaceful, well maintained & right in the middle of nature at its best. the country park itself is packed with lots of play equipment & activities, set amongst stunning",
          "My husband and I were travelling to reading and hoping to find entertainment for the children (age 12, 8 and 7) for few hours before travelling to Kent to camp overnight. On arrival, it was welcoming and obviously suited to children (more suited to the younger ones....but 12",
          "Nice, well kept and clean park but hefty price tag in my opinion and of course your kids will want to go on th electric quad bikes at \u00a33pp, and the train ride at \u00a31.50pp and a few other bits within that cost on top. The walk round the lake is easy and the path quite narrow in",
          "Medium sized park with petting zoo and various childrens attractions. We went at Easter when they featured a Circus, which was very good and a kids craft zone. A good walk around the park with a dinosaur area, toddler area, adventure playground, train and sandpits. All in all a",
          "This is a good, well laid-out park with some good attractions for younger kids. It is murphy's law, or an excellent business plan, that all my 6-year old son wanted to go on was the go-karts and the train, both of which you have to pay extra for! We went on Easter Saturday and",
          "We had a lovely time at the Easter Egg Hunt on Sunday at Wellington Country. It was so busy with a lovely",
          "I hadnt been here for a few years but went with extended family today who were visiting from Devon. Though it is a lovely place,I felt it was the best value for money in the area. It worked out just under \u00a39 per head as we got a family ticket. However train rides \u00a31.50",
          "We have a five year old son and camped over the Easter weekend in a tent. It is a lovely camp site in a nice setting. The facilities were clean and there was always hot water. The night time curfew of 10:30 seemed to work well and was not too noisy at all. We will definitely be",
          "All ages catered for. Family fun. Good circus. Crazy golf. All inclusive. Also small train for extra charge",
          "... And it was not expensive compared to other family friendly parks. That was my first impression when I paid at the entrance. Free parking with plenty of spaces (off season). High season I can guess it gets very busy. The staff seems very young however they are attentive and",
          "Visited today with my husband and our dog while on a day trip to Hampshire. Felt it little pricey to get into, however we enjoyed the various trails through woodland and around the lake with our dog. We could appreciate all the available activities if one had young children to",
          "Went here to look at the animal farm (located right at the very very back!!!), there was only a few animals there (goats, pigs, rabbits etc), so it didn't take much time to look around. It was nice to walk around the park area though. Quite pricey for what it is too.",
          "The park is good for a nice long walk if the weather is nice and there are playgrounds for the kids. Small sit on train as well. Other than that there is little else to do. Not enough for a full day out",
          "We went with two of our young grandchildren... we only had 2 hours available but wished we could have stayed longer, but would have run out of energy long before they did! Having paid \u00a37:50 each for 2 pensioners and \u00a36 :50 each for 2 children we felt rather ripped off to have to",
          "This is a great place to go with kids. There are lots of good play areas, and the whole place is set in beautiful countryside. Highly recommended.",
          "It was a lovely sunny day and as my daughter, granddaughters and I all have annual passes we headed to Wellington Country Park. Although it is very popular in school holidays the park never feels crowded and children find the different play areas entertaining. We had to go, as",
          "Two adults and a very active 1 year old visited the park and we could have stayed the whole weekend as the park is so big. Plenty to do and see. The miniature train ride was an inexpensive treat which we all enjoyed and the farm animals were a big hit! They even get some of the",
          "Went for the first time not really knowing what to expect but this is brilliant. There is a big loop so you just keep moving on from one area to the next when the little ones get bored. Plenty for a full day and things for all ages. Also a decent cafe with a play area so you",
          "For one week in August we look after our four grandsons (ages 10, 8, 8 and 6) and this is always on their itinerary. Good range of activities, most of which suit their age span. Can't see it going out of favour in the near future either.",
          "So much to do for all ages, our little boy is almost 2 and loves dinosaurs so the dinosaur wood was wonderful! Lovely and clean and so worth the entrance fee. Lovely outdoor wholesome fun! Just go!",
          "We ( 3 adults and a 6 year old girl) had a fantastic time in November. There are a very good variety of activities.. There are so many I think people forget how many there are. We particularly love the crazy golf course, the petting farm, the zip wire, the HUGE slide and when",
          "Apart from in the entrance/exit restaurant and associated lavatories, cold water, neither bottled nor tap, was available, and we all got thirsty going around the extensive site.",
          "Went to view as was going for a weekend break but were very disappointed, very tired, woodlands need tidying up big style prices a bit on the pricy side, most staff nice, ok for very young children though.",
          "Beautiful park with plenty to do. Great little petting zoo. Interesting walks. Little train. Fab, varied play areas. Great time had by all on a regular basis,mug never gets boring.",
          "We were lucky with a bright sunny day in November for 4 adults, a 4 and 6 year old. Good variety of activities, but generally a bit tired, needing updating such as swings in the Adventure Park. The whole park needed a few more activity areas to fill the day. The enchanted wood",
          "It's a lovely place to go with the family,but I think it's expensive for adults. The weather was quite pleasant when we went but it had rained that morning so I wish we'd taken our wellies! The staff were friendly and helpful especially the young girl at the animal farm and",
          "Wellington Country Park is a lovely family place to go. Today we were there for the Halloween experience with friends. We decided to take our toddlers on the little train. The man looking after this area was dressed up as Dracula! Got on the train, he was trying to make jokes,",
          "Have just returned from Wellington Country Park. Went there with my daughter and 3 grandchildren aged 12, 4 and 1. We had a very enjoyable visit with so much for the children to do. We didn't get there till mid day and next time will get there early so we spend a whole day",
          "Good for a day out particularly for the little ones. If the weather's right it's great place for camping with all the facilities you could want.",
          "Having just bought a trailer tent we decided to try it out close to some of our grand children, we found on the Internet this camping site. The last time we tried out a U/K camp site it was unbelievably awefull, so finding this one inspired us to try again. All I can say is wow!",
          "I remember going here when I was a kid and I loved it, so recently I suggested taking a day trip there being able to take the dog with us. It is fairly expensive to get in, and the gift shop isn't as impressive as I remembered, but it is pretty and we had a nice walk around the",
          "We have visited Wellyboot Park (as our 4 year old grandson insists upon calling it!) several times this summer. Having read other reviewers comments, a few we agree with and most that we do not. This is our perspective \u2013 Yes, the initial cost of entry is high, particularly for",
          "I stayed here for 3 days with my little boy in a tent and we had a great time. We were based in the tent field and we had no problems with hard ground but I could see other pitches that looked rather hard and not used very much - maybe only used when the park is fully used, not",
          "Love this place! Great fun for little ones (my children are 3 and 7) - lots of space to run around and have a picnic. Very safe. The kids love the jumping pillow and the woodland play area. Not expensive to get in and you can easily spend a full day here.",
          "We camped for two nights with friends, 4 adults, 4 kids (all 6 and under). Good camping, facilities are basic but okay for short stay. Pitches are well separated. Bonus is that entrance to the park is included and we were there for the family fun weekend, a great weekend had by",
          "Stayed here for two nights. Nice and clean (except for showers) but could have more for adults! Good park for kids though. Should have quiet pitches as neighbour was moaning that the kids were making to much noise even though they were not. Easily solved by having quiet pitches",
          "We had a family day out consisting of 6 adults and 2 toddlers (a ratio that is needed). We luckily had amazing weather so all attractions were open and running meaning that there was lots to do and you get your entrance fee worth of time at the park. We took a pack lunch,",
          "During a weekend in August myself and a few of my friends were camping at Wellington country park and it definatly didn't have the customer friendly enviroment it likes to think it has on the web site. When we first arived at the park there were next to no signs stating where",
          "Our experience here started very badly by having no guidance by staff as to where we would find our designated camp area, and then as we was driving around lost in the campsite we was confronted by the \"warden\" who has possibly the worst customer service skills that I have ever",
          "The first time i went here i thought it was expensive and a bit underwhelming. Then i had children and i quite literally love this place. I think it is a bit much for a day trip. But as i have the season ticket i go all year long. I love it. So much to keep my daughter",
          "A beautiful and relaxing place to go walking and relax. The paths are well signposted and parking is easy",
          "Visited on the way back from London to Southampton. Not very good value for money. Entry fee is quite high for what is actually on offer. There are plenty of other country parks that don't charge an entrance fee. This was fairly average. There are additional charges for the",
          "we stayed here for a few days this week (4 nights/5 days) the camp site is fantastic, great pitches and really well organised, its very clean and although lots of tents and caravans the place didnt feel busy at all. - assess to the park is included in the stay and its great to",
          "I'm sorry but I don't believe nearly \u00a330 for 2 adults and a 5 year old is great, there's literally nothing to do for adults so why do we have to pay nearly \u00a310 each in high season. As for the kids, well I could have taken my child to any playground for free. Plus You have to pay",
          "All we can say is fantastic value for money, grandchildren had a awesome day will go back, as there is so much to do walks are great, and the dinosaurs well you have to see them",
          "We had a great day out.....Really good for family picnic, worth visiting. Dinosaurs were the main attraction for our son, he absolutely loved it.",
          "We visited with grandchildren and had a full day exploring all that Wellington Country Park has to offer. Would be most suitable for children under 10 years. Lots of different playground areas and plenty of space. Good provision for picnics including an under cover area.",
          "We visited the park on a Monday during the school holidays. On arrival the car park was almost full which started alarm bells ringing. The park was busy but you never felt crowded, the were plenty of visitors but lots of things to do with items spread out enough that you",
          "Place and the walk are too good but there were not many animals outside to view. Canteen facility is available and free car parking available.",
          "Our party consisted of myself, my daughter and her children of 10 and 6 years old. It cost just over \u00a333.00 to get in and my ticket was a ' seniors' with a generous 50p discount. The park is very attractive and well laid out with lots to do for children but more so for the",
          "Took a friend from Japan and her six year old son to this venue 3/8/2014. It was themed to be a pirates day and those swashbuckling pirates were in evidence as soon as we reached the payment tills to gain admission. \u00a39-50 for adults and \u00a38-50 for the child which added up to a",
          "Average park, nice lakes, good climbing frame but \u00a342 for a family of 5 - lots of free places that are just as good.",
          "Visited here with my three year old at the start of August when they had a pirate themed day. My son absolutely loved the whole day. There are lots of play parks and things to keep small children entertained and he loved the animal park as well. Would recommend you take your own",
          "Plenty of space, lots of play areas. Lovely little farm, great train ride but you have to pay, (kids only) nice cafe & gift shop. Great day out!",

          "We visited Wellington Country Park over the weekend for the second time with family including our 4 year old daughter, we had a lovely day, the park is clean and tidy and the staff are very enthusiastic about their jobs and ever so friendly. There was a fairy and pixie event",
          "We live close to Wellington Country park so we have visited several times. The last time we visited there were heavy downpours of rain for most of the day but we embraced it and all of the children, 3 under 4, all had a great time exploring the dinosaurs and play areas. We had",
          "There is very little to recommend this venue. It is expensive to enter but really nothing to see except a badly stocked souvenir shop - mostly cheap imported trash, a sunken blue tractor (which was our granddaughter most loved attraction) and a small gauge train (not even steam)",
          "Had not been here for at least 20 years and took my kids here today. Park has plenty to offer kids. Lots of outdoor activities set in beautiful country side.Prices were reasonable and staff seemed very friendly. If you want to get your kids to burn off some energy this is a",
          "We regularly go here with a big group of friends, with young children. The camp site is well designed for big groups and often has a number staying. There are also more secluded pitches. Having free access to the park is brilliant and a real draw for us. The only downside",
          "This is a great place to go with young children. My 2 year old son loved the dinosaur walk and the small train and enjoyed playing in the sandpit and in the outdoor play areas. With lots of space to run around with his friends and have a picnic. A fantastic location with so much",
          "Excellent park though gets really busy on weekends or holiday times. I prefer it during weekdays during termtime. Have a toddler who loves the playgrounds, softplay, train & petting farm. Recommend taking a picnic as cafe food isn't too exciting & bit pricey for what it",
          "I took my godsons here (3 and 5) and we were kept busy all day. There's a great range of activities and play areas for kids of all ages, the boys particularly liked the giant 'jumping pillow', sandpit and most of all, the dinosaur area which we visited twice. The park is a",
          "I live very close to Wellington Country Park and have visited on a couple of occasions. I always feel like the price paid is excessive for a family of four for a single visit. The pricing seems geared up to encouraging annual passes for locals to buy rather than encouraging",
          "Just came back from my 2nd visit to Wellington country park and overall I had a good day, helped mostly by the weather. We arranged to meet some other members of my family and in total there were 7 adults and 5 children. The children were 2, 7, 9, 12 & 14 so mixed ages. We took",
          "I met two friends both with young children at this park today. Between the 3 of us we have 9 children age 5 and under. We had a wonderful day fun packed day from 10.30 till 5pm. We went on the train, walked round the lake, visited the farm and used the many play areas, the",
          "We had a caravan rally in the Deer park. What a relaxing weekend, stalking deer (for photos...) listening to Cuckoos and Pheasants before heading into the park proper. Entrance was included with the camping and the entertainment laid on was great - we particularly enjoyed the",
          "Good place for boisterous boys to let off steam although not cheap to get in. The mini golf is included but the little cars and train are extra. The bouncy cushion is brilliant and the boys stayed on there for ages. The cafe is reasonable with a good selection for children.",
          "Went here today on the bank holiday Monday as annually Wellington Country Park host a family circus. Once again had a great day out. Lots of activities to do, and the circus show was great. Enjoying all the talented performers, and getting involved in the fun that the circus",
          "We started our trip by entering the post code into the satnav only for us to end up traveling some convoluted route to the back end of the park. We were not the only ones as evidenced by several other MPV drivers with perplexed looks on their faces. It would have been sensible",
          "Had a lovely day at the park with the children but I feel it's very overpriced for the amount there is to do. There are are a few playgrounds, bouncy pillow, sandpits and dinosaurs to look plus picnic areas but it misses a main attraction to justify the price. As it's Easter",
          "We love this place.. so much to do for younger kids, and an event calendar that is packed full of diverse and fun things\u2026 we became members after our first visit and go frequently now.. worth traveling too\u2026",
          "There seems to be a lot of people a little put off by the entrance fee for the park, I would recommend picking your days out wisely, we went a few days ago and there was the crazy bikes to play on as an added bonus, our two were on them for hours and it was great entertainment",
          "My partner and I stayed here in July 2013 in our camper van. We love the outdoors and just wanted a couple of days of picnics and cream teas. We visited to view the pitches before hand - staff allowing us access to the campsite for as long as we wanted without charge,",
          "went back many years after my children where young they are all now in there 40s the price to get in now is realy over priced I think when we used to go it was free.a lot of money if you have a large family so we were all disappointed after taking our grandchildren there for",
          "We had an enjoyable day there but the pricing is way too high for what you get. \u00a330 for an adult and 2 kids and you have to pay an extra \u00a31.50 for the train and \u00a33 for 2 laps on the electric cars. Really does feel a bit cynical. Beale Park or Bucklebury Farm Park are better",
          "We were very impressed by WCP. It's big, peaceful nicely kept grounds. You can walk around the lakes and you see people fishing having picnics. Food in the cafe can be considered overpriced (jacket potato \u00a35.85), and the entrance fee \u00a39.50, but I think it worths it, we will be",
          "Been here a couple of times when friends have visited who have children. It's okay, you can pass a couple of hours or perhaps longer if you take a picnic in summer. The children enjoyed seeing the animals but were disappointed the show and tell talk session they advertised",
          "OMG I really cannot stress enough what a total RIP OFF this place is!!!! Please, honestly, take your kids to your local park, there really is no difference, except how much money you will save!!!! I am so annoyed at how they can actually charge \u00a37.50 for adults - \u00a36.50 for",
          "The boys had a lovely day with friends,we took our own picnic so cant comment on the food. Good toilet facilities, may look at a season ticket seeing that its so close",
          "Had a wonderful day at Wellington Country Park even though the weather was terrible the park was great as we were with children from 4 to 15 there were still lots to do. The space arts and craft centre was fab staff helpful and cheerful nothing was to much trouble. Had a lovely",
          "This is a beautiful park, they keep expanding it and now have a dinosaur forest, more play areas for children of all ages, a great soft play area for babies, ride on quad bikes, a little train and lots more. We bought a session ticket now we have a baby and have used it so much",
          "I love the outdoors and try to visit the park as often a i possibly can. Although i do feel the entry fee is rather extrotionate. i do wish they would lower the entry fee, they would attract many more customers of they did.",
          "it was a few years ago we went to wellington park, lots of grass and wood land to walk ,also there was a model railway to ride on ,and a small caf\u00e9.",
          "Yes theres lots to do, but the entry fee is not justified.We have visited a couple of times, as friends have arranged to meet there. We always feel a bit ripped off!",
          "It is a lovely big area to play ball games and go for a walk or just relax. But I do feel it is expensive for a big open area where there isn't that much to do.",
          "This place is well worth visiting. Great things to do yet never feels too busy. Great events for children which are included in the admission cost. We love the place.",
          "WCP is a really good day out for young kids. It's a fairly large and very beautiful country park with lots of different play areas including sand pits, slides, wooden houses, animal petting centre, toddler area and crazy golf. You can take a picnic and there's even some brick",
          "We had a great time today - there were lots of activities for the children plus plenty to See & do - we particularly enjoyed the crazy golf & adventure play park. The staff were brilliant, all had a smile on their face & were happy to help - they all seemed to really enjoy",
          "We stayed here recently on the campsite with friends. The campsite is incredibly cleverly arranged so, although busy, it appears that one is camped in the middle of the forest. Access roads are good & well maintained and the security procedures are a good feature & well",
          "Really enjoyed a few hours - lots of space plenty to do and well worth a visit. The kids loved the attractions but the staff should be more aware that some kids are to big for some of the attractions and this can be dangerous the big pillow area. Apart from that a great day.",
          "We stayed at the campsite in a quiet weekend in September and I have to say this is probably the best campsite we have ever stayed at. It is pricey as park entry is included but the woodland setting makes it very worthwhile. We don't use electric bur camped with family in a",

          "Wowee. Taken here by family, this park has it all. Farm, dinosaurs, train ride, excellent play parks, bouncing cushions. And all well looked after and clean. Highly recommend. Go go a whole day to get the most from the admission price.",
          "We went to the park today having driven past on numerous occasions when travelling on business and often thought that looks interesting. It's fair to say my troop had a brilliant time. Our little family includes a 22 month old and a 4 1/2 and they both had a stupendous time. We",

          "Stayed for 3 nights from Mon 5 - Thursday 8 August 2013. A lovely campsite set into the forset with great individual pitches with electric hook up. Been to many sites before which are over crowded for this time of year however this is so big you are not really bothered by others",
          "We have just returned from a fantastic 3 day camping holiday at Wellington Country park. The campsite was beautifully maintained, with friendly and helpful staff. Set in amongst the forest, our pitch was private (I recommend the electrical hook up areas for added privacy) and",
          "Fab place to take my 3 & 4 year old granddaughters they loved it plenty to do and see, loved the way you walked through woods and found the dinosaurs or real deer. The animal farm bit was beautiful and the animals all looked very well cared for, only criticism would be the food",

          "In all, I've always loved visiting 'welly' but following my most recent visit, I actually thought about the cost of the place compared to others in the area and realised that actually it is a little overpriced for what it is. It cost me \u00a325 to enter, \u00a34.50 for a train ride",
          "Not a satisfying day out. There is not enough entertainment (you can find green and woodland areas in Berkshire without the exorbitant entrance fees). The crazy golf was non-existent, the only plus was a zip wire for the young lad we had with us!",
          "If you want a chilled out day with young members of the family then look no further than this venue. A new crazy golf course is opening soon but there is plenty to do for the young members of the family and a must for grandparents looking for a good day out with the",
          "Great place for a perfect summer saturday. Beautiful walks and if you are taking a football or a frisbee, the best place to be. There are also tons for kids. There's also a small train which the little ones will love. Good facilities . If booked ahead theres loads of stuff -face",
          "I camped a the counrty park for the Marvellous festival 2013. The staff at the park were very welcoming and helpful. The facilities are kept very clean and tidy. I had a very pleasant stay at the park and would recomend the electric pitches as the best choice. The park",
          "'Welly Park' is an excellent day out for adults and children. Beautiful setting with large lake, childrens playground - and some great fun tree houses for them too. It's a lovely walk all the way round the lake - and there is also a small animals enclosure, with pigs, sheep,",
          "This is a lovely park with loads to do and plenty of space to do it in. From crazy golf to nature trails, from train ride to farm animals, fitness trail to play areas for all ages, this makes a lovely day out. Take a picnic and then top up with ice cream from one of the vendors.",
          "We have been taking our four grandsons here for a day out during school holidays for the past three years and it's on their wish list for this August, too. Plenty for them to do and something for all ages - ours are 9, 7, 7 and 5 - as ageing grandparents it's a stress free",
          "I was taken here by my other half on a whim for a day out, and it was lovely, beautifully kept, and with lots of activities, mainly for children though. There were lots of different areas, even areas set up where you could bring your own BBQ and lots of picnic space. Next time",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Khandallah is a suburb of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand. It is located 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) northeast of the city centre, on hills overlooking Wellington Harbour.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe northeastern part of the suburb is dominated by a large area of parkland, which stretches north towards Johnsonville. Three parks that make up this reserve land total almost 2 km2 (0.77 sq mi) of the slopes of Mount Kaukau. The summit of this 445-metre (1,460 ft) peak, which is topped by Wellington's main television transmitter tower, provides impressive views of the harbour. Khandallah has a reputation for being one of the most affluent of Wellington's suburbs; one of the \"Three Ks\" with Karori and Kelburn.\nThe Khandallah village shopping centre in Ganges Road has a supermarket, restaurant, dairy (convenience store) and a pub as well as the Library and Town Hall. Here nineteen new shops opened in the 1920s, overtaking the original shops around the railway station.Box Hill was named after a sentry post that was established during the \"M\u0101ori Scare\" of 1846, near the present Anglican Church; see Old Porirua Road. \n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Library ===\nKhandallah library was opened in 1953 in the middle of Khandallah village on Ganges road, after a 1947 petition by local writer Fanny Irvine-Smith. The library serves an average of 1600 customers a week.  The Greater Wellington Regional Council local rain gauge is located here.\n\n\n=== Town hall ===\nThe Khandallah town hall has a capacity of over 350 people, including 140 seats and 20 tables and has a stage, kitchen and gallery. It was built in 1912 as the Khandallah Public Hall.\n\n\n=== Recreation Centre and park ===\nNairnville Recreation Centre features a multi-purpose sports hall suitable for basketball, netball, volleyball, and badminton. A squash court is available for hire and an upstairs community room with kitchen facilities.Nairnville park features sports fields that are used for football, rugby and cricket. An artificial turf was added in March 2009. The park also includes a children's playground, cricket training nets and a skateboard half pipe.Nairnville park and recreation center are named after James and Louisa Nairn who owned farm land in the area.\n\n\n=== Swimming pool ===\nKhandallah summer pool is a 30-meter non-heated outdoor summer pool at the end of Woodmancote Road; No 45.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe suburb is served by the Johnsonville Branch commuter railway which connects it to the central city and surrounding suburbs. It has three railway stations; Khandallah, Box Hill and Simla Crescent. Parts of the suburb nearer the harbour and some distance from the stations are served by several Metlink bus routes: number 43 and 44 Khandallah - Strathmore (Blue Route) buses and number 45 Khandallah via Ngaio.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== School enrolment zones ===\nKhandallah is within the enrolment zones for Wellington Girls' College, Onslow College, Raroa Normal Intermediate and St Oran's College.\n\n\n=== Primary schools ===\nKhandallah has three primary schools.\nCashmere Avenue School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 6 students, with a roll of 307 as of March 2020.Khandallah School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 6 students, with a roll of 371. The school is on Clark St and the site was first occupied by a school in January 1893.St Benedict's School is a co-educational state-integrated Catholic primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of 273. The school is on Nicholson Road and was opened in 1952 by Archbishop Peter Cardinal McKeefry. The school was integrated with the state school system in 1981.\n\n\n== History ==\nKhandallah is named after Khandela, Rajasthan, or may be Khandala and supposedly means \"Resting place of God\" in an unspecified language. Hence the suburb and those surrounding it have many place names connected with the Indian subcontinent; e.g. Calcutta Street and Simla Crescent.\nThe name may have come from a homestead built in the area in 1884 by Captain James Andrew, who had recently returned from duty in India and had been consul in Baghdad.   When the railway was laid through the area by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, Andrew is reported as insisting that the railway station be named Khandallah with the h on the end of the name, and reportedly gave land for the Khandallah station provided all trains stop there.However, Edward Battersbee (also spelt Battersby) was listed in the 1864-1865 Province of Wellington electoral roll as living at Khandallah, Porirua Road on 23 April 1864 some 20 years earlier than Andrew. In addition Battersby had worked for the East India Company as a veterinary surgeon in the Bombay Light Cavalry, thereby making him the more likely originator of the suburb's name. In January 1868 Battersbee placed his 450-acre property, named in the advertisement as Khrandalah, on the market for sale.Another settler from the British Indian Army was Captain Charles Sharp of the Bombay Native Infantry who lived elsewhere but bought land around the Khandallah railway station and let it to sheep farmer Captain John Kirwan. In 1894 Robert Hanna bought it for subdivision.When the formation of the Borough of Onslow was proposed in 1889, Khandallah was already described as a District, and was a part of the Onslow Borough until it amalgamated (merged) with Wellington in 1919.Khandallah was largely farmland to the 1920s; James Nairn built a farmhouse in 1869 on the old Ngatoto Native Reserve, now Nairnville Park. The opening of the railway to Wellington in 1886 (now the Johnsonville Branch) enabled people to commute into Wellington, and the line was electrified with more frequent and faster trains in 1938. The population of Khandallah increased from 766 in 1916 to 2,498 in 1938.Access was originally via the Old Porirua Road until new access roads opened; Onslow Road down to the Hutt Road in the 1920s and Burma Road to Johnsonville (superseding Fraser Avenue) in 1936.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBremner, Julie (1983).

        "wiki": "Kelburn is a central suburb of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand, situated within 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) of the central business district.\nKelburn sits on the hills just west of the capital's central business district and is bordered by the Botanic Garden and the suburbs of Thorndon and Northland to the north, the suburbs of Karori and Highbury to the south west, and Aro Valley to the south.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe iconic Wellington Cable Car is a tourist attraction and public transport facility. Operating since 1902, it is a funicular railway that ascends from Lambton Quay in the central business district to Kelburn. The Wellington Cable Car Museum is next to its Kelburn terminus.\nThe Wellington Botanic Garden comprises 25 hectares of native forest, gardens and displays, and has entrances adjacent to the Kelburn terminus of the cable car and on Kelburn's Glen Road.\nThe main campus of Victoria University of Wellington is in Kelburn, and is home to the category 1 listed Hunter Building, the Adam Art Gallery and the Adam Concert Room. It includes Te Tumu Herenga Waka Marae, a tribal meeting place of the Ng\u0101ti Awa hap\u016b of Ng\u0101ti Awa ki Poneke.The Carter Observatory includes a planetarium and exhibition, and is located within the Botanic Garden, close to the Kelburn terminus of the cable car. The cable car also has a university stop next to Kelburn Park, which serves as a university and community sports ground.\nKelburn Village, on Upland Road, houses cafes, restaurants, a pub and local shops. Several embassies and consulates are based in Kelburn, notably the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia on Glen Road. The headquarters of Metservice, New Zealand\u2019s national meteorological service, is located in the Botanic Garden in Kelburn.\nThe Kelburn Viaduct was one of New Zealand's earliest reinforced concrete bridges, and provides vehicle and foot access to Karori and other Western suburbs.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe suburb of 'Kelburne' was established after the Upland Estate Company purchased farmland from William Moxham in 1896. It was named after Viscount Kelburne, son of the Governor of New Zealand at the time. The 'e' at the end of 'Kelburne' was later omitted to avoid confusion with the suburb of Kilbirnie.\nIn 1898, the investors formed a company to build and operate the cable car, to distinguish the nascent suburb from competing residential developments. Kelburn was populated quickly following the opening of the cable car in 1902, with Victoria University's Hunter Building opening in 1904, the Dominion Observatory in 1907, construction of St Michael's Church in 1912, and of Kelburn Normal School in 1914.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Kelburn was 3,615 at the time of the 2013 Census. Homes in the suburb are among the city's most valuable. As well as homeowners, residents of Kelburn include undergraduate and postgraduate students seeking to live in the vicinity of Victoria University.\n\n\n== Education ==\nKelburn Normal School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of 304 as of March 2020. The decile 10 school was founded in 1914 as a school for educating primary school teachers, and has a specialist music programme.Clifton Terrace Model School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of 74.Kelburn is within the enrolment zones for Wellington College, Wellington Girls' College and Wellington High School.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\n\nKelburn's boundaries form an approximate triangle, with the Terrace Tunnel and State Highway 1 defining the eastern boundary, Bowen Street (west of State Highway 1) and Glenmore Street defining the northwestern boundary, and the hills above Aro Valley forming the southern boundary.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nThe northern area of Kelburn near Parliament Buildings and between the Botanic Garden and Kelburn Park has been home to the Todd family, one of New Zealand's wealthiest families. Business leaders Sir Ron Trotter and Lloyd Morrison and prominent lawyers including Sir Kenneth Keith and Sir John McGrath lived in Kelburn. Prominent residents have also included politicians and public figures such as Sir Keith Holyoake and Sir Guy Powles.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHumphris Adrian; Mew Geoff (2009).

The stream is clear and healthy, and I have found bully fish in there on more than one occasion, although they are quite difficult to spot",
          "Probably the best dog off-leash area in Wellington.  Wide ranging spaces, nice stream, and a decent size to let the dog (golden retriever)  go a bit berko.  It can be a bit boggy in winter though.  Other dog users are generally pretty good \u2026",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Government House, Wellington, is the principal residence of the Governor-General of New Zealand, the representative of the New Zealand head of state, Queen Elizabeth II. Dame Patsy Reddy, who has been Governor-General since September 2016, currently resides there with her spouse. The present building, the third Government House in Wellington, was completed in 1910. It is located in the Newtown suburb of the city.\nAs well as being an official residence and workplace, Government House is also the main venue where the governor-general entertains members of the public, and receives visiting heads of state and other dignitaries and the credentials of ambassadors to New Zealand. Government House is likewise the location of many award presentations and investitures, and where prime ministers and other ministers of the Crown are sworn in, among other ceremonial and constitutional functions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First Government Houses ===\nWhen Auckland was the capital of New Zealand from 1840 until 1865, the provision of an official residence for the governor was initially not a priority. It was only during the period of the fourth governor, George Grey, that an official property was provided. The first Wellington Government House was Colonel William Wakefield's villa, located where the Beehive now stands. Wakefield was the Agent for the New Zealand Company; he had built the house in 1840, but died in 1848. The residence was then used as a hospital for a short period in 1848 after the Marlborough earthquake. Wakefield's house was a very plain Regency styled building with verandahs, (Auckland Libraries, 4-1028) it stood on a hill overlooking the harbour. There is a record of the first Government House Ball being held in it, on 10 February 1849 during George Grey's first period as governor.\nGrey was succeeded by Robert Wynyard, then by Thomas Gore Browne (and then Wynyard again). It is possible that neither of these men visited or resided in Wellington during their terms and thus the official status of the Wakefield Villa is uncertain. Grey became governor for a second time in 1861 and he certainly used Wakefield House as his Official Wellington Residence.\n\n\n=== Second Government House ===\n\nIn 1865 the capital was transferred from Auckland to Wellington. The need to provide accommodation for the various branches of Government resulted in a flurry of construction and prompted the replacement of the rather plain Government House with a more appropriate building. In 1868 this was embarked upon. As the new Parliament Buildings were directly adjacent it was unsurprising that it was mooted that the new Government House should be in a similar neo-Gothic style . As it happened an Italianate style was chosen, probably because it was the cheaper option.\nDespite being built of wood, the second Government House was an imposing structure distinguished by a tower; it was one of several mid-century houses influenced by Queen Victoria's Osbourne House. Designed by William Henry Clayton (1823-1877) and completed around 1871 the second Government House commanded expansive views over the city and harbour and provided a picturesque contrast with the adjacent Gothic styled Parliament Building complex. Its first occupant was Sir George Ferguson Bowen in 1873.\nAll the succeeding governors resided in the new Clayton building, from Sir James Fergusson to Lord Plunkett from 1904. The social climate of the late 19th century required the governor to spend part of the year in other areas of the country \u2013 predominately Auckland, although for a while a third Government House was maintained in Christchurch. This pattern doubtless lent longevity to the fabric and decoration of each of the official residences, but relatively little furniture and other items were provided by the government \u2013 each successive governor had to provide his household with furniture, linen, china etc. from his own pocket (today the pattern is quite different - with each new incumbent only being required to provide personal items). During its 34-year career as Government House the Clayton building was redecorated and added to but it entered the 20th century largely unaltered.\nFollowing the fire in the wooden Parliament Buildings in 1907, the then Governor General Lord Plunket offered the use of Government House to house both houses of Parliament until a replacement building could be built. In the interim the Plunketts decamped to Palmerston North between 1908 and 1910 where they resided in a house now called Caccia-Birch. Plunkett had been lobbying for a larger and more up-to-date residence to be provided by the Government, hopefully more distant from Parliament and with more private grounds. \n\n\n=== Present Government House ===\nThe Parliament Building fire nudged the government into commissioning a new Government House to be built. John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington was the first governor-general to occupy in Government House, residing there from 1910 to 1912.\nGovernment House closed in October 2008 for a major NZ$44 million conservation and rebuilding project, and was reopened in March 2011. During the refurbishment the Governor General lived at Vogel House in Lower Hutt while in Wellington.\n\n\n== Grounds ==\n\nThe house's grounds are much more private than the previous residence totalling 12 hectares (30 acres). On one side the gardens border Alexandra Park and the Mt Victoria Town Belt giving the impression of even greater expansiveness. The scale of the ground has allowed a range of different landscapes to be developed; rockeries, flower gardens, lawn areas, and a splendid collection of mature trees. All this contributes to it now being considered a garden of National significance, although there are few ornaments or sculptures to be seen. The extensive grounds contain tennis and squash courts, a bomb shelter, four cottages and a visitor centre.\n\n\n=== Residence ===\nThe current residence, in Newtown, was designed in an eclectic style in the manner of a half-timbered Tudor mansion. As it was intended to evoke a large English country house, the house's rooms were designed in a range of styles\u2014from Elizabethan to Tudor, to Georgian and Regency. Throughout the house are examples of what was considered good taste at the time: marble fireplaces, parquet floors, oak panelling, Mahogany doors, leadlight windows, bronze electric light fixtures and neo-Georgian plasterwork ceilings. Various portraits of successive governors and other significant people are displayed along with a collection of New Zealand art, some of which has been donated by previous governors. The house covers 4,200 m2 (45,000 sq ft).\n\nMany of the rooms are set aside for official state occasions\u2014for example, two dining rooms, a ballroom, a conservatory and drawing rooms. Government House is where the governor-general confers with the leader of the New Zealand Government, hosts foreign dignitaries, and performs the functions of New Zealand's head of state, as the representative of the monarch of New Zealand. The residence is also open to the public, running free tours of the state rooms throughout the year.As a result of renovations undertaken in the early 2000s, new carpets were provided for the public reception rooms. These are large artworks in their own right. The Carpets and rugs were designed by several New Zealand artists; Gavin Chilcott, Andrew McLeod, Tim Main and John Bevan Ford. The weaving was done by the carpet manufacturer Dilana, in association with Athfield Architects. The design of the Drawing Room carpet by Gavin Chilcott is derived from the silver fern. Of particular interest is the spectacular kowhaiwhai pattern, composed into a huge single composition 4 metres (13 ft) x without a repeat, was designed by Andrew McLeod and inspired by Theo Schoon's drawings of M\u0101ori designs. This pattern was produced in three different colour-ways and appears in several of the Reception Rooms.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGovernment Houses of New Zealand\nGovernment Houses of the British Empire and Commonwealth\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Governor-General of New Zealand - Biography",

          "We received warm greetings by the vicar when we arrived. He kindly shared his knowledge with us about this church and its rich history. This is a very beautiful and pristine church. Being one of the oldest church in Wellington area this church was built in 1848 and it still has",
          "If you have no religious conviction still come and see this beautiful church on architectural merit alone better still come to a service and hear the beautiful organ and meet the charming locals wonderful",

          "This is an architecturally amazing gothic style working church. It has a wonderful vaulted ceiling, gargoyles and a fully restored organ. It is an RSCM affiliated church that still has a small but vibrant and dedicated choir. Well worth a visit especially on a Sunday morning",

          "Looking through the glass doors, this large beautiful designed building beckons and invites you in from the street. In the rush and sometimes cursory feel of life, this is a well placed oasis. After a Morning Prayer service, the priest was available to chat. What a great",
          "St Peters was once again left wide open and inviting when I visited. I really love that about most of the churches in Wellington \u2013 they remain accessible to locals and visitors alike at all times of the day. It was nice to enjoy a few moments of peace alone in this beautiful",

        "wiki": "Petone (, M\u0101ori: Pito-one), a large suburb of Lower Hutt in the Wellington Region of New Zealand's North Island, stands at the southern end of the Hutt Valley, on the northern shore of Wellington Harbour. The M\u0101ori name Pito-one means \"end of the sand beach\".Europeans first settled in Petone in 1840, making it one of the oldest settlements in the Wellington Region. It became a borough in 1888, and merged with Lower Hutt (branded as \"Hutt City\") in 1989.\n\n\n== History ==\nA substantial Maori p\u0101 (fortified settlement) was already established at Pito-one close to the beach when the first European settlers arrived in the region.  The first European settlers in large numbers arrived on 22 January 1840, on the ship Aurora  carrying 25 married couples, 36 single persons and 40 children. \nThe locality was described as, \"sandy beach, which is about two miles long ... bounded on either side by wooded hills from 300 to 400 feet in height.  It was covered in high forest to within a mile and a half of the beach, when swamps full of flax (New Zealand flax) and a belt of sand hummocks intervened.\"  The Maori from the nearby pa came to meet them, one passenger's diary recording, \"the venerable old chief Te Puni ... together with sons and endless relatives and a pa full of natives who were delighted to greet us with 'Kapai-te-Pakeha' and other expressions of greeting\".  \nA beach settlement of small wooden houses and tents was established, which was initially called Britannia.  The earliest European settlers found life hard.  Nevertheless, the settlement grew: the population of \"Pito-one and Hutt\" in 1845 was given as 649, compared to, \"Town of Wellington\" of 2,667.  In 1850 the Maori pa at Pito-one was described as, \"the largest and best fortified within the District of Wellington ... their cultivations of kumara and maize look well and the residents, in point of comfort and wealth, are better off than any of the Port Nicholson natives ... total population 136.\"  There was horse racing at Pito-one Beach on 20 October 1842, attracting a crowd of five or six hundred people from Wellington.Petone was the first European settlement in the Wellington region and retains many historical buildings and landmarks. After repeated flooding, settlers moved south to Thorndon.  Thorndon is at the shore of what is now the city of Wellington, New Zealand's capital. \nFor much of the 20th century, Petone was a thriving, largely working-class town and the location of several large industrial sites, including two car assembly plants, a meat processing plant, a wool processing plant, a tobacco processing plant, a soap factory and a toothpaste factory. One remnant of this industrial history is the Petone Wharf. The wharf was originally built to allow the Gear Meat Works to export its products. The majority of these closed in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly after the . resulting in gradual economic decline. \nPetone gained borough status in 1888. Petone Borough amalgamated with Lower Hutt as a result of the local government reform in 1989.\nThe suburb has since enjoyed renewed economic growth, using its early European heritage as a draw for tourists and gaining many cafes and shops.\nIt is home of the Petone Rugby Club which has been one of the world's leading clubs since 1885.\n\n\n== State housing ==\nSome of New Zealand's first State housing was constructed in Petone in 1906, with some of the original houses remaining in good condition. The local tourist office provides a guide showing where these houses are located.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPetone is relatively flat lies at the river mouth of the Hutt River. It nestled between the river to the north, hills on the west and east and Wellington Harbour to the south. \nAs a low-lying suburb, it is vulnerable to tsunami and the threat of flooding.\n\n\n== Notable features ==\n\nThe Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life) in Buick Street provides pure untreated artesian (underground pressured) water from taps.  The water originates from the Hutt River at the Taita Gorge and is safe to drink in its natural form as it has been naturally filtered through the alluvial gravels and sands of the Hutt Valley over several years.  It is free, highly valued and consumers travel long distances to collect the water for drinking purposes.\nPetone Community Library (Te Kete Wananga) access via Jackson Street.\nPetone Settlers Museum, housed in the Wellington Provincial Centennial Memorial Building on the Petone foreshore.\nHoniana Te Puni-kokopu New Zealand Wars memorial in the Te Puni Street ur\u016bpa (burial ground).\n\n\n== Petone Rotary Fair ==\n\nThe Petone Rotary Fair is a notable local event, held annually since 1992, that draws people from all over the greater Wellington region to Jackson Street, Petone's main thoroughfare, which is closed off to traffic.\nThe purpose of the fair is not only to raise the profile of Petone and provide an enjoyable day out, but to raise money for charity. The fair consists of various stalls selling everything from plants, artwork, jewellery, CDs & DVDs, cosmetics, food and drink, etc., as well as musicians, carnival rides, and displays from various organisations such as the New Zealand Fire Service.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPetone has three schools\n\nPetone Central School is a state full primary (Year 1\u20138) school in central Petone, and has 74 students as of March 2020.\nSacred Heart School is a state-integrated Catholic full primary (Year 1\u20138) school in central Petone, and has 145 students as of March 2020.\nWilford School is a state full primary (Year 1\u20138) school in northeastern Petone, and has 304 students as of March 2020.Since Petone College closed in 1998, Hutt Valley High School in central Lower Hutt has been the nearest state secondary school to Petone.\nThe main campus of the Wellington Institute of Technology (Weltec) is located in Petone.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Even though it was very windy, we really enjoyed our walk along the Petone Foreshore - the colours of the ocean, the views and the jetty made it a lovely afternoon.",
          "Went to this place after getting out from home for a walk. This place is good for fishing and just to have some peaceful time with your loved ones.",
          "This stretch is always littered with driftwood and other stuff so, don't be brave and think you can walk there without footwear. Its not a great beach but some locals like it. If you can contend with dog poop, pollution and strong winds then hey, its the place for you but,",
          "An easy beach to reach, popular with the locals, you can walk for quite a distance. Great for kids and families.",
          "Petone Beach is never going to be a major holiday destination...the sand is too grey, but it has a wonderful outlook across the harbour to the entrance, is great for photo opps, and is a great way to stretch those legs and take in a bit of history. The wharf, the first settler",
          "The Petone beach is a wonderful place to walk. Walk on the sand or along the promenade, stop for a coffee at the mobile stand. Even on a wet, windy day it is lovely view from the car park.",
          "It is a nice beach in summer although can be a bit exposed. Part of the beach is covered in shells which need care when walking.",
          "As normal for Petone and Wellington it is very windy. Nice walk along the front. I walked from the bridge on the east side, going past a disk golf course. The walkway goes all the way to the motorway at the other end. I continued on to the Korokoro dam. Getting off the train for",
          "Petone beach is one of the safest beaches in NZ.Take a stroll and take in the sights from Wellington, Eastbourne, Western hills.Wrap up warm if a southerly is blowing.",
          "Petone is such an interesting town to visit with its eclectic mix of shops and fabulous sea front walk, especially on a.glorious sunny day. The pier is now open and worth a stroll along There is a wonderful cafe with sea views Seashore caberet. Plenty of parking spaces off",
          "This is a lovely area to wander along the foreshore with your family or spend time with the kids building an number of 'sand' sculptures. However during peak times the traffic flow along here is terrible and you can be stuck in it for some time. There is a fair amount of",
          "This is our local beach, only 5 minutes walk from our house. This summer has been unusually scorching for Wellington, but we try and walk it even in mid-winter. It doesn't have nice sand, it is usually messy with driftwood, but it has a fabulous views across Wellington harbour",
          "The foreshore area could be so much more. The beach has a fabulous outlook over to Wellington, Somes Island and the Bays. It is popular with people and families out walking . It could do with more cafes, better play areas for children. The Settlers Museum is worth a visit",
          "This could be the major tourist attraction in Lower Hutt but sadly it isn't. The views from here are spectacular, looking over the bay to Wellington, but a lack of a range of eating and drinking establishments. I'm pretty sure the locals grumble like old sewers when anything is",
          "Not the most beautiful beach in the country but definitely great for views of Wellington, Somes Island, the surrounding mountains and ocean. Great for walks either alongside or on the sand. There is a coffee cart that\u2019s open almost always up on the sidewalk and a cafe further up",
          "Petone is a sweet town will a surprisingly international vibe. Many good ethnic restaurants, and interesting shops. Worth a visit. The foreshore has a good view of downtown Wellington and the Petone Settlers Museum.",
          "As someone who loves sifting through any waters-edge flotsam & jetsom, this is a pretty interesting foreshore with loads of driftwood and interesting views across the bay. Visited first time in winter......if you do, wrap up warm, the winds can chill through to the bone. Great",
          "Fantastic scenic and easy walk for everyone of all ages and physical abilities. Path is wide, flat and great quality and is used by many people. Great views of the water and mountains that surround. Heaps of car parking along the foreshore. Coffee shops and toilets nearby.",
          "Stayed for the night in a family unit. Very clean, comfortable beds, warm and quiet. Plenty of extra blankets if needed but quilts are very warm. Not fancy but would visit again. Excellent value. Great shower as well and clean bathrooms.",
          "My dog loves this beach. We go there for her run when we are stuck in town. Sunny, stoney but pleasant.",
          "A typical Wellington stretch of beach. Exposed, cold water and not particularly pretty. Oriental is everyone's favourite for good reason.",
          "Plenty for kids of all ages to do here including swimming, fishing dog walking, AND food from a beachside cafe or a fish and chip shop, with Jackson street eateries only 5 minutes walk away. Something for all people of all ages. And a lovely promenade walkway for walking of",
          "Although the road is being repaired, the foreshore is still a beautiful sandy and fresh beach walk. The old wharf is closed due to earthquake damage but that does not stop many people walking dogs, children, couples and friends gathering and making a colourful sight. The boats",
          "as beaches go, this one is nothing more than average. It does however have lots of access points and car parks and that makes it very accessible. Good views back to Wellington, and if there is a southerner blowing prepare for no cobwebs left (and wrap up warm)",
          "Shell and stone beach but nice walk with a kiosk and cute playground as well as small train. The kiosk is great place to have an ice cream or hot pie.",
          "i live around this place, so anytime i come here to take a walk, jog, have my own peaceful time. The petone winter carnival (in august) held along the petone foreshore is a must to visit which is followed by the amazing carnival closing fireworks in the evening",
          "A favourite spot to walk the dog and enjoy the scenery. The harbour is beautiful, gray or blue, the driftwood abundant, shells galore. Surrounding hills are green and natural, too steep for houses. Wellington city is in the distance and seaside suburbs too. Sometiimes",
          "Petone is a long beach which is the length of Petone. It has places to eat along it or even places to get coffee and an ice cream. Not the best beach in the world but a very safe beach!",
          "Petone beach is a great place for a stroll along & even if there is a slight breeze just put a coat on. If you get to the wharf walk out on it & there is nearly always someone fishing & most people enjoy a chat. On a fine day make sure you make the most of the Three S,s Sun,",
          "saturday morning rolled in sunny, and the beach was full of walkers , dogs on leaches and sailboats kayaks etc. good way of clearing cobwebs from the head.",
          "Probably, not an option if you like beach solitude, but nearly perfect for families: easy access, free parking, lots of shops and restaurants nearby",
          "I headed this up Dogs, because this is Wellington's best dog walking beach. But don't fear, dogs are only allowed in limited areas off the lead, and on the lead on the main beach during winter. If you would love to run your dog off lead and perhaps have the wee beastie go for a",
          "a beach/foreshore where the drift wood is left as nature would have it???? lotsa sand and some gravel patches on exposed places. To me, it is JUST ANOTHER BEACH in NZ. nothing special. refreshment outlets and toilets at a coupla places on the road(Petone Esplanade)",
          "its free, parking is easy, quick walk to shops and cafes. very windy and lots of branches on the sand which is more gravelly than sandy but other than that nice beach,",
          "Love strolling in the beach here. Nice fine sandy beach where kids can run around or build sand castle, collect shells or just play. Easy and free parking helps, too!",
          "On the edge of the quirky Petone area, the foreshore is a great place for easy walking with views across the harbour to Wellington City.",
          "The perfect spot for a stroll and a bit of stone throwing. Close to Petone shops and handy to Lower Hutt, this is a lively beach on a beautiful day. Perfect for a walk on a not so beautiful day too.",
          "A great place for an easy walk, with lots of things to explore along the way. Kids can run on the beach, as can adults! You can explore the pier, visit Petone Settlers museum which has free entry and is a great place to escape to if the weather is cold and windy. To be honest it",
          "If you stay in one of the nearby hotels, you can go back and forth between swimming and the pubs - for a really fun time. (drink responsibly.) I just love walking along the path and eating an ice cream - goody goody gum drops is my favourite and a kiwi classic - which is",
          "We loved walking the Petone Foreshore from end to end - great exercise and good people watching. It is however exposed to the infamous Wellington southerly wind which whips up the water and at high tide will smash into the sea wall and splash over, car parking at northern end",
          "It's a nice place to chill during a workday. It's awesome that we've got such lovely areas in Wellington that are a few minutes from work :)",
          "Petone foreshore is good for walks on the beach and sometimes (if the wind is not too cold) you can go there for a picnic. It is not exactly a tourist beach but nice when the weather is good.ALmost every day there is a coffee cart on the carpark, which makes it a perfect spot",
          "Its a lovely long beach and they also have the ferry from wellington calling in. The wharf is long and people fish off it, very close to shops as well if there is a compulsive shopper in the group.",
          "Okay Petone as a town is worth a visit full stop. Easily accessed by public transport - bus, train, and even the ferry at times, it has a range of things to offer. The actual beach is a lovely wide sweep of sand which is pleasant to visit for all beach activities including",
          "I feel that Petone foreshore and beach is underrated because the sand isn't fie and white like oriental Bay across the harbour but the views and boardwalk and tussock grasses make up for it! There are always many people coming here for a quiet walk along the beach of through",
          "Having lived in Wellington for 10 years, it's still nice to wander along the sand whenever we make a visit or are passing thru.",
          "The beach is grand. The pier is fun to walk along, checking out the fishermen's varying degrees of success. Loads of driftwood gets moved onto the beach which makes for great exploration. The museum along the beach in the old swimming change rooms is fantastic.",
          "The Petone Foreshore, and Wellington in general, are nice enough on their own. Unfortunately, New Zealand is blessed with many wonderful beaches, so it's hard to pick a favorite. Petone gets five stars because there's something for everyone and you can spend nearly a day walking",
          "This Beach was close to where I lived and I always enjoyed walking my dog along this piece of beach. No matter what the weather there was always people, dogs, interesting displays of beach art and when you need a coffee good cafes are nearby.",
          "We love walking the Petone Foreshore from end to end - great exercise and good people watching. It is however exposed to the infamous Wellington southerly wind, so hold onto your hat",
          "When Petone had its own council, the beach and its surrounds were maintained in excellent order, but since the Hutt City Council assumed responsibility, the beach and promenade always looks neglected and has an uncared for look!!",
          "The Flying Bean Coffee Cart on the Petone Foreshore is one place to stop for a great coffee, just parked on the side of the road right by the beach. With a coffee that is made just the way you want it, I like mine extra hot and all the people that work there do just that. Great",
          "Nice to chill out and relax talk to the locals and visit local cafes ..................... No complaints",
          "We stayed overnight before catching the Interislander Ferry. Easy walk to Petone shops and would have been a lovely walk along the foreshore but the wind was cold. The room was clean and bed comfy, very good WIFI, but if you are not used to traffic noise don't stay on the",
          "Enjoy the Capital city from this lovely foreshore...see the buildings afar and the ferry boats crossing the cook straight. The waves this time were of a good size and you can feel the pounding sea hit against the rocks. on a good day you can pick sea shells and just enjoy the",
          "It's a nice place to go for a walk when you've had enough of the main strip in Petone. The beach is mainly driftwood and shale but the views back towards Welly and the hills are pretty nice. Can feel a little windswept but still worth a ramble.",
          "Like being close to the shops yet a sense of being away from rush.. Not a great place in the middle of winter as southerly winds very cold",
          "a quick 10 minute train trip to lots of cafes, shops and the best shoe outlet store ever. What an unexpected surprise.",
          "quiet and very picturesque even on a not so nice day. You are able to see right out into the harbour. The walk is longish .Downside is the amount of dog dirt...stepped in some.",
          "Don't come for the beach, it's not attractive and there's quite a lot of rubbish. It is also extremely exposed...getting sand blown in your face isn't very nice! The whole foreshore area seems like it has been neglected. The only attraction of interest is the Settlers Museum",
          "This 'beach' is exposed, windy, cold and often covered in rubbish. There are also few shops or anything interesting except for a few cafes across the road. Come here for a walk but that's about it.",
          "There's the Early Settlers Museum, beach (popular for dogs to run along), and a great playground for kids plus sandhills to play in. It's exposed and windy on a windy day but on a sunny day a great place to take the kids or go for a walk. Petone is also a great shopping",
          "Had a very relaxing walk along the foreshore. Lovely views back to Wellington City. The children`s park & play area was clean & tidy with well maintained equipment.",
          "It is a great walk beside the sea with the ever changing view of the harbour. Wellington city in the distance is spectacular. Even if the weather is blustery it is still a good place to visit as there is interesting art works along the way & the sea is a little wild.",
          "We grabbed a take-away lunch and parked on the foreshore looking across the Wellington Harbour on a sunny Saturday. The beach is a driftwood gatherers delight and walkways just made for those wanting to walk or jog away an hour or so. Peaceful and relaxing for others.",
          "This is an area that we frequent often for walking. Compared to other foreshores and walks around NZ and the world Petone foreshore comes out at the bottom of the heap. It needs an injection of capital to provide some facilities but more importantly it needs a commitment by the",
          "Petone Forshore has positive atmostphere an affordable ferry trip to wellington city and back the peer is great close to eastbourne lower hutt and wainuiomata the Petone village is from the hay day but the towns energy is young and vibrant but very refined dont take my word for",
          "We needed a place to stop at for just one night, picking up our son from Welly airport. The owners of the motel were very polite. On arrival they showed us around allowed us to look at the room before we had even paid. The room was very comfortable great king size bed rooms were",
          "This is right in the southerly blast so it's usually pretty windswept. It's nice walking along the beach to connect with walks but sitting on the beach is not so pleasant. One thing that is nice is watching the oyster catchers. They are a scream with their long orange beaks.",
          "Always something to do. Great family beach with good swimming and nice pier. Sundays very popular and nice walk, a favourite. A great cafe is all that is missing. Nice safe kiddies park and swimming platform. Great way to spend the day",
          "Lovely place to visit and sit on the beach eating fish and chips from John's fish and chip shop. The best in the Hutt Valley",
          "if you want to take time out, this is place to go, lots of dogs on the beach , with the ever present sea gulls",
          "This is not as exciting as I expected, but ok 2 spend a afternoon stroll",
          "Needs a clean up. Seaweed and dried up wood litters this beach.",
          "Lovely place to relax and walk along the beach. Plenty of places to sit down. Just wish there was more sand instead of the rocks and shells.",
          "I am a local, I met a friend here the other day and we walked her dog on the beach. It was pleasant, but a nothing special. Lots of beaches in Wellington. Not all of the beach is available to dogs. I would not recommend this beach in a strong southerly.",
          "I find the Petone foreshore slightly depressing. The sand is brownish and litter-strewn, and the sea is brownish and oily-looking. There is a childrens playground which never seems very inviting and it stands next to some very uninviting toilets. The good things about Petone",
          "Excellent beach to just chill and relax, nice and calm.",
          "Made the mistake of booking four nights at the Foreshore in September 2008. Charge for one bedroom apartment was $140 per night - we had a baby so needed the bedroom. We knew something was wrong on arrival - there was a woman sitting in the office just staring at a computer"

        "wiki": "Avalon is a suburb of Lower Hutt in New Zealand, formed as a private residential development in the 1970s on land formerly occupied by market-gardens on the left (eastern) bank of the Hutt River. It features mostly California-inspired designed houses, often split-level, with 3 or 4 bedrooms.\nThe Hutt City Council formally defines Avalon as the area bounded by Percy Cameron Street and the Wingate Overbridge in the north, the Hutt Valley rail line in the east, Fairway Drive and Daysh Street in the south, and the Hutt River in the west.\n\n\n== Avalon Studios ==\nAvalon came to the attention of most New Zealanders as the early centre of the country's nationwide television-broadcasting production, particularly with the opening of the purpose-built Avalon Studios in 1975. Given that New Zealand started regular public television-broadcasting for the first time in 1960, and instituted networked television in 1969 with only a single (and State-owned) channel available to viewers, the sole provider of television-broadcasting acquired a monopoly position of immense influence within the New Zealand mass media, and the name \"Avalon\" summarised and expressed that clout for many years.\nAvalon also became the focus of New Zealand film-production - through and building on the National Film Unit, which Peter Jackson bought in the late 1990s and incorporated into his Park Road Post facility. Avalon was the filming location for the 2002 television show 100 Hours.\nTelevision New Zealand (founded in 1980) inherited the Avalon real-estate and continued to operate some functions from Avalon, even though its activities mostly moved to Auckland in the course of the 1980s. Avalon produced  television-shows such as Good Morning and the New Zealand Lotteries Commission's live Lotto draw.\nHowever, in 2011 TVNZ announced that it would sell off the site for good by 2013 and shift its remaining shows to Auckland, thus consolidating the broadcaster's Auckland focus. According to Wellington-based TV  personalities, the northward drift began in 1980 with the formation of TVNZ, and the subsequent relocation of the TV One newsroom and headquarters to Auckland under then Prime Minister Rob Muldoon (in office 1975-1984).\nIn April 2012 a consortium, Avalon Holdings, bought the Avalon Studios with the expectation of officially taking possession in early 2013. In 2017 the studio facilities were used for filming of the Scarlett Johansson starrer Ghost in the Shell (2017 film). In March 2019 an application was lodged to transform the 10-storey Avalon Tower into 61 residential units. \n\n\n== Education ==\nAvalon has five schools.\n\nAvalon Intermediate School is a state intermediate (Year 7\u20138) school, and has 218 students as of March 2020.\nAvalon School is a state contributing primary (Year 1\u20136) school, and has 217 students as of March 2020.\nKimi Ora School is a state special school for students with physical disabilities, and has 73 students as of March 2020.\nNaenae College is a state secondary (Year 9\u201313) school, and has 736 students as of March 2020.

        "wiki": "Petone Settlers Museum is a local history museum located in the Wellington Provincial Centennial Memorial, a historic building in Petone, Lower Hutt, New Zealand. The building was originally constructed to mark the Wellington province's centennial commemorations; the museum opened in the building in 1977. The building was extensively refurbished in 2016.The building is classified as a Category 1 historic building by Heritage New Zealand.\n\n\n== The site ==\nThe Wellington Centennial Provincial Memorial building is located on the Petone (originally 'Pito-one', or 'end of the sandy beach') foreshore and memorialises the site where local M\u0101ori welcomed the first ship carrying organised British settlers to Wellington on 22 January 1840. The positioning of the building is approximate, rather than precise.Local Te Ati Awa chiefs including Te Puni and Te Wharep\u014duri sold tracts of land around the Wellington harbour to the New Zealand Company to provide land for settlement. The original settlement was built near Te Puni's pa in Petone.\n\n\n== The building ==\nBeginning in the mid 1930s, New Zealand's Labour-led government planned for the centennial celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. While the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition in the Wellington suburb of Rongotai was the main centennial event, funds were made available for provincial memorials and events, including the construction of the Wellington Provincial Centennial Memorial on the Petone foreshore.A national competition was held to find the final design of the building, and the Wellington architect William Gray Young adjudicated. The winner was Auckland-based architect Horace Lovell Massey (1895\u20131979). Massey was awarded the NZIA Gold Medal for this design. Historian Gavin McLean describes the building as 'Wellington's provincial memorial but in many ways the New Zealand monument to pioneer endeavour' and 'an enduring celebration of pioneering'.The architecture of the memorial combines Stripped Classical and Art Deco motifs. A central Hall of Memories is flanked by two rooms originally designed as male and female changing rooms for the building's additional original purpose as a bathing pavilion. The building's primary features are a large sand-blasted glass window and a stone replica of the prow of the ship Aurora (the first of the New Zealand Company settler ships to arrive in Wellington) at the base of the window facing the street. On 18 December 1938, Ivor Te Puni, a descendant of chief Te Puni, wrote a letter to the Prime Minister requesting he also remember the M\u0101ori people who \"gave\" one hundred years ago. The result of this letter was the depiction of Te Puni on the stained glass window extending his hand in welcome to the new settlers, represented by a suit-clad man and a woman carrying a child.The memorial was officially opened on 22 January 1940 in a ceremony led by Prime Minister Peter Fraser and Governor-General Lord Galway.\n\n\n== Petone Settlers Museum ==\nDischarge from a major abattoir on the Petone foreshore, the Gear Meat Factory, made swimming at Petone beach unpopular and the bathing pavilions fell into disrepair. In 1977 the western bathing pavilion was converted to the Petone Settlers Museum; two years later the museum extended into the eastern bathing pavilion.Today the museum is a repository of information and objects relating to the history of M\u0101ori and Pakeha settlement in the surrounding area, as well as the social, cultural, sporting and industrial history of Petone.In 2016 the museum underwent a major refurbishment to both the exterior and interior. The $250,000 refurbishment sought to bring back the original look and feel of the building. Features such as decorative concrete grills have been re-instated and the building restored to its original colour. The original beach-front opening at the rear of the building was reglazed, and coloured paint that had been applied to the ship prow and bas-relief sculptures on the building's exterior was replaced with a cream shade, returning them to their original monochromatic state.While the project took place, contractors discovered the original tiled foot baths that swimmers had to walk through to get to changing rooms. The museum reopened on 29 May 2016 with a family open day celebrating the refurbishment. $75,000 was also spent refreshing the exhibition spaces inside.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPetone Settlers Museum website",

        "wiki": "Nairn Street Cottage is Wellington's oldest original cottage. It was originally built by the Wallis family, who lived in the cottage for three generations. Tours of the cottage are available to hear about these early British colonists and their descendants, and the garden is open daily during daylight hours. Nairn Street Cottage is classified as a \"Category 1\" (\"places of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'\") historic place by Heritage New Zealand.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe cottage was built in 1858 and is located on Nairn Street in the suburb of Mount Cook, Wellington. The Cottage was built in a late Georgian style and is similar to other houses built from that time through to about 1870. The Cottage was built by William Wallis who arrived in New Zealand in September 1857 with his wife Catherine.\n\n\n== The Wallis family ==\nWilliam and Catherine were newly-weds who undertook an arduous seventeen-week journey by ship to arrive in New Zealand. Like many immigrants they came in search of a better life. Unlike many immigrants, Wallis purchased the Nairn Street site only after he viewed it. He chose the location specifically because there was a stream at the bottom of his town-acre site. Wallis was aware of the necessity of a safe water supply after the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake had created tsunami that swamped Wellington town's water supply leading to several deaths from typhoid.\nWilliam had been apprenticed as a carpenter on The Crystal Palace in London. He also built hospitals in the Crimean War, which allowed him the skills and capital necessary to emigrate to the comparatively new colony. The cottage is almost entirely built of native New Zealand timber and was built by hand. His original tool chest remains in the cottage collection.The Wallis family had 10 children altogether, but after their seventh child the family relocated to a larger house, which William also built, next door.\nDescendants of the Wallis family remained in the cottage until the late seventies when the Wellington City Council earmarked the cottage for demolition so that council flats could be built in its place. The Council took the building under the Public Works Act in 1974 from Winifred Turner, a granddaughter of William and Catherine and the last person to live in the cottage. Only the tenacity of Winifred Turner saved the cottage and ensured that its historical value was recognised.\n\n\n== Museum: 1980\u2013current ==\nThe Colonial Cottage Museum Society campaigned to save the cottage from demolition, and established the cottage as an educational museum in 1980.Nairn Street Cottage offers guided tours of the house and gardens. Each tour begins with a run through of the Wallis family's history and the significant events that occurred around the world during the 127 years that the Wallis family lived in Nairn Street Cottage.\nAll of the items within the cottage, with some exceptions, date from between 1850 and 1880. Several items belonged to the family, others were donated from other settler families, while others have been loaned or purchased.\nTours, group tours, and education visits are available at the museum.\nIn 2018 the cottage was temporarily closed and refurnished. The reopening signified a shift in focus \u2013 originally the cottage focused solely on William and Catherine Wallis; the refurbishment saw a wider focus on the different generations of the Wallis family from 1830 to 1970.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nColonial Cottage Museum website",

        "wiki": "The Vatican Museums (Italian: Musei Vaticani; Latin: Musea Vaticana) are the public art and sculpture museums in the Vatican City. They display works from the immense collection amassed by the Roman Catholic Church and the Papacy throughout the centuries including several of the most renowned Roman sculptures and most important masterpieces of Renaissance art in the world. The museums contain roughly 70,000 works, of which 20,000 are on display, and currently employ 640 people who work in 40 different administrative, scholarly, and restoration departments.Pope Julius II founded the museums in the early 16th century. The Sistine Chapel with its ceiling decorated by Michelangelo and the Stanze di Raffaello decorated by Raphael are on the visitor route through the Vatican Museums. In 2019, they were visited by 6,882,931 persons, which combined made them the third most visited art museum in the world. They are one of the largest museums in the world.\nThere are 54 galleries, or sale, in total, with the Sistine Chapel, notably, being the very last sala within the Museum.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Vatican Museums trace their origin to one marble sculpture, purchased in the 16th century: Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons was discovered on 14 January 1506, in a vineyard near the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. Pope Julius II sent Giuliano da Sangallo and Michelangelo Buonarroti, who were working at the Vatican, to examine the discovery. On their recommendation, the pope immediately purchased the sculpture from the vineyard owner. The pope put the sculpture, which depicts the Trojan priest Laoco\u00f6n and his two sons being attacked by giant serpents, on public display at the Vatican exactly one month after its discovery.\nBenedict XIV founded the Museum Christianum, and some of the Vatican collections formed the Lateran Museum, which Pius IX founded by decree in 1854.The Museums celebrated their 500th anniversary in October 2006 by permanently opening the excavations of a Vatican Hill necropolis to the public.On 1 January 2017, Barbara Jatta became the Director of the Vatican Museums, replacing Antonio Paolucci who had been director since 2007.\n\n\n== Pinacoteca Vaticana ==\nThe art gallery was housed in the Borgia Apartment until Pope Pius XI ordered construction of a proper building. The new building, designed by Luca Beltrami, was inaugurated on 27 October 1932. The museum's paintings include:\n\nGiotto's Stefaneschi Triptych\nOlivuccio di Ciccarello, Opere di Misericordia\nRaphael's Madonna of Foligno, Oddi Altarpiece and Transfiguration\nLeonardo da Vinci's  St. Jerome in the Wilderness\nCaravaggio's Entombment\nPerugino's Madonna and Child with Saints and San Francesco al Prato Resurrection\nFilippo Lippi's Marsuppini Coronation\nJan Matejko's Sobieski at Vienna\n\n\n== Collection of Modern Religious Art ==\nThe Collection of Modern Religious Art was added in 1973 and houses paintings and sculptures from artists like Carlo Carr\u00e0, Giorgio de Chirico, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Marc Chagall, Paul Klee, Salvador Dal\u00ed, and Pablo Picasso.\n\n\n== Sculpture museums ==\nThe group of museums includes several sculpture museums surrounding the Cortile del Belvedere. These are the Gregoriano Profano Museum, with classical sculpture, and others as below:\n\n\n=== Pio-Clementino Museum ===\n\nThe museum takes its name from two popes; Clement XIV, who established the museum, and Pius VI, the pope who brought the museum to completion. Clement XIV came up with the idea of creating a new museum in Innocent VIII's  Belvedere Palace and started the refurbishment work.Pope Clement XIV founded the Pio-Clementino museum in 1771, and originally it contained the Renaissance and antique works. The museum and collection were enlarged by Clement's successor Pius VI. Today, the museum houses works of Greek and Roman sculpture. Some notable galleries are:\n\nGreek Cross Gallery (Sala a Croce Greca): with the porphyry sarcophagi of Constance and Saint Helen, daughter and mother of Constantine the Great.\nSala Rotonda: shaped like a miniature Pantheon, the room has impressive ancient mosaics on the floors, and ancient statues lining the perimeter, including a gilded bronze statue of Hercules.\nGallery of the Statues (Galleria delle Statue): as its name implies, holds various important statues, including Sleeping Ariadne and the bust of Menander. It also contains the Barberini Candelabra.\nGallery of the Busts (Galleria dei Busti) Many ancient busts are displayed.\nCabinet of the Masks (Gabinetto delle Maschere). The name comes from the mosaic on the floor of the gallery, found in Villa Adriana, which shows ancient theater masks. Statues are displayed along the walls, including the Three Graces.\nSala delle Muse: houses the statue group of Apollo and the nine muses, uncovered in a Roman villa near Tivoli in 1774, as well as statues by important ancient Greek or Roman sculptors. The centerpiece is the Belvedere Torso, revered by Michelangelo and other Renaissance men.\nSala degli Animali: so named because of the many ancient statues of animals.\n\n\n=== Chiaramonti Museum ===\nThis museum was founded in the early 19th century by Pope Pius VII, whose surname before his election as pope was Chiaramonti. The museum consists of a large arched gallery in which are exhibited several statues, sarcophagi and friezes. The New Wing, Braccio Nuovo, built by Raffaele Stern, houses statues including the Augustus of Prima Porta, the Doryphoros, and The River Nile. It is in the Classical style and has a wide arched roof with skylights. The colour scheme is blue-grey and white with a polychrome marble floor. The walls of each side of the gallery have a row of large niches in which stand marble statues. Between the niches are plinths supporting smaller portrait sculptures. The Galeria Lapidaria forms part of the Chiaramonti Museum, and contains over 3,000 stone tablets and inscriptions. It is accessible only with special permission, usually for the purpose of academic study.\n\n\n=== Gregoriano Etrusco Museum ===\nFounded by Pope Gregory XVI in 1836, this museum has eight galleries and houses important Etruscan pieces, coming from archaeological excavations. The pieces include vases, sarcophagus, bronzes and the Guglielmi Collection.\n\n\n=== Gregoriano Egiziano Museum ===\nThis museum houses a large collection of artifacts from Ancient Egypt. Such material includes papyruses, the Grassi Collection, animal mummies, and reproductions of the Book of the Dead.The Gregoriano Egiziano Museum was inaugurated on 2 February 1839 to commemorate the anniversary of Gregory XVI's accession to the papacy. The creation of the Gregoriano Egiziano Museum was particularly close to the pope's heart as he believed the understanding of ancient Egyptian civilisation was vital in terms of its scientific importance as well as its value in understanding the Old Testament. This feeling was expressed in a paper by the museum's first curator, the physiologist and Barnabite, Father Luigi Maria Ungarelli.\n\n\n== Vatican Historical Museum ==\nThe Vatican Historical Museum (Italian: Museo storico vaticano) was founded in 1973 at the behest of Pope Paul VI, and was initially hosted in environments under the Square Garden. In 1987, it moved to the main floor of the Apostolic Palace of the Lateran where it opened in March 1991.\nThe Vatican Historical Museum has a unique collection of portraits of the Popes from the 16th century to date, the memorable items of the Papal Military Corps of the 16\u201317th centuries and old religious paraphernalia related to rituals of the papacy. Also on display on the lower floor are the papamobili (Popemobiles), carriages and motorcars of Popes and Cardinals, including the first cars used by Popes.\n\n\n== Highlights from the Painting Collection ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Other highlights in the museum ==\n\nThe red marble papal throne, formerly in the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano;\nRoman sculpture, tombstones, and inscriptions, including the  Early Christian Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus and Dogmatic sarcophagus, and the epitaph of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus;\nThe Raphael Rooms with many works by Raphael and his workshop, including the masterpiece The School of Athens (1509\u20131511)\nThe Niccoline Chapel\nThe Sistine Chapel, including the Sistine Chapel ceiling (gallery)\nThe Gallery of Maps: topographical maps of the whole of Italy, painted on the walls by friar Ignazio Danti of Perugia, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII (1572\u20131585). It remains the world's largest pictorial geographical study.\nThe frescoes and other works in the Borgia Apartment built for Pope Alexander VI (Borgia).\nThe Bramante Staircase is a double spiral staircase designed by Giuseppe Momo in 1932. The staircase has two parts, a double helix, and is of shallow incline, being a stepped ramp rather than a true staircase. It is encircles the outer wall of a stairwell about fifteen metres (49 feet) wide and with a clear space at the centre. The balustrade around the ramp is of ornately worked metal.\n\n\n== Visitors ==\nThe Museums had 6,427,277 visitors in 2017, making them the fourth-most-visited art museum in the world.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAccademia, Venice\nUffizi, Florence\nIndex of Vatican City-related articles\nList of most visited art museums\nVatican Gallery of Maps\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nG.

          "We visited Rome over Christmas and although we are atheists a trip to the Vatican city is a must for the architecture and art alone.",
          "Visiting the Vatican City - even for a non-Christian - is frankly a very moving experience. I was struck not just by the obvious majesty and scale of the Basilica and its world famous Piazza de San Pietro but also by the sense of humanity it symbolises: that thousands of people",
          "Beautiful city with mad car drivers. But still a place worth going to. Vatican city tour and gardens tour well worth the money. Then climb right to the top of St Peters basilica for magnificent views of the city. We stayed for a week which seemed just about right. Enjoy.",
          "It was a great time to spend our 30th Anniversary visting the museums as well as the different historical sites around Rome.",
          "I bought skip the queue tickets thank goodness. We made the mistake of going into the garden first instead of heading towards the Sistine chapel. Crowds were horrendous. It was so hot too and no air. If you\u2019re claustrophobic or have kids don\u2019t bother. Finally got to the Sistine",
          "There is so much to say about the amazingness and the power of the Vatican and how holy and important the place! Simply amazing",
          "Visiting Vatican city was a memorable one. We selected a hop and hop off bus and get off near the Tiber river close to the Vatican city. From the river bank you have to walk nearly half a kilometer to the Vatican city. It is a majestic city with all the elegance. Most of the",
          "This place needs to introduction and \u2018reason to visit\u2019. If your question is whether to queue in the really long line or not, the answer is simple. Either visit the place before 8:30AM or buy a ticket that allows you to avoid the queue and use the side entrance. The place is",

          "Today, took a four hour guided tour of the Vatican Museums and St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. We opted to go with Gray Line who was recommended by our hotel. We found the tour company to be extremely organized and it was easy to locate their guide, Daniele L. at the designated location.",

Once you get past all the people trying to get you to buy a \u2018quick pass\u2019 for 30euros per person ( it cost 17 euros by the way\ud83d\ude44 for an adult). and buy your ticket it is just a matter of checking your bag in ( tip!

          "Amazing architecture, beautiful surroundings, great atmosphere..., worth a visit if you are in Rome.",
          "Museum worth visiting only because of the Sistine chapel. Sistine chapel is where the popes are elected after the previous pope passes away. Also because of michaelangelo wall and ceiling paintings . This is the reason why you should visit this museum. All the other",

          "A 4 night stay wasn't long enough to see all that this beautiful city has to offer.The history, mind blowing art & historic buildings are fascinating. The people were friendly, efficient when dealing with large numbers of people & every care is taken with the food they serve.",
          "If you are in Rome this is aplace that you have to visitor , the history inside there , the great legacy that Michel Angelo left in the walls of sixteen chapel , the beautiful basilica. I took a guided tour to know the history of this place I highly recommend to do it",
          "Stayed in Rome for 4 nights, I arranged to go to the Vatican on the Friday, unfortunately I'm disabled, but they did everything possible to make my life easier, but even so a lot of the time I sat and my wife explored! We had lunch there, a shared plate of Italian meats, cheeses",

          "We visited Vatican City for an afternoon and were very impressed with the art, architecture and history. We were VERY fortunate that we\u2019d chosen to take a private tour through Jewish Roma tours. (We give them 5 stars.) This allowed us to learn a great deal about the art and",
          "Without a doubt this was the highlight of our trip to Rome. Parts are free to go into with just needing to pay to go see the museum and the Sistine Chapel. It was breath taking. There are numerous areas to go and pray as well as a mass was going on whilst we were there. You can",
          "The place is unique. Definitely the place you will remember for years. I recommend to skip the queue, i had an Omnia Pass for that. The place is full of people who try to fool the tourists, be aware. Go in the morning, is not so crowded.",
          "You won't be able to keep up with your guide because of the crowds. It's worth it to skip hours standing in line waiting to get in but don't plan on being able to remain in close proximity to the guide. Picture 1000 people in a hall probably planned for 100 people. Personally,",
          "The place is packed with tourists. If you want to go inside, I think it's better to come early because there are long queues. The structure, engineering and architectural design is massively ingenious. The pillars at the entrance were bigger than I thought. So many souvenirs. A",
          "The art is great but it was impossible to enjoy it. The picture gallery was worthwhile and not too crowded, but the main musuem was bad. Tour groups everywhere, literally could not move. Once you enter the musuem, you cannot turn back, you must continue on for rooms and",
          "We went twice, once early in the morning for a tour, and once at night to see St Peter's Square all lit up. I highly recommend the guided tour, we did the skip-the-line tour that was before opening hours. There are crowds no matter when you go, so just be prepared. The tour",
          "Its always a pleasure visit the Vaticano. It\u2019s not a just a place you visit but something that nurture the soul. There was a bit of cue both days we were there but they move quite fast. Between the line and X-ray took us around 15 minutes to be inside. Weather in Rome wasn\u2019t",
          "Wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect but didn\u2019t expect to be constantly harassed by the inordinate amount of ticket touts! Sorry but they really spoilt our visit ! Yes we have tickets , no we don\u2019t want a selfie stick or bus tickets !!",

          "We did the whole Vatican Museum, Sistine chapel and St. Peter\u2019s basilica. After you exit the Basilica you walk into the Vatican City area where the Pope speaks to the people. It is so neat to be able to see the window the shows himself from. The area is huge and beautiful.",

          "Crowds were intense. A cattle call through the Sistine Chapel. Not disabled friendly. But people helped move my wheel chair up and down stairs and were kind and encouraging. This charity by people is what made the experience for me. The ceilings, walls, history--all",
          "We toured the chapel as part of a tour of the Vatican Museums. It was very very crowded and we were glad our tour guide had told us ahead of time what we would see as there is no talking while inside. It would be great to visit it with fewer people.",
          "First of all, we saw the pope up close.....he rides through the crowd before he gives his public address at 9:00 am in St. Peter\u2019s square. It was amazing to see him among us! We booked a Vatican museum tour with gray line tours. Our guide, Chiara, knew her stuff and we liked",
          "High concentration of art masterpieces from dawn oh human civilization... So much things to do and see. If you like history and art this tiny place is a must to visit, at least once. So much secrets and surprises behind every door, corner and wall. Wherever you look there is",
          "Hey cheapskates We decided to buy a hop on and off bus ticket plus jump the Line Vatican entry rather than a expensive tour. It\u2019s not too far to walk. Hint do some google History before you enter so you know what your seeing. It was a big day taking in all the other stuff on",
          "Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s beautiful... but be prepared for over-the-top crowds.

It\u2019s extremely difficult to enjoy anything since you spend",
          "A remarkable journey of culture and architecture. The Vatican was a step back in time with all the frescos and works of art, especially the tapestries. A must see in one\u2019s lifetime.",

          "We visited Vatican at night (around 10pm) and it was a truly amazing experience. We have been told that during the day the crowds are unbearable, but at night it was a perfect pleasure. Of course there were a few people, but we could perfectly enjoy the magic atmosphere of this",

          "And I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Absolutely amazing. The scale of the architecture, paintings and mosaics is hard to comprehend. Some tips, take a tour and miss the queues. Beware of cafes around the Vatican City - you will pay around 10 euros for a coffee. You cannot take bags into",

If you want to send a postcard from the vatican, then make sure you bring a pen, they will not lend you a pen and you will need to buy one for \u20ac1.50. I advise visiting in the morning as it fills up quite quickly.",

          "There is no wardrobe or any storage opportunity, with a baby carriage that's hard to visit the museum. It wasn't allowed to us to use the elevators, we could use them just at the entry/exit. The Sistine Chapel is beautiful, and the other exhibitions are also great.",
          "Amazing collection from great masters in opulent setting. A great cultural day out. Be prepared for lots of walking and crowded setting. I'd also recommend bringing some food to eat. It's a long day! Buy your ticket in advance to avoid a long queue.",
          "Vatican city was an amazing visit. The Vatican is actually a country located inside towering stone walls of another city, however you won't need a passport of any sort to enter. If you are in Rome and have time to make your way to Vatican \u2026",
          "This is the 2nd doorway to the Vatican City! Visit only with valid tickets and during opening hours only. You know The Vatican is a separate country comprising of a 1000 human beings and the smallest country in the world. Yeah, you gotta \u2026",
          "Do not have words to describe the place, it's that beautiful. If you are in Rome, keep one day aside for just the Vatican museums. Next day, visit the rest of the Vatican city. It's definitely worth it.",
          "Obviously there is an enormous amount to see here, but the way tours are organised leaves you little chance to appreciate it. Official audio guide devices are a scam - most of the time they describe what you see, like a an aid for people \u2026",
          "Just stunning.  You will need the whole day to take it in.",
          "One of the greatest expressions of art I have ever seen in my life! It is fantastic, even if you are not a Catholic it is very worthwhile to visit once in your life if you are an art lover!",
          "Impressive architecture and building.\nHold lots of artifacts. Statues. Arts. Paintings. Etc.\nNear to metro ottaviano station.walking distance 5 minutes.\n\nWe went early Feb. Maybe is low season. The queue is less and bearable. Super easy to go in queue up. Buy the tickets there and then. We did not bought it online.",
          "Definitely a valuable place to visit, but we were surprised to see that the Pinacoteca was closed without warning because of a conference, which was disappointing. The big crowds don't take all of the pleasure out of the visit for me, but \u2026",
          "Sistene chapel was magnificent but most of the people have no respect and were taking pictures and talking even though signs were posted everywhere not to do it. The guards did nothing about it either which ruined the experience.  Michelangelo did some very fine work here.",
          "Beautiful. Cannot miss this place while visiting rome",
          "By closing time this spiral stairs are almost empty of visitors! One could easily spend a whole day inside the Vatican museum & Sistine chapel. The restaurant in the ground floor opens up to a portion of the Vatican gardens and the grounds \u2026",
          "For those who never visited the Vatican Museums, I stronly suggest you do and you take your time to see them well. These museums are large and also filled with an incredible amount of statues, jewels and maps amongst many other items. \u2026",
          "Not Catholic or religious. Regardless, I recommend going. Truly impressive collection. \n\nWear comfortable shoes and watch out for hustlers outside. Once inside, if you have the time savor it. \n\nLike I said, I'm not religious, but this place helped me understand how and why people believe in a higher power. Breathtaking.",
          "I think this is the most amazing and rich with art museum! One day is not enough! We were rushing through the galleries",
          "A place filled with culture gathered from all around the world and a great immersion into Roman and Catholic history. It is guaranteed to leave you speechless, especially if you are a fan of intricate sculptures and paintings as myself, who views art through an engineer's spectrum.",
          "It was one of the must visit places if you are in Rome. The museum was quite good it will take one full day if you are patient to look all the historical aspects. There are many local guides outside the museum with some packages. But I \u2026",
          "This museum is stunning. There is so much to see and not enough time!   I was able to visit this museum early in the morning.   Make sure that you are in the correct waiting line because there are some fake tour guide people who try to \u2026",
          "One of the best museums i have ever visited. A lot of things to see, for sure one day visit does not help to see all these ''treasures''. The staff of the museums is very polite, the ticket office very fast and convenient.",
          "Simply amazing! So much art! Painting, sculpture, mosaic, pottery... Greco-Roman, Egyptian, classical antiquities, of course Christian... so much to see! Took the kids on a whirlwind run through (fully aware they'd not have the stamina for \u2026",
          "Amazing place. Full of treasures. We took five hours to go round, be prepared for a long walk.",
          "What a great musium we had a guided tour. This is one of the places you need to visit more than once. We had a catered dinner in the courtyard that was part of the tour. So much history and artifacts to see.History buff Catholic or Protestant will equally enjoy the museum.",
          "It is one of the must go places when you visit Rome/Vatican. Very interesting and inspiring museum. We needed around 3 hours to complete all rooms. From beautiful gardens, marmaor statues, paintings and even modern art pieces.",
          "The whole museum has amazing exhibitions. Worth the visit and it's best to buy the tickets online and always look above because the ceilings are awesome not just the sistine chapel.",
          "The amount of art in these museums is incredible.  Not a little bit of everything but a LOT of everything.  Not the biggest museum in the world but a very complete one.",
          "Very well preserved. Abundance of art works and archeological findings. Organized and well signed.",
          "If you don't speak Italian, it is worth taking a translator or tour guide. This can benefit with understanding the history and add to the experience.",
          "Rich in history and plenty to see ranging from works of art to understanding a bit more of Italian and Catholic history. Queues are very long would recommend a skip the line tour.",
          "DONT BOTHER WITH FAST PAST ITS A SCAM. \njust wait in line it dosent take too long and you save so much money. The fast past isn't always efficient and it cost more than entering the museum. \n\nThe Sistine chapel is breathtaking. And worth \u2026",
          "It's a very beautiful place ....... There are sculptures, fresco, tapestry, paintings, mosiac work and much more. Would advice to keep a full day aside to absorb the treasure from museum.",
          "This place is really nice to give you the full hit of the Italian masters. Alot to see and take in so I recommend you take your time as much as you can. You really get a sense of how the styles evolved. Also an insight into where a lot of \u2026",
          "I loved it, the only down side is that even if you get the audio guide there are not enough audio files and you find yourself looking at different things that you wonder about but you can not learn about it. Also you need to be prepared for \u2026",
          "You can take pictures everywhere with the exception of the Sistine Chapel.  The museum is around the corner from the entrance to the basilica itself, probably 1/4 mile give or take.  Impressive amount of stuff from ancient Rome, and the \u2026",
          "Other than the crazy crowds this was amazing visiting such an iconic and historic place. To walk on such storied and holy ground was incredible and humbling. The magnificent paintings and artifacts were breathtaking. I absolutely recommend you visit if you are in Rome.",
          "Vatican Museum is massive, expect to stay at least 2 hours and make sure to wear a comfortable pair of shoes. Buy a \"skip-the-line\" ticket before you get there.",
          "Extremely beautiful, the artwork is amazing and the hallways are gorgeous!! It does get quite crowded but there is a good flow throughout the entire place and I absolutely adored going here! Historically amazing as well!!!!!",
          "When in Rome you must visit the Vatican museum. Fantastic exhibitions. Unique pieces of art !",
          "Make sure you book your visit in advance and come to the afternoon time slot as the crowds are massive. Download an audio guide on your phone to get the context of all the amazing art inside the museum and the Sistine Chapel.",
          "This is certainly a stop that needs to be taken if you  visit Rome. We did it in an afternoon and I think that was the right amount of time.\nThere is so much to see and it is stunning. The ceilings are what makes this place though.\nIt is \u2026",
          "Absolutely beautiful! However, if you are like me and don't know much about the history of the artifacts and art, you tend to find yourself looking at almost identical pots and statues.",
          "Beautiful and thrilling. The amount of art is spectacular!!! Was an experience even for someone not in to religion. The tour is fantastic and very informative. Would absolutely visit again and again! Cannot possibly take it all in, in just one visit!",
          "This is an incredible place to see, especially for Catholics. Pay for the guided tour that skips the line across from the main waiting area and just outside of the Vatican in a gift shop, it is worth the price.",
          "I'm a devout Catholic and I have been looking forward to seeing the Vatican since I was a kid. I loved the history and everything that the buildings were meant to represent. The part that made me disappointed was to see how commercialized \u2026",
          "Excellent attention to detail when the place was built. It's just mesmerizing to the eye",
          "Everywhere you look there is art. It's going to take you months if not years to appreciate every detail. It's a huge building, it's the 5th largest art museum in the world so prepare good shoes for lots of walking. Unfortunately a very crowded place, though. The museum shop sells lots of cool little trinkets.",
          "Awesome historical place in rome. One way to visit colloseum. It's was long time ago when I work on cruise ship. Hope get chance to visit in the future. Godbless us.",
          "This is one of the world's great museums.  The collection is among the best ever.  The paintings and sculpture are magnificent  but your visit will end in the Sistine Chapel with it's famous Michaelangelo ceiling.   There are long lines to \u2026",
          "Like everyone else Vatican Museums is the major attraction in Rome. I would have liked to stay longer and more often as the collection, various chambers with priceless works of the masters and the Sistine Chapel are so amazing. A guided \u2026",
          "We had no problems with the queue because we went as a organised tourist group and did not need to wait in line but the line was really long as well as the wait time. The museum is beautiful and amazing, filled with magnificent paintings \u2026",
          "A must see of Rome! Don't forget to visit the gardens. Look for the room with Pope's vehicles, one of the best. Some tips: prefer to book your online ticket from the official Vatican Museum's website, it's the most cheap and accurate, and give 8euros to rent an audio guide (if you can't afford for a guide), it's value for money!",
          "A huge place, around 700 meters away from St Peter's Basilica. You need a few hours to visit the museum. Keep in mind that there are many tour operators groups visiting the museums, so the museums may be crowded. When we went to the \u2026",
          "It's The Vatican, so ya, it's impressive! However way too crowded! If you don't like crowds check online for best times to go.",
          "Obligatory. Amazing! Must see! Beautiful, really impressive and important part of the Italian history and world culture!",
          "Very glad I visited. Waited nearly 30 years to see the Sistene Chapel but the whole process was my idea of hell. The centrepiece of Michelangelo's masterpiece is the creation. How ironic! TOO MANY PEOPLE!!! If there was a plan in place to \u2026",
          "One just wonder at the great art work of the ancient  days. It's really fantastic and excellent place to visit. One who goes to Rome must visit this place. It's one of the must visit place in Italy. Whole day can be spent in adoring great art work.",
          "As expected. A lot of history and some great areas to check. Would need a week here to see everything.",
          "One of the best collections You can imagine. The most precious and widely known statues or paintings are here behind Vatican wall. So it is place everyone should visit!",
          "Beautiful, inside and outside. Sistine Chapel, check. I was immensely impressed with how much artwork is located inside. You don't have to be religious of any sort just enjoy art and history. They kind of rush you through the sistine Chapel \u2026",
          "One of the finest experience in Europe. A must do activity in Vatican City.",
          "Excellent museum with good audio tour. Only downside is trying share space with constant stream of tour guides and their groups, which seemed too big for the space available.",
          "Go early. 9am and book online prior to your visit. I would also recommend that you find an app or travel guide and read what's there before you go. The reason, there is so much there you will have to be choosy. There's a subterranean car \u2026",
          "If you can try and get early entrance- definitely worth it!! Very complex place to walk through and not well signed. The map given also did not match the rooms.",
          "Excellent! The American guide was so great and the 3 hours felt like 1h! As one friend told me, in Musei Vatican we find the best compilation of the human creations explaining their relationship with God \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0d",
          "Really good,  but do not buy your tickets from touts on the street. If you look online you can find deals much cheaper.",
          "The place and the pieces of art was incredible, the architecture was fabulous but the organisation of the museum is terrible, there isn't security, guards let everyone enter, even if the signal is red a the security point ! The place is \u2026",
          "Tourist location to be explored. Watchout though for paid tour guides, they rip you off mostly.",
          "Cool to see the history, but way too crowded and we went during \u201clow season.\u201d I also hate to support the Catholic Church that has abused and continues to abuse so many children. History should be free, but the tickets are pricy.",
          "Beautiful art pieces, but be aware of the crowds and busy times. We were able to (mostly) avoid these by coming early and being selective in which art pieces we wanted to see.",
          "Plan ahead and get inside in the morning so you have enough time to walk around. You need headphones with an audio jack (not Bluetooth), otherwise you pay 1.5 euro for a very inconfortable mono wired headphone. Don't be scared of the big line to get in the basilica, it pretty fast and it's nice inside (and on the top of the building).",
          "Beautiful places, full of history. After all, both the fall and the glory of mankind from ancient times is right in front of you. I recommend visiting Vatican around this time of the year since there aren't as many tourists as usual and the weather is much better, especially compared to most summer days, which tend to be extremely hot.",
          "I first visited the Vatican Museum 30 years ago as a young backpacker. I remember staggering out after what seemed hours exhausted and overwhelmed. I didn\u2019t even realise I had passed through the Sistine Chapel. This time, with my kids we \u2026",
          "Really enjoyed the visit,especially the basilica, not sure if its worth the cost as a few people we spoke too paid different prices for the visit even though we booked on line with the same operator.",
          "Very beautiful place. The art work is stunning. Pictures dont do it justice",
          "A beautiful place for adults and kids as well.",
          "So much history to take in, a day's visit isn't enough. Absolutely stunning and highly recommended to all. First time, you can go with a tour guide, then go visit again alone with no intent of taking pictures, just go early, take your time \u2026",
          "This was an amazing experience. When it comes to big attractions like this, of course the lines are too long and there\u2019s an obscene amount of people. Despite that fact, the opportunity to visit this place to further learn about the history \u2026",
          "Gorgeous place, I just wish we knew where we were going! We paid to skip the queue which is a great idea but we were there for 2 hours, and followed the crowd and come out thinking surely weve missed somewhere there, we tried to go back in \u2026",
          "It felt like I was having an out of body experience here, no photo can show you just how beautiful the artwork inside here is. I was in awe the entire time. The cafeteria food was terrible but the staff were such amazing people. I want to \u2026",
          "This museum is very well kept and its worth the money paying in for it. It is so beautiful and there is a lot to see. You can also see the Chapel with this ticket. Please make sure you get your tickets from the actual vatican museum, and \u2026",
          "Great historical experience..In awe with the collection they have.",
          "This is a tough one to review, because the museum itself is world class 5-star, but the amount of people they send through at once is overbearing! I\u2019ll admit, we visited at about 11am which is probably one of the worst times to go, but even \u2026",
          "Definitely get some sort of guide, either audio or a person as this place is just too huge otherwise. Also get skip the queue tickets in advance as otherwise plan for a long queue to get in. We did the children's audio guide which was long \u2026",
          "Amazing architecture, history and exhibitions",
          "Literally amazing.. you feel something in your stomach when you see those exhibits.. there are so many things you can see in this museum. Capella sistina was one of my favorites. All of it is so perfectly built it is unbelievable. The \u2026",
          "World's finest work is right here. Not to be missed at all. I bought skip the line ticket online. But I feel normal ticket would be the same really. Don't get influenced by touts standing outside the museum who'll try to sell you all types \u2026",
          "Be prepared to either get there early or book in advance to ensure you get the full Vatican Museums experience.\nThere is an abundance of things to see and do in the largest museum in the world.\nIt is well worth a visit and you cannot leave Vatican City without doing it!",
          "The best museum Ive ever been to. Fantstic pieces of art and history. It gets annoying if its too crowded but go at less crowded times.",
          "The place is an amazing concentration of art of the most famous artists of the Renaissance: Michelangello, Raffaello, Botticelli and the others. The best way to actually enjoy is to book the tickets in advance with a guide. The line for the \u2026",
          "Be prepared to either get there early or book in advance to ensure you get the full Vatican Museums experience.\nThere is an abundance of things to see and do in the largest museum in the world.\nIt is well worth a visit and you cannot leave Vatican City without doing it!",
          "Very nice staff. Lovely to visit. Even more enjoyable when we actually opened the map. We did not do the audio tour but still enjoyed ourselvws very much. Want to return to see more attractions.",
          "What else needs to be said. A must see while in Rome! Took the tour and was truly blown away by what I experienced. This could be an all day event! Be prepared to have your best/favorite day in Rome right here. Just a heads up, the Swiss \u2026",
          "Love this place. I can spend a day here",
          "So much beauty in one place.  Can't take it all in? Not to worry they have an awesome book with stunning photos that you can purchase!",
          "This place is so beautiful- but too many people. Just make sure you buy your tickets online, makes the wait so much shorter. Amazing art.",
          "The Museum host a most remarkable collection that is definitely imperative to see at least once in a lifetime. Unfortunately, the itinerary is pre-fixed and it is not possible to skip determined sections to go straight to those of interest, \u2026",
          "Fab museums, so much to see! If I'd had time I'd had spent two days here. You need in since we managed to see everything just about in one full day, but we did not get to fully appreciate most exhibitions. The basement ethnography exhibition on the amazon was fascinating and very sparsely populated with other patrons.",
          "Incredible...and incredibly tiring.  If your major interest is the Sistine Chapel you have a very long walk through many galleries. It was magnificent but difficult with a sprained ankle.",
          "It was the most beautiful place to explore and learn; From the intricate detail of the Sistine Chapel to the knowledgeable tour guide, my family and I kept going back to learn new things each day.",
          "The best experience of wealth and world treasures I have experienced in all my travels. Well worth the money and the three hours of walking within the museums. What a collection.  I cannot recommend it more. It is an absolute must see if \u2026",
          "Super interesting place !so much history .. make sure you give yourself lots of time .",
          "Visited on a Saturday morning, booked a guide to allow us quick access and gain a full sense of the history. Would have to recommend booking in advance at least as the queues build up quickly and it gets incredibly busy.\nGreat place to visit though and easy to see why it's so beloved.",
          "Very beautiful. You can walk the whole country in 15 mins. Very well built and maintained. The sight seeing trip is a bit expensive (\u20ac25-\u20ac30 per person). That allows you to roam inside the Vatican museum. Roaming/entering the country is free",
          "Museum was great but there\u2019s a ton of lying guides outside telling you it\u2019s not possible to go inside without a guide and you have to prebook tickets. This should be cleaned up by authorities period. If you\u2019re like me and want to explore by yourself go inside and buy a ticket.",
          "Amazing place again get a tour. But is so wonderful place to visit",
          "A must see...\nBetter get your tickets online to avoid waiting hours in the line.\nAvoid the tourist hunters outside, every 2 meters one of them will try to speak to you, they are very annoying. I think Vatican should ban them...",
          "So much to look at! You do need a guide of some sort, as items don't tend to be labelled. There are plenty of your guides taking people round, however, I took the cheaper option and downloaded the Rick Steves audio Europe app, (which I \u2026",
          "It was great and our tour was brilliant. Would highly recommend getting a tour guide otherwise you will be queueing all of the day! TripAdvisor is useful in finding a good price and buying them close to the event (day/night before) can get you reduced prices! We had the early tour and was brilliant as wasn't massively crowded.",
          "A must see! Make sure you take the Vatican Gardens tour as well. Take your time, it is a long visit. Prepare your soul for a dive into proof of History... There's no Collection like this one. All galleries will amaze and inspire!",
          "We took the guided tour, the tour was roughly 3 hours, a bit intense, we skipped so many rooms just so we can finish on time.\n\nI really recommend taking your time while visiting the Vatican.\n\nWas not worth the money, cheaper solution is audio-guide and it is roughly the same experience.",
          "My wifes Aunt booked us a private tour of the Vatican for our honey moon. It was great. Had our own personal guide to teach us things and point out certain pieces of knowledge. Let me temper the hype just a little bit for you though, the \u2026",
          "Awesome place. This is a must-know attraction in the Vatican city.\nHuge Museum containing the Sixtine Chapel as a \u201cfinal\u201d attraction (it is the most important and famous inside the Museums). But if you like art , definetely you must go \u2026",
          "Incredible experience. Don't rush through for the sistine  chapel and enjoy the whole visit. Amazing.",
          "Just amasing, from one hall to another, equally beautiful all the time, along these museums paths!!!",
          "Crazy busy. Highly recommend a guided tour to give you context and skip the lines. There is a lot in the museums, it can be a little overwhelming. There is a lot to see, so it would be better split up into two times to allow for the art to sink in. Beautiful art and buildings though.",
          "Amazing. Not much more to say. Well worth the price of the ticket. We did a three hour tour which was exhausting but highly recommended. Also recommend St Peter's Basilica including going up the dome.",
          "Even the agnostic or atheist should have this on their list of \u2018must visits\u2019 when travelling to Rome. 2nd most amazing collection of truly historical museum pieces that I have witnessed (behind the British Museum but I may be biased). Buy \u2026",
          "You should visit this unique place",
          "The number of visitors in October needs to be regulated but as such s money-spinner, will it be? Some of the chapels and rooms are stunning and the experience would be greatly enhanced by halving the number of visitors. Sistine chapel \u2026",
          "What a place. We visited at night so not as crowded. Would take months to actually see everything on display. Definitely a highlight of our visit to Rome.",
          "A magical and sacred place! I believed the Vatican was bigger though.",
          "Amazing place to visit if in Rome. The art is breathtaking by so many of the greats of the classical era.",
          "It\u2019s nice to go there once in your life. For the timing better go in the night, but you will still find a lot of people. Don\u2019t get an audio guide it\u2019s not worth it as the information is general and short so you won\u2019t get any useful \u2026",
          "Very very crowded even at 10am in the winter low season. You can only shuffle once by inch through the galleries. You can barely appreciate any of the art due to the sheet number of people.",
          "If you are a lover of art and the renaissance, the Vatican museum is a must. Book early though.",
          "A guide is really a good idea, skip the queue and be informed: for a price.",
          "Some cool art and historical pieces and with most things from the Renaissance period, particularly from the Catholic church, some really weird things. Pretty crowded so be prepared for lots of elbows, bumping and no space bubbles.",
          "Really great historical museums at the Vatican! Pays to get a guided tour the first time.  Get the tour with St Peter's Basilica at the same time as you have to leave and go back and que for hours for St Peter's otherwise.",
          "Amazing and fascinating but even off season it can get ridiculously full. Fairly sure we used a local guide booking service to bypass the mega-lines of tourists.",
          "So much to see here. Toured it this morning with early access. Well worth the cost. A must see.",
          "A must see when in Rome. \nWe went in January, so it wasn't so crowded. It took us a few hours, and I'm not convinced, we saw everything. You can't take pictures in the Sistine Chapel, but everyone did anyway.",
          "Incredible place. Seeing the heritage of humanity from the ancient times, famous works of renneiscance masters, unforgettable.",
          "Wonderful and mesmerizing memories. One should atleast once visit this place before he dies. So artistic and i saw a real mummy which has been in the opened view.",
          "Legendary! Mind blowing stuffs! \nVatican is no wonder a mystic vault of wonders. Specially when it comes to the collection of art and sculptures. Every nook and cranny of it was crammed with beautiful historic pieces of art and sculptures. A must must must visit if you're in Rome. Or your Rome visit is not worth it.",
          "The most beautiful artworks I've ever seen in my life. The rooms themselves are exquisite. Wish I had stood my ground within the moving crowd to look for longer and take better pictures. Book your tickets in advance so you can skip the queue!",
          "Well worth a visit, besides the chapel there are plenty of other exhibits to see. It can get quite crowded though. There are some good places to eat as well, prices are reasonable considering where you are and the food was all well cooked and very tasty.",
          "Avoid all the scammers outside. Just stand in line. Left hand on the wall. Go inside the museum entrance and buy your tickets upstairs after the security check.\nI wish you have a great experience.",
          "Whether you are religious or not the Vatican Museums are a must see. The entire experience is awe inspiring. The frescoes are stunning. The Sistine Chapel was breathtaking. Sidenote, they do not allow photography (cameras or phones) in the \u2026",
          "A MUST SEE!!!! I'm sure if you go to Rome your more than likely going to visit here. There's alot more inside than I thought and we spent 3 hours walking round. Go early as possible to avoid most of the crowds but even when it opens a 8am \u2026",
          "A must visit in Vatican City. The collection available in the museum is astounding. It can be crowded so I suggest you head there as soon as it opens",
          "One of the best decision in my life! The whole thing was breathtaking from start to finish! The museum is like a tour through roman history, you get to see all the works of the greats! The museum it self is a piece of art!! Beautiful everything, an experience of a lifetime. Also great student discounts!",
          "You can spend lots of time here waiting outside or strolling the enormous collection of art. The sistine chapel is beautiful!",
          "Well I think there is nothing to say about the inside. Everything is so beautiful. The museum has many parcours to get you to the Capella, short, long, u decide.\nThe waiting line can be huge, the waiting can take more than an hour",
          "It's something magical. It's a huge place. Those people back then, think big. Their vainglory make them build all this. \nThe best choice is to hire a guide. He or she can explain what you see. In Capella Sistina, photos and tour guides are \u2026",
          "Vatican Museum, take a full day for this, go in the morning at 9:00 to avoid a big queue. And especially do not take the \"skip the line\", does not worth the money. The museum is huge, and be prepared the take a lot of history lesson in that day. Takes around 4 - 5 hours to see. Is not expensive and can provide audio-guide.",
          "You should visit religious or not. What a great collection. So many stuffs to see inside! There is a place to eat and drink cafe. Without a ticket took me 15min to get inside. 17euros everything is included.",
          "Amazing place! The art work is just incredible and a place that cannot be missed.",
          "A walk through history.  A grand deposit of art and culture.",
          "Every third Sunday is free entry. The queue was for one and half hour but is wasn't bad, on the end you are gona be rewarded.",
          "Full of great art, historical and religious pieces. Can get crowded and long lines, so try to plan ahead. Absolutely worth the visit.",
          "The art history of the sistine chapel is beautiful.  I just wish it were easier to exit the place.",
          "This is the must see. Beautiful place full of very interesting things. If you like art, or even if you are not religious.",
          "I was surprised to see how lengthy the museum was before getting to see the Sistine Chapel. Beautiful artworks (traditional and modern), ancient relics, and statues are to be seen along the way. Views of the city from windows can be seen as well",
          "Boyfriend wanted to go and I was not fussed - so glad we went and saw the Sistene chapel... it is incredible and cannot be described",
          "You have got to see it to belive it the art work alone could take days to look at its amazing it's a \"Must See\" 5 stars ...",
          "Although a VERY NICE place and lots of things to see... The whole experience is unfortunately completely ruined by the crowd. It's not possible to enjoy the place because of the quantity of people inside.",
          "Absolutely outstanding for the best in history and exclusive experiences of the uplifting spiritual journey.",
          "Breathtaking artwork and elegance. Everything is so over the top in extravagance. Went with a tour group so got in without waiting and direct access to the Sistine Chapel and St Peter's Basilica. Definitely made it worth it. It's a must-see if in Rome.",
          "The art is absolutely amazing, the statues gallery, the paintings in the Sistine chapel, the Etruscan exposition... just amazing. Too bad though that we don\u2019t get time or space to truly appreciate the beauty and emotion of the collection, \u2026",
          "Very crowded, but a lot of great sights. I would recommend the skip the line tour, there is a student discount. It's worth it if you get the tour with the museums, chapel and basilica. Have fun",
          "Not my favorite place in Italy, but yet good",
          "Magnificent ,you have never seen something alike. But someone must be prepared , it takes a lot of time to see it all , try to avoid to buy tickets on the spot , better if you get them on line at least 3 days before you decide to visit . \u2026",
          "Incredible works of art 'acquired' buy various popes. Truly incredible make sure you get a guide with a scheduled tour.",
          "You have to go here when you are in Rome it is just breath taking just amazing",
          "Good place to learn the history of Vatican. The walk is long so bring comfortable shoes. There are sign boards on the way to follow the short itinerary or the lengthy one. No photos are allowed when we reach the Sistine chapel.",
          "I have to say that I really enjoyed been there, best part (for me of course) the Egyptian area, lots of content and sculptures, information well explained. But after that I was concerned about the organisation, very messy in my opinion, \u2026",
          "This Vatican Swiss Guard caught my eyes!! a knight in shining armour \u2665\u2665\u2665 handsome.",
          "Extremely interesting and big, you can easily spend 6 hours in there and won't even be enough",
          "The exhibition is remarkable but when it comes to organisation motion inside this is horrible experience. This is 'low season' and the crowd inside the Sistine Chapel was bigger than I ever saw. Police/security did almost nothing.",
          "Lovely collection of Papal pomp and circumstance as well as a succinct explanation of where all the taxpayers money went.\n\nSuch incredible preserved examples of vehicles from different eras. Highly recommend spending some time to see these glorious conveyances even for those who are not motor enthusiasts.",
          "An awesome collection of historical art. The toor can be recommended. In the morning it is less crowded.",
          "It's a beatiful place with a incredible art collection, including the Sixtine Chappel. It would be nice if the tour could be supported by some information next to the artwork... without a guide, it's very hard to understand what you're seeing.",
          "Museums vists are a must with so much history and culture , very beautiful.\nTake a tour guide for the full experience",
          "We scheduled a private tour through City Walks Tours. It was just the two of us and an art historian.  We were able to go into spaces that the public tours cannot access.  This experience was invaluable. I highly recommend a private tour of this breathtakingly beautiful place.",
          "Splendid museum! Highly recommended to book a tour guide to fully enjoy the experience and to know the history on the most important pieces. Please go with your own earphones so you do not need to take a disposable earphone with them.",
          "Amazing. Skip the lines. It's all worth it whether your religious or not. The art is phenomenal.",
          "There are a lot of important and amazing works of art through the museum band Sistine Chapel. Not to mention that you can get into St. Peter's Basilica, and up top of the Basilica.\n\nYou will see some of the most famous artwork in history \u2026",
          "It is a beautiful place and has soooo much to see and is really worth the money BUT it is soooo many people and you have to get into the museum as quick as you can in the morning otherwise you will be surrounded by tourists",
          "Can spend hours here, the art is breathtaking",
          "Beautiful place. Make sure go early in the day so will have full time to explore",
          "It's huge, stunning, inspiring and the home of the Sistine Chapel. I don't need to say any more.",
          "Wow. Just wow. Are there any other words for this level of opulence and history? Whether you're a Catholic or an atheist, Vatican City contains some of the most priceless and stunning pieces by the Masters. Must-see.",
          "One of the best museums I have ever been. When you are in Rome it is a must to see it. Highly recommended to buy the ticket online in advance since queue to get there is huge.",
          "Wow, the Vatican is just Wow!  It is amazing how large it is, how much art is on display and how many sculptures are inside. I had no idea of the scale of what we saw at the Vatican!  It is so beautiful and well kept!  We bought our tour tickets through Viator. Excellent!",
          "If you really want to see Capella Sistina, you should visit this museum, otherwise don\u2019t waste your time and money (17 EUR per person), otherwise I would suggest guided tour, at least gives more insight. Too crowded and disorganized. Audio guide definitely is not recommended (8 EUR).",
          "Amazing, fantastic artworks. Be prepared to loose yourself if ur not on a guided tour, lots to see. Different experience each time. Security and staff very helpful with my elderly mother, treated her like royalty and pampered her. So much \u2026",
          "Museum itself, along with its layout, various content and all things that follow deserve nothing more than five stars. However!\n\nThe way visiting groups are handled is absolutely horrible. I was well aware for the need to wait for hours to \u2026",
          "Amazingly beautiful with all means  there are so many details and things you would never get without a guide so I highly recommend going with a guide. It's worth every penny having a guide and skipping the line",
          "I had mixed feelings about this beautiful place. On one hand, you could spend hours if not days just going through this place. On the other hand, there are so many people in there that it is a little much. The Sistine Chapel was so full, \u2026",
          "Went on a Wednesday morning and there was literally no queue, either at the entrance or at the sixtine chapel - it was empty almost and I had lots of time to walk around and look at everything. Liked it a lot and will come back at the same time to avoid the crowd!!",
          "So let me start by saying this is a wonderful place filled with some amazing items. It gets 2 stars however simply due to how many people they let in. They don't seem to limit it enough which means your journey around is a constant battle \u2026",
          "Beautiful, very busy as expected (I went in the afternoon).",
          "Out of this world. It would take weeks to take it all in. Very crowded. Bring your water walking shoes plenty of time and clear vision. It's an amazing location in Rome",
          "Already been in Vatican Museums two times. If i visit Rome again I'll go there third time for sure. I'll not describe things you can see here because they are too much. Instead I'll give you few advices to make your visit easy.\nFirat and \u2026",
          "I would highly recommend visiting with a tour guide/group in order to get the most out of your experience. Not only will you get to skip the line that can take hours just to enter the museum, but your guide will also be explaining everything along the way.",
          "Some impressive exhibits - we found the Greek and Roman antiquities of most interest - but be prepared to deal with rude and surly staff which rather spoiled the experience for us. Plus the fact you can't really take your own route or go at \u2026",
          "Awesome art and very showy. Design wise fantastic.",
          "I don't think this place need any publicity. If you intend visiting make sure you go very early ( 6am sharp) as any time after you will be stuck in a mile long queue. Also, don't be tricked in buying tickets for guided tours from outside \u2026",
          "the museum has so much to offer with collection of unique pieces from across the globe, it's a must visit place.",
          "Stunning collection of Roman and Greek artifacts. Well worth a visit.",
          "Loved it. We had an audio guide which I prefer so you can visit at your own space and hear properly  as the place can be noisy with multiple guides shouting in different languages. Make sure you book your ticket on line to avoid the very \u2026",
          "Absolutely lovely, all the exhibits are beautiful and awe inspiring. A couple negatives, the crowds are intense even in the off season (winter) and the signs are fairly useless overall.",
          "Although the entrance to the museum is a bit expensive, it offers a magnificent experience for art and history enthusiasts.  If you want to visit the Vatican museums, I recommend going early in the morning and buying tickets online.  You \u2026",
          "Not sure what to think when you see the wealth that the catholic church has amassed over the centuries but the architecture is amazing.",
          "What can one say about one\u2019s visit to the Holy See? It\u2019s just simply beyond words just being able to be there, walking the same paths as Popes and the princes of the Church have trodden through so many countless times. \n\nThis place is a \u2026",
          "It is a nice place...but you cannot see anything for a long time, forget trying to read the little signs beside the statues, paintings etc. You are stuck in a long line getting to the Chapel. The maps hall was my favorite, beautiful place. They should let less people in, buy a skip the line it's worth the price",
          "It\u2019s a must if you visit Rome!!! Amazing place!",
          "A whole experience with interesting history. Maybe would have been nice to have an exit to piazza san pietro rather than exiting outside of Vatican's walls.",
          "This was a great experience but the tour of the Vatican was too long. Walking the Vatican was too much for me.",
          "Where do I begin? Book early to avoid the lines. The entrance is like an airport security check since this is basically its own country.\n\nA tour guide is a must, otherwise you\u2019ll miss a lot of information. A proper tour can easily go over \u2026",
          "It was great. What an unbelievable imagination and talent had the artists that lived such a long time ago.",
          "Worldwide famous venue, unique in the world, you can't miss it when you are in Rome.",
          "No words can explain what a beautiful place this is",
          "One of the most beautiful places I have seen. Know that there will be A LOT of people visiting with you.",
          "Absolutely beautiful. I don't usually like museums etc but it's just breathtaking. We paid 17\u20ac for entry and to be honest, I'd have paid double that. Words can't describe how beautiful it all is and the photos certainly don't do it justice",
          "Absolutely incredible! Majestic indeed and don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise or scam you: the entry is free!",
          "Beautiful ceilings and frescoes. A lot of art work and historical artifacts too. Be prepared to spend at least 2 hours here.",
          "If you love art , humanities  was your favorite subject, and don\u2019t mind walking A LOT: this place is for you! \nTruly loved it!!! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\nJust wear nice comfortable shoes PLEASE",
          "A real beauty of architecture, beautifully carved sculptures on walls along with paintings.\n\nIf you are person who loves history a very nice place for you to visit for others it could be a little tiring as the museums requires quite a lot walking.",
          "Just Sistine Chapel would make this place 5 star, but there is so much more. Plenty of other beautiful works by Raphael and Michelangelo and others...",
          "Make sure you check out the modern art collection as well as the more traditional works. Someone knows who to buy! It is truly amazing.",
          "Just absolutely remarkable. The artwork was incredible and in such good condition. If you really want to take time to see things, you would need many many days. Truly one of the best things that we saw in long trip to Italy.",
          "Super worth it, much to see there and very inspiring",
          "An outstanding collection of the worlds most priceless artifacts!",
          "The art in the Vatican museums is amazing, but it's EXTREMELY crowded. I felt like a cattle as I was pushed along in a giant crowd. The sheer number of people causes you to sweat just from their body heat. You barely have time to appreciate \u2026",
          "Amazing.  Reserve tour ahead is the only way to go in and avoid lines",
          "Amazing breadth of knowledge! You could spend hours upon hours exploring the thousands of rooms and learning about every artifact they have. They even had exhibits on Egyptian history, which surprised me. They gave every person a radio \u2026",
          "Beautiful place, we went in late September so it wasn't too busy. For certain areas of it you need specific clothing (no visible shoulders or knees). If you know you're coming I would recommend booking a tour in advance, and you'll need a long ish time to look round everything. Consider bringing your own earphones for the tour",
          "Amazing museum experience: Rafael's works, Greek antiquity, Italian renaissance, 15th and 16th centuries' tapestries, wonderful architecture and the list goes on. Plus, considering that the only way to see Michelangelo's magnificent Sistine \u2026",
          "Words cannot express the gravity and beauty of this museum. You must go and see it for yourself.",
          "Really really really crowded. Huge groups walking trough the beautiful corridors. Nice statues and paintings. We had I guide which I recommend to learn more about the highlights. They however do have a fast pace and do skip things, but I didn't mind that because it is to busy anyways.",
          "The whole thing was breathtaking from start to finish! The museum is like a tour through roman history, you get to see all the works of the greats!Just absolutely remarkable. The artwork was incredible and in such good condition. If you really want to take time to see things, you would need many many days.",
          "Impossible to enjoy with so many people. They should only allow groups of 10 max when doing tours because there were some with 50 or more in a group. So rude and loud and little respect for other people. Just run over you or push you out of \u2026",
          "Very crowded, linear museum that made us feel rushed to go through it. Unfortunately, the art is undeniably important, and so, it is still something I recommend everyone go see.",
          "Impressive, very interesting and well maintained.  The exhibited pieces seem to be secondary, as the building and the ceiling paintings in each room impress again.  In order to enjoy the museums and not to wait an eternity I would recommend a pre-booked tour in the early morning (08.30am), as the museum is not overcrowded at this time.",
          "Didn't see sight nor sound of The Pope, starting to think he doesn't live here. Good map corridor. Decent enough collection of art from all over the gaff.",
          "Great place. You have to reserve more over two and half hour if you want to visit all.",
          "Here are a few tips on how you can maximize your visit to the Vatican Museum while in Rome.\n\nFirst, known when to go! Many believe that as long as you purchase a tour that allows you quicker entrance and avoidance of the long queues outside \u2026",
          "If when visiting Rome and you love art, then this is of course a must visit. Endless amount of art. It is enormous. Best to reserve tickets online because the queue to buy tickets is very long.",
          "Entry fee for museum (Vatican Museum & Sistine Chapel) is only 17 euro a person if you buy at the booth. If you get there at 8:30am, before the 9am opening time, there is basically no line.\n\nIt does not matter if you get there early or late, weekend or weekday, you will get blocked by large tour groups. Good luck and God speed.",
          "Huge but very very busy, look online and buy skip the line tickets via any agent like tiqets that start at 0830.  I would normally avoid this but we brought skip the line and paid a few euros above the normal ticket price.  There is an \u2026",
          "Interesting  but b prepared fir long wait",
          "By far the most impressive museum we've visited to date. The artwork is breathtaking and there is so much of it to see. Definitely worth it.",
          "Everything about this place was beautiful. I would recommend getting a guide as they take you to specific places, I think I would get lost without them. Skip the queue tickets are definitely worth it otherwise expect to wait in line for a few hours!",
          "Nice Historical Museum.. But be careful for some people outside who offer you to upgrade your Ticket so you can go directly to Peter's Dome through the Museum.... The Museum is NOT 4KM Long. Don't believe them!!",
          "Very special place, well organized,  lots to see.",
          "Majestic, this place its full of art, a masterpiece from the best artist around the world (mostly Italians) the price is very worthy",
          "It can be kind of crowded, but I found it to be reasonably priced and well worth the visit. A staggering collection of some of the finest pieces of classical and Renaissance art. 4 stars for the crowds, they really should have the Sistine Chapel be separate, since that's what most people really go to see.",
          "it's a must see but the Vatican doors not treat this as holy, sacred or reverential. they sell every ticket and pack it as much as they can.",
          "History...! If you are a person with so much curiosity to know about the ancient ROME, if I tell you everything here, how you could get thrilled. Simply go and watch and share your experiences with me. Hope you enjoy it.",
          "Very large interesting museum. You need at least 3 hours to get an impression. Impressive art and masterpieces.",
          "Could have been guided better.Felt like being in a race not even given time to admire the beautiful work of art that there is rush rush and everyone pushing. So commercial.",
          "The best thing about my trip to Rome was the Vatican museums and The Sistine chapel, they were something out of this world!",
          "So much history and wonderful things to see.",
          "Nice to see but dont get a guide, they speed though the museum as fast as they can.",
          "Too crowded, not good organized so that lines flow. Could not watch properly and enjoy exhibitions",
          "Big place. Lots of wonderful art   I recommend downloading the Rick Steve\u2019s app and folllhis path so you can enjoy the trip more. \n\nThere is a lot to see including some great art by Raphael. I recommend taking your time through the museum. \u2026",
          "Super crowded because of Passion Week, but so beautiful and full of history.",
          "Never seen such place like this",
          "Spectacular!!!! Be prepared for a very long walk to the highlight of Michael Angelo's painting. Must see!",
          "Jaw dropping in every sense!!!! I literally cried the whole time while inside the Vatican as our tour guide gave us detials on the history of stuff. Every inch is covered in wealthy arts. There is only one painting in the Vatican and every other colorful thing is a mosaic if not a sculpture.",
          "Amazing. Simply too much to see in one visit",
          "One of the best Museum\u2019s in the world. Buy your tickets online and get a time to show up, please don\u2019t be that person that waits for hours in line. We been twice and bought our tickets both times, in June we passed a three-hour line and walked right in. In December there really was no line but we still walked right in.",
          "Booked a guided tour directly from the Vatican which included the museums, the Sistine Chapel and St Peter\u2019s Basilica. Tour was wonderfully lead by a knowledgeable guide in Art History. Felt like a got a brief  3-hour introduction to museums through which one could wander for days.",
          "A little busy so took some time to move through the corridors. Absolutely stunning though.",
          "We booked our tour through the Vatican Museum.  Maria, our guide was effervescent and extremely knowledgeable of art.  It was a great idea to have a tour guide for many reasons. Not only did we not have to wait in loooooong lines to see the \u2026",
          "Awesome place, just don\u2019t go during summer. The crowds are immense. \nYou shuffle along and can\u2019t really linger to take in some of the amazing treasures of the world you are being exposed to. \nAlso the touts in the streets will drive you crazy. \nDefinitely would like to do during winter.",
          "One of the best places to visit when you go to Rome",
          "You need to spend an entire day here to appreciate everything. Nowhere to sit, and pause and digest what you have seen. Michelangelo's chapel is magnificent",
          "It was... Really not what I expected. I went here off season in February. Stood in line for about an hour - which I was okay with considering I did not want to spend more money on the ticket. It was super crowded. I felt like a sardine in \u2026",
          "My Wife didn't close her gob all day, it was like she was trying to catch flies! We got here at 9.30 am and we didn't leave until 3. It's massive and a lot to see. If you hate people like I do, you'll need a lot of caffeine (my alternative \u2026",
          "It's soooooo big. I've managed to miss two whole exhibitions somehow. I didn't take the  audio guide this time and still spent 4 hours  at this museum.\nAnd I would like to share my experience with some kind of guides outside the entrance of \u2026",
          "A must see when in Rome. But is it? We took a guided tour \u2013 our guide was exceptional! She did all she could to make our way through the museum worthwhile. It's just too many people in there. You don't get to enjoy the artworks and masterpieces. If you are interested in art history and romes rich culture definitely go!",
          "Beautiful place with so much history. It is nice to take a guided tour so you know what you are looking at, ir take a guide book along if you have one. Busy place. This is a spot best to go early to avoid some crowds. Try to pre-purchase tickets (online), either for entry or tours.",
          "I would not encourage going here unless you have an early morning entrance ticket or early tour group.  We waited about 2 hours to get in, and it was almost impossible to move around once we did because of all the tours.  I think you will \u2026",
          "would have bee a great experience if we had not had such a bad tour guide, Marina Valeltini was a terrific guide if she stopped playing with her phone and fighting with other guides.\nother than this we are glad we visited the  Vatican",
          "This is a must see place for me when I am in Rome, this is my fifth time and the first for my daughter and she was amazed for all the beauty that this museum has, the web page is not very good, but we made it. We have breakfast inside and was ok. But the experience was always breathtaking",
          "Incredible history and I appreciate all the restoration work done to date. Great efforts!",
          "This whole place was a joke, \n\nLet me start with the good. This museum had extremely impressive art and landscaping. Each area had something incredible to look at.\n\nNow on to the bad. The museum was so crowded that you could not appreciate \u2026",
          "Great museum, but the agents are really annoying. They keep asking you the same question:Do u wanna skip the line? I don't think this is even legal. The line takes 3 hrs and the line is really freezing.",
          "Loved the art but not the crowds. Friend lost her backpack with everything in it. Keep your wallet and passport in a save place.",
          "Everything costs dearly  eventhough its *spiritual place*, why ticket for Sistine chapel cannot serve also for Saint Peter church... Clear commercialism... \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25",
          "I didn't buy ticket online, I arrived at 7.30 am and there were 7 people waiting. The ticket office opened at 9 am. You might want to have lunch inside. Slice of pizza with water cost \u20ac 4.5",
          "Is there any other place like this in the world? No. \nAbsolutely fabulous. \nThe amount of art you have to see is priceless and hard to embrace. Take photos to remember.\nI did. \nMy dream was to see Raphael's frescos and they are \u2026",
          "Fabulous paintings and collections. A lot of walking on marble floors and nowhere to sit down until the Sistine Chapel . Using the audio guided tour was great to use to go at your own pace.",
          "Best of all museums I have ever visited. Very organized. I would recommend the guided audio to know the history better of each masterpieces out there.",
          "You could spend forever here even with crowds i had guided tour which was better and learnt so much more including hidden spiral staircase",
          "A billion stars rating.  I was video recording and snapping pictures like crazy during this guided tour by an Italian local tour guide who spoke English with a heavy Italian accent.  Lots of sculptures, paintings all over the walls and the \u2026",
          "Been here daytime and night time, best to book a Vatican Museums at night tour from their official website. It\u2019s definitely less crowded so you have more time to absorb & appreciate everything you see. It was a bit confusing at the main \u2026",
          "Amazing museum. One of the best I've been to and I don't really like museums. There are lots of statues and tapestries to explore and they really show the pinnacle of art. The Sister Chapel is beautiful, but get ready for a long walk, as \u2026",
          "Amazing rooms and architecture would definitely recommend coming here",
          "Beautifully maintained museums.. it will surely impress you.. please stay away from tourist scams who sell entry tickets in double price.. reach early and stand in queue for the official tickets",
          "It was way too crowded and our guide had no appreciation for our difficulty in staying with him. He almost lost the entire group at one point.\nIt is a wonderful place but it is hard to appreciate the beauty if all one's energy is being used \u2026",
          "Renowned for Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Museum also houses collections by van Gogh, Chagall, Dali and Picasso. Then there's the famed rooms by Raphael.\nWhile you should be prepared for the crowds - rain, hail or shine - a visit to the Vatican Museum should accompany any trip to Rome.",
          "Amazing. A must see. Lots of tourists year round - about 6-7M!",
          "Even more beautiful than I imagined. Not an attraction you can afford to skip.",
          "Absolutely high class museum. You will be blown away! I did the Vatican museum, and in 3 hours I only touched the surface. \n\nMy tickets I bought online for 8:30, and there was no line to get in. I showed the guard my online ticket, and \u2026",
          "The line was super long. It was very stuffy in the museum itself. Not sure if I really enjoyed the place or not. That said, I'm not much of a museum kind of guy, so my review might not be a good one if you are a history buff or sorts. A unique place to be, but really not for me.",
          "One of the biggest museums I ever seen, itt was amazing!",
          "Book a tour as it helps to get you in faster through the line faster, do it early as it will take approx. 3 to 4 hours to see everything. Once inside leave the group and go explore on your own. Trust me it will be worth the time.",
          "Another must see in Rome. The best of it is the end of the tour, of course, the Sistine Chapel where you can see and feel the genius of Michelangelo. It\u2019s astonishing. Also, the museum has other interesting items and paintings. \nExpect at \u2026",
          "Better to buy tickets online to skip a line. You can pass from the museum to St. Peter Cathedral in Sistine Chapel room (check small door with \u201conly for group tours\u201d sign).",
          "Beautiful place. If you're prego, you can skip the line.",
          "Wonderful experience! Astonished by the collection of antiquities displayed in the Museum. Purchase the Skip-the-line ticket in order to avoid long queue's. Be prepared to spend the entire day in the Museum to absorb all there is to offer.",
          "Make sure that you are abke to walk well. Its a very long day on your feet up and doen lots of stairs. Absolutely worth it though. The most amazing place. Almost too much to see.",
          "I always have goosebumps visiting this place. I love art and history",
          "Even if you aren't religious this is a must when visiting Rome. Is a place full of art and history. To enjoy you must book for early in the morning otherwise be prepared to walk slowly herd style. After visiting multiple cities around \u2026",
          "Packed with groups of visitors. In Sistine Chapel, the staff just told you to \u201cgo to the middle, stay clear off the passage. Do you understand?\u201d Sorry, it\u2019s really confusing because it\u2019s not possible to go through and I even become a member \u2026",
          "Reserve online and skip the line! Bring your water and snacks as there is hardly anything and it\u2019s too packed to try. Take comfy shoes. We had a reservation at 10am and there was already a line along the Vatican wall. The place is not air conditioned so dress light and bring a fan.",
          "This incredible museum has a magnificent collection, especially classical art. Through it you can access the Judgment Hall of Michelangelo, a unique place.",
          "The incredible art i have ever seen in my life, the words of amazing is not enough, it's inseam.\n\nMore than amazing!\nBeautiful, fantastic, excellent organized.",
          "Amazing experience! A must if you are visiting Vatican City! I do recommend the audio tour if you are walking by yourself and also to buy tickets online to avoid crowds. Sistine chapel is breath taken!",
          "I was positively surprised by the treatment I got as a pregnant woman. With no hesitation the security let me in and with that I skipped a 2h+ line! Even the lady cleaning the toilet wouldn't let me wait! \nThe place is indeed crowded, we \u2026",
          "Very interesting, rich of history and art. Defenetly place to visit.",
          "We spent an entire day here. Every corner of Vatican City was filled with spectacular art, even the hallways we were walking past to another exhibition. \n\nWe spent an hour just sitting and marveling at the Sistine frescos.",
          "Great collections. But need a day fully to enjoy each and every master piece.",
          "Amazing art and sculptures, however it is way too hot with the body heat of all of thr visitors and needs more exits, as it took me 20 mins to find an exit when I decided to leave",
          "Overwhelming amount of information, a lot of precious collections, and amazing history. Some summary on each art work would have been helpful but unfortunately we had to rely on the audio guide which was difficult when we visited with young kids.",
          "The museums contain so much that you could easily spend a week here. Well worth the wait. Contains archeological areas, masterpieces, villas and gardens, etc. Even if you are not a pilgrim, the museums are well worth a look. Remember to dress appropriately. Low cut or sleeveless clothing, shorts, miniskirts, and hats are not allowed.",
          "Blew my mind away! Did not expect to see such rich collection of arts, science not just religious pieces.  Invest in early priority ticket to go in so you have silent close encounter with these beautiful works of the super genius people from the past.",
          "Beautiful museums. A lot of unexpected gems to be found here! Too crowded, but totally worth it.",
          "Buy the skip the line ticket to save yourself 2 hours of just waiting. Prepare your neck for all the looking up at the ceilings",
          "Too much incredible art & statues to believe.  The most stunning museum in the world!",
          "Very beautiful sacred place filled with many ancient sculptures and paintings. Guides are well informed about the topic and talk planty of fun-facts. For example there are only two Greek sculptures, one of which is \"Torso\", which show difference between Greek masters and Roman ones. Precious details worthy of 5 stars",
          "Vatican Museums are mind blowing in size and contents. Beautiful architectures, gorgeous artifacts and endless statues. Four stars due to enormous crowds.",
          "I am not a fan of modern and religious art (last millenium I mean), but there is a lot of art from ancient Rome and Greece that is really eyes opening. Definitely go and see it.",
          "One of the best museums I have been to! Well kept and beautiful. 100 recommend",
          "Could easily spend 4 or 5 hours just taking in all the beautiful artwork and history.",
          "Amazing experience! \nThe Sistine Chapel Ceiling is amazing! \nIt is overcrowded though... although most tourists seem to be rushing to the Sistine Chapel and don\u2019t really care about the museum itself, which is both annoying and very \u2026",
          "When I\u2019m Rome... you must obviously visit the Vatican Museums. \n\nThere is LOADS to see. So much art to experience that it can be overwhelming. \n\nI\u2019d suggest avoiding spending too much time lingering at works near the start of the museum as \u2026",
          "A must see when in Rome. Make sure to pay for the skip the line tour available from several travel companies.  The line for standard admission was hours long. The tours are several hours and only cover a small fraction of the facilities. \u2026",
          "To spend a day in Rome is a must, full of everything will enrich the soul of every visitor.\nSuitable for everyone\nTry to book in advance",
          "Entered the Vatican Museums with a group tour immediately at opening at 8am and there was already a massive lineup. I can\u2019t imagine how long the lineup would be if we travelled without a group at mid day but I would guess that the wait \u2026",
          "A great experience, gives you some perspective.",
          "Highly recommend the private tour. Historic, educational, beautiful, and inspirational.  A life experience",
          "Had a wonderful experience here",
          "An amazing, insanely large, collection of art. The star goes to whoever is running the place in true Italian lazy style with a very poorly organized tour service, chaotic I might say, definitely not adapted to the high number of visitors; you can easily get lost from your group.",
          "Great!! One of the best place to visit in Italy.",
          "Must place to see in Rome. Take a tour guide, the informations they'll give you are important. We didn't have one and we could appreciate the details. You can see the history of Rome through art. There are many important works of art to \u2026",
          "The crowds really made me dislike this place, it got so much better after the group tours left the Vatican Museum/Sistine Chapel via their dedicated exit. This place is definitely worth visiting but the group tours can make it a miserable experience.. they really need to limit the # of people inside.",
          "Very touristy. Shuffle like a sheep, ok but there are better things in Rome to see. If it's on your bucket list, then fine, but if you're short on time save it for another day",
          "It was interesting. I loved the old maps they had there, although I couldn't spend much time studying them. I hated the amount of people though and places to sit were rare.",
          "You see signs to Sistine Chapel every 50meters, indicating that you are close, but in the end you have to walk a looooot in order to get there.\nAnd when you actually arrive, they don't let you take any photos of it, so they can sell afterwards souvenirs picturing it.",
          "I might live there without getting tired.",
          "I think It is one of the most stunning place  in the world",
          "An amazing museum and property to visit once in your life! There is a wait of an hour or more in line to enter - unless you get a fast entry pass (recommenced) and then allow a couple of hours to walk around the complex and see many years \u2026",
          "A must see but be prepared for a huge crowd. Unable to stand and view as had to keep walking with the throng, unbearably warm which made the day a little bit of a disappointment, wouldn't have missed it though as it was jaw dropping WOW. Take time to walk around the outside as this was the highlight of Rome.",
          "Interesting, meaningful, huge collection. What I had only seen in books so far was now admired live. A bit tiring and long hiking, but a great experience. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Houses a huge display of fascinating and breathtaking renaissance art pieces, the museum is huge and there were also a crowds of people including tour leading groups and individuals in there. There was no time to have own sweet time for \u2026",
          "If you visit Rome you should visit this museum. Buy fast track tickets not to wait in a line too much. The beautiful garden and indoor museum are both great.   Plan a half day or more if you are older than 35, do not plan to visit with \u2026",
          "Visiting this museum properly is a long journey. Be prepared and well rested.",
          "Nice place. Long queues but worth the wait. I advise getting the skip the line tickets.",
          "You\u2019ll be stunned by its enormous and exquisite collections made in the history of human. It could be overwhelming.  Wise to get an audio guide for your visit or attend a guided tour so you know the stories behind what you see.",
          "The history and art are phenomenal, the only reason I give 4 stars is due to how busy/packed it is. Strongly recommend buying skip the line tickets ahead of time.",
          "Interesting place, the Vatican garden are very beautiful.",
          "We spent a lot of time in Rome because we thought that we had to see all the \"hot ticket items\" including the Vatican Museum. Our ticket to the museum had been cancelled the day we were going so we stayed an extra half day to visit it \u2026",
          "Something everyone must see but it's so busy it's a really uncomfortable place to walk around. Especially when you get to the Sistine chapel. Feel like you've been herded in & can't appreciate the beauty of the place",
          "If you are interested in museum . This place will provide lot more than what you pay",
          "Pretty good fairly expensive but worth it to see when in Rome",
          "Lots of historical artifacts, sculptures, and artwork. Recommend audio guide for in-depth historical information. Though there is information provided on or next to each peice with a description of the item.\nThought it was very interesting and cool to see.",
          "One of my most favorite museums in the WORLD!",
          "I love this place. It has a lot of beautiful sculptures and art.",
          "What a wonderful experience.  I had a very knowledgeable tour guide, very learnerd gentleman.  I can even explain to someone now about the Vetican Museums. Its always packed with tourists from all over the world.",
          "Was cynical when my better half booked the skip the line  tour for 7.30am... but totally awesome experience, this coming from an atheist remember.   Worth the visit if you appreciate the art and man hours which created such masterpieces",
          "The museum restaurant was great value for money. Good service, good food and a pleasant environment. Quite a surprise given how busy everything else was.",
          "I would recommend a guided tour if it your frist time. The guild's have so much knowledge that is not readily available",
          "Bless your house for the kingdom of heavens has come close to you \u201c\u201d bless your house",
          "Absolutely huge, the relics are well maintained. Can get super crowded with tourists. Wise to buy a skip the line ticket to get in.",
          "Amazing place, the story is here,  i recommend it  !!",
          "stunning as you would expect, take the whole day to see everything, though it takes 7 years to carefully examine all the artifacts stored in the museums, but if you like art or are interested in roman history, definitely visit but get the \u2026",
          "A must see whilst in Rome, beautiful museum. We went on the last Sunday of the month which is free, it was very busy so patients will be needed. the audio tour is worth it to get the most out of it.",
          "Amating collection of art. Must visit more than one time, because you can get overwhelmed by the number of masterpieces. Be prepared for a swarm of tourists though.",
          "A long distance to walk. But very cosy",
          "Really not worth the money. For no price at all you can visit St Peters square instead and enjoy the majesty of the basilica from outside.  \nWe had prearranged queue jump tickets for the Vatican museums as we would never have queued up like \u2026",
          "The art work collection is fantastic. You also get a view of the Dome of St Peter's from the museum. \n\nAs a visitor, I would suggest that you make an arrangement for a small group to tour the place. You can hear the tour guide much better and it's easy to ask questions and for navigation purposes within the museum.",
          "Reopenining, finally!",
          "Must visit museum in your life.",
          "What can you say, the attention detail  tje glistening art work the structure,  the never-ending marble floors, the openness of the galleries and of course the greatest art works of the Sistine chapel. Pity all this wealth cannot be shared with the whole planet. A must see.",
          "I understand reverence, but the mood in the Sistine Chapel was offputting. That shouldn't stop you from seeing it. Just be quiet and mindful and stick to your own spiritual experience.",
          "An amazing place with a lot to take in. Be prepared to do a lot of walking without much opportunity for a rest. \nThe queues are very long and there's a lot of people. You can buy skip the line tickets which are very much worth the extra cost.",
          "One day is definitely not enough to see everything.",
          "So much history to see! Worth a visit if you are in Roma!",
          "Lots to see...so much history. Well worth the visit.",
          "I have never seen anything like it. Many statues with a lot of history of the Catholic faith and the Roman empire. Loved it.\ud83d\udc96",
          "Sistine Chapel is the jewel of the Museums, and as a church they invite you to be silent but they do it SHOUTING....what a folly. Plus they let too many people enter at the same time so it becomes messy and...guess what \u2026",
          "Display of good sculptures, pairings and Sistine Chapel.",
          "BUY A TICKET ONLINE, save yourself a lot of time. We bought our ticket to get in the day before and we walked right in, no wait at all even at 12:00, the line for tickets was about 300 people long and we didn't wait at all. The layout of \u2026",
          "Sistine Chapel is beautiful while the art in the museum is equally beautiful. Loved the tour!",
          "It's really nice worth going",
          "The museum has some really beautiful works of art, but honestly the highlight of the Vatican is the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Basilica. The museum is worth a casual walk through. The sculptures are ornate and the tapestries are very intricate.",
          "For me it was an experience like no other. It is dazzling to the point of blinding you in front of such a display of wonders that is open to your dazzled eyes. It is understood and certain that the price to be paid in order to be able to \u2026",
          "Stunning collection and presentation of art. Just mind boggling, like best on the planet. I question, though, the logic behind letting in as many people as humanly possible on any given time and day of the week, to the point where you \u2026",
          "The Vatican Museum was truly amazing. So many beautiful paintings, statues and other works of art. The building interior and decorations are stunning. Some words of  advice. Do not visit in the summer peak  holiday period. The crowds \u2026",
          "Many of the best article and historical things",
          "Artwork was incredibly beautiful but far too many people to actually appreciate it all. Would highly recommend paying more for the sessions that allow fewer people access. Definitely a must visit but will never go back during normal hours.",
          "Better not take a guided tour although they help.skip the line because the queue is very long. The best option would be to skip the line with a guided tour and spend the whole day inside. It is because once you get out you can't go back in \u2026",
          "Best way I can sum this up was how I explained it to my wife on leaving;\n\n\"You could put this museum anywhere in Rome and it wouldn't be any different\"\n\nIt didn't feel although you were visiting the Vatican, Just a generic museum that was \u2026",
          "Vatican and its museum are so beautiful! Vatican museum is the biggest I've ever been. If I would really want to read everything I would need probably like two days. It was amazing experience. Don't forget that tank tops or deep v cut \u2026",
          "Very nice museum with a lot of beautiful object of art. It's worth visiting it!",
          "Absolutely fantastic. A must-see while you're in Rome, it has a history like no other.",
          "Visiting every part of the Vatican Museums is like trying to visit the entire British Museum, Louvre or Metropolitan Museum of Art in one go. It is vast and the different galleries continue for what seems like forever. Inside it is a very \u2026",
          "You pay \u20ac18  If you pay directly at the Vatican ticket booth Well worth it.",
          "Too many large groups that jams the flow, we are like sheeps herded to slaughter. Luckily the end is much better. The museum is exquisite, fantastic and marvelous, except for too many people at the same time.",
          "One of the most profound experiences I\u2019ve had. We had a knowledgeable and very nice tour guide who provided us with a strong foundation of knowledge. They did a good job moving thousands of people in and out safely. The artwork was mesmerizing. What a wonderful experience.",
          "Watch out for fake ticket salesmen at the entrance. They will try to move you out of the line next to the city walls and scam you across the road. It\u2019s a shame the museum has no solution to the rampant scam salesmen. \nLine was very long but it\u2019s worth it. BUY TICKETS MONTHS  BEFOREHAND",
          "Only if you are really into the art stuff.",
          "It was interesting, but people always stopped in front of the door to take photos of the ceiling  instead of stepping aside. Also, I am not fond of this things, I found the interactive art more interesting. There were some panels which showed up some people who started to talk or mimate if you touched them.",
          "Unbelievable place. Can't begin to describe the amazement you feel going round this place. Also the tour guide is well worth it as there is so much more than imaginable. They help highlight the best bits. Amazing",
          "Its beautiful and a once in a life time experience",
          "Marvellous to see the collections of priceless art from around the ancient world... time capsules of  life past ...from exhibits to the mosaic flooring up to the beautifully painted and carved Windows and ceilings your eyes have a feast \u2026",
          "Is an amazing place.... Time is what you need to discover its treasures.",
          "Incredible statues and paintings,  too much to take in in one visit.   Wish these works or art were better identified and related to the world in which they were created.   Also very crowded.",
          "A lot of walking, magical art... skip the queue worked. Too tired to finish with the caravaggio paintings. Next time",
          "Nobody can leave the Rome without experience the Vatican Museums, you probably find the long line for it, so as a tourist guide of Museum, I suggest to reserve your ticket in advance in the official site and go early cause this museum needs \u2026",
          "Wonderful museum. It's better to enter with group pass. It's almost useless to wait in the ordinary queue unless you arrive very early in the morning.",
          "2 main points to know. Please please, do not buy tickets from people outside this place or anywhere claiming tours or fast access. Yes it\u2019s crowded, yes it\u2019s better if you buy ahead the entrance tickets, but and it\u2019s my personal experience \u2026",
          "This place was unbelievable pictures can\u2019t justify so much beauty . The chapel and the cathedral inside was nothing like I\u2019ve ever seen . The feeling and emotions when you walk in is un describable . The whole place is made of marble and is \u2026",
          "Incredible but research the ways to gain entry as lots of semi scams. I think you either go all out for a full guided tour or just get a relatively cheap skip the line pass",
          "A visit in Rome isn't complete without seeing the amazing collections of the Musei Vaticani! Incredible Egyptian mummies, classical Greek statues, Raphael's murals, papal furniture, renaissance maps and Michelangelo's Sistine chapel! If that's not enough, I don't know what is.",
          "Nice to see but without a guide the info u get is minimal. Sad u can't take photos of Sistine chapel too to look back on the experience.",
          "5 stars for exponates... 1 star for organizers... Too crowded!",
          "There's hardly a queue during lunchtime. I didn't do the 'skip the line' but please check if it includes entering the Basilica thus avoiding an hour's wait in the queue. Inside the museum it's a time travel back to the earliest days of christianity. Be blessed.",
          "Oh my this place was amazing to walk around in so cool and seeing the Sistine\u2019s chapel was amazing",
          "The museums are great. The art is amazing and it's impressive to see all the details that these artists created. Of course we were there more for the Sistine Chapel and you have to go through a loooooong way to get there. Be prepared for it \u2026",
          "Unbelievable place. Lots and lots of artwork here and lots and lots of people visit this place. Recommend to go the the place early in the morning (7:30) as there's a lot of people going to the place.\nTicket is about 20euro which i think it is a good price. For kids between 6-18 gets special price. And under 6 is free entry.",
          "Amazing museum and architecture. Perfect way to spend a day in Rome. If you want to skip the line, I would totally recommend to book your tickets online.",
          "In case you buy your tickets online you can go directly to the entrance about 30m before the timeslot you booked and enter the museum, skipping the long line.\nOnce inside and passed the security validate the online tickets on a machine or \u2026",
          "If you want to experience Greek and Roman art this is perhaps the greatest place to do so. Dozens of rooms filled with classical statues and displays jammed with attic pottery. \nThe amount of works is incredible and really does provide a \u2026",
          "Beautiful and full of rich history.   Only problem, going through the different museums leading to the Sistine Chapel, we were packed in like sardines, if someone yelled gun, bomb or if someone had a medical emergency,  there would be a \u2026",
          "Must see place in Europe. Book in advance to avoid queue and try to spend whole day here... Google about top art pieces to cover and history and get it..",
          "Realy busy, mostly grom tour groups. Very beautifull and a must see",
          "We did a skip the line tour. If you want to do this, it is a must. The line is very long to get in  The amount of people absolutely ruined the experience. The do something like 40,000 people in one day. We went in October. I can't imagine \u2026",
          "As one would expect then this is a magnificent place, but there is a great amount of people. Especially during the tourist season (surprise) worth it though. Tickets online is a bit more expensive, but it beats the 2-3 hours in the queue \u2026",

          "We did a guided tour. It was brilliant. The experience is fantastic. Go as early as you are able to book. It gets insanely busy early on. If you go in summer the heat is absolute madness and only some of the rooms have air conditioning. You \u2026",
          "Just the history is enough to take your breath away. So wanted to stop and look, especially some of the modern art, but just not possible. The moving mass of humanity can be overwhelming. Would only wish for a tour at a quiet time - though I'm not sure that one exists.",
          "The experience is really worth the price.\nJust be prepared to walk for a couple of hours in a continuous, never ending stream of tourists. I don't know if there could be days when the museum is not crowded, or options to visit after closing times. If there are, consider them, no matter the cost.",
          "Sure, Sistine Chapel is very beautiful. But it is probably the only main sight located at the end of a very long walk that nearly has no way to bail mid-way. Honestly, how many of us care or would remember about the stuff shown a long the \u2026",
          "We went on a Friday evening, would recommend you go at this time if you can as it was no where near as busy as the daytime and so was more comfortable to visit. Only downside is some of the museum and grounds were closed off, but all the major rooms were open, and I felt it was worth the trade off.",

        "wiki": "The flag of Vatican City was adopted on 7 June 1929, the year Pope Pius XI signed the Lateran Treaty with Italy, creating a new independent state governed by the Holy See. The Vatican flag is modeled on the 1808 yellow and white flag of the earlier Papal States, to which a papal tiara and keys were later added. The Vatican (and the Holy See) also refer to it, interchangeably, as the flag of the Holy See.\n\nThe flag consists of two vertical bands, one of gold or yellow (hoist side) and one of white with the crossed keys of Saint Peter and the Papal Tiara centered in the white band. The crossed keys consist of a golden and a silver key, in which the silver key is placed in the dexter position. It is one of only two square sovereign-state flags, the other being the flag of Switzerland.\nThe Vatican City coat of arms is present in the white half. The coat of arms consists of:\n\nthe papal tiara (as used under the pontificate of Pius XI);\nthe two keys which represent the Keys of Heaven (according to the Gospel of Matthew 16:19) given by Jesus Christ to St Peter. The popes are regarded as the successor of Peter, and the gold and silver keys have been significant elements in the symbolism of the Holy See since the 13th century. The gold represents spiritual power, while the silver key represents worldly power. The order of the keys on the coat of arms of Vatican City is the reverse of the coat of arms of the Holy See, in order to distinguish between the two entities.\na red cord connecting the keys.The yellow and white of the flag also refer to the keys \u2013 in heraldic terminology, there is no distinction between yellow and gold (the metallic color or), nor between white and silver (argent).\nThe Argent color has also been reported in relation with the white mountains of Lebanon and of the biblical city of Miye ou Miye according to the Lebanese Historian Anis Freiha.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nThe flag is displayed in many Catholic churches and institutions worldwide, often alongside the national flag of where the church or institution is located.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Papal States traditionally used a yellow and red cockade, the traditional colors of the Roman Senate and the Roman people. However, these colors were not used on flags. In 1808 Pope Pius VII ordered the Vatican's Noble Guard and other troops to replace red color with white, in order to distinguish them from the troops that had been incorporated into Napoleon's army.In 1803 the Papal States started using a white merchant flag with the Papal coat of arms in the centre. This flag was made official on 7 June 1815. On 17 September 1825 it was replaced with a yellow and white flag which took its colours from the materials of the key (yellow for gold, white for silver). These colors were probably taken from the 1808 flag of the Palatine guard. This was the first bicolor used by the Papal States and the ancestor of the modern flag of Vatican City. The merchant flag also served as a state flag on land.Starting in 1831, the papal infantry flew square yellow and white flags. At first, they were diagonally divided, but after 1849 they were vertically divided like the merchant flag. The last infantry colour, adopted in 1862, was a plain square white and yellow flag.On 8 February 1849, while Pope Pius IX was in exile in Gaeta, a Roman Republic was declared. The new government's flag was the Italian tricolor with the motto \"Dio e Popolo\" on the central stripe. The papal government and its flags were restored on 2 July 1849. On 20 September 1870, the Papal States were conquered by Italy and the yellow and white flags fell out of official use.\nAfter the Lateran Treaty was signed in 1929, papal authorities decided to use the 1825 merchant flag as the state flag of the soon to be independent Vatican City state. However, the official drawing in the constitution used a drawing of the square 1862 infantry flag as a template. The treaty came into effect on 7 June 1929, and with it the newly-square Vatican flag.\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n            \n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of flags of the Papacy\nHistory of Christian flags\nChristian Flag\nIndex of Vatican City-related articles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVatican City at Flags of the World\nFlag of Vatican City by Rev.

          "Not as extensive as I thought they\u2019d be, but the Vatican Gardens offer a pleasant stoppage from the crowded galleries and Vatican museums. There\u2019s a caf\u00e9, benches to sit down at and monuments like Sfera con sfera to take in.",
          "It\u2019s a long steep walk up a large hill or small mountain but worth it. You get in a tram and go through various roads and see flowers bushes trees and sculptures. Beautiful.",

          "My wife & I were fortunate to have a private tour c/o the Vatican post office who we had aided in the past. The gardens are so peaceful following the hustle & bustle at the front of the Basilica. We were there in October so can only imagine what the rose garden is like in full",

          "Very large and very beautiful gardens.Nice experience to see the huge well planned & lovely garden.It is very peaceful.The garden tour itself was lovely, the guide was charming and very knowledgeable.Simply worth a visit just to see these.",
          "The garden is located between the museum and the st peters basilica. It is a quiet place to go compared to the hundred of people in the square and museum",

          "We had a tour in a bus in this garden. The garden was nice. Kind of had to wait in a crowded area with no seating to get into the pre-booked tour. But still, it was a good experience. This garden shows the lavish lifestyle of pope and heads of the religion back in the day.",

          "My wife wanted to see the gardens and as the combined ticket also gave you skip the line access to the museum this seemed like the perfect option. The tour is OK and you do get to see parts of the Vatican that you normally would not get access to but in honesty it is like any",

          "It was just a perfect garden, beautiful, scenic that too right in the middle of a city..so very well maintained..take your time to visit so that one can enjoy the view fully..",
          "I\u2019ve seen grander gardens. It\u2019s simple. But simple is sometimes better. It\u2019s a good view to cleanse the eyes. You\u2019ll see a lot of art and the greenery is refreshing when you feel overwhelmed.",
          "Nice gardens very clean very beautiful, peaceful and relaxing Take the whole tour of the Vatican its worth it Gave me chills walking in the amazing place",
          "The gardens are amazing! You will never see anything as stunning as these gardens. Simply worth a visit just to see these.",
          "We opted for the vatican garden tour for an extra \u20ac20. Truthfully probably wasn\u2019t worth the money. The gardens are amazing and would probably be better exploring at your own pace and on your own. The bus tour is not worth it because you spend a long time waiting for everyone",
          "What a great way to see the gardens, up close and personal, through the walking tour provided by the Vatican Museums! Our guide was excellent---she took her time explaining the history of each plot or section or corner of the immense gardens. Couldn't get enough photos of the",
          "The gardens are nice but the amazing thing about this garden tour is that you can learn and feel how the popes live and lived without having thousands and thousands of other tourist pushing and yelling. It is so nicely quite and the artworks are so nice, I could do this walk",
          "We went to the Vatican Gardens today on a tour conducted by the Vatican Museum. If I could go back and book with a real tour company I would. The tour was supposed to start at 9:30. Our email confirmation said we were to arrive 20 minutes early; we got there by 9am. No one",
          "My beef with the Vatican is that unlike the many royal gardens in Europe, unlike the many of the lush Cathedral and Monastery gardens throughout Catholic Europe, one gets to wander around in them. The current excuse for blocking access is the threat of terrorism. In the past",

          "Gardens was beautiful, maintain well, relaxing. Can take a nap and will not be disturbed. Seeing all people all over the world come together is wonderful.",
          "We did the English speaking gardens tour - the tour started a bit late as they seemed to be waiting for people who hadn't arrived, despite the fact that you are told to get there 20 minutes early. There were 36 of us in the group, which to my mind, was too big a group for the",
          "Gardens are perfect. Different, from different periods, with nature and buildings, trees, birds, fountains and very good care. Guide can give some more energy and more knowledge about trees, bushes, vegetables. He knows history very well.",
          "We were able to see the magnificent beautifully groomed gardens from the Dome. The attention to detail was amazing.",
          "These are private gardens so you can't actually enter. However you can get views from the top of the dome which are great.",
          "I really get the impression that the staff at this place feel they are special and that you shouldn't bother them. You would have thought of all places this place. I.e. A catholic venue would be disabled friendly. Not in my experience. I have arthritis and find walking",
          "Midst of so much histroy and art these gardens provide and beautiful soothing view to eyes.. sit here to feel cool breeze and relax yourself...",
          "Not very satisfied with the tour, had troubles hearing the guide due to old and outdated equipment. Information provided is not something that can really catch my attention and also the gardens are not that spectacular. Two beautiful attractions: one of the fountains that had",
          "This was a great tour, amazing guide who was funny and knowledgeable. The visit to the garden made the Vatican worth it. I recommend to only do the garden tour and skip the museums which are way too crowded.",
          "Its a slight detour but, if you can, do the Vatican's gardens. Meticulously maintained, they are a refreshing foil to the bustle of Rome on the outside of the walls and the bustle of tourists on the inside!",
          "We took a guided tour and the grounds are magnificent .. the whole experience was totally worth it not something you will forget in a hurray",
          "After going through all the security and crowds, it is nice to get out and enjoy the space and serenity of the gardens. So much art can be overwhelming even for a person like myself, who studied art and architecture in Florence",
          "These are pretty good. I visited as part of a Vatican tour. I doubt I would make an effort to come just here. Lots to see.",
          "Nice to see whilst in the surrounds of the Vatican City and museum. Well kept and immaculately presented.",
          "We managed to exit the sistine chapel on the left and continue the walk back to the entrance, pinacotec, and gardens. Visiting The gardens is a relief from the crowded corridors leading to the sistine chapel, and can be found when walking through the corridors leading away again",
          "If visiting the Vatican, it is nice to see, but it isn't anything special. We enjoyed seeing where the pope sometimes entertains dignitaries, which is does in the gardens. It was good to see green, as so much around here is brown from the lack of rain.",
          "There are tours of the garden, if you can manage to book one please do so! In our case, we were shown around by a priest who was a student at one of the universities in Rome, so I am ashamed to say we were really using our \"influence\" !! Not everyone can do that, but a",
          "Not to be missed during a visit to Rome. Plan ahead - and reserve a spot on a \"Garden Tour\". It is best to go on the early morning tour - before the heat of the day sets in.",
          "Good view of garden. Finely manicured and creative design. The tour packages will pass the garden. Nice visit",
          "I love gardens and when I found the Vatican Gardens visit on the website I was delighted. There are limited tours so you should book online and it takes about an hour in a small minibus with a multi lingual audio guide. It was really special because you get to see the Pope's",
          "These gardens are simply stunning to sit quietly within and reflect. The gardens apparently date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal Apostolic Palace.",
          "Beautiful manicured gardens that provide a spiritual space for prayer and or meditation. Appreciate the time and the artful existence of the area.",
          "Passed through on the way to the Vatican museums. Can see the gardens and the courtyard. Would be nice to walk through but limited time.",
          "Not knowing much about the Gardens, was surprised how much I enjoyed them. Did not realize how expansive they were., Lots of history and hidden gems along the way. Its very impressive that we are able to tour the very spots that Pope for generations have roamed and prayed.",
          "Well it is no doubt that this Vatican Garden is just a good place to visit with the nice view and landscape you will never be bored.",
          "I hate writing a semi-negative review on such a beautiful place, but I do want people to be aware of what it's like. Do this tour if the weather is going to play nice. We did it on the first day of Aug 2017 and it was easily 100f/38c with 100% humidity. Several on the group",
          "A lot of people forget about the Vatican Gardens but they actually encompass a very large part of the grounds at the Vatican itself. I definitely recommend taking the early access tour, that we did-smallish group no more than 14 or so, with a very informative and patient guide",
          "Definitely a place not to miss when in Rome. Visit early in the morning to miss the huge crowds, the early access tours are great!",
          "These gardens are beautiful and well kept best views are from the windows when going round the museum. Signs telling you to keep off the grass everywhere. A stroll around the gardens are a must as plenty of interesting things to see including the gold and black globe. Make time",
          "What fabulous gardens so well kept and the best views are from the windows in the museum. You really need more than a day to see everything to do with the Vatican so it was a quick look around but it's still worth it. You can book a tour but we didn't.",
          "Worthy to take the audio tour with the bus , especially in summer.it cost 15 euros per person and you can visit the museums after that. Relaxing travel to the gardens. If you like to walk on the heat, great . If not, take the tour. We bought inside the omnia office in San",
          "I have been to Roma several times, so I wanted to do something, I had not seen during my last visits. I booked the Vatican Garden tour via the Vatican Museum site. It was a wonderful walking tour, but I wish we had more time to enjoy the gardens and views. But I understand this",
          "Nice garden, a lot of place for pope to walk, very nice flowers and trees. You can see it from the museum",
          "Thought mistakenly had booked a private tour at >\u00a330 each. However we were in a group of 30, which was like herding cats, (it just takes one awkward family). Some of the more interesting parts were inaccessible due to weed treatment, and the rest was mildly interesting but not",
          "We didn't get the chance to actually walk through these because it was closed off but we could see them from afar. Serene",
          "maybe we expected too much but for the price paid, and the length of tour, we expected something special,,, apart from the photo highlighted here there is grass and more grass, lots of trees and shrines for spectacular gardens, head to Alnwick Castle in northumberland for a",
          "I booked this tour for myself, husband and our three kids - aged 10, 10 and 13. Stefania was our guide and she was incredible. Her teaching us about the art of the Sistine Chapel before we got there so we would know what to look for and what we were looking at was so helpful.",
          "Only accessible with booking a tour guide, though the ticket also gives access to the museums and sistine chapel afterwards. The gardens are prestinely kept, the tour is 2 hours long, so you need to consider if you are fit enough, wearing comfortable shoes and take into account",
          "Well maintained and beautiful gardens, so peaceful. So lovely to walk through the gardens. A must see.",
          "After the hustle and bustle of all that surrounds you, sit here, feel and see the beauty. The colours are outstanding. It's beautiful.",
          "The gardens are amazing and looked after prestinely, there has to be an enormous amount of dedicated gardners to keep them looking the way they do all year round",
          "Booked for the 1300 tour and we were not disappointed. A great tour and it took us around these magnificent gardens.",
          "After the madness of Vatican City this 45 minute tour of the fabulous grounds and buildings is worth the extra entrance fees. A helipad and railway station - who'd of imagined?",
          "Don't expect to be walking through the gardens. there is just a balcony on where you can see the gardens from.",
          "Always a dream to marvel and trod the Vatican Gardens. Finally I strolled with so much joy along the streets well-maintained and cared-for. The serenity in between the walks where specially the Popes make their \" relaxing moments with nature \". I love the bench where the Popes,",
          "Peaceful and a nice way to be outside! The Vatican Museums are so crowded - this is a great way to take a break, a breather! In the garden are big placards explaining the Sistine Chapel - you can read those. Also, they allow you to take your cafeteria food outside to the terrace",
          "It is a huge and well-maintained garden in Vatican city. Very charming and quiet. Very few crowd, green and flowers everywhere.",
          "Serene despite the crowds. We had a guide who was brilliant and told us about the Sistine Chapel before going in.",
          "Nice gardens you can fine anywhere. Nothing much to write home about. Did not even see the pope there. Does he not like the garden?",
          "I was fortunate to visit in an organised group and found it a delightful escape from the hassle of the Museum entrance! A number of interesting areas around the buildings and structures of the Vatican: the wooded hill of the so-called English Garden; the formal clipped hedges of",
          "Peaceful and full of art, old and new. What's not to enjoy?!? Check out Pomodoro's Sphere within schere which rotates on an axis. Dit on a bench to enjoy the relative tranquility and gaze at St. peter's basilca before you have to brave the crowds indoors!",
          "We paid for the full tour of the gardens and did not regret it. If you are debating between this tour or an internal tour of the Vatican I definitely recommend this one. It's much more unique and private, you don't have to wrestle the crowds and you can go through the Vatican",
          "The Vatican official website offers a guided tour of the Vatican Gardens, including entry for The Vatican Museums and Basilica of St Peter. One of the best days i've spent so far on Vatican City. A 2 hour tour on the gardens lets you see amazing trees, flowers and known sites.",
          "The Vatican gardens are very tidy and well maintained. You are not allowed on the grass but there are plenty of benches to sit down and have a break from all the walking. Lovely spot to catch 5 in the sun.",
          "Gardens are very well maintained and nice. You will get lots of pictures and enjoy! It is breath taking!",
          "Stunning gardens to spend time walking around. They are one of my favourite gardens with so much to enjoy. Relaxing place to sit and people watch.",
          "We could see the gardens but we couldn't actually visit because they were being used at the time. The entire Vatican and its grounds are beautiful.",
          "did a bus tour of the gardens which was not very good- stuck in a bus for 1/2 hour on a sunny day is not the best-also the museums were ok but walking through many rooms it was all a bit same old- wouldnt recommend unless you really like that sort of stuff-",
          "I booked this following other reviews on Trip Advisor as a way of accessing the museum without queuing, and getting a rare view of the otherwise private grounds. The trip is less than 45 minutes and I think everyone would have liked double that time, it's interesting but quick,",
          "Part of paradise hidden in the center of Rome, these are the Vatican gardens. Natural masterpiece created by the people to feel the power of god-creator.",
          "Magnificent gardens and well worth the stop. Lush gardens and so beautiful. Good contrast between the concrete buildings and natural life. Highly recommend",
          "All I can say is go and see for yourself. Beautiful, peaceful, relaxing. All set in the most beautiful setting you could imagine",
          "If you're touring Vatican City, then yes you should take a look seat the Vatican gardens. Very pretty. Well maintained, beautifully manicured. You can even have lunch on the patio near the garden to fully enjoy the peace and serenity of this view. But if you're not already",
          "Though it was raining when I went in November, I would definitely go there again just to take a walk in those beautiful gardens.",
          "Well worth a visit, nice to get away from the hustle and bustle, Tour needs to be booked in advance through the web site to guarantee a place. Word of warning do not arrive too early as you will be asked to come back at the right time, we were 50 mins early and ended up at the",
          "We took the official Vatican bus tour and would highly recommend this to anyone already planning a visit as your ticket also covers admission to the Vatican museums and Sistine chapel. It can also be booked online meaning you get to skip the long lines queuing for tickets.",
          "As you would expect in a beautiful place like the Vatican City these gardens are extremely well kept and looked after. You can stroll around just enjoying the peace and quiet or alternatively you can just look at the wonderful gardens from the halls of the Basilica. Either way",
          "The Vatican Gardens are pretty to look at and of course are very well kept. The grounds are pristine. Other than that, you won't miss much.",
          "Absolutely stunning! We went with a tour guide here and if you want to see the gardens then you must go with a tour guide. The scenery is out of this world and well kept, the different waterfalls we came across were absolutely stunning and the different statues and buildings",
          "When you enter to the vatican city, you can do a trip in the gardens, that have the flag of vatican made by flowers and you can see the cathedral of st. Peter from the other side",
          "Bought Vatican Garden Tour -Guided Tour on Foot tickets online in USA. Ticket includes entry to Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel. Arrived at Vatican Museum entry at 8:30am. Guard said he'd let us in at 9am for our 9:30am tour. No line to wait in just loitered around. At 9",
          "Deep within the walls of the Vatican are to be found some of the rarest of species, both flora and fauna. As if that is not enough, the views of the city below and around you, that is, if you can manage to tear your gaze away from the awesome and splendid beauty within is a",
          "Beautiful mature gardens some of which are seen as part of the Vatican Museum tour. Worth the trip if there was nothing else, but there is so much more.",
          "We spent an hour in the Vatican Gardens and wish we'd spent more time there. The peace and tranquility, the unique views of the Vatican, the sculptures are just a tranquil counterpoint to the hordes overrunning the halls of the Vatican Museum and inside St Peter's Basilica.",
          "The gardens are nice. Good way to see the bulk of Vatican City, but they are plain. I expected more flowers or color, and it is mainly bushes. The papal emblem was impressive.",
          "This tour took around two hours, the weather was perfect! There is so much to see in the gardens, you also get to see St. Peter's Basilica from many different angles. The history of the gardens is most interesting. No trip to Rome would be complete without seeing this",
          "While you are in the Vatican Gardens, you are able to see the Vatican city from a totally different perspective. The gardens are made of mostly hedges and manicured lawns, so don't expect a lot of flowers, but you will also see things like the Vatican radio station. All in all,",
          "Unlike some of the beautiful garden in England - these gardens must be appreciated from afar. It was disappointing that we couldn't get closer.",
          "The worst part of this visit was have to get in, because you must enter through the Vatican Museum. Walking tour is 2 hours and up and down steps and hills. Riding to might be better. The experience is like walking through a European park. Mainly statues, fountains, and",
          "Took a bus for this tour. Meeting point is inside the Vatican Museum. Waited 15 minutes for the tour to begin. Once in the bus, sit to your left. Beautiful place full of history.",
          "Have been in October . Nice weather but not much garden to see because there is non blooming . It is hard for handy cup or old person",
          "Gardens are stunning. Our guide Maggie, was very knowledgeable. It was fantastic seeing areas that are not open to the general public. our tour was just under 2 hours long, there is also the chance you may bump into Pope Benedict who lives in one of the buildings in the gardens.",
          "We did the 2 hour walking tour of the gardens in English. Our guide was very knowledgeable and informative. This was our second time in the gardens, and as with all of the tours we have been on several times we were shown different things -so well worth doing the tour a second",
          "Beautiful walk through the gardens. A chance to see things you wouldn't normally see like the villa used for receptions and the study used by pope John xxiii. And there are parrots flying around.",
          "Nice but too short for the price, we loved seeing the gardens but the tour lasted less than a hour.... This seemed very short considering the price.",
          "BUT KEEP OUT of the grass, or a guard will ask you \"can you read the sign? It is in several languages\". Just kiding, the guard was very polite, I was sitting with my friend in a bench, amazed by people walking over the grass, when he came and voil\u00e0. It is kind of confusing the",
          "When you are inside the Vatican Museum you can see the gardens and they are beautiful but you are not allowed down I. The garden to tour it. These are the grounds that the Pope lives on, his police live there and his Swiss Huardes live in this area. Remember the Pope doesn't",
          "We went on the vatican's very own guided walking tour of the gardens. This was a wonderful few hours for us as outdoor lovers, and a nice change from the hustle and bustle of the city! First tip. Book directly with the Vatican. This will save you a ton of money! The catch is -",
          "I booked a tour through Expedia with the Aloschi brothers tour & I'm so glad I did. You can't access the gardens without a special tour & the extra cost is worth it. The other sights in Vatican City are insanely crowded, the Sistine chapel gets 25,000 visitors per day! We were",
          "Nice open green spaces, an occasional monument here and there, and (most importantly) a place for us all to read and understand what we will not be able to photograph or to stand in any one place long enough to appreciate. It's like a human conveyor belt in there, folks. The",
          "The gardens are beautifully kept. You will want to spend time and enjoy the peaceful walk around the Gardens.",
          "We were blown away by the detail and beuty of these magnificent gardens. They have only been open for public since Francis became pope. You can only pass through the gardens as a part of a guided tour, not individually. Te tickets for the guided tour should be booked in",
          "Considering the fact that I have a hard time keeping my lawn mowed, the work put into this garden is impressive!",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect of this tour I am not a gardener and it was a very hot day!! Our guide was amazing the tour was very interesting and informative giving the history of Vatican hill and the gardens. It was very well paced the very young and the not so young alike",
          "We booked our tickets before we travelled (compulsory) and were not disappointed. The gardens are beautiful and our guide was very informative. The walk took about 2.5 hours but was not arduous, with stops at points of interest. Admission to the Vatican museums and Sistine",
          "Did this as part of a tour. There are many Parks and gardens in Rome but most are not well maintained. This is an exception, everything is perfectly manicured.",
          "I found out about the gardens during my visit to the Vatican about 20 years ago. I think the gardens are not too much known about or visited. I always make a point to visit as they are magnificent and extensive, covering many acres. I love the formal Italian gardens of",
          "Being in Vatican we also wanted to see these parks for some change from visiting all those museums with their extraordinary art treasuries. We did it through the one of the numerous tours offered by the local touristic agencies since there is no general public access to the",
          "To my knowing you have to visit with a tour. Can not buy entrance tickets to the Gardens. We booked with City Wonders and it was wonderful!! Try including the breakfast as we did. A very nice experience.",
          "Did not see enough! It was a battle between wanting to stay outside & soak up the beauty or go inside for shade. Us Brits are not used to 36 degree heat ;) I would have loved to stay longer.",
          "I wasn't sure how exciting might be to tour a garden, but this is of course no ordinary garden. First, the guide explains a bit of history, what was built here, what was built there, but I was pleasantly surprised to be so close to St. Peter's dome, it makes for great pics that",
          "The Vatican Gardens tour was really nice. Took about 45 minutes or so on a bus with an audioguide. Was very interesting and would recommend it to anyone who has time.",
          "The gardens are really beautiful, and they need much more and more time to explore this botanical miracle.",
          "Tourist guides will drive you crazy and the sheer amount of people very annoying. The museum was so busy we walked out. The Vatican itself was truly amazing. Just sitting there and taking it all in was a joy, and the buildings, monuments stunning. What a shame though you have",
          "This was a dream come true. I booked tickets 6 weeks in advance. When we arrived we were part of an English speaking group. Each visitor has an ear piece and then for the next two hours you are transported to one of the most privileged tours I have ever experienced. Our guide an",
          "These gardens are a peaceful reflection of the Vatican. They are beautifully kept. A visit to the gardens is highly recommended",
          "This was so neat to experience. We did this on a tour with city wonders. Lindee was our tour guide and she was phenomenal! It was truly an experience to see so many important sites and spiritual places throughout the gardens. We would definitely recommend taking a tour while",
          "I was a little disappointed with this tour. The upside was being outside, surrounded by greenery, strolling in the slightest of breezes on an otherwise 36 degrees of heat. There were a few pleasant surprises amongst which were the 1000 year old olive trees. However, I found it",
          "As part of our Vatican tour we added a trip around the gardens. What a brilliant tour after the mayhem of getting into the museum complex. The tour is a small group, about 20 ish, on a bus. We had the usual headphones and commentary, very good and worth listening to. The",
          "We booked this tour as part of the Vatican experience. It was a great way to see around the the gardens and fountains. However , my enduring memory will be of the various view we got of the magnificent St Peter's Basilica. The tour gave us plenty of places to get a photo through",
          "We visited during February 2016 and the gardens were in beautiful bloom! I was surprised since it was only about 40 degrees.",
          "This site is just absolutely gorgeous! You can see the detail and the enormous amount of work that goes into maintaining these grounds. A great ending to the tour of the Vatican and Sistene Chapel.",
          "While most visitors to the Vatican head straight for St Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, there is a much quieter and altogether more peaceful retreat just behind the vast complex that's as close to garden heaven as you can get. The Vatican Gardens are a unique work of",
          "The gardens are very beautiful and its a good time to relax in there while you're on your visit to Vatican!",
          "We found out that you can only see the Gardens if you buy a ticket for the Vatican Museums which includes a tour of the Gardens. You can do this online, but make sure it is well in advace of your trip. You can choose a tram or walking tour. We took the tram and it had earphones",
          "The gardens were beautiful and lots to see. The only thing was there is not much shade and it was boiling hot. Really beautiful gardens though.",
          "Second only to the stone/marble walls and statues in the Vatican are the gardens. The rich color and natural flora and fauna in the ancient backdrops makes for memorable images that are first captured personally before they can be filmed.",
          "The gardens have been added to by popes over the years as a place for reflection and peace. In the centre of Rome and the Holy City, they are indeed a places of beauty and peace. Guided tours only, either by foot or on an electic bus, the Gardens ticket includes admission to",
          "Peaceful and lovely. You just want to find a piece of shade and stay all day with someone to bring you tea in the afternoon. It's like being in a Ivory Coast film.",
          "The Vatican gardens are spectacular for all who love gardens. I saw the gardens several times and each time there is something new to look at. Very mellow and comforting space.",
          "The Gardens of the Vatican represents 65 % of the surface of the Vatican. It is well kept and gives relaxation to the ancients walls of the city. Walk through and breathe pure history with green all around",
          "So much history in beauty in these gardens! It was a perfect day in terms of weather and our tour guide was quite informative. They issue Whispers (headset with one earpiece) so you can hear. We had about 34 people in our group. Tip: purchase your ticket on-line in advance!",
          "It helped that we had a very good guide who was very informative. Worth paying the extra for as you would not get all the information yourself easily.",
          "Hard to believe that this sized garden exists in the centre of the Vatican, a peaceful place to avoid the crowds briefly",
          "These are the most beautiful gardens I have ever seen. It is just perfection in every way and can be seem from many view points around The Vatican .",
          "Beautiful gardens and worth a walk round, there is also posters of the Sistine Chapel explaining the art work. The gardens are well kept but again it's better to pick a good sunny day to visit.",
          "This gardens were part of our combined tour of the Vatican, Sistine Chapel and Basilica. Although not as impressive as the structures themselves, they provided a nice interlude to the indoor portions of the tour. That it threatened to rain but did not made it even better!",
          "We did a 45 min tour by bus, which we preferred to a 2 hours walk. The ticket includes a visit to the Sistine Chapel as well as the Museums. The tour is in an open bus, with audio explanation (not to extensive, just right) and leaves you in awe, for the gardens are vast,",
          "Me and my fianc\u00e9 booked a last minute tour to see the Vatican gardens, which was worth it. I recommend going to Vatican Gardens. it was well preserved and our tour was telling us which part of the gardens were some of the past Popes favorites. The rose garden was beautiful",
          "I could not visit as I was unaware of restriction. Book in advance to avoid last minute disappointment.",
          "Peaceful, quiet, a true oasis in a bustling place. The Vatican is an amazing but overwhelming place; a walk in the garden is the perfect way to let your soul find comfort.",
          "Gardens were very appealing and well manicured. It was a nice break to go outside in the fresh air, to have a view from the roof top. Great photo spot.",
          "We took the guided bus tour of the Vatican gardens, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The ticket is also good for the Vatican museums and Sistine chapel. The gardens are beautiful, and the narration excellent (different languages via head phones) Make reservations on line, as we saw",
          "This was nice to get out of the crowds a bit and let the kids run. While still busy i could at least breath here. An expresso and some sun hit the spot.",
          "Lovely manicure gardens wiTh fountains and statues there is a small cafe to get a drink if you so wish. There is also information on the Sistine chapel available for you to read before you continue your tour.",
          "How do you explain something as beautiful and calming as this, you can't, it's something you need to experience. Get your tickets early to avoid the crowds.",
          "We normally like gardens but the extra cost on top of Vatican museum and Sistine chapel made us think again. You can see the gardens from the museum windows and I'm glad we didn't bother to pay the extra. Manicured lawns and trees are ok but no flowers as far as we could see.",
          "If your going to the Vatican pa for the tour of the Vatican gardens, a trip through the footsteps of the past Popes and simply out standing to be able to sit by the private waterfalls where \\popes for centuries have contemplated life.. Shhh don't tell everyone...",
          "We were in the garden for about an hour. This is not enough. The price of this tour cost the same as the tour for inside the buildings, which we had for 3 hours. What was a bad impression of the tour is in the garden! Perheps tours can be more nicer in the summer, but in winter",
          "Expecting to be different from the other gardens but it turned out to be the same..there several gardens better than this. Nothing special!",
          "Expected far too much from this attraction. As gardens go, it's fine, but nothing special. We have seen much better for far less cost, but as it was included in other attraction cost it's worth doing.",
          "You can't tread on the grass but you can enjoy the peace and serenity of the established gardens - plenty of seats to rest when necessary and soak up the vista's",
          "Make sure you have comfortable footwear to travel around these extensive gardens, the work that went into creating such a spectacular place can be seen in the intricate architecture",
          "Beautiful gardens, so peaceful and serene. Like an oasis in an otherwise busy city. Well worth walking round.",
          "We visited Vatican gardens yesterday. Beautiful place even on winter time with magnificiant Magolia on blossom and plenty of fountains. On guided bus tour we heard a lot of Vaticans history. Need to visit next time on spring or on summer.",
          "Beautful area of the Vatican. Can only be reached by ordering a guided tour a long time in advance. And just connect to your group in good time, not be 5 minutes late as we were due to the traffic, we had to argue and almost cry to get through in to the garden to our guided",
          "Very well kept gardens and a really lovely walk round. Can imagine in the summer months that it would be too hot to walk round as not much shelter but it was delightful to do it in February.",
          "A nice spectacle of gardening Nothing astonishing but really beautifull. You must pay to get into the gardena Not reccomended for rainy days",
          "Just one of those serene moments in life where you are away from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet, still able to be part of this wonderful Roman History",
          "Wonderful to escape the crowds, and get a breath of fresh air. A huge golden globe that has more on offer. A range of pretty gardens and features with benches to rest on.",
          "A lovely and well manicured gardens, an ideal place to sit and take in your surroundings and reflect on what you've seen in the museums/your time in Rome.",
          "gardens are wll maintenend but not free to enter. also there is a guide fee to pay. If you dont have time and disposable budget, its second priority.",
          "We first saw these through the Vatican museum windows. They are so far away from the local hustle and bustle. Ian",
          "The gardens are very nice; however, when we were visiting there was restoration work and revisions being done in parts of the garden. Many people visit the gardens... some benches available for quite reflection.",
          "I visited Vatican Gardens when I was at Rome. After I made a tour of Vatican Musem, I drink a coffe in Vatican Gardens. The gardens are absolutlly magnificent.",
          "We chose the tour of the Vatican gardens by open bus and it was very nice to relax and listen to the comments while stopping at each famous statue, foutain or building. Definitively the best way to enjoy the beauties of the Vatican Gardens.",
          "We visited the Vatican gardens as part of a tour.A very peaceful and enjoyable visit. Would have liked to have spent longer but our guide kept us moving.",
          "As with most of Rome s tourist spots the gardens are both beautiful and breathtaking. Walking around letting your mind wander you can vision the many who have been there before you for many different reasons.......... from the prisoners to the garden experts and all have stood",
          "We viewed the garden from inside the Vatican Museum. It was lovely and peaceful. It's nice to imagine the Pope taking a quiet moment to walk in the sunshine and greenery. Though we didn't realize it, you can walk in the gardens through various tour operators.",
          "Enjoyed the beautiful gardens whilst escorted by an informative guide. You cannot visit on your own, you have to take a guide. We enjoyed a private tour.",
          "The gardens themselves are lovely and redolent with history. What really disappointed us is that we went to the Vatican City's own tour operator 'Pellegrini', on the left just beyond awesome Vatican colonnade, and we asked specifically for a walking tour of the Vatican gardens.",
          "Our Tour guide took us through the gardens. I thought they were well groomed and manicured. But didn't come to the Vatican to see the gardens. Take a look if you have time but time can be better spent in the museum.",
          "Great visual respite in the midst of the hallowed buildings of the Vatican; rather like sorbet eaten before your next course!",
          "The gardens came in handy as a place to clear your head from the enormous amount of art works inside.",
          "Overall I enjoyed the walking tour, but felt it moved a bit slow for me. I had booked my tour through the Vatican Ticket Office which also offers an open bus tour of the gardens. Along the way we saw other tour groups which appeared to be led by outside tour operators.",
          "Gardening at its finest in this climate is the best description I can give this opportunity. The grounds are surrounded by outdoor cafes and on our visit great sunshine. This is all part of your ticket to the Sistine Chapel and Museum.",
          "I wanted to go to see these but they are closed apart from Mondays. Later found out entry is EUR 25 which seems steep. Excellent view of them from the top of St Peter's.",
          "The tour was in a mini bus which was fine. The narrated tour guide was fine. The tour was purchased with a \"tour of the Sistine Chapel\". I assumed the bus would drive us to the Sistine Chapel and deposit us and offer a guide through the chapel. No, they brought us back to the",
          "I was lucky to visit on a beautiful warm sunny day that seemed to capture the beauty of the garden even more. Like all things in Rome, time is needed to soak in the surroundings, to appreciate what your eyes are seeing. Take time to just sit in the gardens and people watch or",
          "In this case, the wait is measured in months, as in the time necessary to get an advance tour in English. Not all Vatican tours include the gardens. It is possible to get a view, and some very nice photos from the gallery of the Vatican museum, but that will never match the",
          "Fantastic Gardens where you can see, when you come out of one part of the museum del vaticano; you find a nice Summer house \"La Casina\" and see also a grotte of Lourdes on the end of the gardens there are a place for helicopter landing; To discover and be amazing.",
          "My husband and I visited the Vatican and we really enjoyed it. The grounds are beautiful and there is so much history there to see and experience. I am not Roman Catholic but I really enjoyed the visit. The grounds are well kept and just a great part of the city to see.",
          "We had booked in advance so were able to walk straight in to enjoy the busy Vatican Gardens . Other people not so lucky in large queues",
          "It is not easy to book a tour of the Vatican Gardens. We scheduled months in advance for a tour in English. There was a German couple on our tour who said they have been trying to book a tour in German for 4 years. They finally settled on the English tour. The gardens are",
          "The Vatican Garden is accessible from the Courtyard of Vatican Museums. It can also be seen from the court yard for those who want to save more time for the Museums. Wheel chair cannot access the garden from the Court yard. We had a restful view of the Garden from the courtyard.",
          "These gardens are stunning. We found them accessible from the Vatican Museums. Very formal with St Peters Dome overlooking. Great photo ops. Crowded. Traditional and formal in style. Recommended as part of an all day St Peter's, Sistine Chapel, Vaican Museum tour",
          "the gardens at the Vatican were still nice although being October it was the end of the tourist season it was nice to escape the crowds the gardens were peaceful,there were lots of different trees some i have not seen before, also there were a few flowers still in bloom and the",
          "Only negative thing is it's too 'clinically' landscaped...couldn't find a better term...over landscaped maybe...but it is nice to walk around and views of it from the top are great...",
          "We booked the bus tour .. Took 40 mins. You really do not know what is behind St Peters but this tour was amazing, the gardens are peaceful and such a tranquil place.",
          "If you have time before entering the Museums, the gardens are a beautiful sideline of your visit. As you head up the stairs, there is a doorway that leads to a courtyard and garden that is below. Also during your tour there is a doorway that takes you out to the globe, which",
          "All the space is used to create peaceful niches that you can just take it in and relax. Notice the scale and grandeur yet the interplay of old and new.",
          "We took the 2 hour walking guided tour, and although it was raining still very much enjoyed. Lots of history and beautiful sculptures, fountains, and architecture. Ticket price also included entry into the museum, Sistine Chapel, and St. Peter's. Purchase online! Highly",
          "We went on a mini bus guided tour of the Vatican private gardens, complete with audio. It was very informative and enabled us to see parts of the garden not open to other members of the public. Well worth the ride.",
          "Considering the number of tourists that visit Vatican, Vatican gardens can be a good place for any tourist to spend some relaxing hours in the midst of nature. The place worth a visit even during rains.",
          "Definitely worth the effort. Book this tour in advance. It is very unique and something that not many people had the opportunity to see.",
          "Hadn't planned on seeing the Vatican Gardens was a late decision but glad I did, a good design and well maintained gardens, tour was very good, guide spoke very good English and very informative. I went on a very hot day with Vatican gardens not having a lot of shade would",
          "The gardens are beautiful and the guide knew her history and could tell us who donated each plant or statue and when and why. There was confusion on the part of the security staff as they insisted I check my umbrella while everyone else in the group had theirs; even the clerk",
          "We didn't see many people walking around, so the tour is definitely the way to go. The gardens would take hours to walk through. It's an impressive place full of history!",
          "Did not realise this was available until I got to ORP to collect my tickets. Only 28 people at a time can be driven around what effectively is the extent of the inside of Vatican City.",
          "I did not know at the beginning that a half of territory of Vatican is a huge park! The guide told us that initially it had agricultural purpose, but later it was organized as English park...It looks actually very Italian, very Mediterranean, very beautiful!!!",
          "Great visit and very well kept gardens. Fantastic exibits within the garden. This is included as part of a tour visit to the Vatican.",
          "the gardens are beautiful designed and maintained, and showcase a various styles from around the world. we took a bus tour which I would highly recommend as it allowed us to be in the shade. there are also lots of fountains and sculptures to look at.",
          "We took an organized guided trip to Vatican gardens by bus and didn't regret. It was informative,we started just in time, and we experienced the space that we couldn't have seen on foot.",
          "Nice to get away from the crowds, but was a little disappointed that they weren't bigger. Kind of felt though that you got a behind-the-scenes tour. If you have been to the Vatican before this is something new to see.",
          "We visited the Vatican Gardens without planning on doing so; and we were glad we visited the gardens. It was a nice 45 minute tour providing a nice view of the backside of the Vatican. We did the tour before doing the Vatican Museum before the weather got to hit and it was",
          "Treat yourself to a walking tour of the Vatican gardens when visiting the Vatican Museums. The added bonus is to avoid the lines for the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Basilica. It is easily booked in advance on the Vatican's web portal. The guided tour gives not only a view of",
          "You can view these lovely, old established gardens on the tour of the museum. They have old tall trees and flower beds, a peaceful recluse from the world.",
          "These gardens are quite small compared to Versailles. They are well kept, however, the day's heat does not allow you to spend any quality time there. Spaces in the shade are close to non existent. The cafeteria adjacent to the gardens has nice food for a reasonable price.",
          "We did the 45 minute garden tour by bus. Booked online from home and very good value as ticket includes entry to Vatican museum and Sistine Chapel. This means - most importantly - that when you turn up to enormous queues you are waved in with you booking forms. Commentary is",
          "We booked a walking tour around the Vatican Gardens with a guide. The guide gave us headphones at the beginning of the tour so we could hear him perfectly. The views are breathtaking and the fountains are marvellous. TIP: Bring a water bottle with you, that way when you",
          "We purchased the Vatican gardens through Expedia and the local operator was Carrani tours. Despite the long queues we skipped to the front of the line having purchased a morning tour ticket which meant missing out on skip the line as well which also has substantial queues. The",
          "Breathtaking views. Very good place to get some fantastic pictures. I felt that it was easy to get around here. I really enjoyed this.",
          "We booked Vatican Gardens open bus tour in advance and it was our best day in Rome. Audiogide was absolutely perfect. The tour was organized so we could see the best places of the gardens early in the morning and then we went to see the Vatican museums without queue.",
          "Breathtaking!! Best to come here in the am when they open to the public. Can be very crowded due to the influx of tourists to this popular site.",
          "We booked the two hour walking tour and it was great. Our guide was able to share fascinating facts, whilst also showing us the home of the retired Pope and the Sistine chapel from outside. We went at 11am which made it very hot, but the guide constantly looked for shade so we",
          "Very peaceful and tranquil garden. But it is not that interesting or exciting. If you have a lot of time, you can visit.",
          "such a tranquil spot amongst this almost hectic place, seemed strange looking down on it from the museum and was lovely to wander through.",
          "Well preserved and little interesting pockets here and there. I wish I had had more time to visit them",
          "Booked the two hour walking tour through the Vatican website , a nice tour at a gentle pace with lots of photo opportunities and fantastic views ,realy enjoyed it",
          "We visited the garden at a official Vatican tour.this tour is the only opportunity to see Vatican & surrounding from outside. the garden are beautiful built in various of styles, I recommend the tour. also it's give you the chance to visit the Vatican museums.",
          "We opted for the bus tour of the gardens initially to save my mum the walk, however it proved a good call as it also kept us out of the direct sun for a while (the sides are open but there\u2019s a cover overhead). I had pre booked tickets on line so headed straight to the booth to",
          "We would have liked longer here, if you get the chance spend half a day exploring the gardens and soaking up the atmosphere.",
          "It was one of the most amazing and mysterious and pretyy palces I saw in my life, I remember Iw as walking with my mom and we were looking at palms and amazing green egzotic plants I never seen before. I liked to take a pictures with every single palm tree with a place where",
          "We strolled through the gardens at our leisure after we had had our fill (overload) of gorgeous art. It was wonderful to enjoy a part of nature and see the crafted bushes. There was art around us and a lovely fountain. It brought a sense of peace after the crowded museum",
          "I booked a guided tour with a small bus and must say it was a relief to see things in a relaxed way. Just enjoying the surroundings, beautiful gardens, flowers, cactus, statues, buildings, fountains,...in a normal way. A must do when you visit the Vatican i think. I paid 5 euro",
          "Vatican Gardens are not a must-see, but a special place to visit if you have extra time and want to do something not everyone does.",
          "well laid out gardens in fine conditions. Lovely to rest here for a while when you get tired of seeing the marvellous Vatican Collections",
          "We booked the Vatican Gardens Walking Guided tour, which you book on line as the space is limited. I was so glad we booked this trip to see the Vatican Gardens, then you also get to see the Vatican Museum, Sistine Chapel, plus you can walk right into St. Peter's from the Sistine",
          "We secured our tickets on line before we left home. SO happy we did. It got us into 1 fastest of 3 lines to get in. This ground were gorgeous and pristine, The only thing I didn't like was seeing how dirty some of the statues on the grounds were. The Vatican is not supported by",
          "Once you have done this tour once I think it is enough... we paid an additional 20 Euro each to visit the gardens, but unsure if this was a good deal or not! It was in addition to visiting the museum and Sistine Chapel... with the Omnia card The tour of the historic and",
          "We booked with a tour of the Vatican gardens followed by museum and Sistine chapel. It was so quiet and peaceful what a gem away from the crowds , we were in a small group of twenty with a guide . It was such a wonderful haven - a treat not to be missed.",
          "Loved this tour of the gardens. Much better than walking in 90 degree weather. Plus admission to the museums and Sistine chapel and St Peters plus no standing in line. People stood outside for hours to get in. Not on this tour. Not even 5 minute wait. So lovely.",
          "This is easy to take in while inside the Vatican. It is lovely but you don't have to spend a lot of time here to get a feel of its beauty.",
          "I was invited to go along with a friend to attend a conference then we strolled around the gardens which we were told that it was a unique look amazing a little piece of heaven",
          "The Vatican Gardens is the kind of place you can only dream about. You can almost feel the history in this serene and calm piece of heaven. It's a far cry from the busy Vatican Museum. When you're here I urge you to soak it up and enjoy that moment in these beautiful gardens.",
          "Loved this tour. Small bus with earphones with information about the buildings, sculptures, and gardens within the Vatican walls.",
          "I loved the Vatican Gardens tour! I am not sure if it was because I have seen the Vatican or not, but this was my favorite part. The beauty of the grounds and all the different plants and trees from around the word are something sepical. Very few tour companies are allowed to do",
          "Ample self-reflecting space with various items to stimulate the senses such as the intricate details on the golden globe of the earth.",
          "Well, I guess it would take an year to see everything that Vatican has to offer. There is simply too much here. And if you are on half a day tour, you would just be doing enough to scratch the surface. In this time allocation quandary, the gardens perhaps lose out. But I would",
          "There are so many things to see just in the Vatican that it would be easy to pass up the gardens. Don't. Rome is a bustling city and the gardens provide an hour so of peaceful quiet. Very beautiful. Highly recommended when you visit the Vatican.",
          "The Gardens were fabulous, spend as much time as you can there and get information prior to going, the museum and gardens are spectacular!",
          "I am not a creature of nature but I really did think the gardens were stunning and the fragrant aroma of the flowers wafting in the air amongst the stunning gardens is really an experience to remember. We were carted around in a golf buggy type people carrier and it was quite",
          "I saw what I expected, being such a place. Maybe in summer time looks even better, but again I\u2019m thinking if the so many poor people around the world might have a better life if the Vatican will think to send them some help, by saving from the gardens maintenance.",
          "The Vatican open-air bus tour is a fairly new attraction in Rome. Although there is also a walking tour available of the grounds, this is a nice alternative, especially for those who are elderly or just plain too tired to walk the extensive grounds. Certain unique vistas of the",
          "I call it this because of the tour guide that made the experience. First, she was very animated, which made for wonderful discussions and feedback. Second, her knowledge of the environment and it's significance to the city were so intricate and thought-provoking. Third, and",
          "We booked a mini bus tour of the Vatican gardens before we left home. It included admission to the museum & Sistine Chapel, which we did after the bus tour. It also allowed us to skip all the queues. The ride is about 40min, the gardens are stunning and well worth the visit.",
          "If you want to get into the Vatican Gardens, you will need to purchase a guide tour ticket. This is the only area (that I know of) they need a guide to take you around due to security reason. (Apparently people might bump into Papa Francesco, The Pope) What you see apart from",
          "What a lovely peaceful place. Not to be missed. I would definitely recommend. We had breakfast in the gardens and it was so surreal. A beautiful place in a beautiful city",
          "You need to pay a special ticket to visit the gardens, on top of the ticket to visit only the museum. The gardens are much bigger than what you are authorized to visit. However, what you see is pretty, obviously well maintained. It is worth to spend 30-60 minutes there.",
          "We only went into the public areas of the gardens. Plenty of seating for a well earned rest after touring the museums.",
          "Very nice and pleasant if it is a nice day outside. A good break from the long day at the museum. Lots of information in the garden's as well.",
          "Nice to walk round these gardens knowing the Pope has also been walking in the same spot. These are very well kept and would suggest you book a guided tour to make the most of your time here. If not then you would be queueing for over two hours.",
          "This was quite and peaceful and a very welcome stop after the crowds in other areas of this vast place. The guide you choose is very important to understand the history and facts of this amazing place. Impressive gardens excellent gardeners.",
          "We visited this place with guided tour. I must say they do share best of their knowledge to the visitors to have information about the place they visiting. The garden is really beautiful for photography.",
          "We relaxed in these gardens just sitting there on one of the benches watching the stunning buildings the place is just mesmerising we loved it.",
          "And it does depend on the knowledge and experience of the guide. This was one of my favorite experiences in September 2012. It wasn't only a garden tour. My guide gave insight into the Vatican and the Pope (Benedict, at the time) as well as history and current events. We",
          "The Square and the Basilica were all the places we we've been to during our visit to the Vatican, but gladly, we were able to attend a Sunday afternoon mass, though Pope Francis wasn't the celebrator. Indeed, It is the House of God, with Its vastness and hugeness, with the",
          "Understanding a lot of things one sees here depends on the guide. This is many centuries old and has flourished yet borne the brunt of time.",
          "Not anywhere as crowded as other sites and is peaceful break from the huge crowds and press of people at many sites",
          "The gardens were lovely. I cannot imagine how they look in spring and summer. We only walked through two garden areas on the tour as it was cold and rainy, but we got some nice photographs and a good look at the gardens and their contents. From one of the terraces over the",
          "We had gotten online tickets to visit the Vatican Museum, but I had read somewhere that I could ask once I got there if they were conducting garden tours that day. They said yes, at 9:30 AM in English. The group was small and the guide very knowledgeable. My husband and I",
          "Pass if you're not ready to walk for 4 hours and only have a 15 minute restroom/coffee break before going into the sistine chapel. Nothing remarkable about the garden unless you'll like to get a good view of the basilica's dome.",
          "Nicely maintained gardens of the Vatican which just adds to the whole experience of visiting the Vatican. This, along with a visit to the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums, will easily take a whole day. Lots of walking so be prepared for that.",
          "Well laid out. Trees are in shape. Plenty of Cesar influence in this part of the city. Modern and nice... need more sun in order to enjoy.",
          "We only joined the Vatican Gardens tour in order to see the Via Triumphalis Necropolis on the day we had scheduled for Vatican City (combo tour was the only available option that day). If we could have skipped the gardens, we probably would have, since it really isn't anything",
          "The history, the buildings, garden and just everything! The place is huge, and so much to see! We even came before it opens and the que was enormous. But, we got in quickly, and had some hours here! Everyone who works here is so nice as well!",
          "I would expect nothing less than a well maintained and well kept gardens from the Vatican. Lovely gardens and combined with an visit to the Sistine Chapel this will definitely take up to the best part of a half day.",
          "The gardens can many best be seen from the top of St. Peter's but they can best be appreciated from waundering around the grounds.",
          "Definitely a paradise on this earth... between the sculptures, fountains, flowers and trees, the Vatican Gardens are mystical. There is also a new tour being created for the visually impaired and the hearing impaired so that even more people can benefits from the garden's beauty.",
          "The Gardens was the start to our day at the Vatican and it was so nice. Like others have mentioned, the Garden is not open to the public, so it's really calm and serene to walk through (which did not prepare me for the hordes of people I was to encounter later). There is a lot",
          "After the vast hordes of cattle baying for a 30 second view of the Sistine Chapel, this is a pleasant break.",
          "We luckily were in Rome on a very beautiful weekend sun was shining so stroll around these gardens was ideal there is a lovely fountain there",
          "This tour is only available if booked through the Vatican official website and is conducted by the Vaticans official Tour Guides. The Vatican Gardens are not available for viewing to the public so there was literally no one else at the gardens besides our tour group. Group size",
          "The Vatican gardens are amasingly huge and beautiful with many sculptures and buildings. It is worth to visit it, but the tour in the gardens a little bit long, so you have to choose between the gardens and the proper visit of the museum. Once in a lifetime everybody should go",
          "A tour of the Vatican Gardens is in my opinion not to be missed. The Gardens are beautiful and unique and filled with sculptures and fountains. The Fountain of the Eagle is breathtaking and very unique. Ensure that you book with a reputable guide. Soak in the serene",
          "Vatican gardens is an pleasant two hour addition to the Vatican museums visit. I was not overly excited as I saw many more beautiful gardens all over the world but it is still interesting place to visit. You have to book this tour in advance as it is very overrated as everything",
          "Don't miss out on this wonderful opportunity. The gardens are extremely beautiful, easy to wander through, peaceful and pretty. Our guide was Simona Labadyova and she made our visit extra special and informative. As well as speaking excellent English I understand that Simona",
          "Spent more than 2 hours in Vatican Museum u can rest among beautifl Pope garden. There is an amazing fountain in the middle of it and u can trully relax there, seeing the names of the artists on the wall of the museum on one hand, and on the other hand enjoy the view of St.",
          "The atmosphere itself is very beautiful. It's nice to see how much land these gardens take up. However, there is a lack of plants and flowers. The worst part is the tour guide that we had. A lot of questions were asked about specific plants and memorials and most of them he was",
          "If you visit Vatican city, you must go to the gardens and have a coffee there and take wonderfull pictures",
          "It beautiful to be able to walk around the gardens and see into parts of histroy. Eventhough a majority of the gardens are off limits to the general public, you still see some of the most beautiful parts. It almost looks like a whole different world.",
          "We booked with Viator tours there were 8 in our group all avid gardeners so we were excited . It was expensive about $175 each but the tour lasted 5 1/2 hours so you get your money worth. The gardens were not really blooming but so much of the garden is design and entails more",
          "Such a pretty and spiritual area (whether your Catholic or not). The gardens were beautiful. When we went, there was a light rain that made the colors really stand out against the gray weather.",
          "The Vatican gardens are very nice and relaxing although not all parts are open to public. A great place to relax after visiting the museums.",
          "I loved the Vatican garden - it was beautifully kept and very pretty. There are benches to sit on and lots of people were reading and eating their lunch. Lovely restful area.",
          "we hadnt enough time to visit numerous gardens of vatican,beause only the museum take more than 4 hours to visit,but when entered,we faced a big space of garden and flowers and the golden globe \"the sphere within the sphere\" monument which was great and lovely and took photos",

        "wiki": "The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican (Italian: Basilica Papale di San Pietro in Vaticano), or simply Saint Peter's Basilica (Latin: Basilica Sancti Petri), is a church built in the Renaissance style located in Vatican City, the papal enclave which is within the city of Rome.\nDesigned principally by Donato Bramante, Michelangelo, Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter's is the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world. While it is neither the mother church of the Catholic Church nor the cathedral of the Diocese of Rome (these equivalent titles being held by the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome), St. Peter's is regarded as one of the holiest Catholic shrines. It has been described as \"holding a unique position in the Christian world\" and as \"the greatest of all churches of Christendom\".Catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial site of Saint Peter, chief among Jesus's apostles and also the first Bishop of Rome (Pope). Saint Peter's tomb is supposedly directly below the high altar of the basilica. For this reason, many popes have been interred at St. Peter's since the Early Christian period. A church has stood on this site since the time of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Old St. Peter's Basilica dates from the 4th century AD. Construction of the present basilica began on 18 April 1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626.St. Peter's is famous as a place of pilgrimage and for its liturgical functions. The pope presides at a number of liturgies throughout the year both within the basilica or the adjoining St. Peter's Square; these liturgies draw audiences numbering from 15,000 to over 80,000 people. St. Peter's has many historical associations, with the Early Christian Church, the Papacy, the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-reformation and numerous artists, especially Michelangelo. As a work of architecture, it is regarded as the greatest building of its age. St. Peter's is one of the four churches in the world that hold the rank of major basilica, all four of which are in Rome. Contrary to popular misconception, it is not a cathedral because it is not the seat of a bishop; the cathedra of the pope as Bishop of Rome is at Saint John Lateran.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nSt. Peter's is a church built in the Renaissance style located in the Vatican City west of the River Tiber and near the Janiculum Hill and Hadrian's Mausoleum. Its central dome dominates the skyline of Rome. The basilica is approached via St. Peter's Square, a forecourt in two sections, both surrounded by tall colonnades. The first space is oval and the second trapezoidal. The fa\u00e7ade of the basilica, with a giant order of columns, stretches across the end of the square and is approached by steps on which stand two 5.55 metres (18.2 ft) statues of the 1st-century apostles to Rome, Saints Peter and Paul.The basilica is cruciform in shape, with an elongated nave in the Latin cross form but the early designs were for a centrally planned structure and this is still in evidence in the architecture. The central space is dominated both externally and internally by one of the largest domes in the world. The entrance is through a narthex, or entrance hall, which stretches across the building. One of the decorated bronze doors leading from the narthex is the Holy Door, only opened during jubilees.The interior dimensions are vast when compared to other churches. One author wrote: \"Only gradually does it dawn upon us \u2013 as we watch people draw near to this or that monument, strangely they appear to shrink; they are, of course, dwarfed by the scale of everything in the building. This in its turn overwhelms us.\"The nave which leads to the central dome is in three bays, with piers supporting a barrel-vault, the highest of any church. The nave is framed by wide aisles which have a number of chapels off them. There are also chapels surrounding the dome. Moving around the basilica in a clockwise direction they are: The Baptistery, the Chapel of the Presentation of the Virgin, the larger Choir Chapel, the altar of the Transfiguration, the Clementine Chapel with the altar of Saint Gregory, the Sacristy Entrance, the Altar of the Lie, the left transept with altars to the Crucifixion of Saint Peter, Saint Joseph and Saint Thomas, the altar of the Sacred Heart, the Chapel of the Madonna of Column, the altar of Saint Peter and the Paralytic, the apse with the Chair of Saint Peter, the altar of Saint Peter raising Tabitha, the altar of St. Petronilla, the altar of the Archangel Michael, the altar of the Navicella, the right transept with altars of Saint Erasmus, Saints Processo and Martiniano, and Saint Wenceslas, the altar of St. Jerome, the altar of Saint Basil, the Gregorian Chapel with the altar of the Madonna of Succour, the larger Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, the Chapel of Saint Sebastian and the Chapel of the Piet\u00e0. The Monuments, in a clockwise direction, are to: Maria Clementina Sobieski, The Stuarts, Benedict XV, John XXIII, St. Pius X, Innocent VIII, Leo XI, Innocent XI, Pius VII, Pius VIII, Alexander VII, Alexander VIII, Paul III, Urban VIII, Clement X, Clement XIII, Benedict XIV, St Peter (Bronze Statue), Gregory XVI, Gregory XIV, Gregory XIII, Matilda of Canossa, Innocent XII, Pius XII, Pius XI, Christina of Sweden, Leo XII.  \nAt the heart of the basilica, beneath the high altar, is the Confessio or Chapel of the Confession, in reference to the confession of faith by St. Peter, which led to his martyrdom. Two curving marble staircases lead to this underground chapel at the level of the Constantinian church and immediately above the purported burial place of Saint Peter.\nThe entire interior of St. Peter's is lavishly decorated with marble, reliefs, architectural sculpture and gilding. The basilica contains a large number of tombs of popes and other notable people, many of which are considered outstanding artworks. There are also a number of sculptures in niches and chapels, including Michelangelo's Piet\u00e0. The central feature is a baldachin, or canopy over the Papal Altar, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The apse culminates in a sculptural ensemble, also by Bernini, and containing the symbolic Chair of Saint Peter.\nOne observer wrote: \"St Peter's Basilica is the reason why Rome is still the center of the civilized world. For religious, historical, and architectural reasons it by itself justifies a journey to Rome, and its interior offers a palimpsest of artistic styles at their best ...\"The American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson described St. Peter's as \"an ornament of the earth ... the sublime of the beautiful.\"\n\n\n== Status ==\n\nSt. Peter's Basilica is one of the papal basilicas (previously styled \"patriarchal basilicas\") and one of the four Major Basilicas of Rome, the other Major Basilicas (all of which are also Papal Basilicas) being the Basilicas of St. John Lateran, St. Mary Major, and St. Paul outside the Walls. The rank of major basilica confers on St. Peter's Basilica precedence before all minor basilicas worldwide. However, unlike all the other Papal Major Basilicas, it is wholly within the territory, and thus the sovereign jurisdiction, of the Vatican City State, and not that of Italy. This is in contrast to the other three Papal Major Basilicas, which are within Italian territory and not the territory of the Vatican City State. (Lateran Treaty of 1929, Article 15 (Ibidem)) However, the Holy See fully owns these three basilicas, and Italy is legally obligated to recognize its full ownership thereof (Lateran Treaty of 1929, Article 13 (Ibidem)) and to concede to all of them \"the immunity granted by International Law to the headquarters of the diplomatic agents of foreign States\" (Lateran Treaty of 1929, Article 15 (Ibidem)).\nIt is the most prominent building in the Vatican City. Its dome is a dominant feature of the skyline of Rome. Probably the largest church in Christendom, it covers an area of 2.3 hectares (5.7 acres). One of the holiest sites of Christianity and Catholic Tradition, it is traditionally the burial site of its titular, St. Peter, who was the head of the twelve Apostles of Jesus and, according to tradition, the first Bishop of Antioch and later the first Bishop of Rome, rendering him the first Pope. Although the New Testament does not mention St. Peter's martyrdom in Rome, tradition, based on the writings of the Fathers of the Church, holds that his tomb is below the baldachin and altar of the Basilica in the \"Confession\". For this reason, many Popes have, from the early years of the Church, been buried near Pope St. Peter in the necropolis beneath the Basilica. Construction of the current basilica, over the old Constantinian basilica, began on 18 April 1506 and finished in 1615. At length, on 18 November 1626 Pope Urban VIII solemnly dedicated the Basilica.St. Peter's Basilica is neither the Pope's official seat nor first in rank among the Major Basilicas of Rome. This honour is held by the Pope's cathedral, the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran which is the mother church of all churches in communion with the Catholic Church. However, St. Peter's is certainly the Pope's principal church in terms of use because most Papal liturgies and ceremonies take place there due to its size, proximity to the Papal residence, and location within the Vatican City proper. The \"Chair of Saint Peter\", or cathedra, an ancient chair sometimes presumed to have been used by St. Peter himself, but which was a gift from Charles the Bald and used by many popes, symbolizes the continuing line of apostolic succession from St. Peter to the reigning Pope. It occupies an elevated position in the apse of the Basilica, supported symbolically by the Doctors of the Church and enlightened symbolically by the Holy Spirit.As one of the constituent structures of the historically and architecturally significant Vatican City, St. Peter's Basilica was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984 under criteria (i), (ii), (iv), and (vi). With an exterior area of 21,095 square metres (227,060 sq ft), an interior area of 15,160 square metres (163,200 sq ft), St. Peter's Basilica is the largest Christian church building in the world by the two latter metrics and the second largest by the first as of 2016. The top of its dome, at 448.1 feet (136.6 m), also places it as the second tallest building in Rome as of 2016. The dome's soaring height placed it among the tallest buildings of the Old World, and it continues to hold the title of tallest dome in the world. Though the largest dome in the world by diameter at the time of its completion, it no longer holds this distinction.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Saint Peter's burial site ===\n\nAfter the crucifixion of Jesus, it is recorded in the Biblical book of the Acts of the Apostles that one of his twelve disciples, Simon known as Saint Peter, a fisherman from Galilee, took a leadership position among Jesus' followers and was of great importance in the founding of the Christian Church. The name Peter is \"Petrus\" in Latin and \"Petros\" in Greek, deriving from \"petra\" which means \"stone\" or \"rock\" in Greek, and is the literal translation of the Aramaic \"Kepa\", the name given to Simon by Jesus. (John 1:42, and see Matthew 16:18)\nCatholic tradition holds that Peter, after a ministry of thirty-four years, travelled to Rome and met his martyrdom there along with Paul on 13 October 64 AD during the reign of the Roman Emperor Nero. His execution was one of the many martyrdoms of Christians following the Great Fire of Rome. According to Origen, Peter was crucified head downwards, by his own request because he considered himself unworthy to die in the same manner as Jesus. The crucifixion took place near an ancient Egyptian obelisk in the Circus of Nero.  The obelisk now stands in St. Peter's Square and is revered as a \"witness\" to Peter's death. It is one of several ancient Obelisks of Rome.According to tradition, Peter's remains were buried just outside the Circus, on the Mons Vaticanus across the Via Cornelia from the Circus, less than 150 metres (490 ft) from his place of death. The Via Cornelia was a road which ran east-to-west along the north wall of the Circus on land now covered by the southern portions of the Basilica and St. Peter's Square. A shrine was built on this site some years later. Almost three hundred years later, Old St. Peter's Basilica was constructed over this site.The area now covered by the Vatican City had been a cemetery for some years before the Circus of Nero was built. It was a burial ground for the numerous executions in the Circus and contained many Christian burials, because for many years after the burial of Saint Peter many Christians chose to be buried near Peter.\nIn 1939, in the reign of Pope Pius XII, 10 years of archeological research began under the crypt of the basilica in an area inaccessible since the 9th century. The excavations revealed the remains of shrines of different periods at different levels, from Clement VIII (1594)  to Callixtus II (1123) and Gregory I (590\u2013604), built over an aedicula containing fragments of bones that were folded in a tissue with gold decorations, tinted with the precious murex purple. Although it could not be determined with certainty that the bones were those of Peter, the rare vestments suggested a burial of great importance. On 23 December 1950, in his pre-Christmas radio broadcast to the world, Pope Pius XII announced the discovery of Saint Peter's tomb.\n\n\n=== Old St. Peter's Basilica ===\n\nOld St. Peter's Basilica was the 4th-century church begun by the Emperor Constantine the Great between 319 and 333 AD. It was of typical basilical form, a wide nave and two aisles on each side and an apsidal end, with the addition of a transept or bema, giving the building the shape of a tau cross. It was over 103.6 metres (340 ft) long, and the entrance was preceded by a large colonnaded atrium. This church had been built over the small shrine believed to mark the burial place of St. Peter, though the tomb was \"smashed\" in 846 AD.  It contained a very large number of burials and memorials, including those of most of the popes from St. Peter to the 15th century. Like all of the earliest churches in Rome, both this church and its successor had the entrance to the east and the apse at the west end of the building. Since the construction of the current basilica, the name Old St. Peter's Basilica has been used for its predecessor to distinguish the two buildings.\n\n\n=== Plan to rebuild ===\nBy the end of the 15th century, having been neglected during the period of the Avignon Papacy, the old basilica had fallen into disrepair. It appears that the first pope to consider rebuilding, or at least making radical changes was Pope Nicholas V (1447\u201355). He commissioned work on the old building from Leone Battista Alberti and Bernardo Rossellino and also had Rossellino design a plan for an entirely new basilica, or an extreme modification of the old. His reign was frustrated by political problems and when he died, little had been achieved.  He had, however, ordered the demolition of the Colosseum and by the time of his death, 2,522 cartloads of stone had been transported for use in the new building. The foundations were completed for a new transept and choir to form a domed Latin cross with the preserved nave and side aisles of the old basilica. Some walls for the choir had also been built.Pope Julius II planned far more for St Peter's than Nicholas V's program of repair or modification. Julius was at that time planning his own tomb, which was to be designed and adorned with sculpture by Michelangelo and placed within St Peter's.  In 1505 Julius made a decision to demolish the ancient basilica and replace it with a monumental structure to house his enormous tomb and \"aggrandize himself in the popular imagination\".  A competition was held, and a number of the designs have survived at the Uffizi Gallery. A succession of popes and architects followed in the next 120 years, their combined efforts resulting in the present building. The scheme begun by Julius II continued through the reigns of Leo X (1513\u20131521), Hadrian VI (1522\u20131523). Clement VII (1523\u20131534), Paul III (1534\u20131549), Julius III (1550\u20131555), Marcellus II (1555), Paul IV (1555\u20131559), Pius IV (1559\u20131565), Pius V (saint) (1565\u20131572), Gregory XIII (1572\u20131585), Sixtus V (1585\u20131590), Urban VII (1590), Gregory XIV (1590\u20131591), Innocent IX (1591), Clement VIII (1592\u20131605), Leo XI (1605), Paul V (1605\u20131621), Gregory XV (1621\u20131623), Urban VIII (1623\u20131644) and Innocent X (1644\u20131655).\n\n\n=== Financing with indulgences ===\nOne method employed to finance the building of St. Peter's Basilica was the granting of indulgences in return for contributions. A major promoter of this method of fund-raising was Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg, who had to clear debts owed to the Roman Curia by contributing to the rebuilding program. To facilitate this, he appointed the German Dominican preacher Johann Tetzel, whose salesmanship provoked a scandal.A German Augustinian priest, Martin Luther, wrote to Archbishop Albrecht arguing against this \"selling of indulgences\". He also included his \"Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences\", which came to be known as The 95 Theses. This became a factor in starting the Reformation, the birth of Protestantism.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Successive plans ===\n\nPope Julius' scheme for the grandest building in Christendom was the subject of a competition for which a number of entries remain intact in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. It was the design of Donato Bramante that was selected, and for which the foundation stone was laid in 1506. This plan was in the form of an enormous Greek Cross with a dome inspired by that of the huge circular Roman temple, the Pantheon. The main difference between Bramante's design and that of the Pantheon is that where the dome of the Pantheon is supported by a continuous wall, that of the new basilica was to be supported only on four large piers. This feature was maintained in the ultimate design. Bramante's dome was to be surmounted by a lantern with its own small dome but otherwise very similar in form to the Early Renaissance lantern of Florence Cathedral designed for Brunelleschi's dome by Michelozzo.Bramante had envisioned that the central dome would be surrounded by four lower domes at the diagonal axes. The equal chancel, nave and transept arms were each to be of two bays ending in an apse. At each corner of the building was to stand a tower, so that the overall plan was square, with the apses projecting at the cardinal points. Each apse had two large radial buttresses, which squared off its semi-circular shape.When Pope Julius died in 1513, Bramante was replaced with Giuliano da Sangallo and Fra Giocondo, who both died in 1515 (Bramante himself having died the previous year). Raphael was confirmed as architect of St. Peter's on 1 August 1514. The main change in his plan is the nave of five bays, with a row of complex apsidal chapels off the aisles on either side. Raphael's plan for the chancel and transepts made the squareness of the exterior walls more definite by reducing the size of the towers, and the semi-circular apses more clearly defined by encircling each with an ambulatory.In 1520 Raphael also died, aged 37, and his successor Baldassare Peruzzi maintained changes that Raphael had proposed to the internal arrangement of the three main apses, but otherwise reverted to the Greek Cross plan and other features of Bramante. This plan did not go ahead because of various difficulties of both Church and state. In 1527 Rome was sacked and plundered by Emperor Charles V. Peruzzi died in 1536 without his plan being realized.At this point Antonio da Sangallo the Younger submitted a plan which combines features of Peruzzi, Raphael and Bramante in its design and extends the building into a short nave with a wide fa\u00e7ade and portico of dynamic projection. His proposal for the dome was much more elaborate of both structure and decoration than that of Bramante and included ribs on the exterior. Like Bramante, Sangallo proposed that the dome be surmounted by a lantern which he redesigned to a larger and much more elaborate form. Sangallo's main practical contribution was to strengthen Bramante's piers which had begun to crack.On 1 January 1547 in the reign of Pope Paul III, Michelangelo, then in his seventies, succeeded Sangallo the Younger as \"Capomaestro\", the superintendent of the building program at St Peter's. He is to be regarded as the principal designer of a large part of the building as it stands today, and as bringing the construction to a point where it could be carried through. He did not take on the job with pleasure; it was forced upon him by Pope Paul, frustrated at the death of his chosen candidate, Giulio Romano and the refusal of Jacopo Sansovino to leave Venice. Michelangelo wrote \"I undertake this only for the love of God and in honour of the Apostle.\" He insisted that he should be given a free hand to achieve the ultimate aim by whatever means he saw fit.\n\n\n=== Michelangelo's contribution ===\nMichelangelo took over a building site at which four piers, enormous beyond any constructed since ancient Roman times, were rising behind the remaining nave of the old basilica. He also inherited the numerous schemes designed and redesigned by some of the greatest architectural and engineering minds of the 16th century. There were certain common elements in these schemes. They all called for a dome to equal that engineered by Brunelleschi a century earlier and which has since dominated the skyline of Renaissance Florence, and they all called for a strongly symmetrical plan of either Greek Cross form, like the iconic St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, or of a Latin Cross with the transepts of identical form to the chancel, as at Florence Cathedral.\nEven though the work had progressed only a little in 40 years, Michelangelo did not simply dismiss the ideas of the previous architects. He drew on them in developing a grand vision. Above all, Michelangelo recognized the essential quality of Bramante's original design. He reverted to the Greek Cross and, as Helen Gardner expresses it: \"Without destroying the centralising features of Bramante's plan, Michelangelo, with a few strokes of the pen converted its snowflake complexity into massive, cohesive unity.\"As it stands today, St. Peter's has been extended with a nave by Carlo Maderno. It is the chancel end (the ecclesiastical \"Eastern end\") with its huge centrally placed dome that is the work of Michelangelo. Because of its location within the Vatican State and because the projection of the nave screens the dome from sight when the building is approached from the square in front of it, the work of Michelangelo is best appreciated from a distance. What becomes apparent is that the architect has greatly reduced the clearly defined geometric forms of Bramante's plan of a square with square projections, and also of Raphael's plan of a square with semi-circular projections. Michelangelo has blurred the definition of the geometry by making the external masonry of massive proportions and filling in every corner with a small vestry or stairwell. The effect created is of a continuous wall-surface that is folded or fractured at different angles, but lacks the right-angles which usually define change of direction at the corners of a building. This exterior is surrounded by a giant order of Corinthian pilasters all set at slightly different angles to each other, in keeping with the ever-changing angles of the wall's surface. Above them the huge cornice ripples in a continuous band, giving the appearance of keeping the whole building in a state of compression.\n\n\n=== Dome: successive and final designs ===\n\nThe dome of St. Peter's rises to a total height of 136.57 metres (448.1 ft) from the floor of the basilica to the top of the external cross. It is the tallest dome in the world. Its internal diameter is 41.47 metres (136.1 ft), slightly smaller than two of the three other huge domes that preceded it, those of the Pantheon of Ancient Rome, 43.3 metres (142 ft), and Florence Cathedral of the Early Renaissance, 44 metres (144 ft). It has a greater diameter by approximately 30 feet (9.1 m) than Constantinople's Hagia Sophia church, completed in 537. It was to the domes of the Pantheon and Florence duomo that the architects of St. Peter's looked for solutions as to how to go about building what was conceived, from the outset, as the greatest dome of Christendom.\n\n\n==== Bramante and Sangallo, 1506 and 1513 ====\n\nThe dome of the Pantheon stands on a circular wall with no entrances or windows except a single door. The whole building is as high as it is wide. Its dome is constructed in a single shell of concrete, made light by the inclusion of a large amount of the volcanic stones tuff and pumice. The inner surface of the dome is deeply coffered which has the effect of creating both vertical and horizontal ribs, while lightening the overall load. At the summit is an ocular opening 8 metres (26 ft) across which provides light to the interior.Bramante's plan for the dome of St. Peter's (1506) follows that of the Pantheon very closely, and like that of the Pantheon, was designed to be constructed in Tufa Concrete for which he had rediscovered a formula. With the exception of the lantern that surmounts it, the profile is very similar, except that in this case the supporting wall becomes a drum raised high above ground level on four massive piers. The solid wall, as used at the Pantheon, is lightened at St. Peter's by Bramante piercing it with windows and encircling it with a peristyle.\nIn the case of Florence Cathedral, the desired visual appearance of the pointed dome existed for many years before Brunelleschi made its construction feasible. Its double-shell construction of bricks locked together in herringbone pattern (re-introduced from Byzantine architecture), and the gentle upward slope of its eight stone ribs made it possible for the construction to take place without the massive wooden formwork necessary to construct hemispherical arches. While its appearance, with the exception of the details of the lantern, is entirely Gothic, its engineering was highly innovative, and the product of a mind that had studied the huge vaults and remaining dome of Ancient Rome.Sangallo's plan (1513), of which a large wooden model still exists, looks to both these predecessors. He realized the value of both the coffering at the Pantheon and the outer stone ribs at Florence Cathedral. He strengthened and extended the peristyle of Bramante into a series of arched and ordered openings around the base, with a second such arcade set back in a tier above the first. In his hands, the rather delicate form of the lantern, based closely on that in Florence, became a massive structure, surrounded by a projecting base, a peristyle and surmounted by a spire of conic form. According to James Lees-Milne the design was \"too eclectic, too pernickety and too tasteless to have been a success\".\n\n\n==== Michelangelo and Giacomo della Porta, 1547 and 1585 ====\n\nMichelangelo redesigned the dome in 1547, taking into account all that had gone before. His dome, like that of Florence, is constructed of two shells of brick, the outer one having 16 stone ribs, twice the number at Florence but far fewer than in Sangallo's design. As with the designs of Bramante and Sangallo, the dome is raised from the piers on a drum. The encircling peristyle of Bramante and the arcade of Sangallo are reduced to 16 pairs of Corinthian columns, each of 15 metres (49 ft) high which stand proud of the building, connected by an arch. Visually they appear to buttress each of the ribs, but structurally they are probably quite redundant. The reason for this is that the dome is ovoid in shape, rising steeply as does the dome of Florence Cathedral, and therefore exerting less outward thrust than does a hemispherical dome, such as that of the Pantheon, which, although it is not buttressed, is countered by the downward thrust of heavy masonry which extends above the circling wall.The ovoid profile of the dome has been the subject of much speculation and scholarship over the past century. Michelangelo died in 1564, leaving the drum of the dome complete, and Bramante's piers much bulkier than originally designed, each 18 metres (59 ft) across. Following his death, the work continued under his assistant Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola with Giorgio Vasari appointed by Pope Pius V as a watchdog to make sure that Michelangelo's plans were carried out exactly. Despite Vignola's knowledge of Michelangelo's intentions, little happened in this period. In 1585 the energetic Pope Sixtus appointed Giacomo della Porta who was to be assisted by Domenico Fontana. The five-year reign of Sixtus was to see the building advance at a great rate.\n\nMichelangelo left a few drawings, including an early drawing of the dome, and some details. There were also detailed engravings published in 1569 by Stefan du P\u00e9rac who claimed that they were the master's final solution. Michelangelo, like Sangallo before him, also left a large wooden model. Giacomo della Porta subsequently altered this model in several ways. The major change restored an earlier design, in which the outer dome appears to rise above, rather than rest directly on the base. Most of the other changes were of a cosmetic nature, such as the adding of lion's masks over the swags on the drum in honour of Pope Sixtus and adding a circlet of finials around the spire at the top of the lantern, as proposed by Sangallo.A drawing by Michelangelo indicates that his early intentions were towards an ovoid dome, rather than a hemispherical one.  In an engraving in Galasso Alghisi' treatise (1563), the dome may be represented as ovoid, but the perspective is ambiguous. Stefan du P\u00e9rac's engraving (1569) shows a hemispherical dome, but this was perhaps an inaccuracy of the engraver. The profile of the wooden model is more ovoid than that of the engravings, but less so than the finished product. It has been suggested that Michelangelo on his death bed reverted to the more pointed shape. However, Lees-Milne cites Giacomo della Porta as taking full responsibility for the change and as indicating to Pope Sixtus that Michelangelo was lacking in the scientific understanding of which he himself was capable.\n\nHelen Gardner suggests that Michelangelo made the change to the hemispherical dome of lower profile in order to establish a balance between the dynamic vertical elements of the encircling giant order of pilasters and a more static and reposeful dome. Gardner also comments, \"The sculpturing of architecture [by Michelangelo] ... here extends itself up from the ground through the attic stories and moves on into the drum and dome, the whole building being pulled together into a unity from base to summit.\"It is this sense of the building being sculptured, unified and \"pulled together\" by the encircling band of the deep cornice that led Eneide Mignacca to conclude that the ovoid profile, seen now in the end product, was an essential part of Michelangelo's first (and last) concept. The sculptor/architect has, figuratively speaking, taken all the previous designs in hand and compressed their contours as if the building were a lump of clay. The dome must appear to thrust upwards because of the apparent pressure created by flattening the building's angles and restraining its projections. If this explanation is the correct one, then the profile of the dome is not merely a structural solution, as perceived by Giacomo della Porta; it is part of the integrated design solution that is about visual tension and compression. In one sense, Michelangelo's dome may appear to look backward to the Gothic profile of Florence Cathedral and ignore the Classicism of the Renaissance, but on the other hand, perhaps more than any other building of the 16th century, it prefigures the architecture of the Baroque.\n\n\n==== Completion ====\n\nGiacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana brought the dome to completion in 1590, the last year of the reign of Sixtus V. His successor, Gregory XIV, saw Fontana complete the lantern and had an inscription to the honour of Sixtus V placed around its inner opening. The next pope, Clement VIII, had the cross raised into place, an event which took all day, and was accompanied by the ringing of the bells of all the city's churches. In the arms of the cross are set two lead caskets, one containing a fragment of the True Cross and a relic of St. Andrew and the other containing medallions of the Holy Lamb.In the mid-18th century, cracks appeared in the dome, so four iron chains were installed between the two shells to bind it, like the rings that keep a barrel from bursting. As many as ten chains have been installed at various times, the earliest possibly planned by Michelangelo himself as a precaution, as Brunelleschi did at Florence Cathedral.\nAround the inside of the dome is written, in letters 1.4 metres (4.6 ft) high:\n\nTV ES PETRVS ET SVPER HANC PETRAM AEDIFICABO ECCLESIAM MEAM. TIBI DABO CLAVES REGNI CAELORVM(\"... you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church. ... I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ...\" Vulgate, Matthew 16:18\u201319.)\nBeneath the lantern is the inscription:\n\nS. PETRI GLORIAE SIXTVS PP. V. A. M. D. XC. PONTIF. V.(To the glory of St Peter; Sixtus V, pope, in the year 1590, the fifth of his pontificate.)\n\n\n==== Discovery of Michelangelo draft ====\n\nOn 7 December 2007, a fragment of a red chalk drawing of a section of the dome of the basilica, almost certainly by the hand of Michelangelo, was discovered in the Vatican archives. The drawing shows a small precisely drafted section of the plan of the entablature above two of the radial columns of the cupola drum. Michelangelo is known to have destroyed thousands of his drawings before his death. The rare survival of this example is probably due to its fragmentary state and the fact that detailed mathematical calculations had been made over the top of the drawing.\n\n\n=== Changes of plan ===\nOn 18 February 1606, under Pope Paul V, the dismantling of the remaining parts of the Constantinian basilica began. The marble cross that had been set at the top of the pediment by Pope Sylvester and Constantine the Great was lowered to the ground. The timbers were salvaged for the roof of the Borghese Palace and two rare black marble columns, the largest of their kind, were carefully stored and later used in the narthex. The tombs of various popes were opened, treasures removed and plans made for re-interment in the new basilica.\n\nThe Pope had appointed Carlo Maderno in 1602. He was a nephew of Domenico Fontana and had demonstrated himself as a dynamic architect. Maderno's idea was to ring Michelangelo's building with chapels, but the Pope was hesitant about deviating from the master's plan, even though he had been dead for forty years. The Fabbrica or building committee, a group drawn from various nationalities and generally despised by the Curia who viewed the basilica as belonging to Rome rather than Christendom, were in a quandary as to how the building should proceed. One of the matters that influenced their thinking was the Counter-Reformation which increasingly associated a Greek Cross plan with paganism and saw the Latin Cross as truly symbolic of Christianity. The central plan also did not have a \"dominant orientation toward the east.\"Another influence on the thinking of both the Fabbrica and the Curia was a certain guilt at the demolition of the ancient building. The ground on which it and its various associated chapels, vestries and sacristies had stood for so long was hallowed. The only solution was to build a nave that encompassed the whole space. In 1607 a committee of ten architects was called together, and a decision was made to extend Michelangelo's building into a nave. Maderno's plans for both the nave and the facade were accepted. The building began on 7 May 1607, and proceeded at a great rate, with an army of 700 labourers being employed. The following year, the fa\u00e7ade was begun, in December 1614 the final touches were added to the stucco decoration of the vault and early in 1615 the partition wall between the two sections was pulled down. All the rubble was carted away, and the nave was ready for use by Palm Sunday.\n\n\n==== Maderno's facade ====\n\nThe facade designed by Maderno, is 114.69 metres (376.3 ft) wide and 45.55 metres (149.4 ft) high and is built of travertine stone, with a giant order of Corinthian columns and a central pediment rising in front of a tall attic surmounted by thirteen statues: Christ flanked by eleven of the Apostles (except Saint Peter, whose statue is left of the stairs) and John the Baptist.\n\nThe inscription below the cornice on the 1 metre (3.3 ft) tall frieze reads:\n\nIN HONOREM PRINCIPIS APOST PAVLVS V BVRGHESIVS ROMANVS PONT MAX AN MDCXII PONT VII(In honour of the Prince of Apostles, Paul V Borghese, a Roman, Supreme Pontiff, in the year 1612, the seventh of his pontificate)\n(Paul V (Camillo Borghese), born in Rome but of a Sienese family, liked to emphasize his \"Romanness.\")\nThe facade is often cited as the least satisfactory part of the design of St. Peter's. The reasons for this, according to James Lees-Milne, are that it was not given enough consideration by the Pope and committee because of the desire to get the building completed quickly, coupled with the fact that Maderno was hesitant to deviate from the pattern set by Michelangelo at the other end of the building. Lees-Milne describes the problems of the fa\u00e7ade as being too broad for its height, too cramped in its details and too heavy in the attic story. The breadth is caused by modifying the plan to have towers on either side. These towers were never executed above the line of the facade because it was discovered that the ground was not sufficiently stable to bear the weight. One effect of the facade and lengthened nave is to screen the view of the dome, so that the building, from the front, has no vertical feature, except from a distance.\n\n\n==== Narthex and portals ====\nBehind the fa\u00e7ade of St. Peter's stretches a long portico or \"narthex\" such as was occasionally found in Italian churches. This is the part of Maderno's design with which he was most satisfied. Its long barrel vault is decorated with ornate stucco and gilt, and successfully illuminated by small windows between pendentives, while the ornate marble floor is beamed with light reflected in from the piazza. At each end of the narthex is a theatrical space framed by ionic columns and within each is set a statue, an equestrian figure of Charlemagne (18th century) by Cornacchini in the south end and The Vision of Constantine (1670) by Bernini in the north end.\nFive portals, of which three are framed by huge salvaged antique columns, lead into the basilica. The central portal has a bronze door created by Antonio Averulino c. 1440 for the old basilica and somewhat enlarged to fit the new space.\n\n\n==== Maderno's nave ====\n\nTo the single bay of Michelangelo's Greek Cross, Maderno added a further three bays. He made the dimensions slightly different from Michelangelo's bay, thus defining where the two architectural works meet. Maderno also tilted the axis of the nave slightly. This was not by accident, as suggested by his critics. An ancient Egyptian obelisk had been erected in the square outside, but had not been quite aligned with Michelangelo's building, so Maderno compensated, in order that it should, at least, align with the Basilica's fa\u00e7ade.The nave has huge paired pilasters, in keeping with Michelangelo's work. The size of the interior is so \"stupendously large\" that it is hard to get a sense of scale within the building. The four cherubs who flutter against the first piers of the nave, carrying between them two holy water basins, appear of quite normal cherubic size, until approached. Then it becomes apparent that each one is over 2 metres high and that real children cannot reach the basins unless they scramble up the marble draperies. The aisles each have two smaller chapels and a larger rectangular chapel, the Chapel of the Sacrament and the Choir Chapel. These are lavishly decorated with marble, stucco, gilt, sculpture and mosaic. Remarkably, all of the large altarpieces, with the exception of the Holy Trinity by Pietro da Cortona in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, have been reproduced in mosaic.  Two precious paintings from the old basilica, Our Lady of Perpetual Help and Our Lady of the Column are still being used as altarpieces.\nMaderno's last work at St. Peter's was to design a crypt-like space or \"Confessio\" under the dome, where the cardinals and other privileged persons could descend in order to be nearer to the burial place of the apostle. Its marble steps are remnants of the old basilica and around its balustrade are 95 bronze lamps.\n\n\n=== Influence on church architecture ===\nThe design of St. Peter's Basilica, and in particular its dome, has greatly influenced church architecture in Western Christendom. Within Rome, the huge domed church of Sant'Andrea della Valle was designed by Giacomo della Porta before the completion of St Peter's Basilica, and subsequently worked on by Carlo Maderno. This was followed by the domes of San Carlo ai Catinari, Sant'Agnese in Agone, and many others. Christopher Wren's dome at St Paul's Cathedral (London, England), the domes of Karlskirche (Vienna, Austria), St. Nicholas Church (Prague, Czech Republic), and the Pantheon (Paris, France) all pay homage to St Peter's Basilica.\nThe 19th and early-20th-century architectural revivals brought about the building of a great number of churches that imitate elements of St Peter's to a greater or lesser degree, including St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago, St. Josaphat's Basilica in Milwaukee, Immaculate Heart of Mary in Pittsburgh and Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral in Montreal, which replicates many aspects of St Peter's on a smaller scale. Post-Modernism has seen free adaptations of St Peter's in the Basilica of Our Lady of Liche\u0144, and the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro.\n\n\n== Bernini's furnishings ==\n\n\n=== Pope Urban VIII and Bernini ===\nAs a young boy Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598\u20131680) visited St. Peter's with the painter Annibale Carracci and stated his wish to build \"a mighty throne for the apostle\". His wish came true. As a young man, in 1626, he received the patronage of Pope Urban VIII and worked on the embellishment of the Basilica for 50 years. Appointed as Maderno's successor in 1629, he was to become regarded as the greatest architect and sculptor of the Baroque period. Bernini's works at St. Peter's include the baldachin (baldaquin, from Italian: baldacchino), the Chapel of the Sacrament, the plan for the niches and loggias in the piers of the dome and the chair of St. Peter.\n\n\n==== Baldacchino and niches ====\n\nBernini's first work at St. Peter's was to design the baldacchino, a pavilion-like structure 28.74 metres (94.3 ft) tall and claimed to be the largest piece of bronze in the world, which stands beneath the dome and above the altar. Its design is based on the ciborium, of which there are many in the churches of Rome, serving to create a sort of holy space above and around the table on which the Sacrament is laid for the Eucharist and emphasizing the significance of this ritual. These ciboria are generally of white marble, with inlaid coloured stone. Bernini's concept was for something very different. He took his inspiration in part from the baldachin or canopy carried above the head of the pope in processions, and in part from eight ancient columns that had formed part of a screen in the old basilica. Their twisted barley-sugar shape had a special significance as they were modelled on those of the Temple of Jerusalem and donated by the Emperor Constantine. Based on these columns, Bernini created four huge columns of bronze, twisted and decorated with laurel leaves and bees, which were the emblem of Pope Urban.\n\nThe baldacchino is surmounted not with an architectural pediment, like most baldacchini, but with curved Baroque brackets supporting a draped canopy, like the brocade canopies carried in processions above precious iconic images. In this case, the draped canopy is of bronze, and all the details, including the olive leaves, bees, and the portrait heads of Urban's niece in childbirth and her newborn son, are picked out in gold leaf. The baldacchino stands as a vast free-standing sculptural object, central to and framed by the largest space within the building. It is so large that the visual effect is to create a link between the enormous dome which appears to float above it, and the congregation at floor level of the basilica. It is penetrated visually from every direction, and is visually linked to the Cathedra Petri in the apse behind it and to the four piers containing large statues that are at each diagonal.As part of the scheme for the central space of the church, Bernini had the huge piers, begun by Bramante and completed by Michelangelo, hollowed out into niches, and had staircases made inside them, leading to four balconies. There was much dismay from those who thought that the dome might fall, but it did not. On the balconies Bernini created showcases, framed by the eight ancient twisted columns, to display the four most precious relics of the basilica: the spear of Longinus, said to have pierced the side of Christ, the veil of Veronica, with the miraculous image of the face of Christ, a fragment of the True Cross discovered in Jerusalem by Constantine's mother, Helena, and a relic of Saint Andrew, the brother of Saint Peter. In each of the niches that surround the central space of the basilica was placed a huge statue of the saint associated with the relic above. Only Saint Longinus is the work of Bernini. (See below)\n\n\n==== Bernini's Towers ====\n\nUrban had long been a critic of Bernini's predecessor, Carlo Maderno. His disapproval of the architect's work stemmed largely from the Maderno's design for the longitudinal nave of St. Peters, which was widely condemned for obscuring Michelangelo's dome. When the Pope gave the commission to Bernini he therefore requested that a new design for the facade's bell towers to be submitted for consideration. Baldinucci describes Bernini's tower as consisting of \"two orders of columns and pilasters, the first order being Corinthian\" and \"a third or attic story formed of pilasters and two columns on either side of the open archway in the center\".\nUrban desired the towers to be completed by a very specific date: 29 June 1641, the feast day dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. To this end an order was issued which stated that \"all work should take a second seat to that of the campanile.\" The south tower was completed on time even in spite of these issues, but records show that in the wake of the unveiling the Pope was not content with what he saw and he ordered the top level of Bernini's tower removed so that the structure could be made even grander. The tower continued to grow, and as the construction began to settle the first cracks started to appear followed by Urban's infamous public admonishment of his architect.\nIn 1642 all work on both towers came to a halt. Bernini had to pay the cost for the demolition; eventually the idea of completing the bell towers was abandoned.\n\n\n==== Cathedra Petri and Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament ====\n\nBernini then turned his attention to another precious relic, the so-called Cathedra Petri or \"throne of St. Peter\" a chair which was often claimed to have been used by the apostle, but appears to date from the 12th century. As the chair itself was fast deteriorating and was no longer serviceable, Pope Alexander VII determined to enshrine it in suitable splendor as the object upon which the line of successors to Peter was based. Bernini created a large bronze throne in which it was housed, raised high on four looping supports held effortlessly by massive bronze statues of four Doctors of the Church, Saints Ambrose and Augustine representing the Latin Church and Athanasius and John Chrysostom, the Greek Church. The four figures are dynamic with sweeping robes and expressions of adoration and ecstasy. Behind and above the cathedra, a blaze of light comes in through a window of yellow alabaster, illuminating, at its centre, the Dove of the Holy Spirit. The elderly painter, Andrea Sacchi, had urged Bernini to make the figures large, so that they would be seen well from the central portal of the nave. The chair was enshrined in its new home with great celebration of 16 January 1666.Bernini's final work for St. Peter's, undertaken in 1676, was the decoration of the Chapel of the Sacrament. To hold the sacramental Host, he designed a miniature version in gilt bronze of Bramante's Tempietto, the little chapel that marks the place of the death of St. Peter. On either side is an angel, one gazing in rapt adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome. Bernini died in 1680 in his 82nd year.\n\n\n== St. Peter's Piazza ==\n\nTo the east of the basilica is the Piazza di San Pietro, (St. Peter's Square). The present arrangement, constructed between 1656 and 1667, is the Baroque inspiration of Bernini who inherited a location already occupied by an Egyptian obelisk which was centrally placed, (with some contrivance) to Maderno's facade. The obelisk, known as \"The Witness\", at 25.31 metres (83.0 ft) and a total height, including base and the cross on top, of 40 metres (130 ft), is the second largest standing obelisk, and the only one to remain standing since its removal from Egypt and re-erection at the Circus of Nero in 37 AD, where it is thought to have stood witness to the crucifixion of Saint Peter. Its removal to its present location by order of Pope Sixtus V and engineered by Domenico Fontana on 28 September 1586, was an operation fraught with difficulties and nearly ending in disaster when the ropes holding the obelisk began to smoke from the friction. Fortunately this problem was noticed by Benedetto Bresca, a sailor of Sanremo, and for his swift intervention, his town was granted the privilege of providing the palms that are used at the basilica each Palm Sunday.\n\nThe other object in the old square with which Bernini had to contend was a large fountain designed by Maderno in 1613 and set to one side of the obelisk, making a line parallel with the facade. Bernini's plan uses this horizontal axis as a major feature of his unique, spatially dynamic and highly symbolic design. The most obvious solutions were either a rectangular piazza of vast proportions so that the obelisk stood centrally and the fountain (and a matching companion) could be included, or a trapezoid piazza which fanned out from the facade of the basilica like that in front of the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena. The problems of the square plan are that the necessary width to include the fountain would entail the demolition of numerous buildings, including some of the Vatican, and would minimize the effect of the facade. The trapezoid plan, on the other hand, would maximize the apparent width of the facade, which was already perceived as a fault of the design.Bernini's ingenious solution was to create a piazza in two sections. That part which is nearest the basilica is trapezoid, but rather than fanning out from the facade, it narrows. This gives the effect of countering the visual perspective. It means that from the second part of the piazza, the building looks nearer than it is, the breadth of the facade is minimized and its height appears greater in proportion to its width. The second section of the piazza is a huge elliptical circus which gently slopes downwards to the obelisk at its centre. The two distinct areas are framed by a colonnade formed by doubled pairs of columns supporting an entablature of the simple Tuscan Order.\nThe part of the colonnade that is around the ellipse does not entirely encircle it, but reaches out in two arcs, symbolic of the arms of \"the Catholic Church reaching out to welcome its communicants\".  The obelisk and Maderno's fountain mark the widest axis of the ellipse. Bernini balanced the scheme with another fountain in 1675. The approach to the square used to be through a jumble of old buildings, which added an element of surprise to the vista that opened up upon passing through the colonnade. Nowadays a long wide street, the Via della Conciliazione, built by Mussolini after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaties, leads from the River Tiber to the piazza and gives distant views of St. Peter's as the visitor approaches, with the basilica acting as a terminating vista.Bernini's transformation of the site is entirely Baroque in concept. Where Bramante and Michelangelo conceived a building that stood in \"self-sufficient isolation\", Bernini made the whole complex \"expansively relate to its environment\". Banister Fletcher says \"No other city has afforded such a wide-swept approach to its cathedral church, no other architect could have conceived a design of greater nobility ... (it is) the greatest of all atriums before the greatest of all churches of Christendom.\"\n\n\n== Clock ==\nThe top of the facade of St. Peter's Basilica has two clocks and several sculptures. The clocks were created to replace Bernini's bell towers which had to be torn down due to insufficient support. The left clock shows Rome time, the one of the right shows European mean time. The statues are Christ the Redeemer, St. John the Baptist and 11 Apostles. From the left: St. Thadeus, St. Matthew, St. Philip, St. Thomas, St. James the Greater, St. John the Baptist, The Redeemer, St. Andrew, St. John the Evangelist, St. James the Lesser, St. Bartholomew, St. Simeon, and St. Matthias. Above the Roman clock is the coat of arms for the city-state of Vatican City since 1931 held by two angels. The European mean time clock only shows an hour hand and it is about half an hour behind the rome time. The European mean time also be an attempt to keep the Devil guessing about \"the day and the hour.\"\n\n\n== Bells ==\nThe Basilica has 6 bells, placed in the room under the Roman clock, only 3 of them are visible from ground level while the rest are hidden behind the bourdon. They range from the smallest which is 260 kg to the massive bourdon that approximately weighs 9 tonnes. From 1931, the bells are operated electrically, thus permitting even the largest bell to be tolled from a distance. The oldest bell Rota dates from 1288 and the bourdon called Campanone is rung at Christmas and Easter, on the Solemnity of Sts. Peter and Paul, and every time the Pope imparts the \"Urbi et Orbi\" blessing to the city and to the world. Campanone also announces the election of a new pope.\n\n\n== Treasures ==\n\n\n=== Tombs and relics ===\n\nThere are over 100 tombs within St. Peter's Basilica (extant to various extents), many located beneath the Basilica. These include 91 popes, Saint Ignatius of Antioch, Holy Roman Emperor Otto II, and the composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. Exiled Catholic British royalty James Francis Edward Stuart and his two sons, Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Benedict Stuart, Cardinal Bishop of Frascati, are buried here, having been granted asylum by Pope Clement XI. Also buried here are Maria Clementina Sobieska, wife of James Francis Edward Stuart, Queen Christina of Sweden, who abdicated her throne in order to convert to Catholicism, and Countess Matilda of Tuscany, supporter of the Papacy during the Investiture Controversy. The most recent interment was Pope John Paul II, on 8 April 2005. Beneath, near the crypt, is the recently discovered vaulted 4th-century \"Tomb of the Julii\". (See below for some descriptions of tombs).\n\n\n=== Artworks ===\n\n\n==== Towers and narthex ====\nIn the towers to either side of the facade are two clocks. The clock on the left has been operated electrically since 1931. Its oldest bell dates from 1288.\nOne of the most important treasures of the basilica is a mosaic set above the central external door. Called the \"Navicella\", it is based on a design by Giotto (early 14th century) and represents a ship symbolizing the Christian Church. The mosaic is mostly a 17th-century copy of Giotto's original.\nAt each end of the narthex is an equestrian figure, to the north Constantine the Great by Bernini (1670) and to the south Charlemagne by Cornacchini (18th century).\nOf the five portals from the narthex to the interior, three contain notable doors. The central portal has the Renaissance bronze door by Antonio Averulino (called Filarete) (1455), enlarged to fit the new space. The southern door, the Door of the Dead, was designed by 20th-century sculptor Giacomo Manz\u00f9 and includes a portrait of Pope John XXIII kneeling before the crucified figure of Saint Peter.\nThe northernmost door is the \"Holy Door\" which, by tradition, is walled-up with bricks, and opened only for holy years such as the Jubilee year by the Pope. The present door is bronze and was designed by Vico Consorti in 1950 and cast in Florence by the Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry. Above it are inscriptions commemorating the opening of the door: PAVLVS V PONT MAX ANNO XIII and GREGORIVS XIII PONT MAX.Recently installed commemorative plaques read above the door as follows:\n\nPAVLVS VI PONT MAX HVIVS PATRIARCALIS VATICANAE BASILICAE PORTAM SANCTAM APERVIT ET CLAVSIT ANNO IVBILAEI MCMLXXVPaul VI, Pontifex Maximus, opened and closed the holy door of this patriarchal Vatican basilica in the jubilee year of 1975.\nIOANNES PAVLVS II P.M.

One foot of the statue is largely worn away by pilgrims kissing it for centuries.\nThe sunken Confessio leading to the Vatican Grottoes (see above) contained a large kneeling statue by Canova of Pope Pius VI, who was captured and mistreated by Napoleon Bonaparte's army.  This has now been moved to the back (eastern) end of the grottoes.\nIn the Confessio is the Niche of the Pallium (\"Niche of Stoles\") which contains a bronze urn, donated by Pope Benedict XIV, to contain white stoles embroidered with black crosses and woven with the wool of lambs blessed on St. Agnes' day.\nThe High Altar is surmounted by Bernini's baldachin. (See above)\nSet in niches within the four piers supporting the dome are the larger-than-life statues associated with the basilica's primary holy relics: Saint Helena holding the True Cross and the Holy Nails, by Andrea Bolgi; Saint Longinus holding the spear that pierced the side of Jesus, by Bernini (1639); Saint Andrew with the St. Andrew's Cross, by Francois Duquesnoy and Saint Veronica holding her veil with the image of Jesus' face, by Francesco Mochi.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== North aisle ====\nIn the first chapel of the north aisle is Michelangelo's Piet\u00e0.\nOn the first pier in the right aisle is the monument of Queen Christina of Sweden, who abdicated in 1654 in order to convert to Catholicism.\nThe second chapel, dedicated to Saint Sebastian, contains the statues of popes Pius XI and Pius XII. The space below the altar used to be the resting place of Pope Innocent XI but his remains were moved to the Altar of the Transfiguration on 8 April 2011. This was done to make way for the body of Pope John Paul II. His remains were placed beneath the altar on 2 May 2011.\nThe large chapel on the right aisle is the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament which contains the tabernacle by Bernini (1664) resembling Bramante's Tempietto at San Pietro in Montorio supported by two kneeling angels and with behind it a painting of the Holy Trinity by Pietro da Cortona.\nNear the altar of Our Lady of Succour are the monuments of popes Gregory XIII by Camillo Rusconi (1723) and Gregory XIV.\nAt the end of the aisle is an altar containing the relics of Saint Petronilla and with an altarpiece The Burial of St Petronilla by Guercino (Giovanni Francesco Barbieri), 1623.\n\n\n==== South aisle ====\nThe first chapel in the south aisle is the baptistry, commissioned by Pope Innocent XII and designed by Carlo Fontana, (great nephew of Domenico Fontana). The font was carved from the lid of the purple porphyry sarcophagus which had once held the remains of the Emperor Hadrian, and is surmounted with a gilt-bronze figure of the \"Lamb of God\". Fontana's reworked porphyry sarcophagus lid font replaced an earlier font, which was re-purposed from the sarcophagus of Probus, the 4th-century Prefect of Rome, and which was used for baptisms from the 15th century until the late 17th century, when Fontana's work was completed.\nAgainst the first pier of the aisle is the Monument to the Royal Stuarts: James Stuart, known as the \"Old Pretender\" and his sons, Charles Edward, known as \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\", and Henry, a cardinal. The tomb is a Neo-Classical design by Canova unveiled in 1819. Opposite it is the memorial of James Francis Edward Stuart's wife, Maria Clementina Sobieska.\nThe second chapel is that of the Presentation of the Virgin and contains the memorials of Pope Benedict XV and Pope John XXIII.\nAgainst the piers are the tombs of Pope Pius X and Pope Innocent VIII.\nThe large chapel off the south aisle is the Choir Chapel which contains the altar of the Immaculate Conception.\nAt the entrance to the Sacristy is the tomb of Pope Pius VIII\nThe south transept contains the altars of Saint Thomas, Saint Joseph and the Crucifixion of Saint Peter.\nThe tomb of Fabio Chigi, Pope Alexander VII, towards the end of the aisle, is the work of Bernini and called by Lees-Milne \"one of the greatest tombs of the Baroque Age\". It occupies an awkward position, being set in a niche above a doorway into a small vestry, but Bernini has utilized the doorway in a symbolic manner. Pope Alexander kneels upon his tomb, facing outward. The tomb is supported on a large draped shroud in patterned red marble, and is supported by four female figures, of whom only the two at the front are fully visible. They represent Charity and Truth. The foot of Truth rests upon a globe of the world, her toe being pierced symbolically by the thorn of Protestant England. Coming forth, seemingly, from the doorway as if it were the entrance to a tomb, is the skeletal winged figure of Death, its head hidden beneath the shroud, but its right hand carrying an hourglass stretched upward towards the kneeling figure of the pope.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Archpriests since 1053 ==\n\nList of archpriests of the Vatican Basilica:\n\n\n== Specifications ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndex of Vatican City-related articles\nList of basilicas in Italy\nList of Roman Catholic basilicas\nArchitecture of cathedrals and great churches\nList of oldest church buildings\nList of tallest buildings in Rome\nArchitecture of Rome\nList of largest domes\nHistory of early modern period domes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVaticanstate.va \u2013 official website with images and information about the Basilica\n\"Virtual Reality Tour of the Basilica of Saint Peter\"\nSt Peter's Basilica.info \u2012 unofficial website on the basilica, with images and text from different books.\n360 Degree Photographs Inside Saint Peter's Basilica\nGoogle Maps: Vatican \u2012 Satellite image of the Basilica",

          "The Cathedral is the seat of the Catholic church & the Papal residence in the Vatican. Entry is free to all unless you want to skip the queue. There is total security check before you walk up the entrance. Reading a guide book in advance is useful as there are many facts that",
          "Nice view of Benito Mussolini layout changes outside the church from the top. Don't take the lift, the climb is great experience. The interior of the church is a bit average, just seems old and pretencious.",
          " St. Peter's Basilica, located in the Vatican, is one of the most important buildings in the Christian world. According to tradition, the basilica stands at the burial place of St. Peter, recognized by Catholics as the first pope - his grave lies under the main altar. It is a",
          "Simply stunning! Emense in size and beauty. You can't fully understand the size and beauty of everything you're looking at unless you're there.",
          "Memorable and Indescribable! The most imposing of all the Basilicas! The history of St. Peter's Basilica begins in the fourth century, when Emperor Constantine decided to build a basilica on the site where the apostle had been buried.",
          "After seeing our fair share of churches throughout Italy, this one sure is impressive! It's absolutely huge! And going down the center aisle of the church, there are markers indicating where other world churches end, showing just how massive this one is!",
          "Brilliant Place, Must go there and highly recommended. I am very sure that you guys will love to go there and enjoy your stay.",
          "For me, this is one of the finest attractions to see in the world. You read about it, see it on the tv, but nothing will prepare you for actually being there and going inside.",
          "Here's my thing - I'm an atheist, but I can still appreciate the beauty of places like this. It's beautiful and shiny and full of gold and history and gorgeous art and culture. However, it's also built by an institution that doesn't care about poor people and loves to flaunt",
          "There are really no words to describe to experience at this beautiful cathedral. It was very emotional and spiritual for us. The beauty of the architecture and preserved history is absolutely amazing!",
          "Gobsmacking art work, from Michaelangelo\u2019s Pieta just inside to the right, to Bernini\u2019s throne and the artwork on the walls\u2014all mosaics that look like paintings. Do climb the stairs to the top of the dome. The views are unmatched.",
          "Another fascinating place to see in Rome, one of many, sadly 4 days is just not enough to see it all. We visited as part of the golf buggie tour.",
          "You do have to go through security to get into St Peter's and be careful with your dress code. Amazing paintings and very ornate inside.",
          "St. Peter\u2019s is just magic when you walk in the size of the place will amaze you, it is out of this world to say the least and to see where past pope lay to rest is something else, Don\u2019t miss this as it is out of this world",
          "What an amazing Basilica, even better that it was very quiet when we went. Be prepared for the steps to the top all 360, if you are claustrophobic then go with caution as it is a small confined space to get to the top but well worth the view on a clear day.",
          "St. Peter's Basilica is absolutely stunning, both inside and out. We had to wait 30 minutes in line to get in (can't imagine how long the wait would be in summer) and another 15-20 minutes to climb the dome. Note that you will pass a security check (but bringing bottled water is",
          "The Basilica was'nt for me but the climb to the magnificant Dome was the highlight of all my visits to Rome. The view over Rome was awesome",
          "Be early if you want to avoid long queues. We arrived 8:05 AM and we need to wait 30 minutes in a queue before we passes security. Two hours later queue to security check was several hundred meters. You need to have proper clothes to have access to basilica. Shirt without",
          "One of the most beautiful views in the Vatican, but the climb is not for the faint hearted. Entry to the church is free of charge but to climb the dome is \u20ac8, or \u20ac10 per person if you want to take the lift half way. You can only pay by cash on entry, but also be aware that there",
          "If you are only going to go to one place in Vatican city, for my money a guided tour of Saint Peters basilica is the place to go.",
          "We went on a Thursday in March. Hardly any queue to get past security or into the church. The actual church is free, the dome is not and is \u20ac8 each. We decided to just see the church and we were not disappointed. Huge and opulent. There was a free museum of antiquities inside",
          "The moment you enter the Basilica you are stunned- the size of it immediately just strikes you. The decorations are extremely impressive and there is so much to see! Highly, highly recommended. Tickets are not supposed to be expensive, even skip the line tickets.",
          "After traveling around Spain, France and Italy for the past month and a half I\u2019ve seen my fair share of churches. This one, however, stands in a class by itself. The sheer size of the structure is monumental. The art, sculptures and furnishings inside are all first rate",
          "Absolutely amazing, luckily not too busy when we visited, and weather was fabulous. Only thing that annoyed me was the number of people trying to sell me a tour. Polite no works though.",
          "Enjoyed our tour of the Vatican City and St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. Beautiful inside and so much history. Our guide was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions of this beautiful facility.",
          "When visiting Saint Peter Basilica, you are in the largest church in the world. The majesty of this building is near incomprehensible. It's size, the inherent art and beauty, the symbolism, and the history all combine to make this one of the best places in the world to visit.",
          "I think the photos say it all! Overwhelming beyond your religious or lack of religious beliefs. Free entry. Our third visit\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Wow, outside I wasn't overly impressed, there's better things in Rome Inside looks great from the pictures but I didn't have 2.5 hours to do a guided tour also wasn't prepared to queue for at least 1.5 hours or pay 50\u20ac each to skip the queue",
          "A quite breathtaking and awe-inspiring experience, perhaps this is the finest cathedral I\u2019ll ever set foot in. We queued for about fifty minutes but it was ultimately so worthwhile in the end. Don\u2019t be put off by the queue \u2013 this is a must.",
          "Again like most of Rome- must see. Together with Vatican museum. Even only like art and history is beautiful",
          "Visited this place during our trip to Rome last summer. As always the place is very crowded and there is a huge queue to get it so it takes some patience but it's all worth it once you get inside, definitely one of the must visits while in Rome and if you have more time then you",
          "I visited St. Peter's 20 years ago and although I was impressed at the time I am not sure I really appreciated just how breathtaking amazing the place is. The last time I was here was 2 years ago, but because of the queues and our limited time we decided not to wait to go in.",
          "No words to express.It is so beautiful, .Visited early morning with guide so it was not at all crowded.",
          "We spent the day in Rome and made a visit to St. Peter's. It is always a thrill to visit and see this remarkable place!",
          "After the vatican museums and sistine chapel. Then climbing to top of Castel Sant' Angelo we then ventured to the Basilica dome! I had to keep stopping on the 320 steps after the elevator but it was so worth the pain for the views. The Basilica was so beautiful too. Cannot",
          "An awe inspiring building of immense scale and grandeur. If you only see one site in Rome it has to be this one. Pre order tickets on line as the queues are ridiculous and ticket touts are everywhere.",
          "A renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the largest and greatest church in the world. Catholics believe the basilica is the burial site of St Peter, chief among Jesus's apostles and also the first bishop of Rome(Pope). The basilica is approached via St Peter's square.",
          "We did a full encompassing tour in ended in the Basilica which was not as crowded as the Vatican itself , the grandiose height of the possibility of fitting of the Statue of liberty",
          "Didnt buy the skip-the-line ticket. Saw the queue and didnt want to wait. But the end of the queue was this american couple who told us the line was fast moving. So we decided to try. About 200m of queue in abt 30mins or less. Relief! Biggest church in the world. Inside was",
          "As a Catholic, I had always been eager to visit the Vatican. St. Peter\u2019s Basilica was the highlight of my trip to Italy. Of course, you don\u2019t need to be Catholic (or religious) to appreciate the church\u2019s beauty. The sheer size is amazing along with the fact that they can",
          "What a beautiful building. Amazing to see the many works of art in the building. The sheet size of it is awe inspiring.",
          "We have visited the Basilica last Saturday and it was great to get in and see it so empty since it was closing soon. We had a quiet visit and seen it. Although it\u2019s not my type of place to visit I still enjoyed the architecture",
          "The stunningly beautiful St. Peter's Basilica is without question the most beautiful church that I have ever had the pleasure to visit. Its size and its grandeur is incredibly impressive, so much so that there's almost too much to absorb. My advice is to take a minute, sit down",
          "Went there with my 10 and 6 year old and they both loved it. It really is breathtaking and somewhere you could spend hours looking at all the detail. Don't miss it!",
          "Just the walk up the avenue is spectacular but doesn't prepare you for At Peters square. However trying to get in takes an age even with queue jumping tickets and at \u20ac53 each it's expensive",
          "This is a must on any trip to Rome. So much to see and enjoy. We climbed the 551 stairs to explore the top of the dome... Do not do this if your not fit (I'm certain not) we did not pay attention to the signs, once you start the climb there is no way to turn back, 4 days later",
          "Monumental visit on the historical city of Vatican, totally worth it. The panoramic view is breathtaking.",
          "Personally I prefer the under stated grandness of French and British Cathedrals to the oppulence of this Basilica. It's grand and impressive and I'm really glad that I've been to see it but I couldn't help wishing that someone had told the Romans that sometime less is more.",
          "Coming from a non-conformist background this beautiful, opulent building reeks of political power with superstition (rubbing a statue's foot) and idolatry rather than a Christian message of piety and humility. That said; as a building it is stunning and the art work remarkable.",
          "These views are to die for. The inside of the basillica was beautiful. The line outside to get through security was massive. Make sure to have time to get through the line.",
          "Queued up but not for so long. *Best tip - buy tickets beforehand to avoid worst of queues* Saw all the parts, museum, Sistine Chapel and Basilica. *Second tip - pay the extra for the Dome climb * We climbed up to the terrace of the Basilica to stand behind the statues on the",
          "as per my other posts it was so busy when we went. Very interesting to take a look around and see how big this place is.",
          "Wow. So much wow. Inside and out is breath taking. We prebooked a tour of the museums, Sistine chapel and St Peters. This is absolutely the way to go. Entrance is on the opposite side of the city from St Peters and with ticket in hand you walk right up. I was here in",
          "It\u2019s free. Don\u2019t pay to skip the line. Just get there as it opens or before 8am!! There is still a queue but it takes 30 mins. We came out at ten and the queue was across the square!! The cathedral is huge.",
          "Just as the title suggests...Be sure to arrive early. We went twice on an anniversary trip to Rome. We would get there around 9am in February and had a very short line. Once inside it will take your breath away. Be sure to climb the dome for an unforgettable experience and",
          "For some this is the centre of their being, i visited merely to say I'd been to the smallest principality on the planet and send a post card. I was there Tuesday morning, it was busy, Wednesday is when the Pope maked an address must be hellish. This and the museums seem to be",
          "We did the City Wonders tour that started at 10:00 with the museum's and ended after 14:00 in the Basilica. There was a lot to take in and a lot of walking as well. Absolutely knackered at the end but definitely worth it and not to be missed.",
          "Fantastic and impressive to see even from the square. I understood that entry to the Basilica is free. Now there was big lines and main entry were closed.",
          "Everything was so, wonderful and the details are just amazing. Everytime you look, you see or notice something else",
          "The special one the only one and greatest of all , we were lucky to see our daughter perform in this Basilica",
          "What can I say, seen lots of churches now, great to see this one, it\u2019s pretty special, I loved the square in front of this church and even got to see the changing of the guard.",
          "Although technically not the Cathedral of Rome, St. Peter's Basilica is arguably one of the finest churches in the world. As the spiritual center of Vatican City this stunning structure harbors not only stunning art but architectural contributions from Raphael and Michelangelo.",
          "Accidentaly went here on Sunday exactly to Mass, saw Pope and heard his speach from the window and this was something very, very special",
          "Absolutely stunning place. A must visit when in Rome. And it's not paint work... it's Mosaic!! The artwork is amazing.",
          "Hello, Needless to mention this masterpiece is unique from Art and Holiness perspective. The place is so huge that you feel too small.",
          "We went to see the church because it was on our stop of the hop on hop off bus. Is was very beautiful on the outside and it was a nice experience. It is very big with a great history. I recommend everyone to do the hop on hop off tour. It was crowded.",
          "You don't pay to get in but you do queue to go through security checks. You can pay to go to top of dome which is well worth it for the amazing views. You pay \u20ac8 to walk up all 551 steps or \u20ac10 to go up lift half way then walk the rest. All in all an amazing place. A must visit",
          "We didn't have a fast pass to get in here but only stood in the queue for 20 minutes. It did look grand from the outside but it truly is something else inside. There is so much detail, culture and history in there is unreal. There is the opportunity to go down into the grotoes",
          "This place is huge! So many halls art (sculptures, paintings and architecture) to marvel at. Be sure to pay the entrance fee of 8 or 10 euros to go up to the cupola and see Rome from up high! 10\u20ac gets you into the elevator line that gets you about 150 steps closer to the top.",
          "An inspirational place at the heart of Rome. Great art, music, prayer space. Good place to come back to.",
          "Quite simply the most awe inspiring place I have ever been to. I am not massively religious but to be inside a place of pure history is quite unreal. Stunning must do!!!!",
          "We were in Rome for Christmas Day and of course had to go to the Pope\u2019s Urbi et Orbi Blessing in St Peters Square. At noon exactly, the Pope comes out from the balcony and addresses the crowd. There were tens of thousands of people in St. Peters Square, and from all over the",
          "We decided on a small group guided tour, skip the line, and it was well worth it. Rosalba was our guide and did an amazing job explaining the Vatican, St. Peter's Basilica and Sistene Chapel. I would easily request Rosalba again for another small guided group tour.",
          "We got the full experience tour with a guide of the Vatican museums, Sistine chapel and St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. Our guide was called Serena, she was fantastic 10/10. Very knowledgable, friendly, informative, funny and engaging. She was fantastic. The first part of the tour was",
          "Really convenient to get the online skip the line tiket. Marco and Stefano at the check in have been great help! Professional and kind, brought us all the way in after the check in!",
          "Wow, the most stunning cathedral in the whole wide world. We visited without a guide and the building was just breathtaking from the amazing sculptures, monuments, art and stained glass windows. I visited the crypt where previous popes are buried. St. Peter\u2019s is free entry but",
          "A stunning and beautiful building. So much to see. Some incredible artwork, statues, sculptures and history. It really feels like you are seeing some real history. Thanks so much to Father Alexander who kindly gave us a fascinating tour of the various historical areas. There is",
          "I visited the Basilica and had the most amazing experience. The ques to get in weren\u2019t that long, 25 minutes and I got in. I paid \u20ac10 for the elevator to the Dome. The views and art work were incredible, a high fence is in place for safety. I then climbed up to the cupola 200",
          "This building and everything inside just blew my mind. I felt like I was in a movie. Amazing experience!",
          "We did a guided tour of the Vatican on Saturday and the church was closed as pope doing a mass. We decided to go back on the Sunday and managed to catch the popes blessing also. I was moved to tears on several occasions whilst here. A very special place and a must see. Go to the",
          "We came here on Sunday and our receptionist explained tgat the pope hives a blessing on a dunday, so we waited to here the pope, obviously couldn't understand a word, but an amazing experience even for an atheist like me",
          "We visited the basilica without a tour. It means queuing but although the queue was quite lengthy (due to security) it did move reasonably quickly. It was awesome to see the Square whilst queuing, a sight so familiar from news broadcasts. The basilica itself is beautiful -",
          "No photo will ever capture the feeling of St Peters Bascilla! Absolutely stunning!! We didn\u2019t buy a ticket. We just joined the queue outside the Bascilla in St Peters Square which looked massive when we arrived but went down really quick to be honest and was free!!! The",
          "We arrived at 7:30 am and no cue at all. Walked up to the dome and seeing the area waking up is a blessing in itself. We are me and my wife, a 2 years old and a 5 years old. We took the elevator up to the first level (no use actually) and then I carried the years old all the way",
          "Always nice to be there, very crowded bu with the wait. It\u2019s a must see if you are in Rome, visit the square and enter the Basilica. Check the schedule for the service",
          "A beautiful building, and definitely needs to be visited. The staff were helpful and friendly. My daughter felt faint when in the Basilica and staff helped her to a seated area and checked she was ok. They don't like you sitting around in any area without proper seating, but",
          "We visited this basilica in the late afternoon after visiting the Vatican Museum. The queue to enter the basilica was short and it was not crowded. This basilica is huge with beautiful art work. The ceremony to unveil the Nativity scene was also held on that afternoon. We stayed",
          "You have to be inside to experience the grand church. Human power and intellect to the best, but god is above watching. Humble ourselves, and there will be blessing from above. WORTH the LONG LINE!",
          "Would recommend, really beautiful to see and surrounded by lovely cafes and restaurants. We visited this area for a day and covered St Peters and the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museum at the same time.",
          "Dec 4 we had the place to ourselves no lines no crowd Unbelievable. Walked in to the Basilica and no crowds . We were able to move around and see everything with no lines and the weather was perfect 57Dg and sunny couldnt have picted a better time to go",
          "Once you are in Rome you will visit this Basilica as it is one of the most famous. It is free but there is a very long queue. It might happen that you need to wait several hours on the sun - it is because of a security check. If you go there from Vatican Museum, you can skip",
          "Went in January. Pushchairs not allowed but they let you park it. Extremely crowded inside. Queue winded around the whole square but we got in around 30 mins. Beautiful inside and many photo ops.",
          "Tour guide a must here and dont be deterred by the price. Worth every penny. Lost without her on this visit",
          "Fantastic place to visit absolutely stunning and it's free unless you take the lift upto the viewing area on top of the basilica however it's the best \u20ac10 you will spend as the rest of the walk up is hard work and not for the faint hearted but well worth it for the views and",
          "Wow! It is a holy and sacred environment. Beautiful ceilings, floor tiles, and altar. The manager scene at Christmas, complete with moving parts, was incredible.",
          "Beautiful :) the basilica is huge and so amazing! You can only stop and stare and all the intricate details and could not help but wonder how did they manage to do that!",
          "This was everything we hoped the Vatican would be & so worth a visit. I really can\u2019t get over the sheer size of the place & we didn\u2019t visit for the Pope, choosing to come when there wasn\u2019t too many people around. Unbelievable!",
          "...tour with a knowledgeable and enthusiastic tour guide but you can easily do it yourself. The Dome climb is a must but can be claustrophobic and challenging for the unfit. The views are to die for...a must do when in Rome. Highly recommended.",
          "We were 23, 24, 26 of December 2019, Wow, amazing!!!! Just would like to ask administration of St.Peters basilica more to control Asian tourists : I\u2019m very religious catholic person and very sad to look at Asian tourists making selfies in strange positions.,( for example",
          "It\u2019s the more perfect place which I sow it in my life. I\u2019m in love, seriously guys. Every one must visit it. I want put 50 stars, but here have just 5\ud83d\ude02",
          "Very beautiful and really makes you look up in awe! Fantastic that it\u2019s free, queues were not a problem at all (visiting in January)",
          "I took a tour with a guide for this one and I'm so happy that I did. She explained the intricacies of the art work and their meaning. Michael Angelo was pure genius. I'm still in awe of Midnight mass which was pure magic, if I die tomorrow I will know I have lived",
          "Reach early in the morning, to avoid queues. Don't waste money on buying tickets with your groups for easy entry. We entered even before the tourist agency office opened. 8 AM is best. It is beautiful and serene. Even though I am not a Christian, the peace and spirituality was",
          "The Basilica is very special place. I must say as a Christian you need to be respectful in here. Lots of figures of angels, artwork and paintings. The ceilings are absolutely awesome. I am so happy that I had an opportunity to pray by the Saint John Paul II tomb and St. Peter",
          "Excellent historic place to visit. We did a tour with The Roman guy and felt this helped, as we learnt a lot as we went around",
          "Incredible! Every detail makes it a unique place. Words can\u2019t tell how impressive and huge this basilic is.",
          "I have seen this in pictures and studied it in schools. Words cannot describe my experience. We were with a tour group. Out guide was wonderful. Extremely knowledgeable. I would suggest going with a tour group you very first time. We were able to get in tight away.",
          "A place worth visiting multiple times. Only downside are those security guards who do not seem to appreciate the religious meaning of the place for many visitors - rude behavior when there is no good reason for it.",
          "Very happy we choose to visit while we where here. The art and everything was beautiful breath taking Amazing.",
          "Inspiring place to visit. The supreme pilgrimage site for Catholics. Don\u2019t be turned away by the long line, it does moves quickly. Elegant architecture its overwhelming frescoes. The artworks are spectacular.",
          "We went to St Peter\u2019s Basilica on 16th Jan and up the dome. At at around 3pm, it took about 20 minutes to queue and get through security. There was no queue to purchase tickets for the dome. Cash only to buy the dome tickets. The queue looked slightly longer when we left at",
          "January was a good time to visit as only short queue although still a lot of people there once inside. Didn't have time to do the Vatican museums and can't do the Sistine Chapel without the museums. This was a great option and free we were there over an hour taking photos and",
          "This place can be visited for free I you do not wish to enter to the museums (which, of course, are worth it... but this place stands on its own anyway). It is big, full of great painting, statues and decorations (some very famous ones, by the way). It\u2019s very big too.",
          "Save a day to visit the Vatican city, it's allot to take in and you will need a whole day to visit the church and the museum's, the capula of the st Pieter has the best view in the city, and is somewhat claustrophobic (my partner). But definitely worth the walk up stairs, don't",
          "Give yourself a full afternoon or morning to visit the area as you will need time together around the area and look at everything.",
          "We went to see this I was quite excited, its 10 euro for lift and 8 for the stairs, unfortunately the lift doesnt go to the top it only goes a small bit. But the rest of the way you have to do yourself and its treacherous, so many stairs to climb by the time most got to the top",
          "Amazing place to visit in life. Specially if you are spiritual person and if you admire beautiful constructions and history. Go up to the Dome is something you must!! You can take the elevator but the stairs are really cool. The view paid off! If you arrive before 9:00 lines are",
          "After a short queue to get through security (~4pm) we quickly made our way inside. What a fantastic place with absolutely outstanding architecture, paintings and murals. The size is mind blowing and impossible to fully appreciate. Believe it can hold 60000 people for a service.",
          "This place is unreal spotless clean we even went to the square on the Sunday for the readings by the pope very busy advise to go early to get through the second security if u want to get closer. We done tour of Vatican city which took in st peters and sissian chapel highly",
          "The splendor of this basilica is impressive. Pictures cannot do justice to the grandeur. Despite all of the tourists, it is amazingly peaceful. A must see when visiting Rome.",
          "A beautiful place to visit and a must see if in Rome. Unfortunately security was very slow and poorly organised. No clear signs and very very slow. Enjoyed our visit all the same.",
          "Excellent visit, beautiful basilica with mesmerizing artworks. The entrance was free. I expected extremely long queue to go in but when I visited at about 3pm on a Tuesday the wait was only about 20-30 minutes. Do not miss visiting the underground papal tombs by taking the",
          "I cannot even count how many times I have been to the San Pietro\u2019s Basilica but every time is like the first one. During my most recent visit to Rome, I have witnessed a very memorable event at the Basilica: it was the evening when Pope Francis led a traditional Filipino mass",
          "What an outstanding place to be! I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve been inside a religious building of such magnitude and charm in my life, and that\u2019s saying something. Obviously the number of disrespectful tourists lessens the impact of the basilica, but if you find a nice quiet spot to either",
          "Vatican Church \"San Pietro\" is a magnificent building full of incredible renaisance art. Again a must for Rome, that is absolutely great. Go and pay to climb the extraordinary dome, and look at the statues of the colonade from closer.",
          "Difficult to put into words. This is something you have to see for yourself to fully appreciate. So glad to have been able to have seen it.",
          "I was there in april. There is a huge queue, I suppose \u00e1ll year. But it is worth it.

          "You'd be spellbound by the beauty of this gem of the Vatican. Entry is free, but leave yourself enough time to wait in queue before you finally get to enter unless you could purchase a fast track entry from one of the tourist company representatives scattered all over the place.",
          "If you think you can handle going up all that steps and go down again the view is the BEST in Rome, without a doubt, and it is a fantastic spot to take some panoramic photos!!!! This place will take your breath!!!",
          "Did not know if it would be open. Better was that we were able to be there with probably less than 300 people in the entire area after 8pm on Sunday night. It is so impressive even for a non Catholic. Bonus were the priest signing Christmas songs.",
          "I think this may have been my favorite sight in Rome! It\u2019s beautiful inside and easy to Rome and take in the sights..... the window at the furthest point was just stunning shame we couldn\u2019t get closer but feel privileged to have seen it! X we didn\u2019t do the dome but plan to come",
          "This place is free. Visit early in the morning when line is short. Lines can be really long after afternoon. We visited this after visiting Vatican museums and had to stand in line for over 40 mins in December during rains. Do not forget to see pieta.",

          "Absolutely stunning basilica in the heart of Rome. My husband and I were lucky enough to go to mass on Sunday morning despite the immense crowd. The basilica is massive and houses incredible artwork, including La Pieta by Michelangelo. I would highly recommend visiting at least",
          "Absolutely stunning! Such opulence. Hightly recommend a tour not doing it on your own to avoid the queues.",
          "Most spectacular church you will ever see based on dimensions as well as the gravity of history for this working church. Contains remains of Peter, the first pope, plus the remains of subsequent popes as well as art pieces of Michelangelo called the Pieta. Definitely worth your",
          "Where do I start? Every direction you look there is something to see and admire. This was the last part of a tour we were on and the guide explained many things inside before letting us go in so we were well informed on what it held and some of the history. Once inside you go",
          "Nice place to visit no matter what religion.. beautiful large area to walk and the interior design is amazing to see",

          "This is an amazing experience. Worth paying something to jump the queue I imagine if you don't enough mornings and arrive too late in the day (the Basilica is FREE otherwise). We arrived at around 9am on a Friday morning and had no trouble with queues and were in in no time.",

          "I read many times that you should get up early and get ahead of the crowds. YES, that's 100% true. I got there about 8:30 am and was through the check point and in the Basilica in all of 10 minutes. I had a step counter on me: 12,000+ steps for the day.",
          "The size of the building is unbelievable. You can hurt your neck trying to see the ceiling. Admittance is free but in order to climb the dome (551 steps) for the amazing view you pay 8\u20ac or you can pay 10\u20ac and take the elevator to the first level and avoid climbing the first 231",
          "Visited The Vatican on our trip to Rome & you can't not visit St Peters Basilica when here. Que to get in is quite long but it moves swiftly. Once inside its quite breath taking, all the architecture & marble floors are stunning. If you view it from the square thi church is",

          "Don\u2019t do it if you\u2019re claustrophobic!!! Poor research on our part meant that we didn\u2019t even know you could climb the dome. So when someone said it\u2019s a quick elevator ride to the top, we said great! So that was to the first level, which was fine and beautiful. We then saw a sign",

          "Such an enormous building. Would need a good few days to see all of it properly and drink in the atmosphere. So much to see and learn. Was surprised at the mummified Popes on display in glass coffins. Would love to return.",
          "This is definitely one of the must see places in Rome. No visit is complete without it.. Do it in early December, before school let\u2019s out for Christmas.. Weather is cool, and crowds are light.",
          "This beautiful place is one of those you visit that takes your breath away when you first step inside. A stunning basilica steeped with history and beautiful Catholic iconography. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would recommend an audio guide to fully appreciate what you are",

          "In a word, Magnificent! The ticket lines are beyond long, so be sure to go online beforehand and buy skip the line tickets. We did so, long in advance, and bypassed a LONG wait. Another bonus.... our purchase included an audio guide, the value if which I cannot emphasize",
          "As a catholic, this place was a dream. Walking around, standing in awe of the sheer grandeur of it all was so so humbling. It is a place to go to in your lifetime.....",
          "Wow! What a Church. Huge and highly decorated. Absolutely stunningly beautiful. Lots of art, but.i dont understand why all the sculptures of Popes. We're not worshipping Popes, are we? Aren't we worshipping God? Quite impressive, but St Sophia (Hagia Sophia) in Istanbul",
          "Unfortunately I was not able to go into this place but standing in the courtyard was just mesmerizing. You can't fathom how big this square is with the church at one end. At the time it was 104 degrees Fahrenheit with high humidity and was at the end of my day. I just couldn't",
          "What I can say. If you've gotten yourself to Italy, you just go, it's the Vatican! Keep an eye on your personal items and wallets. I didn't have an issue, but there are beggars all over the place.",

          "Incredible art, buildings and church in general. We thought the lines would be too long so we booked a tour, but they skipped many important/cool areas of the basilica, so if you book a tour to get in, just leave it. We also got to watch the changing of the Swiss Guard outside",

          "It was very beautiful inside but with it being at the end of our tour, we weren\u2019t able to enjoy it as much as we wanted. If you would like to see this and spend ample time I suggest ensuring you pack only small items and not go with a tour of that is your main concern. But",
          "Amazing architecture, so beautiful, well worth the visit. Definitely worth paying extra for the skip the line tickets",
          "What a truly amazing place.... The museum alone is worth visiting and the climb to the top of St. Peter's though not for the faint hearted is worth every step (there is also a lift). Inside St. Peters is truly spectular although maybe not for a truely spiritual vist, I was",

          "Wow stunning to see on a Wednesday they do changing of the guard around 10 am later in the day you can. Go inside it's free lots of walking lots to see and a museum underneath they are just putting together it's amazing you can take from the roof another level only accessible by",
          "The Basilica itself is beautiful, but visitors forget this is a house of worship and not a carnival attraction. I witnessed people using the Holy Water as a prop for their photos only to wipe the water off their hands after the photo. Noise, jostling of crowds, and overall",

          "We didnt get to see the Pope or a service, however walking through the church and seeing how spiritual your surroundings are was breathtaking. I cried. Kneel at the pews...you won't regret it!",

          "A breathtaking place that is unique. I recommend anyone interested in art and history to visit. Come early to avoid long lines for entering.",
          "This is such a beautiful and sacred building. To think of the number of people/pilgrims that have passed thru it\u2019s doors. So many things to see, and see it you must",
          "I can\u2019t begin to describe what an incredible and holy place this is. We were moved by the experience and recommend it to anyone who visits Roma.",
          "This Basilica is both impressive and a bit sickening, exemplifying the hypocritical nature and incredible wealth and power of the Catholic church. The Basilica is HUGE and has dedicated prayer sections, but also manages to have a few areas whereby you need to pay to see",
          "After visiting 10 yrs ago i was disappointed to aee that most of the square and colonade is cordoned off also inside the basilica there are rope cordons to prevent access to some areas which left me feeling disappointed in my latest visit The baailica is nice to see but i wont",
          "St. Peter's Basilica in located in the tiny country of Vatican City, and is the largest church in the world. It is free the enter church, but the line is long. The Basilica is open every day from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. April to September and from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. October",
          "We travelled with forty people on a Tour. Forty-two including the bus driver and tour guide. We went to Vatican City, St. Peter\u2019s basilica and the coliseum. Fantastic things to see and enjoy. The art and sculpture is fantastic. Could not believe the ceiling. We went to the",
          "The size first grabs your attention then the detail, it\u2019s mind blowing. The sculpture of Pieta by Michelangelo is unbelievable, such fine details. There\u2019s around a 30 minute wait to get through security but it\u2019s well worth it.",
          "To visit the Vatican Museum area, St Peter\u2019s Basilica, Sistine Chapel - again for Rome Travellers is a must visit. See the artwork, see the tapestries that are hundreds and hundreds years old, and enjoy the amazing art on the walls and ceiling in the Sistine Chapel. Reminder",
          "Definitely worth the trip, I'd suggest get the underground and buy tickets in advance online, it's cheaper than the \"skip the lines\" and you dont need to wait in the long queue",

          "Really a beautiful place to see. Little overcrowded, but if you go earlier you should be able to avoid at least a little bit.",
          "The scale and beauty of this place is all inspiring. However many pictures you look at before the reality will blow your mind. The interior and frescos are incredible. We thought the whole place was breathtaking, even if the queues are not.",
          "I had a short trip to Rome, I didn't organize much. Reading about all these skip-the-line tours I lost hope of getting in to St Peter's Basilica. But I wanted to see the dome and the view from there. It was a sunny Sunday morning in November, I decided to see how far I would",
          "Unless you arrive very early, there will be a queue. A long queue. Don't let this put you off. It is very well organised and moves surprisingly quickly. Security is swift and it took no more than twenty minutes in total to get in. It is stunning! A huge and ornately",

          "We took a chance & didn't book advance tickets. Despite the long queue, it moved quickly & we were inside within an hour. It is free to enter & is stunningly beautiful. It is enormous with many statues to look at as well as painted ceilings. Nothing prepares you for the",
          "The Square at St. Peter's Basilica is one of those trips of a lifetime. If you want to go inside the Basilica, get tickets ahead of time. Wait time on a Thursday in October was about 4 hours for free admission. Imagine the square with 100-200 thousand people for the selection",
          "This was my second time to visit the Vatican, Sistine Chapel & St Peter\u2019s Basilica. Absolutely amazing and certainly worth money for the & the visit. Overall, I would recommend the Vatican for a tour.",
          "If you are going to visit St Peter's, you have to climb the dome. There is a bit of a queue but the wait is worth it. You can either climb the whole way or you can take a lift part of the way. The difference in price is only 2 euro so I took the lift. You can only pay in",
          "Had a tour guide that was amazing!! She was very kind, attentive and super knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her!",
          "There is no church / cathedral in the world that is as beautiful as this one. There isn\u2019t a square centimeter that isn\u2019t worthwhile seeing. Yes, the line to get in is long but you cannot get home from visiting Rome without having entered here (and this goes as well for the",
          "St Peters Basilica is a must see in Rome. It is free to enter but be prepared to queue. We booked a guided trip which fast tracked us into the Vatican museum and the Sistine Chapel as well as the Basilica. I wouldn't recommend the guided tour - felt like we were herded round",
          "We visited on a Monday before our departure day. We had not been the to vatican city and did not have tickets for the Vatican Musuems. We thought this was the next best thing but it turned out to be a highlight of our trip. We saw the swiss guard which are beautiful uniform",

          "What can I say? Amazing, extremely beautiful and huge church. If you don\u00b4t want to wait in the line, the best thing oyu can do is to buy a guided tour and you can skip the line. We did the official combined guided tour with the Vatican museums which I highly recommend.",
          "We arrived at about 9:30am - there were no queues through the xray machines and walked straight in. There was plenty of space to enjoy the surroundings. The Michelangelo statue was amazing.",
          "This is a real beautiful Basilica to must be visited if you are in Rome. Long lines to visit but in 30-45 minutes you are in and you can see how gorgeous it is.",
          "This is a great place to visit if you are in Rome. Beautiful square and Church. The line to enter and visit inside is long but worth it.",
          "This church is truly amazing, a beautiful piece of architecture, we had a guided tour which skipped the queues otherwise it will take forever. Great paintings",
          "Very magnificent! Takes your breath away, it is a must in Rome! Take the fast track when buying tickets in advanced!",
          "I have done Rome three times now. The best way to see any of the famous places, is to book an early ticket, if possible, and get up early and go. Grab a coffee and pastry either en route or when you arrive. It\u2019s the best way to avoid queues, because they are big queues.",
          "This was our 2nd visit to St Peters. Last time we went was Agust it was hot and very busy. This time November it was quieter, yes it was busy but not crowded we arrive about lion and there was a short que. We immediately went to climb the dome. There was about a ten minute que.",
          "This is a massive, decadent, beautiful church. We went with a tour group which I highly recommend to skip the lines. We also had I shortcut entry from the Vatican museum which saved us another wait. There is a lot to see and having a guide certainly helps to appreciate the",
          "We joined the queue at 15:50 on Friday 18 October and queued for around 30 mins. We were lucky as any other time we were walking past the queue was much worse. I liked St Peter's Basilica and as there were less people than in the Vatican Museums it was a better experience and",
          "Let's begin with the fact that I'm an atheist. But even for me it was a spectacle. Huge inside and outside giving you a real proportion of how much money was wasted on building it, would definitely reccomend because of all the history and barbaric that took place there!",
          "It is hard to put into words the beauty of this place, it is a must visit. Make sure and get a tour guide if you really want to enjoy the visit.",
          "St. Peter's Basilica is one of the best known work of Renaissance architecture, the largest church in the world and considered the holiest of holy churches. The building certain ranks amongst the greatest architectural masterpiece I\u2019ve ever seen. As other visitors have",
          "WOW. That is all I can say. It is the most beautiful and sculptural location I have ever seen. There is no place else in comparison.",
          "Avoid the crowds and get there nice and early. You will see much more in half the time. It's the best way to visit.",
          "An amazing place with very beautiful art work. Unfortunately hardly any seats to sit, relax and enjoy the beauty. It was unfortunately also very noisy as the majority of tourists showed little respect for this special place of worship.",
          "The outside of this massiv building looks beautiful with al the statues. The insite is a mazing to see. A must on your list when you visit Rome. Waiting line without a reservation could be around 2 tours!",
          "Depending on how you get int to the basilica, it is a long process during peak times. We were there at October half term holiday and beat the queue by buying a Skip-the-line-tour which included the Sistine chapel (which we were marched through). On exit, the queue to get in",
          "I have been to Rome more time then I can count. I have continued to return to The Vatican and St Peters, but never again. This is the only place in Italy that I have been disappointed 100% of the time. First- no crowd control! The experience is dreadful, unsafe, and",
          "Amazing place, we had a guide who had so much knowledge and told us fun stories and key history regarding the building. Really beautiful and a must whilst in Rome. Lots of space to see inside and afterwards you can send a postcard from the worlds smallest country! Ensure you",
          "Excellent guided tour with Erica. Very informed and personable. Worth every penny especially getting by line ups.",
          "We had taken a guided tour of the Basilica. Right on entry you feel dwarfed by the gigantic proportions of the Basilica - the lavishly adorned interiors, the high dome, multiple chapels and all in all an amazing building of its age! No wonder it dominates Rome\u2019s skyline. It\u2019s",
          "Busy but well worth the wait in the queue. If you're fit and healthy the climb to the cupola is a must. 500 + steps to the gallery inside and you can also go outside. View of St Peter's Square and Rome is stunning. Basillica is very busy but stunning.",
          "We visited the basilica at the end of our tour of the Vatican and Sistine chapel. It was a great way to end our very busy tour. The size of the basilica meant there was a lot more room to move about. Such a beautiful building. Highly recommended but definitely get skip the line",
          "Visited St Peter's Basilica on our short break to Rome this week. We purchased 'skip the line's tickets in advance which meant we didn't have to join the long queue to get in. Also purchased tickets to go up to the dome, which was a great experience. We thought that the walk",
          "Amazing church, it is great to visit after you had seen the Vatican Museums. Downstairs it is a cript where all the popes are burried",
          "The queue can be quite intimidating, but it moves fast so a couple of hundred meters took less than an hour so we didn\u2019t buy the fast pass. So if you are not in a hurry relax and save your money. The church itself is fantastic and I would recommend going up to the top of the",
          "We only queued for about twenty minutes to get in. Inside is amazing and well worth visiting. You can pay extra to go up the done to the inside high balcony and then higher to the roof outside the dome. To get up the dome it is 10 euros per person for the lift and 8 per person",
          "We bought skip the line tickets. Trust me. The line is so long!! It's worth the money not to wait so long in line. It's on the right side of the building. Inside you have to remember to keep your mouth closed. :) it's so beautiful.. you'll have your mouth open off amazemend.",

          "For such a holy place it is totally ruined by the amount of and size of the groups that are let in, Everywhere you turn there is another cruise group or a person with a stick followed by a large group. You were constantly watched and could not sit to look up and admire the",

          "It is one of the most recognizable and celebrated religious building in the world, St. Peter\u2019s Basilica is held as one of the holiest shrines for its followers. Do I need to write it\u2019s in Vatican City which is the world's smallest country with its own post office for 1000",
          "My wife and I entered this monumental cathedral, after a 10 minute wait, to see what beauty, stories, architecture, emotions and presence were inside. Once inside, I was so taken back by the details, gold laced ceilings, the feeling of history of Catholicism and Christianity,",
          "To cross the Tiber in a literal sense and enter St Peter's is a phenomenal experience. For me personally it was incredibly spiritually uplifting but for those who are simply tourists I would expect it to be still incredibly awe inspiring. Truly an amazing place.",
          "Over the years the crowds in St Peter's Piazza and the Basilica itself only seem to have become larger. The day we went on this trip the queue to enter the Basilica was apparently four hours long. It is free to enter, but let's face it if you can afford it you really should",
          "This was the one attraction we decided wasn\u2019t worth buying skip the line tickets for (they were \u00a317 each) as it\u2019s free entry. We ended up queuing for 2 hours but it was the only attraction we did queue for so didn\u2019t mind. It was worth the wait as it was spectacular inside. It",
          "St Peter's basilica is amazing but you need a course in unarmed combat as manners go out of the window. Pushing and shoving the order of the day. Get your skip the line tickets before going to the Vatican as queues are long. Artwork is beautiful. Visit a must. Went in October",
          "It's big, it's busy, it's beautiful & it's well worth a visit. Tombs include Pope John Paul II. Make sure you do the dome too. Reasonably priced cafes in the streets nearby",
          "Visited on our trip to Rome. Must do. Very busy very crowded. Do a tour of some kind. Pass all the lines, visit the gardens. Do the museums,the Basilica. Take the time enjoy it. Worth the time. Beautiful, like you will never see again. Once in a lifetime.",
          "Amazing experience today at the morning mass with Pope Francis in the worlds most beautiful basilica. The service was incredible - despite being in Italian, the children found it easy to follow and join in using the brilliant Vatican guide. We felt most welcome thanks to the",

          "Been before but this time we were earlier and wasn\u2019t so crowded. A beautiful building though still too much going on to feel very spiritual to me. Maniac on a floor cleaner kept making us move. May be the biggest in the world and the architecture is stunning but personally",
          "What a beautiful experience it was to just be standing in front of St. Peter's Basilica. We just stood there for a long time enjoying the peaceful feeling, and the beauty of the architecture. This is another location in Rome that I will definitely recommend for a visit",
          "The Papal Basilica of St. Peter in the Vatican is a marvelous church for its impressive architecture, the spectacular art contained therein, and the fact that it is regarded as one of the holiest Roman Catholic shrines. A visit to Rome would not be complete without visiting St.",
          "Queued for 45 minutes to get in, queue jumping was terrible, some people have no manners. Got inside and looked round the fascinating sculptures, roof, floor, everything was so ornate. There were money boxes at certain statues and also places you had to pay for penance etc.",
          "If you go to Rome you have to see St Peters. It is the most beautiful place on earth, if you aren\u2019t moved you aren\u2019t human. Climb the dome to see Rome, it is worth the 8 Euros.",

          "Get to St Peters early - by 08:00. Join the queue on the right and go up the to the roof /dome choose the lift option, it only costs an extra 2 Euros. On the roof there is a reasonable cafe (cash only) a toilet and a view of the piazza. Up inside the dome is another more steep",
          "Although I've been inside before, I braved the line again but bailed out after fifteen minutes. My guess the line was 90 minutes. Worth it if you haven't been inside before.",
          "We visited St Peters at the tail end of the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museum tour. It is a special place steeped in history and beautiful art. The Pieta itself is worth the visit",
          "TIPS: 1. best is to book a private tour early morning before the museum opens to the public. Costly but worth it!!! 2. If you're not spiring for #1, then book a tour guide during normal hours. You'll save hours by not standing in queues. Expect to be jostled but",
          "You just have to go seen this place. No question, it's amazing and you don't have to be A church goers or even like churches. But a fast track ticket if possible with a tour guide to explain what you are seeing when you look upon this church's wealth.",
          "The size is really huge. There was mo small area not covered by art work. Even the marvel floors had mosiac like patterns and mixure of colours. The painting like pictures of detailed mosiacs are undifferentiable from oil paints. Collection of roman age stone sculptures as well",

          "We visited at the end of August. We joined the queue at around 08:30 and the queue was already about 45 mins long - but it was absolutely worth it. There is a Treasury Museum that you pay to enter (around 5Euro for Adults) and it is defintley worth visiting - lots of",

          "Of course, seeing St. Peter's Basilica is a must-see if you are a Catholic visiting Rome. The wait in line is just for security and moves pretty fast, so don't be intimidated by that line. Once you are in line, don't expect any spiritual experience as it is a bunch of tour",
          "It\u2019s hard to enjoy the art and building with so many big groups pushing through. The size of the groups really need to be limited. So the organization of the people is bad but the building is amazing. Due to crowds I wouldn\u2019t go back but it was nice to see once.",
          "Really beautiful place and in October no need to pay. You can pay 20e for skip the line tickets, or queue 15-20 mins in October (+20). Really nice place, the dome climb 8eur (cash only) for adults, kids free, was the best or most memorablr part of the trip. Our 9y climbed the",

          "Beautiful and breathtaking, really loved this tour, well worth paying \u20ac20 to skip que which is usually 1.5hrs, can pray in church, but lots of holy souvenirs and see prob the most beautiful church historical building in the world. Tombs were closed which was very disappointing",
          "A stunning building with one of the most impressive views in the world if you can make it to the top. I'm not Catholic (or any religion) but if you arrive early the queues aren't too bad, and if you then pay your 10 euro (including the elevator which takes you 1/3 of the way up)",
          "Be prepared for crowds, crowds and more crowds. But it\u2019s worth it to visit this cathedral in all its splendour. So much history and beauty. Make sure you rub the feet of St. Peter when you go. There are gift stores within the church and you can buy vials and get holy water.",
          "During previous visits to Rome it\u2019s been easy to pop in and see the great cathedral. This time we didn\u2019t think it would be worth the wait that we estimated to be at least 2 hours in the sun. The queue circled the square and we\u2019d just been to the Sistine chapel where there were",
          "Magnificent building and a must see. Access to the dome \u20ac10 is not for everyone as despite the lift for the first part there is still many steps to climb and I had to twist around the dome to get up. But you are rewarded with fabulous views. Send a post card while your there",

          "Always enjoyable place to sit and reflect and soak in the sun    This was on Sunday afternoon around 3pm.   Still a small line of people waiting to visit the basilica.  The weather was in the mid 60s, people watching and taking it easy was a good place to enjoy.",

          "Absolutely incredible. The ~1hr 15min wait is totally worth it. The audio tour is more focused on the religious aspects of the Basilica vs the historical aspects, definitely more for religious pilgrimage than tourists. Walking up the dome is completely worth the \u20ac10 elevator ticket. Incredible views.",
          "Visited 3 years ago (2017) and had a mass with the Pope and a huge crowd from different countries. I may not be a Catholic nor a religious person, but it was a marvelous and humbling experience!",

          "This place is an amazing!  We waited in a long queue to climb to the top but so worth it! We took the lift part way, but it was broken when we came down.

          "The largest church in the world! And the admission is free. Definitely worth going although the line can be ridiculously insane. To enhance the experience, I would suggest renting the audio guide. So many things to see and experience there. A trip up to the dome would offer you the view of the city.",

          "Magnificent place! To save time we went to the Basilica at 6:45, there were quite a few people there  but we got in the Basilica at 7:15. We didn\u2019t get in the Basilica immediately but waited for the Dome. We were the first which got up the \u2026",
          "We visited Vatican on our trip of Europe in 2014. We took a guided audio tour of the Vatican. The guide showed us all the places of religious importance to us. All of Vatican has beautiful structures for which the Italians are famous for. \u2026",
          "Great place to see. Too many people during peak season. Highly recommend visiting during Fall or Winter season.",
          "Must see as you will feel like u enter heaven.  Wear aprropriate clothing as this is a sacred place.",
          "After all we we're lucky to get in here. The queue is large so we didn't do it that way. We were in Rome in a Sunday and decided to go to the mass. It was celebrated by Pope Francis himself and it was an overwhelming experience. I am grateful they I could have been part of this.",
          "Even though I didn't get to go inside the basilica itself, it is said to be one of the most amazing works of art and architecture in Rome. The atmosphere was simply amazing, and to stand where millions before me stood... Breathtaking. Must \u2026",
          "Completely inconspicuous on the outside, simply mindblowing from the inside. The most unique Basilica I have ever seen. Ceilings are probably 12 stories high with artwork and chizzled stone work all over. No matter your level of art or \u2026",
          "Such a beautiful place. If your in Rome you must visit here, the workmanship and quality of the building its self is incredible. A lovely atmosphere and helpful staff if you get lost. Worth paying for fast track entry as well.",
          "Amazing place, one of the most beautiful churches which has inside a lot of history and secrets to be revealed. If you have the opportunity go and climb the dome to have a better view of the Vatican city and discover the decorative elements \u2026",
          "No words to describe the beauty of the church and the artists who made this vision come alive n stood beautiful for these 100s of yrs",
          "The most famous and important church in Christianity. And it deserves to be so. It really is impressive and absolutely a place to see regardless of your religious beliefs.\n\nI highly recommend going up to the top of the dome and the roof if \u2026",
          "Too many superlatives can be spent on this review. It's God's HQ and you can see and feel it from every where your eye roams.",
          "Well, it's an amazing piece of architecture that's for granted, but I don't like the interior with all the cult to the Popes and to the church, you are free to think and like what you want, but I don't like it,also despite the entrance \u2026",
          "Awesome place to visit during holidays and especially during Christmas. Perfect weather and atmosphere of celebration.\n\nAmazing architecture.. recommend the visit along with the museum.",
          "One of the most important monuments of Rome and it will amaze anyone. Basilica is huge and beautiful. The queue seems enormous at first, but you'll get inside quite quickly. Don't forget to wear something not too revealing, after all it is a holy place. And the fact that it is for free is almost unbelievable.",
          "Amazing place. Climbing up to the roof was worth it. Awesome views.",
          "Absolutely stunning. Highly recommend the dome walk. Not for the fai t hearted though as there is a lot of steps even with the elevator ticket.",
          "Went in November on a Saturday around 15:00. Line took ~1hr, the wait was worth it. I'm not religious, but the sheer grandeur & magnificence of this place will bring anyone to their knees. \nPut the effort and go to the top of the dome \u2026",
          "Somethings are simply incomprehensible. Out-of the world. It gives you goosebumbs instinctively at the first look. That was St. Peter's Basilica for me. A gem of human creation. Don't think there could possibly be any camera that could \u2026",
          "Amazing. It's a huge beautiful work of art with lots of color and detail. Check it out when you are in Rome.",
          "History at its best. What an amazing engineering feat. Artistic engineering, perfect workmanship. Eye opening and jaw dropping. The list goes on and on. If there is something that should be on your bucket list, it\u2019s definitely to visit the Vatican City and see the St Peters Basilica.",
          "Beautiful and amazingly grand.  The tickets to go up to the dome are $8 and $10 if you want to take the elevator.  If you want to go to the top of the dome, there are additional stairs and no elevator.  The 0900/9am mass was not at all busy.",
          "The plaza is incredibly large with bright, clean, well kept buildings and monuments all around. We didn't get there early enough to get in to the chapel as the line was impossibly long when we arrived around 12 pm. By that time it was also \u2026",
          "\"I guess this Basilica is the closest example of Solomon's Temple\"\n\nMy words refer to the Bible words and instructions given to Solomon by God himself. The splendor inside its so many many walls and the huge dome are impossible to describe \u2026",
          "The sheer size and opulence will stun you.  In the center aisle all the other great world churches are measuring.  They are all dwarfed by this one.  The art work is incredible - Michaelangelo's Pieta is here.  If you have the time and physical ability climb up to the dome.  The best view of Rome. All this and the Pope too.",

          "Love the architecture and artwork, no pictures were allowed inside.",
          "A beautiful place of worship. The craftsmanship exceeded my expectation. Vespers and Mass with Pope Francis is a glimpse of heaven.",
          "Well i cannot deny that its a beautiful building. The air feels full of the history and of meaning that people give to faith and belonging to a greater purpose. Its riches seem to be enormous. Yet the streets in front of the Vatican city \u2026",

          "This is a marvelous basilica!\n\nFun facts:\nThe paintings you see on the walls and the altars are NOT paintings but mosaic (It is made of different COLOURED MARBLES!)\n  [You may not believe it even after seeing it but if you see the \u2026",
          "It is difficult to explain just how magnificent this place is. The size and scale are enormous. The details and art are amazing. No visit to Time is complete without a visit to the Vatican. Do take the shop the line tour though. Otherwise the lines are daunting.",
          "A must go place, although the guided tour is very long (too long) and you miss things, it's worth doing to skip the huge queues. Ask about tickets to mass with the Pope if you are religious. Mass is free, 6000 tickets available Xmas, Easter and the Epithany. Our friend went and it is the highlight of her life other than her children.",
          "Beautiful and worth a visit if you can handle the uncaring staff that are full of lies. They will brush you off and close early after they take as much money from you as they can. The energy here truly gives Catholicism a bad name. What a \u2026",
          "We visited during the night and it was so beautifully lit, just breathtaking.",

          "it's spectacular. the most beautiful church I've ever been to",
          "Roma is like an open museum. Saint Pietro Square and Basilica i\u015f worth to visit. We were really feeling like living in medival ages.  We wish we had the opportunity to see Pope addressing his speech to Catholic Christians. The architectural \u2026",
          "Book a tour that will help you understand and learn everything about St. Peter not only the story but everything inside the building.\nThere are always many many visitors. You should be here in the early morning . When you finish the tour , you still have time to see around or buy somethings in shop.",
          "An undeniably beautiful piece of architecture, although - with apologies to the Catholics - it does rather shout \"Look how much money we've got\" with its incredibly ostentatious decoration.\n\nGreat views from the top of the dome, but beware that the stairwells leading up to it are very narrow and quite steep.",
          "The epicentre for Christianity!! Hugeeee area for people to gather. While it was not full when I visited but I could visualise how this place would appear during some important days during the year",

          "It's incredible Church. Luv it so much, nice!",
          "I highly recommend a guided tour where you skip the queue at the entrance (as they are extremely long and you may wait hours). Entrance is free, though.",
          "The place is awesome but you really need a tour guide for that. Me and my friends took a tour with Storytelling Rome and was super worth it",
          "Great place to visit.  Largest church in the world.  St. Peter's Basilica, which is called \"Basilica di San Pietro in Vaticano\" in Italian, is a large church in the Vatican City, in Rome, Italy. It is often called \"the greatest church in \u2026",
          "There is a security line but you don't have to pay to enter the Basilica. You may have yo pay to go up to the dome. The elevator only takes you halfway through. You still have to climb a lot of stairs to get to the very top. The view is fantastic, though.",
          "For me this was the most amazing place I have ever visited. It is amazing in so many ways and in this Basilica and in St Peter's Square I felt an amazing energy. We visited the Basilica but we also went up the 500+ stairs to the top where \u2026",

          "It is free to enter the main St. Peter's Basilica, though there are admission fees for a few parts, see below.\n\nIf you think the queues in front of you snaking into St Peter's are long, odds are the Vatican Museums are longer and slower \u2026",
          "Wonderfull place, a long waiting line but worth it! Consider use the fast lane (usually 10 to 20 Euros) and safe like 3 hours.\nUsually very crowded place, even inside.",
          "This place is absolutely amazing. We took the elevator up to the top of the dome it was worth it.\n\nOpening hours for the dome are \n\nApril-September 7:30am to 6:00pm\nOctober-March 7:30am to 5:00pm\n\nThe cost is 8 eur to walk and 10 eur to \u2026",
          "This is one of the most beautiful cathedrals we saw in Italy. The interior is extremely extravagant and, most important of all, very cool. After sweating from the body heat of the crowd in the Vatican museums tour, it was great to just step \u2026",
          "The Basilica of All Basilica. Highly recommended. Worth to stand in line for 1-2 hours. But the mini skirt Girl was very interesting in Vatican. :D",
          "A must see for those visiting the beautiful and historical city of Rome. The best part is that it is free and truly one of the best places you will see and will always remember. \nIf you can\u2019t afford a tourist guide to guide you throughout \u2026",
          "Full of beautiful art and history, the only thing I will suggest book tour with SINISTEL chapel because the tickets coming cheaper and you have guide to talk you throught",
          "Magestic construction. No matter what you believe in, the art here is truly amazing. A guide is recommended during the visit.",
          "It is the largest cathedral in the world which makes it worth the wait. This is all about timing. At the wrong time you could be waiting a while, but at the right time you can basically walk right in. It is very impressive and awe inspiring.",
          "Spectacular! Go early 7 to 9 to avoid massive lines. Strollers prams must be parked, restrooms bottom right.",
          "Amazing. Attended Sunday mass and was well worth anyone's time... watching the Pope give his sermon was all inspiring.",
          "A dream come true. More beautiful in person. Definitely book a tour, because the lines to get in are crazy. Don't waste your time waiting in line.",

          "A must visit for anyone going to Rome. Vatican City is one of the smallest countries in the world. Preferably spend upto a day here to cover everything it has to offer. More convenient to book a guided tour so you don't miss out on anything \u2026",
          "Very beautiful inside and outside. Inside, every inch of the walls and ceilings are decorated and you need to give yourself plenty of time for this visit. You may have to queue before getting in and then you need time to appreciate everything. Well worth a visit.",
          "A MUST in Rome. BIG is a good word for this church. Important art pieces.",
          "This is a majestic place to visit. Since my arrival in Rome I saw some places that were nice to see. This place in the Vatican however is different. I really felt I experienced something great. I think this place is the biggest construction \u2026",
          "This place is majestic and full of spectacular art. Every single object out there has some significance which is worth knowing. Getting a audio tour via tour guide out there is advisable. You will not regret spending a day here, it's \u2026",
          "Always a joy to visit the basilica. The scale is breathtaking but there is a great feeling in the church. A trip to the roof allows for the long climb to the top of the dome giving Fabulous views of the city.",
          "Such a peaceful basilica, it is big and has so much attention to detail",
          "Wow. What an amazing site.  Pictures cannot compare to seeing the real thing.  I love that it is free to enter and enjoy.  A must see in Rome no matter what your beliefs are. You can also take escorted tours and take in the Vatican museums or other areas at additional cost.",
          "One truly monumental building it is. Beside the spiritual heritage it holds, St. Peter's Basilica overwhelms you when you step in. It makes you feel small and insignificant with is beauty and opulence. It's worth visiting everytime you come to Rome.",

          "Go early in the morning if you don't like the queues. You should visit the terrace and the dome, if it's possible. The view is spectacular!",
          "Do not afraid of queue. Stand-in ASAP and you\u2019ll get inside in 30 mins. Must see - one of the biggest religious buildings in the world.",
          "Pictures do not in anyway do this wonder justice. It is truly aww inspiring, the shear size and magnitude as you enter are breathtaking. I have, like many, seen photographs in books, movies & documentaries nothing could have prepared me.",
          "On the inside I liked it more than Barcelona\u2019s Sagrada Familia or the Dome of Milan",
          "This was truly one of the highlights of my time in Rome. Not only is there beauty shining from the floors all the way to the magnificent ceilings, but the atmosphere is very tranquil and heart warming. I was a hit apprehensive at how busy \u2026",
          "Very rich in culture and value just to pray to our God?!...",

          "Beautiful.  Make sure you see all the Basilicas and not just the Vatican.",
          "This was one of the best sites to visit in Rome. Such a beautful place and a lot to see around. Even if you are not cathilic, its worth it to plan an see the Pope blessing, because its always messages about peace, family and helping others. But arrive early because there will be lots of people.",
          "Beautiful beyond words. A gift to the world. Centuries old sculpture, paintings, tapestries, architecture. If you can manage the multitude of staircases and walking about 5 miles it is well worth every minute. If arranging your visit \u2026",
          "Beautiful basilica. Many great artwork here. You can not miss this one when visiting to Italy.",
          "Best to visit St Peter's Basilica and see the Pope on Wednesdays when he has a papal audience for the public. Line up early since they close the gates when the pope mobile starts to move around 9am. On any other day, it's still a massive and beautiful square.",
          "A stunning achievement. The queues to get in are massive, and you'll have to stand in the sun for a while if you visit in the middle of the day. Get there as early as you can to avoid the long wait. The scale of the place, and the effective \u2026",
          "There are absolutely no words that I can type to explain what you will see and feel while visiting St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. Probably the most amazing structure I have ever seen. The light coming in the windows the paintings, the ceilings all of it together will make you feel small.",

          "This is such a breathtaking and magnificent cathedral. The best I have seen so far, huge, so full of history and so well maintained. Suggest to book a local tour group as the queue to get in can be quite a long one.",
          "This magnificent place has incredible beauty surrounding the area. Although the wait times can be quite incredible to get in it is free of cost. Recommend arriving early in order to be able to get in. It is truly worth the wait, I will \u2026",
          "As we were visiting with our 3 month old son, we didn't want to have to queue to enter the buildings and go to see the Sistine Chapel. I think this would be better suited to do without children as it would be a long time queueing. \nYou can \u2026",

          "There are not enough hours in the day to get to enjoy all of the gorgeous aspects of this church! I recommend downloading Steve Rick's free audio tour and listening while you look. Also, go up the dome if you are able to do stairs - a lot of stairs - it is so worth it!",
          "A surreal kind of experience: the art work and the size of the basilica are amazing. Even the court yard in front is an engineering marvel. The exquisite statues and murals are incredibly beautiful. It's a bit too crowded for prayer, at least was the case when I visited.",
          "The most beautiful place I have been. The entry is free for the main part. You can't miss this place. If you're Christian it is such a special place to pray and thank God for everything \ud83d\ude0a",

          "Pretty empty these days, I encourage you to visit.  10/10 Would go again",
          "Lots of security going in, on a Sunday. Beautiful inside with lots of history. Mass given to those able to get to the front  near the alter.  12.00 midday  the Pope gives a short sermon. Crowded inside and out. Quieter on a weekday. Well worth a visit.",
          "It is a good place to visit. Long queue but fast moving. Just keep in mind no shorts allowed.\n\nArchitecture wise it has nice sculptures and roman columns with beautiful ceiling. \n\nThere is a beautiful chapel and option to go to dome either by stair or by lift. \n\nMost stricking was it is all goldish.",
          "Stunning. I get why so many people want to look inside. If you want to get the most out of it: take a tour and go as early as possible. It's absolutely worth it to go onto the roof of the basilica to watch inside the dome. You can go even higher an walk on top of the dome to get a stunning view.",
          "Great layout, high ceilings, luxurious floors, spared no expense in the construction of this place.",

          "Absolutely stunning works of art. This is a must visit if you're in Rome. Great amount of resources have gone into the design, construction and maintenance of this beautiful Basilica. \u26ea Even with modern day engineering techniques, to replicate this will be a mammoth task. \ud83d\udcab",
          "Beautiful inside , you cannot imagine the information  you learned",
          "Go. Early. Opens around 7am. By 8:30am on Saturday the line for security was about 1 hour long but moves quickly. Wouldn't want to have joined any later. You can pay \u00a38 to climb up the dome which I would highly recommend but it is 550 steps \u2026",
          "There are no words to describe how beautiful this place is! You leave your beliefs at the door as anyone can appreciate the art and talent that was put so carefully into the basilica. It is an absolute MUST to go all the way up inside the \u2026",

          "I was in awe. A sublime experience, went mid morning on a Saturday in December, the line took about half an hour, once inside even a much longer wait would have been worth it. I suspect the motives of those who down rate this place. Entry \u2026",
          "Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica is one of the most important places to visit in Rome. The place is majestic and it allows visitors to enjoy a very beautiful view of the Vatican and St. Peter\u2019s square. \n\nIn this area, it is possible to find some \u2026",

          "Very beautiful. It must have taken the wealth of a small country to build. Wait was 1 hour, worth the wait. See the dome too, 10e to take the elevator, 8e to take the stairs. Still lots of stairs if you elect to go up to the capula.",
          "Everything is beautiful, but really crowded as most of touristic places are.",
          "Amazing place, prepare for long queue's to get in!",
          "Went there twice. On Saturday to visit and on Sunday for mass. Wonderful experience as I got to see the Pope. Also, it was the International Day of Refugees, which meant the ceremony and songs and choir and Scriptures were in several languages. \nI don't regret going there. Not even the early waking up.",

          "I recommend that people buy a ship the line pass. Regardless, this is a great place to visit.",
          "Beautiful open areas. We were there the day the Pope spoke so it was a bit crowded, but nothing too crazy for Rome. The line to get into the Basilica was 3.5 hours, so we didn\u2019t end up going in. Also, remember that if you\u2019re visiting any \u2026",
          "Simply a \"wow\" when you visit. Whether you are religious or not you will appreciate the work that went in to this church.  It's simply astounding to see the art, the detail and the history.  \n\nThe sheer size of the work inside is something to see.  Highly recommend you check this out if you're in the city.",

          "Awesome experience! Unbelievable artwork and beautiful architecture. A must see when visiting the Vatican.",
          "Fabulous, an absolute must-see, regardless of your views on religion (I\u2019m not remotely religious myself). Even just seeing Michelangelo\u2019s Pieta is worth the visit alone (and it\u2019s free to see, as you don\u2019t pay to enter the church), but the \u2026",
          "Just perfect. If I would be more sensitive, I would already be a catholic... Better to get here early in the morning. No line at 7 am, small line at 8 am, medium line at 9 am and if you come at 10 am by yourself, you are risking to spend a \u2026",
          "Incredibly beautiful. Go up to the dome for breathtaking views if you can, it's definitely worth it. Contrary to other dome ascensions we've done, this one has an elevator which brings you a bit over halfway up.",
          "For shure one of the most beautiful Church in the whole world! The entrance is free, but you need to wait for shure 45 minutes in line! It's really amazing experience to see all that architecture art! You can pay 8euro and go to see wonderful view from the top of Basilica. It worth!",

          "A magnificent very special building, very humbling and inspirational to all Christians. I am so sorry that I have only given it five stars. The Basilica was so terribly overcrowded. So many totally ignorant and disrespectful tourists \u2026",

          "Truly awesome to see this. Also completely free. We went at the end of the day when the crowds had reduced so we didn't wait long in the security queue. The photos do not give it justice.  There is also a good ice-cream place near where the taxi drops you off to the left of the square.",
          "SO BEAUTIFUL. you don\u2019t even know if you should take a photo or take the time to soak everything in. Go with a tour guide! Saves so much time and they explain everything!",

Was amazed by the sculpture made of marble... ...Vatican City should consider reduce the queue by improving at certain points to the Basilica. Provide seats for elderly people & children....overall my family love this place...awesome!",

          "First time here and I really liked the experience, to see how big is this church, also all the art inside your really going to enjoy your time here and it\u2019s FREE no like others church around Europe ( Sagrada Familia, Barcelona), that you need to pay to visit",
          "Beautiful Architecture and a serene place. Do visit the dome to get an awesome Panaromic view of the city...",

          "The basilica is truly astonishing! It is a testament to its rich history and a church every pilgrim to Rome should visit.\nThe dress code is strict so make sure you are covered up properly and get in early to avoid the crowds!",
          "Such a beautiful place. A must see when you visit Rome.\nTip: buy skip the line tickets with the dome climb, as it saves you a lot of waiting time. The view from the dome is amazing, you can see whole Vatican city, and Rome with its many historical monuments.",
          "Excellent! Had a great experience. Went with a guided tour. Was able to hear and learn all about the things we were seeing. Would have been very confusing without the explanation. Was extremely busy on a weekend. Go early to avoid the major crowds",
          "I love it so much. It's like a dream to be there in that holy place.",
          "One of my top 3 favorite places in Rome, better in my opinion than the Roman Forum or the Vatican Museum.",
          "A dream come true. I was able to pray for all my friends and family. I am so blessed that we were able to go here!",
          "The most incredible structure you\u2019ll ever see!",
          "One of the great churches in the world. Must see place.",
          "From religious point of view for Catholic Christians, it's the most holy place.\nEven For tourists/ people from other religions it's a must visit place.\nVery huge monument with beautiful architecture.\nYou need atleast 5-6 hours to visit the Basilica and the museums.\nYou get to know the details of the history of Catholic Christians",
          "Wow, what a beautiful Basilica to see while in Italy!  It\u2019s gorgeous and the detailing is beyond amazing!   I want to go back so I can take more time to see more of what what\u2019s inside!  Perfection!  \u26ea\ufe0f \ud83d\udd4a",

          "St. Peter's Basilica is nothing short of enchanting! There is so much to see from the tombs of the late popes to the Sistine Chapel to the Vatican museum at large. At least one in a lifetime I recommend you visit. Rich history, a wealth of culture, definitely a foodies delight.",
          "Absolutely incredible. The best part of the Vatican city tour by far. The Sistine Chapel was good but the Basilica was beautiful, less crowded and had the same level of architectural significance. \nMake sure you go to the top. Go to the top \u2026",
          "One of the greatest places anyone on earth could ever visit. It's worth every time spent there. The coordination is second to none, the beauty of the city is unfathomable, the temple and the tomb appear to be both sacred and monumental. It was really a swell time at the city. Everyone should give visiting the Vatican a consideration.",
          "Huge church with lots of things to admire. Strongly suggest a guide, otherwise just Google the sculptures and read their story SHOULD be fine, if you are not that particular.",
          "No words can describe the beauty of this place. Have to see it with your own eyes. Also walk to the top of the Dome....you will not be disappointed!",
          "Regardless of your religious beliefs it is an impressive building not only the architecture but all the art inside is impressive. It is worth the wait.",
          "One of the most overwhelming and astounding structures I\u2019ve seen in my entire lifetime.\n\nBeautiful inside out, every nook and corner of this place has a story to tell. Seeped in history, built over 2000 years.\n\nThe colourful designs on the \u2026",
          "It's amazing ! I means there is so much to see that at some point you don't see anything. It is really rich, there is a lot of art in there it's amazing to see all the work that has been done. Going to the top of the church is really worth the effort, the view is gorgeous !",
          "Obviously if you are in Rome this is a place not to be missed. I had the once in a lifetime experience today. Attended a mass in Italian, received communion, then had the honor of seeing the pope give his speech. Feeling really blessed today.",
          "Visit to the palace which is very close to this place. The palace closes by 6pm.\n\nBe at this place by 7am if you want to avoid rush and lengthy queues.\n\nNo point in delaying during day time, as rush will be at peaks. Better to visit early \u2026",
          "Could you give St. Peter's any less than 5 stars?  While the atmosphere was not prayerful due the the huge number of tourists, I was struck by the sense of history and overwhelmed as I saw the original Pieta.  Something I will never forget.",
          "What can you really say about the home church of all Catholicism? It's stunning - absolutely stunning. Incredible artwork, relics of major saints, amazing statues (such as the Pieta), and views of all of Rome from the roof.  I would highly \u2026",
          "One of the best experiences I have ever done. A believer or not, you gotta appreciate the beauty of the place!",
          "I went early in the morning when the ques weren\u2019t too long. It\u2019s free to get in to the bottom floor of the Basilica, you have to go through security and make sure that you\u2019re dress appropriately for a church. \n\nThe works were astounding and the choir was beautiful to listen to during the morning mass.",
          "Marvellous, stunning beautiful old church. Originally build in 300 AC on the grave of St. Peter and enlarged in the 1500s. It is a sight you cannot miss in Rome.",
          "Beautiful well worth navigating the crowds but you should definitely book a guide.",
          "That's my favourite place in the world. I could stay there forever. It's enormous, full of art and history. It's divine. There is no other building like this in the whole world.",
          "A must see when visiting Rome, this is the most implosing and monumental church I've ever seen (even compared to major cathedrals). Entrance is free to the church (opening at 7 am) as well as the crypts (opening at 9 am). Arrive between 7 \u2026",
          "Architecture is crazy. Most beautiful place I've been too. Highly recommend.",

          "It's worth it to wait in line for a while! Architecture is incredible.",
          "Mindblowing place, really loved it",
          "I was shocked how rich the Christian Church is. Everything is golden or made out of something else expensive. Nice to look at but there's always a horde of tourists.",
          "Obviously a place to visit while in Rome, but if you have the time go to the other major basilicas early in the morning - they're quieter, just as beautiful and vast. \nGo here as soon as they open to avoid long lines.",
          "I would love to go back. To truly enjoy this very beautiful place spend atleast half a day. Pay for the guided tour. Explore every where possible. Memories made here",
          "Where faith meets architectural wonder in the Vatican. Remember not to take any metallic water bottles but only plastic ones to avoid them being taken away from you at the initial check point.",
          "I have to say that the Basilica is a fantastic ace to see and hard to.explin the scale of the building...it's massive! We entered the basilica after doing a tour of the Vatican so skipped the queue. There are lots of things to photograph \u2026",
          "Take the elevator. Other than that. Amazing view",
          "Nestled within the city of Rome is a unique piece of land that lays claim to several important titles, not the least of which is smallest country in the world. At 100 acres in size, Vatican City is less than a third of the size of London\u2019s \u2026",
          "Worth visiting even if queues are huge!",
          "This is really nice and well organized place. It's way different from how other landmarks in Rome are managed. The interior is magnificent, people who works there are really helpful. Event in gift shops everything is just like it supposed to be.",
          "For the full experience (dome and view from the top of the dome) be prepared to climb lots and lots of stairs, well worth it though",
          "It's massive n beautiful. Lines move really fast. I could feel a vibe there. In awe with the place",
          "Incredibly beautiful piazza and the basilica is outstanding, but the channelling of the visitors, coupled with the large number of very large groups (over 50) that insist on travelling in unison, makes the experience very unpleasant for the individual visitor. It would be wonderful if one could visit when there are fewer guided groups!",

          "Biggest basilica that i have visited. The sculptures and architecture are very detailed. There's also a prayer room. While coming out you could see the tombs of Pope.",
          "It's ornate and beautiful. The basement has the Grottoes that are also an interesting lesson in history. It is less crowded than the Sistine Chapel and the museum, or at least feels that way because of the sheer size. \nDo not forget to adhere to the dress code or you may not be let in.",
          "It's impossible to put in words how jaw dropping this place is. There had been a lot of chiseling to produce the world class sculptures. Artwork without rival. Queues during the day, but quieter at 6pm.",
          "Impressive religious place. Though probably queues are way too long.",
          "Architecture was amazing. Need some time to see everything.",
          "Third time in Rome, third time in the Basilica. This time it was rainy on a Monday afternoon and the queue was enormous, but took only 30 minutes for us to be inside. So dont feel discouraged by the amount of people waiting, the queue moves fast and it is worth every minute! The place inside is as impressive as it is outside!!!",
          "Long queue for an unmatched place, truly worth the experience",
          "There are less people if you visit very early of the morning. 10 euro (with lift) entry ticket is worth every cent! Must visit when you are in Rome.",
          "You cannot be in Rome and not see the St. Peter's Basilica. Go in the morning to not take the full queue, and if is half of the square is only takes 30-45 minutes to get inside. Also the Basilica is free of charge, but the tower is 18 euros and is an spectacular view.",
          "Just as the title suggests...Be sure to arrive early. We went twice on an anniversary trip to Rome. We would get there around 9am in February and had a very short line. Once inside it will take your breath away. Be sure to climb the dome \u2026",
          "Went as a part of a guided tour. The mother of all churches, worth visiting.",
          "Stunning architecture and art. Staff were very helpful for non-step entry - taking us to an elevator which took us right to the entrance. It was extremely busy. I'd recommend visiting in the early afternoon during peak periods as the queue \u2026",

          "Amazing an experience and a must visit for every one in the world.",
          "We attended mass here. Nothing or nowhere else can compare. It's where the pope delivers mass. There are also many great paintings and sculptures throughout the basilica. It's free to go in, just remember to be respectful.",
          "Summer is a bad idea. While you are waiting in the queue, that scorching sun will beat you down.",
          "Another MUST to visit while visiting Rome/ Vatican.\n\nPlease be advised on clothing requirements, otherwise they won't let you in.\nVery busy and long queues, but definitely worth a visit.  \n\nYou have to pay to visit the Dome, but just do it. \u2026",
          "I'd say do a guided tour. This allows u to skip lines, this is needed because without it u need to wait a really long time. Otherwise it's amazing!",
          "St Peters was like anything in Rome you are just in awe the whole time, we went in the summer months they were not super strict with the dress code just be save we met the requirements, which aren't anything crazy its totally up to that \u2026",
          "Heaps of people! That doesn't make it a bad thing though!  GET THERE EARLY!  Lots of crowds and a security checkpoint to go through.  I'd like to say thanks to the Vescovo (bishop) from Sicilia who I asked where to find coffee and he then shouted me coffee \u2764\ufe0f \u00e8 stato un piacere",

We paid the 10 euro to go to the top on the dome and the view was spectacular! Highest point in all of Rome. The stairs up were very tight but it was well worth it!",
          "Crowded even in the \"off season. The lines are long but better than paying the tour group scammers that hang out front of the Basilica. Go early, wait in line if you can, and enjoy the sights. Amazing for the pilgrims and amazing for historians and even the  non-believers.",

          "Fun tour to do. Go really early in the morning and avoid the lines and the large crowd. It was nice to take the whole area at our own pace. The inside is gorgeous! There are mummified bodies which is disturbingly cool. It's probably even cooler if you are catholic!",

Waited over an hour in a que just to go through security, to then be told myself and my daughter were dressed inappropriately and weren't allowed in, my son and partner had to ho and buy us a shawl to cover up.

        "wiki": "The Sistine Chapel (; Latin: Sacellum Sixtinum; Italian: Cappella Sistina [kap\u02c8p\u025blla si\u02c8sti\u02d0na]) is a chapel in the Apostolic Palace, the official residence of the pope, in Vatican City. Originally known as the Cappella Magna ('Great Chapel'), the chapel takes its name from Pope Sixtus IV, who restored it between 1473 and 1481. Since that time, the chapel has served as a place of both religious and functionary papal activity. Today, it is the site of the papal conclave, the process by which a new pope is selected. The fame of the Sistine Chapel lies mainly in the frescos that decorate the interior, most particularly the Sistine Chapel ceiling and The Last Judgment by Michelangelo.\nDuring the reign of Sixtus IV, a team of Renaissance painters that included Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Pinturicchio, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli, created a series of frescos depicting the Life of Moses and the Life of Christ, offset by papal portraits above and trompe-l'\u0153il drapery below. These paintings were completed in 1482, and on 15 August 1483 Sixtus IV celebrated the first mass in the Sistine Chapel for the Feast of the Assumption, at which ceremony the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary.Between 1508 and 1512, under the patronage of Pope Julius II, Michelangelo painted the chapel's ceiling, a project which changed the course of Western art and is regarded as one of the major artistic accomplishments of human civilization. In a different climate, after the Sack of Rome, he returned and, between 1535 and 1541, painted The Last Judgment for Popes Clement VII and Paul III. The fame of Michelangelo's paintings has drawn multitudes of visitors to the chapel ever since they were revealed five hundred years ago.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhile known as the location of Papal conclaves, the primary function of the Sistine Chapel is as the chapel of the Papal Chapel (Cappella Pontificia), one of the two bodies of the Papal household, called until 1968 the Papal Court (Pontificalis Aula). At the time of Pope Sixtus IV in the late 15th century, the Papal Chapel comprised about 200 people, including clerics, officials of the Vatican and distinguished laity. There were 50 occasions during the year on which it was prescribed by the Papal Calendar that the whole Papal Chapel should meet. Of these 50 occasions, 35 were masses, of which 8 were held in Basilicas, in general St. Peter's, and were attended by large congregations. These included the Christmas Day and Easter masses, at which the Pope himself was the celebrant. The other 27 masses could be held in a smaller, less public space, for which the Cappella Maggiore was used before it was rebuilt on the same site as the Sistine Chapel.\nThe Cappella Maggiore derived its name, the Greater Chapel, from the fact that there was another chapel also in use by the Pope and his retinue for daily worship. At the time of Pope Sixtus IV, this was the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V, which had been decorated by Fra Angelico. The Cappella Maggiore is recorded as existing in 1368. According to a communication from Andreas of Trebizond to Pope Sixtus IV, by the time of its demolition to make way for the present chapel, the Cappella Maggiore was in a ruinous state with its walls leaning.\n\nThe present chapel, on the site of the Cappella Maggiore, was designed by Baccio Pontelli for Pope Sixtus IV, for whom it is named, and built under the supervision of Giovannino de Dolci between 1473 and 1481. The proportions of the present chapel appear to closely follow those of the original. After its completion, the chapel was decorated with frescoes by a number of the most famous artists of the High Renaissance, including Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Pietro Perugino, and Michelangelo.The first mass in the Sistine Chapel was celebrated on 15 August 1483, the Feast of the Assumption, at which ceremony the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary.The Sistine Chapel has maintained its function to the present day and continues to host the important services of the Papal Calendar, unless the Pope is travelling. There is a permanent choir, the Sistine Chapel Choir, for whom much original music has been written, the most famous piece being Gregorio Allegri's Miserere.\n\n\n=== Papal conclave ===\n\nOne of the functions of the Sistine Chapel is as a venue for the election of each successive pope in a conclave of the College of Cardinals. On the occasion of a conclave, a chimney is installed in the roof of the chapel, from which smoke arises as a signal. If white smoke, which is created by burning the ballots of the election, appears, a new Pope has been elected. If no candidate receives the required two-thirds vote, the cardinals send up black smoke\u2014created by burning the ballots along with wet straw and chemical additives\u2014it means that no successful election has yet occurred.The first papal conclave to be held on the Sistine Chapel was the conclave of 1492, which took place from 6 to 11 August of the same year and in which Pope Alexander VI, also known as Rodrigo Borja, was elected.\nThe conclave also provided for the cardinals a space in which they could hear mass, and in which they could eat, sleep, and pass time attended by servants. From 1455, conclaves have been held in the Vatican; until the Great Schism, they were held in the Dominican convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Since 1996, John Paul II's Apostolic Constitution Universi Dominici gregis requires the cardinals to be lodged in the Domus Sanctae Marthae during a papal conclave, but to continue to vote in the Sistine Chapel.Canopies for each cardinal-elector were once used during conclaves\u2014a sign of equal dignity. After the new Pope accepts his election, he would give his new name; at this time, the other Cardinals would tug on a rope attached to their seats to lower their canopies. Until reforms instituted by Saint Pius X, the canopies were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope. Paul VI abolished the canopies altogether, since, under his papacy, the population of the College of Cardinals had increased so much to the point that they would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making the canopies obstruct the view of the cardinals in the back row. In the wake of a conclave taking place to preserve the integrity of the rubble floor on the Sistine Chapel, carpenters install a slightly elevated wooden floor alongside a wooden ramp in the entrance for those Cardinals who for one reason or another need to be transported in a wheelchair.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\nThe chapel is a high rectangular building, for which absolute measurements are hard to ascertain, as available measurements are for the interior: 40.9 metres (134 ft) long by 13.4 metres (44 ft) wide.\nIts exterior is unadorned by architectural or decorative details, as is common in many Italian churches of the Medieval and Renaissance eras. It has no exterior fa\u00e7ade or exterior processional doorways, as the ingress has always been from internal rooms within the Apostolic Palace (Papal Palace), and the exterior can be seen only from nearby windows and light-wells in the palace. Subsidence and cracking of masonry such as must also have affected the Cappella Maggiore has necessitated the building of very large buttresses to brace the exterior walls. The accretion of other buildings has further altered the exterior appearance of the Chapel.\nThe building is divided into three stories of which the lowest is a very tall basement level with several utilitarian windows and a doorway giving onto the exterior court. Internally, the basement is robustly vaulted to support the chapel. Above is the main space, the Sistine Chapel, the vaulted ceiling rising to 20.7 metres (68 ft). The building had six tall arched windows down each side and two at either end, several of which have been blocked. Above the vault is a third story with wardrooms for guards. At this level, an open projecting gangway was constructed, which encircled the building supported on an arcade springing from the walls. The gangway has been roofed as it was a continual source of water leaking in to the vault of the Chapel.\n\n\n=== Interior of the Sistine Chapel ===\nThe general proportions of the chapel use the length as the unit of measurement. This has been divided by three to get the width and by two to get the height. Maintaining the ratio, there were six windows down each side and two at either end. Defined proportions were a feature of Renaissance architecture and reflected the growing interest in the Classical heritage of Rome.\n\nThe ceiling of the chapel is a flattened barrel vault springing from a course that encircles the walls at the level of the springing of the window arches. This barrel vault is cut transversely by smaller vaults over each window, which divide the barrel vault at its lowest level into a series of large pendentives rising from shallow pilasters between each window. The barrel vault was originally painted brilliant-blue and dotted with gold stars, to the design of Piermatteo Lauro de' Manfredi da Amelia. The pavement is in opus alexandrinum, a decorative style using marble and coloured stone in a pattern that reflects the earlier proportion in the division of the interior and also marks the processional way from the main door, used by the Pope on important occasions such as Palm Sunday.\nA screen or transenna in marble by Mino da Fiesole, Andrea Bregno, and Giovanni Dalmata divides the chapel into two parts. Originally these made equal space for the members of the Papal Chapel within the sanctuary near the altar and the pilgrims and townsfolk without. However, with growth in the number of those attending the Pope, the screen was moved giving a reduced area for the faithful laity. The transenna is surmounted by a row of ornate candlesticks, once gilt, and has a wooden door, where once there was an ornate door of gilded wrought iron. The sculptors of the transenna also provided the cantoria or projecting choir gallery.\n\n\n== Decoration ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe first stage in the decoration of the Sistine Chapel was the painting of the ceiling in blue, studded with gilt stars, and with decorative borders around the architectural details of the pendentives. This was entirely replaced when Michelangelo came to work on the ceiling in 1508.\nOf the present scheme of frescos, the earliest part is that of the side walls. They are divided into three main tiers. The central tier of the walls has two cycles of paintings, which complement each other, The Life of Moses and The Life of Christ. They were commissioned in 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV and executed by Domenico Ghirlandaio, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Cosimo Rosselli and their workshops. They originally ran all round the walls, but have since been replaced on both end walls.\nThe project was perhaps supervised by Perugino, who arrived at the chapel prior to the Florentines. It is probable that the commission of Ghirlandaio, Botticelli and Roselli was part of a reconciliation project between Lorenzo de' Medici, the de facto ruler of Florence, and Pope Sixtus IV. The Florentines started to work in the Sistine Chapel in the spring of 1481.\nBeneath the cycles of The Life of Moses and The Life of Christ, the lower level of the walls is decorated with frescoed hangings in silver and gold. Above the narrative frescos, the upper tier is divided into two zones. At the lower level of the windows is a Gallery of Popes painted at the same time as the Lives. Around the arched tops of the windows are areas known as the lunettes which contain the Ancestors of Christ, painted by Michelangelo as part of the scheme for the ceiling.\nThe ceiling was commissioned by Pope Julius II and painted by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512. The commission was originally to paint the twelve apostles on the triangular pendentives which support the vault; however, Michelangelo demanded a free hand in the pictorial content of the scheme. He painted a series of nine pictures showing God's Creation of the World, God's Relationship with Mankind, and Mankind's Fall from God's Grace. On the large pendentives he painted twelve Biblical and Classical men and women who prophesied that God would send Jesus Christ for the salvation of mankind, and around the upper parts of the windows, the Ancestors of Christ.\nIn 1515, Raphael was commissioned by Pope Leo X to design a series of ten tapestries to hang around the lower tier of the walls. The tapestries depict events from the Life of St. Peter and the Life of St. Paul, the founders of the Christian Church in Rome, as described in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. Work began in mid-1515. Due to their large size, manufacture of the hangings was carried out in Brussels, and took four years under the hands of the weavers in the shop of Pieter van Aelst. Raphael's tapestries were looted during the Sack of Rome in 1527 and were either burnt for their precious metal content or were scattered around Europe. In the late 20th century, a set was reassembled from several further sets that had been made after the first set, and displayed again in the Sistine Chapel in 1983. The tapestries continue in use at occasional ceremonies of particular importance. The full-size preparatory cartoons for seven of the ten tapestries are known as the Raphael Cartoons and are in London.At this point, the decorative scheme displayed a consistent iconographical pattern. The tier of Popes, which, in the scheme intended by Pope Julius, would have appeared immediately below the Twelve Apostles, would have emphasised the apostolic succession. It has been argued that the present scheme shows the two Biblical Testaments merged in order to reveal the Old predicting and framing the New, synthesizing, the logic of the Christian Bible.This was disrupted by a further commission to Michelangelo to decorate the wall above the altar with The Last Judgment, 1537\u20131541. The painting of this scene necessitated the obliteration of two episodes from the Lives, the Nativity of Jesus and the Finding of Moses; several of the Popes and two sets of Ancestors.\n\n\n== Frescoes ==\n\n\n=== Southern wall ===\nThe southern wall is decorated with the Stories of Moses, painted in 1481\u20131482. Starting from the altar, they include:\n\nMoses Leaving to Egypt by Pietro Perugino and assistants\nThe Trials of Moses by Sandro Botticelli and his workshop\nThe Crossing of the Red Sea by Cosimo Rosselli, Domenico Ghirlandaio or Biagio di Antonio Tucci\nDescent from Mount Sinai by Cosimo Rosselli or Piero di Cosimo\nPunishment of the Rebels by Sandro Botticelli\nTestament and Death of Moses by Luca Signorelli or Bartolomeo della Gatta\n\n\n=== Northern wall ===\n\nThe northern wall houses the Stories of Jesus, dating to 1481\u20131482. They include:\n\nBaptism of Christ by Pietro Perugino and assistants\nTemptation of Christ by Sandro Botticelli\nVocation of the Apostles by Domenico Ghirlandaio\nThe Sermon on the Mount, attributed to Cosimo Rosselli\nThe Delivery of the Keys by Pietro Perugino\nThe Last Supper by Cosimo Rosselli\n\n\n=== Eastern wall ===\n\nResurrection of Christ by Hendrick van den Broeck (1572) over Domenico Ghirlandaio's original\nDisputation over Moses' Body by Matteo da Lecce (1574) over Luca Signorelli's original\n\n\n=== Michelangelo's frescoes ===\n\nMichelangelo was commissioned by Pope Julius II in 1508 to repaint the vault, or ceiling, of the Chapel. The work was completed between 1508 and late 1512. He painted the Last Judgment over the altar, between 1535 and 1541, on commission from Pope Paul III Farnese.Michelangelo was intimidated by the scale of the commission, and made it known from the outset of Julius II's approach that he would prefer to decline. He felt he was more of a sculptor than a painter, and was suspicious that such a large-scale project was being offered to him by enemies as a set-up for an inevitable fall. For Michelangelo, the project was a distraction from the major marble sculpture that had preoccupied him for the previous few years.The sources of Michelangelo's inspiration are not easily determined; both Joachite and Augustinian theologians were within the sphere of Julius' influence.\n\n\n==== Ceiling ====\n\nTo be able to reach the ceiling, Michelangelo needed a support; the first idea was by Julius' favoured architect Donato Bramante, who wanted to build for him a scaffold to be suspended in the air with ropes. However, Bramante did not successfully complete the task, and the structure he built was flawed. He had perforated the vault in order to lower strings to secure the scaffold. Michelangelo laughed when he saw the structure, and believed it would leave holes in the ceiling once the work was ended. He asked Bramante what was to happen when the painter reached the perforations, but the architect had no answer.\nThe matter was taken before the Pope, who ordered Michelangelo to build a scaffold of his own. Michelangelo created a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from holes in the wall, high up near the top of the windows. Contrary to popular belief, he did not lie on this scaffolding while he painted, but painted from a standing position.Michelangelo used bright colours, easily visible from the floor. On the lowest part of the ceiling he painted the ancestors of Christ. Above this he alternated male and female prophets, with Jonah over the altar. On the highest section, Michelangelo painted nine stories from the Book of Genesis. He was originally commissioned to paint only twelve figures, the Apostles. He turned down the commission because he saw himself as a sculptor, not a painter. The Pope offered to allow Michelangelo to paint biblical scenes of his own choice as a compromise. After the work was finished, there were more than three hundred figures. His figures showed the creation, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the Great Flood.\nThe painted area is about 40 m (131 ft) long by 13 m (43 ft) wide. This means that Michelangelo painted well over 5,000 square feet (460 m2) of frescoes.\n\n\n==== The Last Judgement ====\n\nThe Last Judgement was painted by Michelangelo from 1535 to 1541, between two important historic events: the Sack of Rome by mercenary forces of the Holy Roman Empire in 1527, and the Council of Trent which commenced in 1545. The work was designed on a grand scale, and spans the entire wall behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel. The painting depicts the second coming of Christ on the Day of Judgment as described in the Revelation of John, Chapter 20. High on the wall is the heroic figure of Christ, with the saints clustered in groups around him. At the bottom left of the painting the dead are raised from their graves and ascend to be judged. To the right are those who are assigned to Hell and are dragged down by demons.\nThe Last Judgement was an object of a bitter dispute between Cardinal Carafa and Michelangelo. Because he depicted naked figures, the artist was accused of immorality and obscenity. A censorship campaign (known as the \"Fig-Leaf Campaign\") was organized by Carafa and Monsignor Sernini (Mantua's ambassador) to remove the frescoes.\nThe Pope's Master of Ceremonies Biagio da Cesena said \"it was most disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures, exposing themselves so shamefully, and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather for the public baths and taverns.\" In response Michelangelo worked da Cesena's semblance into the scene as Minos, judge of the underworld. It is said that when he complained to the Pope, the pontiff responded that his jurisdiction did not extend to hell, so the portrait would have to remain. Michelangelo also painted his own portrait, on the flayed skin held by St Bartholomew.\nThe genitalia in the fresco were later covered by the artist Daniele da Volterra, whom history remembers by the derogatory nickname \"Il Braghettone\" (\"the breeches-painter\").\n\n\n== Restoration and controversy ==\n\nThe Sistine Chapel's ceiling restoration began on 7 November 1984. The restoration complete, the chapel was re-opened to the public on 8 April 1994. The part of the restoration in the Sistine Chapel that has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe and removed the original intent of the artist.\n\nThe problem lies in the analysis and understanding of the techniques utilised by Michelangelo, and the technical response of the restorers to that understanding. A close examination of the frescoes of the lunettes convinced the restorers that Michelangelo worked exclusively in \"buon fresco\"; that is, the artist worked only on freshly laid plaster and each section of work was completed while the plaster was still in its fresh state. In other words, Michelangelo did not work \"a secco\"; he did not come back later and add details onto the dry plaster.\nThe restorers, by assuming that the artist took a universal approach to the painting, have taken a universal approach to the restoration. A decision was made that all of the shadowy layer of animal glue and \"lamp black\", all of the wax, and all of the overpainted areas were contamination of one sort or another: smoke deposits, earlier restoration attempts, and painted definition by later restorers in an attempt to enliven the appearance of the work. Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau's critical reading of the restoration data that have been provided, the chemists of the restoration team decided upon a solvent that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster. After treatment, only that which was painted \"buon fresco\" would remain.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Replicas ==\nThe only reproduction of the Sistine Chapel ceiling was painted by Gary Bevans at English Martyrs' Catholic Church in Goring-by-Sea, Worthing, West Sussex, England. A full-size architectural and photographic replica of the entire building was commissioned by the Mexican Government and funded by private donors. It was on view at Mexico City from 1 June to 15 July 2016; it may then be exhibited at other Mexican cities and possibly elsewhere in the world. It took 2.6 million high definition photographs to reproduce the totality of the frescoes and tapestries. A video of the history of the Chapel is shown to the visitors before entering the building; inside, a light-and-sound demonstration explains the content of each of the frescoes.\n\n\n== Quotes on Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel ==\nWithout having seen the Sistine Chapel one can form no appreciable idea of what one man is capable of achieving.\nThis work has been and truly is a beacon of our art, and it has brought such benefit and enlightenment to the art of painting that it was sufficient to illuminate a world which for so many hundreds of years had remained in the state of darkness. And, to tell the truth, anyone who is a painter no longer needs to concern himself about seeing innovations and inventions, new ways of painting poses, clothing on figures, and various awe-inspiring details, for Michelangelo gave to this work all the perfection that can be given to such details.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArt patronage of Julius II\nItalian Renaissance painting\nIndex of Vatican City-related articles\nBasilica di Santa Maria Maggiore\nThe Agony and the Ecstasy (1965 film)\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Sistine Chapel at Wikimedia Commons\nVatican Museums Online: Sistine Chapel A virtual detailed tour of the frescoes and panels\nHigh-resolution interactive virtual tour of the Sistine Chapel\nZoomable Panoramic View of the Sistine Chapel (HTML5)\nThe Devilish Chapel of Michelangelo\nWeb Gallery of Art: Visit to the Sistine Chapel in Vatican\nBBC News: Sistine Chapel Restored (1999)\nThe Restoration of the Sistine Chapel: Right or Wrong?\nwww.christusrex.org Capella Sistina Master Plan & Pictures",

The chapel\u2019s exterior is drab and unadorned, but its interior walls and ceiling are decorated with frescoes by many Florentine Renaissance masters. The frescoes on the side walls of the chapel were painted from 1481 to 1483. On the north wall are six frescoes depicting events from the life of Christ as painted by Perugino, Pinturicchio, Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Cosimo Rosselli. On the south wall are six other frescoes depicting events from the life of Moses by Perugino, Pinturicchio, Botticelli, Domenico and Benedetto Ghirlandaio, Rosselli, Luca Signorelli, and Bartolomeo della Gatta. Above these works, smaller frescoes between the windows depict various popes. For great ceremonial occasions the lowest portions of the side walls were covered with a series of tapestries depicting events from the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. These were designed by Raphael and woven in 1515\u201319 at Brussels.The most important artworks in the chapel are the frescoes by Michelangelo on the ceiling and on the west wall behind the altar. The frescoes on the ceiling, collectively known as the Sistine Ceiling, were commissioned by Pope Julius II in 1508 and were painted by Michelangelo in the years from 1508 to 1512. They depict incidents and personages from the Old Testament. The Last Judgment fresco on the west wall was painted by Michelangelo for Pope Paul III in the period from 1534 to 1541. These two gigantic frescoes are among the greatest achievements of Western painting. A 10-year-long cleaning and restoration of the Sistine Ceiling completed in 1989 removed several centuries\u2019 accumulation of dirt, smoke, and varnish.

          "This is one of the most unforgettable and transformative experiences to date. Please take your time here. I would advise anyone traveling to give yourself a whole day for the Sisitjne Chapel & Vatican. Go see the other places on alternative days. There is so much here to take",
          "The walk through the museum is amazing with stunning artwork on the ceilings. Then you enter the Sistine chapel, no photos allowed here so just stand back and soak up the artwork and atmosphere. It truly is mesmerising!",
          "After being there, there is no way I would try to do this on my own unless I was an art scholar, art historian, or REALLY into the background info on the artists of the Vatican. We did a great \"faster than skip the line\" tour and the price was WELL WORTH IT! This place will",
          "We have visited the Sistine Chapel three times. It is not to be missed. Yes, you have to be quiet and yes, you will be directed through the chapel by security to keep visitors moving but it is so worth it.",
          "Historical and religious structure that will amaze us and admire us since centuries ago. Me and my friend put this place at the end of list and we spent most of our time in here. We didn't regret because of it. Only our sadness is we couldn't able to take photos. Because it was",
          "The chapel paintings were recently renovated and the vivid colors and detail Are awe inspiring. You can\u2019t take pictures inside the chapel",
          "Top tip avoid and ignore all the helpful people offering directions and fast access. Several were telling us there were massive queues. We walked straight into the museum despite being just after the wednesday audience. There is seating around the edge so it is fantastic",
          "Must do visit when in Rome. Masterpiece of Michelangelo's Creation of Man alone is well worth the time. The complex itself is immense and takes a good 3 hours just walking through. It was good to book a skip the line ticket so you don't have to queue even when the crowds are",
          "After a tiring walk in all the museums inside the Vatican we finally entered the main hall of Sistine Chapel which was magnificent and very interesting with the paintings leaving you in awe! You can skip the museums if you want and go directly to the chapel. The security staff",
          "Got to the Sistine Chapel at the end of a long tour. Already overwhelmed and tired feet. It was very crowded and those who had seats were not giving them up. We stayed as long as the Rick Steve\u2019s audio tour lasted (which mostly duplicated what the tour guide told us a couple",
          "You should visit, it\u2019s amazing and it\u2019s free entrance for now as the guide tour told us ... all the church in Italy is entrance free",
          "We've visited the Sistine Chapel a half dozen times. This time, we bought the early entrance ticket (you enter about 7:30 a.m, about 90 minutes before the crowds). The Chapel is a remarkable experience at any time. But it is so much more sacred, and stunning, when you are one of",
          "Beautiful to the extreme, but disappointing that you are packed in like sardines & cannot take photos without security yelling at you to stop & be quiet. I totally understand the be quiet part but with today's technology why no photos of history is most famous paintings? But",
          "Stunning paintings in the Chapel and even on the corridors coming up to it. Crowds are controlled but its truly lovely to see in person. We went in November of this year (2019) and it was packed due to All souls day on the Friday and closed on the Sunday. I'd go again",
          "It's the Sistine Chapel. Don't be in a hurry. Linger near a seated family, they're probably not staying long and then sit and look up and notice the details. I listened to Rick Steves audio while I looked and thought it explained well what I was seeing.",
          "The Sistine Chapel is beautiful. It was definitely worth it to have a tour booked to allow for easier navigation as the Vatican is quite immense. Make sure to schedule a time in advance for your Vatican visit if coming during a busy time.",
          "Loved the build up to the Sistine Chapel. Only thing is, I think they should limit number of people into the chapel at one time. Too many people who were also chatting (signs say complete silence) took away the atmosphere and spoilt this a little.",
          "You can\u2019t say you have visited Rome if you have not toured the Sistine Chapel.. Do it in early December before school let\u2019s out for Christmas.. Weather is mild/cool and crowds are light.",
          "You don't have to be Catholic to enjoy and be amazed by beautiful Vatican City and the Sistine Chapel is such a highlight! They ask that everyone remain silent while in the Chapel and, the only deterrent from the overwhelming sense of awe and peace felt while within, were all",
          "One man\u2019s work on the ceiling. His four years of day and nights spent on it. Not forgetting he was a sculptor, not a painter.

          "If you\u2019re going to see one thing in the Vatican City then The Sistine Chapel is a must. Nothing can prepare you for the incredible painted chapel especially when you know that it was done by one man all those hundreds of years ago. Numerous paintings form the overall chapel and",
          "This Chapel is certainly famous and impressive, but it gets terribly crowded. And why no pictures without flash??? And it's very strange when the Priest or staff yells VERY LOUDLY every few minutes to Be Quiet! This is a Church! Thanks for yelling. I'm sure God appreciates",
          "Everything in Vatican city is amazing, especially Sistine Chapel. We've spent couple of hours in that place because of piece and special feelings there.",
          "Although I was a little disappointed in the chapel itself I could not help but be awed by the story behind it. It is nowhere near as impressive as the Doge's Palace in Venice but it is beautiful in its own way. It is probably the single best place to experience the Fresco's of",
          "The Sistine Chapel was one of my favorite sights in Roma. You see it in literature and hear about its magnificence, but nothing compares to seeing it in person. Personally, I think you could spend all day in there trying to comprehend it, but our audioguide tour took",
          "We reserved our tickets on line \u20ac21 including reservation fee. Simple process to gain entry and collect tickets however there was no need to reserve tickets. Would you believe no queue walked straight in. No matter everything was fabulous and the icing on the cake the Sistine",
          "This is a fantastic piece of art work and history which is extremely famous. It takes up about 15-30 minutes to take in the whole thing and forms part of the Vatican Museum. One thing to note is that you are not allowed to take photographs (so I can't understand why there are",
          "The sistine chapel was the icing on the cake for me. Words can not explain the wonder of this place .Magnificent ,majestic and totally breathtaking are only some of the words that spring to mind.",
          "I advise you to cross off a whole day when you visit the Sistine Chapel as it is huge and takes a lot of time to go through all the sections, even if you were to rush things, which I wouldn't recommend.",
          "Significantly bigger than expected, no photos and no noise but only a few guards to enforce it. Beautiful paintings, recommend visiting if you can, we did tour but since you're not allowed to talk, we were just told to meet up after we were finished looking at the ceiling.",
          "Obviously worth visiting, however waiting time for the Vatican and all related sights can get ridiculous. A useful trick to avoid waiting for ages is to stick with a group and get the faster route. Lastly, the fact that no photos are allowed is honestly a total disappointment.",

          "Seeing the Sistine chapel is an amazing experience. Looking at pictures or seeing movies about its creation do not capture the magnitude and wonder of what Michaelangelo created. It is unfortunate that the throngs of tourists and the herding of visitors by staff prevents quiet",
          "Gorgeous! It was very crowded here but that did not take away from the absolutely breathtaking ceiling. Every panel was a masterpiece of its own and together they told the stories of the Old Testament. Some visitors were disrespectful and ignored the warnings of silence and no",
          "The Sistine Chapel is an amazing work of art. The entrance to the chapel is very modern and well organized. On the day we visited it was overwhelmingly crowded. There were multiple tour groups and it was difficult to move through the rooms on the way to the chapel. Once inside",

          "Visited here as part of a tour. Utterly stunningly beautiful. Unbelievable experience and amazing to think that someone could paint something so beautiful as this. Very, very busy with a few benches to sit on. Quiet and Peaceful. We were able to exit at the tour exit rather than",
          "I am fortunate (and old enough!) to have visited the chapel in 1971. I recall two things: I was awed by the frescoes; and the silence. Revisiting the chapel 48 years later was a wholly different experience. While the art of Michelangelo not only has not diminished in its",
          "Wow! What an amazing piece of art, and how on earth it took Michelangelo 4.5 years to build knowing it took 9 years to clean not so long ago. Crowded place but well worth the visit, the whole painting tells a story in itself.",
          "A must-visit if you find yourself in Rome :) You will be awe-struck and amazed by the paintings on the ceiling and the walls, also the story behind each of them.",
          "It is a must see when in Rome. You will be amazed by its beauty and history. Access to the Chapel thru the Vatican Museum, at the end of the great hall. No picture inside the Chapel as there will be guards around throughout. We paid for a early access tour which walks you inside",
          "This place is amazing. We visited in October and the lines were \"less busy\" than in the summer months, but you cant escape the crowds. Nonetheless, the Sistine Chapel is to be seen to be believed. The numerous rooms full of art will leave you speechless and sometimes",
          "Our time in the Sistine Chapel was preceded by an amazing tour of the Vatican. We enjoyed visiting in November when crowds were less and there was time to be still and take in the stories told in the paintings. We can\u2019t wait to come back again. We were told to leave through a",
          "Staff rude and shunted along like cattle with no time to appreciate beauty of chapel. It's a pity as chapel very beautiful place",
          "Pros: Being able to see the chapel & Michelangelo's work in person was just magical, I still can't believe we were there. Cons: You can't take photos, we were there on a Tuesday in Nov & was still SO packed you could hardly move and was stifling. So hot I thought I may faint",
          "Worth a visit but watch the crowds . Totally rammed to the angelic rafters. Best to have a guide as you will understanding the importance and art information.",
          "We took a tour of The Vatican, Sistine Chapel and St. Peter\u2019s Basilica with a small group of about 15. The tour guide was very informative and definitely had a passion for every detail. The problem was, we had been touring for about 90 minutes before we got to the Sistine Chapel",
          "Beautifull place. Lots of history. The great architecture really makes you feel small. Gards are making sure no one is taking pictures in the chapel and keep the crowd moving away from the entrance so everyone can see.",
          "The Vatican really makes you work for your visit to see the Sistine Chapel. It will take you well over an hour, or more, to get through to the Chapel. Then it was way crowded with people.",
          "This is amazing. No pictures are allowed. It is hugely popular, so be prepared for big crowds. Take a guided tour to hear the story.",
          "No words can do justice to this testimonial to talent, artistry, and the biblically based pictorial history of mankind. No picture taking was allowed. One must remain quiet in reverence to this place of religion. Visual buffet for connoisseurs of fine art.",
          "Beautiful chapel. Bought skip the line tickets directly from the official website, use the self guided tour.",
          "The Sistine Chapel is one of those 'once-in-a-lifetime' experiences that every traveller should try and do. Since its restoration and cleaning, the colours of ceiling have become so much more vibrant and it is a true masterpiece. When we visited it was quite crowded and it is",
          "The chapel is a wonderful site, very beautiful. There is however no control over the numbers at any time and the noise can get very loud. Years ago it was a Swiss guard, in uniform who would clap his hands to quieten the crowd,now it's a security guard with a megaphone. (Not",

          "There's not much that I can add to the thousand of reviews. This is singularly spectacular. The Sistene Chapel is down a couple of rows of stairs and is a quiet and reflective zone. There are actually bench seats provided along the sides of the chapel where you may sit and",
          "Brilliant would highly recommend if visiting Rome. We purchased a skip the line ticket to access the museums and Sistine chapel online around \u20ac27 each. Can get very busy and lots of touts and street seller's which can get annoying especially when you have an umbrella with you",

          "After visit vatican musium visit this church completed see the best .dont need pay separately to visit it and just buy ticket for vatican musium.",
          "That fellow Michaelangelo sure could paint. Its smaller than you might think but no less stunning. A must visit. Just visit very early to avoid the biblically long queues...... !",
          "Smaller than expected but the works of Michaelangelo are amazing. Photos not allowed but many were disrespectful. Try to get to the sides and find a spot on a bench. No other seating is available. It's a bucket list experience.",
          "The reason we traveled to Rome was first and foremost to see the Sistine Chapel. We had not seen it after it was cleaned. Michaelangelo's work was truly revealed in all its glory. And it is wonderful to behold. That, however, is not the only difference between our previous visit",
          "The Chapel is located about a 15 Minute walk from St Peters Square.The line up was so long I ran out of time and did not go in.Go early",

          "The wonder of the Sistene Chapel defies description so the purpose of reviewing is top tips. We pre booked a guided skip the line tour which I'd strongly recommend for two reasons. Firstly you avoid what looked like a torturous queue and secondly there is a wealth of information",
          "I am very glad that I finally had the opportunity to see the Sistine Chapel. You have to walk for about forty minutes through utterly enormous lines to get to it. The whole passage way is like a museum, so the walk is not boring. However, if you have young children who need the",
          "Our tour group only had 20 minutes in the chapel so I was glad I'd done my homework before so I understood what I was looking at. It was a very special experience. No photos are allowed inside the chapel.",
          "Yes there are a lot of people who wants to visit it and the lines are long but it is worth it.Amazing place to visit.",
          "We loved this chapel, its truely an experience to be here in this church, paintings of the stories of the bible from beginning to end.",
          "Amazing paid to go up well worth it the views were amazing and the kids enjoyed walking to the top !!",
          "You all know what the Sistine Chapel is, and of course it and the Vatican Museums are something you have to see in your lifetime. The problem lies with the amount of people that are let into the building at one time. That number seems to have no upper limit. There are just",
          "We were part of a VIP group and we spent around 10 minutes in the Sistine chapel and it did not disappoint at all the artwork is glorious and nothing can compare to seeing it in real life you are not allowed to take photos in but people tried and had their cameras taken away so",
          "Amazing place to see but there was so many there that I couldn't stay very long. I don't think I would go back again if I return to Rome but I am glad I got to see it.",
          "This is a must to see while in Rome and again I encourage you to book a tour of the Vatican which this will be a part of the tour.",
          "The magnificent artworks adoring the ceilings and walls of the chapel gives one an excellent peek into the genius of Michelangelo despite he being an unenthusiastic painter and more of a sculptor at heart! We were also lucky to have a good guide who ran us through all the",
          "Okay , it\u2019s an amazing place to see and look at for at least 20 mins. Fair play to Michaelanglo! But people ruined it. The authorities really drive it into you before you go in to not speak and not take pictures . So most people just talked normally and lots of people were",
          "Another wonderful site in Rome ruined by crowds and noise. The artwork is obviously beautiful, but it is so packed and noisy that the chapel element is pretty much ruined. We dropped in to several churches we passed by chance on our trip and so many of them were wonderfully",
          "One of the most incredibile buildings I have ever seen. The paintings are truly magnificent and seem to have been made in 3D :)",
          "You come trough it when you visit the vatican. Take your time to look at all the beauty inside of the chapel. It's crowded, but find a spot to look at everything. It's worth it. No pictures or talking aloud in the chapel. Remember to respect the place where you are. A lot of",
          "Michealangelo's Sistine Chapel is amazing! What ruins the ambiance is the repeated announcements to be silent and to not take photos. And of course, people still try to take photos, resulting in more announcements. We used a free app from Rick Steeves to listen to descriptions",
          "Slightly annoying how some people can't abide by the rules of staying silent for a a few minutes in this sacred place, and insisted on chatting in there. Also you cannot take photos but everyone was trying and ignoring the rules. Its busy, and smaller than imagined but amazing",
          "Artwork and sense of history are incredible but be prepared for huge queues. No photos allowed but lots of people ignoring this so the guards spend their time trying to prevent this. Silence expected as well but this is also ignored which is a shame. This place deserves to be",
          "This is such an amazing space. It is good to have some explanation of what you are seeing so read up or do an early am tour. Take some to just sit and contemplate if you can. No photos or videos allowed, also no talking!",
          "Small chapel with lots of people, This was part of my skip the line tour. Was hoping we could have just walk through. Tour was half hour too long of just sitting in the chapel trying to find a place to sit with so many people.",
          "Most people who've visited the Sistine Chapel will insist you must see it when you go to Rome, and then regale you with tales of massive queues to get in, too many people in the Chapel once you do get in, being pushed through too quickly, the cost of tours, no photography",
          "As much as l think the artwork is beautiful and well worth seeing , l wasn't as awe struck as l was in the rooms before, especially the vatican gallery of maps and the beautiful gold ceiling with the breath taking artwork. If your really into art you have to see the sistine",
          "Toured with big momma a great guide. Her knowledge of the Vatican was amazing. Get used to pushing and shoving . Be prepared to push back",
          "It is amazing to see the chapel but you can\u2019t take pictures due to photo rights by the restoration company. Enjoyed seeing it but it is much smaller than expected! Go to St. Peter\u2019s next door... take all the pictures you can... amazing!!",
          "This was high on our \u2018to do\u2019 list, however I was left very underwhelmed. We pre-booked tickets to the Vatican Museum and Sistine chapel as this was recommended to do and I agree, if you\u2019re going to do it definitely prebook to avoid excessive queues and waiting. The chapel is",
          "What amazing art. The Sistine Chapel is a place you need to sit back, relax and enjoy the amazing art and maybe the peace. However, the crowd in here was overwhelming. The security kept yelling for quiet - but how can hundreds of people be quiet especially if the majority of",
          "My wife and I visited the Vatican in the company of a professional guide, who attempted to prepare us for the Sistine Chapel. It is, without a doubt, a beautiful work of art. Unfortunately, far too many people are allowed access to the chapel at a given time. One finds",
          "Hard to put into words this Chapel. Fairly strict rules on dress code, photos and silence, but lots of people still breaking those, so you may as well have a go. It was incredible to see the work of not just Michelangelo but also other old Italian painters like Botticelli",
          "Came to Rome last year but missed this. Worth the return visit. Bought early access visit through Headout. Great value as 2nd group into chapel with excellent guide. Followed up by visit to St Peters basilica",
          "Of course this is a wonder of the world, but you\u2019ve seen it better in photo reproductions than you will see when you are there in person. It is very crowded. You must walk many steps and through crowded corridors to get there. We saw two elderly men needing assistance to get",
          "I was looking forward to being in the Sistine Chapel Paid extra for an early morning visit It was horrible The guards yelling and acting aggressive People in tank tops with selfie sticks Hundreds of people in a very small hot space The entire experience was handled horribly",
          "Go!! No question, you should see this amazing ceiling painting. Worth the extra fee to get the jump to the front of the line and guided tour tickets. It's so amazing when you consider the skill involved in painting this ceiling.",
          "If you go to the Vatican it's a must to see the chapel. Expect a lot of people entering at once, really crowded, but apart from that you can see the most beautiful frescos there is.",
          "In the Sistine chapel you are not allowed to take any photos. I really think this is amazing because you have to really look and embrace the art and craftsmanship that it took to make such an amazing piece of art",
          "Amazing to see Michelangelo\u2019s work and his influence. Definitely a must see when in Rome for the first time.",
          "This was one of the must sees of our trip. I definitely recommend doing one of the tours to get in and out more quickly. But you cannot visit Rome without getting the opportunity to say you saw the Sistine Chapel. They are very strict about the no picture/silent aspects, for",
          "The Sistine Chapel was lovely- stunning and without compare. BUT we had pre booked tickets which we bought on line- joined the group at 8.00 and out guide walked us up to the entrance but there were already huge queues for the other many many pre booked ticket holders",
          "The only way to avoid the 1-2 hours waiting in line and the overcrowding in the chapel is to either join the super-expensive and exclusive 6:30 am tour, or the less expensive guided tours offered between 7-8 am by a number of companies. No, you will not have the chapel for",
          "Its such a famous place, I was pinching myself, finally checking it out. I downloded a free Rick Steve's audioguide and listened to it a couple of times thru as it described what the pictures were about. Be prepared for crowds, but don't worry too much, you can see the ceiling.",
          "I had the exact same mediocre experience as most of the other reviews on Trip Advisor about the Sistine Chapel. Felt like a herd being ushered through a bunch of other galleries for eternity just waiting to make it to the Sistine Chapel without being trampled. Then once in the",
          "We had a guided tour around Vatican City, including the Sistine Chapel and St Peter\u2019s basilica. The chapel was very impressive and there are many paintings to browse. We were disappointed by the number of people crammed in which made the room very hot and stuffy. Also, many of",
          "Nice to see the creation image live, but the time and effort spend too see it was a lot. Once in a lifetime thing, but never again. Unless you can really understand the religious images at the chapel, this might feel like an empty experience.",
          "If you want to see this without the crowds of people you must go on the 1st entry into the chapel... 7.20am tour, does not stop at the museums, just walks through to the chapel. Once there they leave you to view at leisure. At that time wewere able to walk freely, sit on the",
          "We visited in October, took an 8:30am tour of the Museums and Sistine Chapel, however it was sooooo crowded. Wall to wall people, very loud. I couldn't wait to get out.",
          "Chapel is beautiful but the walk to it afyer been sight seeing before was too much and the heat, stuffiness and crowds make it a bit uncomfortable and willing it to be over, lack of seats and open space throughout a bit closptraphobic. Bring student id if student more than half",
          "Lots to see, but somehow the experience is less good when shared with thousands of others who are stomping around and you need to keep the crowd\u2019s pace instead of your own.",
          "on a recent trip to rome i was looking forward to the sistine chapel , we were rushed in and rushed out , do not understand why we could not take photos , as tourist we spend enough money in rome.",
          "First thing.. Pretty a skip the queue.. Well worth it. When we got to the chapel I too was dissapointed. It was so packed you couldn't take it in. People were not listening and taking pics in there, even though there are signs and announcements all over the place including",
          "I have to say I was left very unmoved by the chapel. It didn't help with 1 painting I was interested in looking at properly was the last judgement & you weren't allowed to stand & look at it as it was near the entrance so the herded you on. It's supposed to be silent in there,",
          "This is the third time I've visited the Sistine Chapel and the first time I've been able to see it all in its restored state. It is absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately, this time the visit was spoilt by people not showing due respect, taking pictures, and not being silent? I'm",
          "Everywhere you look inside the chapel are masterpieces. So many images/paintings that can be overwhelming and each one is special. You can\u2019t talk or take photographs inside, even though many try. Do this with a skip the line ticket to the Vatican Museums - do not take a tour -",
          "Michaelangelo's masterpiece must be seen at least once in your life. The level of detail in the frescos leaves me speechless. The only downside is the crowds of people which can make it difficult to truly admire everything.",
          "There was too many people in Sistine Chapel. And it is quite difficult to concetrate on the pieces of art when there are a lot of strangers around you. I really recommend go there around 15.00. I think it is the best time for coming. Good luck",
          "How do you put into words the pure beauty of this work of art by the great Michelangelo. You honestly need to see it to understand. You cannot take photos and you need to stay quiet ( no talking) of course you get the ones that don't listen grr. Honestly stand still look up and",
          "It's a pretty room with impressive paintings, but that's it. You can't take pictures, it's no more impressive than other chapels in Rome and the room is just too small for the number of people allowed in at once. Seriously, you go down this long pathway and maze of museums and",
          "This is the best place to visit and see the splendour of the art work on the walls, floors as well as the ceilings. Every inch of this place is a place of admiration. Spend time hwre as much as possible to admire the great works of art.",
          "Despite the crowds definitively must-see even when you\u2019re not religious. Recommended to visit as soon as possible. After 11 o\u2019clock it gets uncomfortably crowdy.",
          "It was crowded. But beautiful and captivating! Was not disappointed. I can now lay claim to having seen the originals for The Last Supper and The Last Judgment.",
          "We had a small tour of just 4 people. It was just perfect for weaving in and out of the crowds. Our Tours by Raphael - Vatican and Basilica tour was the best tour we had in Italy. Our tour guide was really great! She was informative and engaging. Mama Mia! What a great",
          "This is the place I have visited to see the divine nature of God and to pray for the betterment absolutely serene place",
          "The chapel is the most stunning place and a true masterpiece. You do need to wait a long time in the security queue and to go in. Arrive at least an hour before going in. Allow an hour to walk in the chapel. You can climb up the steps to the very top of the chapel from the side",
          "We enjoyed the guided tour. It is a stunning piece of art made by several top artists of their time.",
          "As an art lover I was hoping to get to look at all of the masterpieces longer than I was able to. If you don\u2019t buy tickets ahead of time the wait can be up to four hours. We bought skip the line tickets but I cannot imagine having to wait in the sun to get into this museum just",
          "I don\u2019t have any pics in the Sistine Chapel as they are not allowed but when I walked through the door it brought tears to my eyes! We were there in September so it wasn\u2019t as crowded as it could have been but I wouldn\u2019t care how crowded it was I wouldn\u2019t miss it! The dome is",
          "Together with my wife we both individually agreed this was a highlight of both our Italy and Greece holiday. Fortuitously the guide left us due to a special service in St Peter's basilica. Consequently, we spent over 2 hours gazing at the ceiling, the walls which represented the",
          "We took a group tour as part of our tour the Sistine chapel, lucky we opted to book our tour guide because its a chaos just to get a ticket..such a beautiful place to visit and explore and we have free time to go by our own pace and sit in a chapel and pray.. I adore all the",
          "No doubt the place is great but people are not being honest because that chapel was way way overcrowded...",
          "Stunning. Artistically Dazzling. Historic. Best ever since they were restored. Monument to the genius of Michelangelo, one of the greatest artists in history. Do not miss the Sistine Chapel. Alas, there is a problem - which is to get to the Sistine Chapel you have to go through",
          "You know you\u2019re in a place that was touched by God when you\u2019re in the Sistine chapel. There\u2019s no describing the feeling of standing there looking up at the paintings. It\u2019s so very much more than I ever expected",
          "This is an impressive room, but it was much too crowded to be enjoyed as it should be. There were guards in the room making sure there was no photography. Between the crowds and the guards, it was not a pleasant place to stay in. The art was impressive, definitely worth a visit,",
          "Never, ever in my life have I been in such crowds! I was expecting crowds, but I was not expecting being jam packed into the Chapel, practically on top of everyone else to see this masterpiece. We took an early morning tour before the public opening at 9. The line for those not",
          "There is only one Sistine chapel so it is worth seeing but be aware that the crowds are stupendous and all atmosphere has gone as a result. If you can go early or late it might be better than my mid morning visit.",
          "As a few people have said in reviews, there isn't a lot of time to enjoy the beauty within. Security ushers everyone through quickly. Taking pictures in some areas is not allowed and it does get hard to take a photo, walk and enjoy the beauty at the same time in areas where",
          "From the rooms of Raphael steps lead to the Capella Sistina, the pope private chapel, a wonderful painted chapel, the walls of the chapel were decorated by several prominent painters of the Renaiissance, like Boticelli etc. and entirely overshadowed by Michelangelo's famous",
          "You are only in there for a minute passing through. Security keeps moving people along, not letting you enjoy it. Looks amazing from what I was able to see.",
          "Sadly we did not enjoy our visit to the Sistine Chapel as much as we would have liked. It is such a wonderful place to visit but they allow thousands of people in at one time and you just get swept along with the crowd and cannot stop to admire or read anything. Even in London,",
          "Beautiful and worth the time. Go early to beat the busy crowds. The frescoes come to life, i enjoyed seeing for real what I had read in books at school",
          "The see the workmanship and attention to detail so close up is impressive to say the least and once seen never forgotten.",
          "Visited as part of a wider tour of the Vatican museums, booked through Headout. We were given the information about the chapel before we entered as you\u2019re not supposed to speak in the chapel - however lots of people did. There were far too many people inside and whilst you could",
          "The Sistine Chapel was breathtaking. It is incredible to think that Michael Angelo painted it so long ago. Although it was extremely crowded, it was still magical. Part of the reason for this was that it was silent and no photos were allowed. This made the experience wonderful.",
          "The photo below is from the internet. Taking pictures is not allowed in the chapel. One will simply be amazed when you enter it. I just prayed as my eyes are in awe to see personally these work of art. Great!",
          "The sanctity of this chapel is very wonderfully maintained. Photography is strictly not allowed inside. Plenty place to sit all around the room and relish the wonderful roof and walls.",
          "What a mess. Thousands of people packed in and no chance to enjoy the environment because you are worried about being trampled. Wouldn\u2019t recommend taking kids. Once inside, everyone is forced to exit through a single tiny side door. There is no line and it seems as though",
          "A masterpiece of art depicting many scenes from the bible, most famous God creating man. Very thought provoking !",
          "the chapel is beyond belief.you enter the room and everywhere you look from the walls to the ceiling is beauty.i closed my eyes and imagined how one man could create everything.he must have been guided by God.to envision how this masterpiece was laid out is something",
          "The Sistine chapel is a must see as the artwork is exceptional. It is no longer possible to take photos in the chapel; but that doesn't mean it is a serene experience. Can get loud as many tours pass thru, but if you can find a seat and just enjoy the moment; I believe you",
          "We visited The Sistine Chapel as part of a guided tour so although we only managed to stay there for 15 minutes it was enough time to take in the beauty of the place. The artwork is amazing and your neck can get a little stiff by looking up but it\u2019s worth it. Obviously the",
          "It was so breath taking for me to see such beautiful art, and to see through the artist point of view is amazing and how he had to do it. It's so beautiful and it was worth seeing.",
          "What an amazing place the story the aura the painting are amazing . Slightly disappointed it closed early as we only got 15 minutes in there but it was long enough to appreciate and admire the artwork .",
          "very nice place. full of wonderful drawings and history. Usually place is very crowded. Best to purchase a skip the line ticket and the book for early morning. Less crowded",
          "The Sistine Chapel has been at the top of my bucket list for as long as I can remember. Finally made that dream come true! We booked a ticket through getyourguide and he was very informative, nice, and even some humor. No regrets doing this tour and recommend using a guide. He",
          "Very stunning but extremely busy at the Vatican . Well worth seeing but if be aware the your going to be in crowds in all day",
          "The actual chapel is very impressive inside and out but there are hundreds of people in there with you and you are ushered along by arrest security guards! You\u2019re also not allowed to take any pictures.",
          "I booked an early morning tour with a company called HeadOut. They promised a tour of the Vatican Museum, Sistine Chapel and St Peter\u2019s Basilica. It was an express tour supposed to last 90 mins. HeadOut are a middle man and buy the tour from City Wonders. We were rushed",
          "So many people were in there at one time, you actually couldn't enjoy it. There were so many people breaking the rule by taking photos. We didn't. Although there were guards, there were far too many people to control. Overall, it was average experience only due to too busy!",
          "The hoards of people crowded into this room made the whole experience terrible - was on a tour but even ahead of the crowds we were all herded into the chapel on a hot day!!! Made to move to the middle with no room to move - such a terrible experience all I wanted to do was",
          "Try not to visit during the midday rush. We went late afternoon and was far quieter. Don\u2019t listen to the signs in the doors about not being able to wear shorts...we wore shorts and nobody said a word. The architecture is unreal and the history of the place was interesting. We",
          "We booked our trip through Get Your Guide website and found Vatican:early entry to museums, Sistine Chapel & St Peter\u2019s through What a Life Tours. The Sistine Chapel portion is so much more then you\u2019ve ever seen in any movie. Our guide presented us with a cheat sheet guide to",
          "We had a guide and I thought we where in there for rather a long time, but that may be me! Great place to see and very busy.",
          "We arranged a 7am tour to visit the Vatican. The Sistine chapel was the first stop, and we were able to enjoy it for 20 minutes with moderate crowds. We then visited the galleries and exited through the Sistine Chapel. This time through the chapel, the crowds were oppressive.",
          "Take the skip the line guided tour it is worth every penny. Also, they explain everything to you. The line up can take hours for you to get in.",
          "A must visit when in Rome, the chapel is stunning, it takes your breath away when you walk in. But you might as well be in a cattle market as you are shouted at and herded through. And then the loud speaker breaking the silence, yes almost silence with the crowds in the",
          "There are no words to express how stunningly beautiful this chapel is, you need to see it to believe it.",
          "We were with a tour company and I had expected great things from the Sistine Chapel but what an anti climax. We were packed lined sardines into the chapel, which we wouldn\u2019t have been able to see except for our pushy tour guide who was marvellous. Lots of guards and security",
          "We were fortunate enough to see the Sistine Chapel in a small group after hours. We had a private guide who provided a vivid description of 'The Last Judgment' complete with the gospel. This was one of the highlights of our trip and will never be forgotten.",
          "It is a trek to get to the Sistine Chapel as you wander through the museum, lots of steps and lots of walking, eventually you arrive !!! And it\u2019s definitely worth it! The Sistine Chapel is just incredible to stay up at ! It does get busy as you would expect, the guards do a",
          "We arrived at the Chapel a full 30 minutes before anyone else came in as part of City Wonder tour. The chapel was lit up by bright lights. As soon as we settled down it was turned off. The magic began as the sun rays fell on the 5 centuries old works. The paint is still",
          "We were booked on a tour and our guide was Gi Gi, he was great and very informative. The chapel is very crowded but you can get out easily if like me you don\u2019t like too many crowds. You do have to cover your knees and shoulders so don\u2019t get caught out, you can wear shorts as",
          "We bought the tickets online prior to our visit so we were fortunate to skip the lines to enter but once inside all the rooms were way too crowded to enjoy the museum, including the Sistine Chapel.",
          "This was a wow moment as the central illustration doesn\u2019t stand out as much as I\u2019d imagine as the whole ceiling is so beautiful. It can get quite Claustrophobic in their as it\u2019s very busy.",
          "Part of our all inclusive Rome in a day by Walkaways....We finished here on an all day tour of Rome. Bring your walking shoes and enjoy. EXCELLENT NO photos in Sistine Chapel.",
          "The sistine chapel is amazing but very crowded. The ceiling is breathtaking, you can stare at it for hours and keep finding a new spot that you did not really see. The colors can take you to an amazing peaceful world of imagination. My advice is to wear confortable shoes when",
          "A must see, but beware the crowds. To see Michelangelo\u2019s masterpiece and realize he did it on his back in his 60\u2019s is just amazing.",
          "I loved all the impressionists works in this museum and the musee de l\u2019 Orangerie. It was incredible seeing them all up close and in person!",
          "I was a little disappointed by the Sistine Chapel. We had fought our way through the museum to make to the chapel where were were herded into the centre of the room by quite aggressive guards. Although the Creation of Adam painting was smaller than I was expecting, I did find it",
          "There's nothing that can be added, it's just a must see. The paintings are something that can't be described. There are some strict rules regarding pictures and filming; avoid yourself the problems, just don't do it, it's that simple. It can get rather crowded, so patience and",
          "Not to much to say but simply amazing and awwwww! My neck hurt the next day due to looking up for so long. Dress code is enforced and NO Pictures! Have respect even though others don\u2019t!",
          "Best tip - study the chapel paintings BEFORE going. There is so much to see, and they hurry you along. So to make the most of your visit, learn about the various panels from your guide ahead of time or go online and study. Be prepared.",
          "Didn\u2019t pay for skip the line and not to bad just queuing as took about an hour to get in. If you like being pestered to buy tat or hats, water and skip the line packages be prepared. Once inside proceeded up a long spiral ramp and then got herded throughout the entire building.",
          "The chapel is beautiful inside, it\u2019s not that big so it\u2019s a bit of a squeeze once your in. The ceiling art is obviously beautiful. It\u2019s definitely worth a visit. No photography allowed inside.",
          "No pictures allowed. It\u2019s supposed to be quiet but people whispering make it a dull roar. The art and tapestry is amazing and worth the wait. This is a must do experience and something I will always cherish.",
          "I felt extremely overwhelmed and wasn't able to appreciate the works of art or sculptures because we were being herded like cattle. So much pushing and shoving to stay with our tour group. We could hardly hear our guide over all the other tour groups.",
          "The Sistine chapel is has a long line to enter but it is still worth it. The art is just breathtaking. A must-see",
          "This is definitely a must to see. It is simply stunning. The hardest part will be leaving the chapel.",
          "It\u2019s a nice ceiling, if you can catch a good look at it between being herded like cattle through the Vatican or being distracted by guards yelling \u201cShhhh!\u201d And \u201cno pictures!\u201d Guards will actually come around and delete pictures from people\u2019s cameras if they catch you. For a",
          "The Sistine Chapel was the best part about our trip to the Vatican Museum. If you can I would just blitz through everything else and go straight here. It is truly amazing and has been well protected. Only downsize is it is incredibly crowded like the rest of the Vatican and I",
          "The chapel is brilliant for art work, you have to appreciate how outstanding this is but We feel that We have seen better chapels across other parts of Europe for taking your breath away. The sheer number of people takes something away from the experience as you are herded in",
          "We were fortunate enough to take the tour with the Guide with all of the keys to open all of the doors first thing in the morning. The tour started at 6am and we literally opened the Vatican Museum door by door and opened the Sistine Chapel in the dark. Our group was 12 people",
          "A truly stunning sight and I recommend to anyone who has not been before, the crowds of people are overwhelming but people travel a long way to see this sight!",
          "The Vatican museum and the Sistine Chapel are a must go place whilst visiting Rome. The museum is quite well organised, so that you can simply walk around without missing any areas. The Sistine chapel was less busy than I expected it. I would recommend booking your ticket ahead",
          "It's one of the most interesting and holy places to visit, photography is not allowed inside the chapel and there is security guards watching people for not taking pictures, beautiful art work and an amazing place to experience",
          "There are so many stories about the murals. I think you can appreciate them more if you know some of the history of the murals. There are some online audio downloads that are good. Be sure to get your ticket early. Try for an early morning or late in the day. 11 to 2 is a",
          "We did a skip the queue tour and walked around by ourselves, which was good because we could side step all the tours which blocked the corridors. The Sistine Chapel was an amazing sight and definitely a must see. My only gripe is trying to walk around, it\u2019s just so busy which",
          "We went at 8.30 am and by the time we got to the Sistine chapel it was so busy it felt very touristy and I didn\u2019t really enjoy it. Which is a really shame, but I feel there is just to many people in there at the same time.",
          "There are really no words to describe the beauty of the art in this place except awe-inspiring! To think that young Michelangelo painted the entire ceiling by himself is just mind boggling! Even if you do not like art - you will find yourself admiring the beauty of everything",
          "BREATH TAKING!!! Says enough. Remember, no photos allowed and must remain quiet, as hard as it will be as you cannot contain your awe and wonder. Really take some time to ponder here and search your feelings and emotions as this will clearly overwhelmingly grab at your heart",
          "All I have heard that this is the most amazing room of paintings by Michelangelo, but since all photos are owned by a Japanese company, no one can take pictures. The Fresco's are amazing and tell the story of Adam and Eve, as well as God with Moses with burning bush. Also Moses",
          "Holy place ..... not really . Completely full of people and noisy Vatican staff pushing them along .... looks like a painted barn .",
          "The Sistine Chapel is a beautiful place. I could stand in there for hours and just look around at how beautiful it is. I recommend it for all ages but mostly for older people.",
          "We went on a very hot day and we were packed in like sardines. We were pushed along there was no way to stop and take it in. People were so disrespectful. If there had been a fire I dread to think how we would have gotten out. This for me out of everywhere we went in Rome, I",
          "I could have stood in awe and studied this room for days, i was lucky to get a spot in the middle of the room and was able to get a sense of the work that must have gone in to creating this masterpiece. It is incredibly busy, however, and a little annoying that some ignore",
          "Breathtaking! I used a guidebook which explained each painting and the history as i wasn't bothered with the audioguide option. A remarkable place to visit. A fast track ticket was ideal to enter the museum as the queue was large, this allowed me to also visit the vatican rather",
          "The intricacies of Michaelangelo\u2019s work are something else. Important to note you can probably see the chapel within 10-15 minutes. Few rules to keep in mind: no talking, no photos and no hats. Also dress code is strict on no shoulders or knees showing. There is security and",
          "Disappointing visit as I was so looking forward to it No respect for silence or appropriate attire Prefer the sacre coeur",
          "Beautiful work by Michael Angelo, the \"judgement day\" painting is amazing, you can look at it for a good half an hour and still not have enough. But again so crowded, it's unbelievable, that's spoils it a bit. No space for any movements, it's like in a sardine can. Shame that no",
          "To view the Sistine Chapel in person was a dream come true! All of the artwork throughout the chapel was breath-taking, but, of course, the Chapel ceiling was the highlight ! Words cannot do it justice. To think that it was painted in just four years is mind-boggling! Be",
          "Enjoyed it but it was so so so busy with guards rushing you in and out and moan if you stand for too long in one place, it didn't make the experience that enjoyable and you didn't get time to fully take in what you were looking at! Make sure you 100% get your tickets in advance",
          "So neat to stand in the middle of the room and think of the hours and hours and effort of painting this work of art. And then to restore it so we can now enjoy it in the same way it was so many years ago. Quite the masterpiece that speaks for itself.",
          "The Vatican is the worlds richest country and bank. For centuries they have accumulated gold and artifacts that are invaluable. Beautiful to see, but one is left to wonder...how many millions of followers could be clothed, fed, and housed if the took just a small portion of",
          "Be sure to allocate plenty of time to enjoy this huge beautiful place full of art works. Make sure to dress appropriately as this is a church",
          "This is a place I always wanted to see and, boy, it does not disappoint. The artwork and history behind it is simply incredible. This venue is a must see when in Rome.",
          "I wish I had photos to post, but alas cameras are forbidden. Make sure you knees and shoulders are covered (which in the summer heat of August was taxing!) seeing the art of Michael Angelo and the beauty of the chapel, as well as the significance of Popes being selected there",
          "Awesome sight. It's truly breath taking. Pity you can't take pictures.when you realise one man painted it in just four years that makes it even more memorable.",
          "If you want to see history this is a must when in Rome. The paintings and sculptures were amazing. The history of the place was equally amazing. There is so much to see and do in Rome",
          "There are no words to describe seeing this magnificent work of art in person, we were lucky to be here when they did one of the prayer that do throughout the day. Religious or not you will feel the presence of greatness.",
          "You enter and it's peaceful. Art was amazing. No photos allowed and there are guards/security. Even the kids enjoyed it.",
          "A true masterpiece so beautiful it almost brings you to tears do not miss it and remember no cameras staff take a very dim view of those trying to break this rule",
          "Although it was quite crowded and very noisy. The sistine chapel itself was beautiful. I do wish they wouldn't pack all the tour groups in like sardines. It would've been nice for it to be silent but with the amount of people that were there it was understandable why it was",
          "The best easy to get the most out off seeing this is to take a tour or even better have a private guide. Having someone explain what you'll be seeing and what to look for makes all the difference.",
          "Genuinely is such a beautiful place. If only tourists would for once in their life respect the rules - be quiet (that means don't announce loudly that you really need to 'take a dump') and don't take photos (yes Chinese dude everyone saw your phone sticking out of your top",
          "But you will still be blown away, by the beauty of the place and the realisation of the extraordinary human feat involved it its conception and creation. Most people stay only 15 minutes or so, but will form a memory lasting a lifetime.",
          "My wife and I walked through magnificent art, architecture, and sculpture, on our way into the Sistine Chapel. While the the experience is like none other I have had in life, it is intensely crowded in the Chapel. If you are fortunate you can find a seat on one of the",
          "This is a must. The art work on the ceiling and walls is outstanding. It is good to be on a tour to find out about the building of and the various artists who worked on it. There are no pictures allowed. The art covers the Creation, Old Testament, New Testament, and the Last",
          "A few places live up to the super hype expectations. Is there just now! Very knowledgeable in the location.",
          "We booked a skip the line tour through Viator, our guide Sev was very knowledgeable, so glad we paid for a tour as the information he gave was excellent. The chapel is just breathtaking - so much history and the art is amazing. Yes it's crowded but things move along although l",
          "It is truly difficult to find the words to capture the beauty of this chapel. To try and imagine Michaelangelo painting the ceiling. The art is truly stunning. Be patient in waiting, for it is worth it.",
          "The Sistine Chapel has a lot of really neat art and it is something that you have to see if you go in this area don\u2019t miss it I really enjoyed it",
          "There was no chance of visiting because of the que. From everywhere dealers of tickets were approaching for the so called \"Skip the Line Tickets\", but you would have to wait in another huge line and pay about the double price!!!",
          "Once you make your walk through the museum, you finally get th o the Chapel and you just choke, your eyes will get watery and your head will start turning in every direction, cause there is so much to see, walls, ceiling and even floors, show much talent and artists showed their",
          "Sistine Chapel was the highlight of the whole Vatican museum experience! Definitely worth the long waiting in the queue outside the museum. There are two paths you can follow, a quick version of the museum and Sistine Chapel and a longer one, where you can also marvel the famous",
          "This was stunning, to see the amazing art in person. Sad I couldn't Take photos, but understandable. It was also very crowded, hot, stuffy and extremely humid. I would avoid late August/ early September.",
          "Exceeded my lifelong expectations. I encourage you to do some homework ahead of time, to get the lay of the land. Which bible scenes are where - front, ceiling, sides. And brush up (no pun intended) on some of the history -- for example, I did not know that Michelangelo painted",
          "There were high expectations before entering, but due to the amount of people being inside the whole experience was very disappointing. There was no time to enjoy the works of art on the walls and ceiling since we were being herded like cattle from one spot to another and the",
          "Takes your breath away. Excellent commentary on the audio guide explaining the paintings and artists. Very busy but no rush to move people along- could spend as long as you wanted in there to take it all in.",
          "You can't come to Rome and not see the Sistine chapel. The Michelangelo masterpiece is an absolute must see. It is crowded in there however and you do need to crane your neck to see the ceiling.. helps to be in the centre of the room. We used a tour group to get in there, queues",
          "This chapel is probably one of the most famous chapels in the world, so I had high expectations when I walked inside. It truly is gorgeous and a masterpiece of artwork, and yet it\u2019s so packed with people that it can be distracting. It\u2019s hard to just enjoy the art when I\u2019m",
          "Okay, but was expecting something different. Nice paintings, but was difficult to stand and enjoy, because of to many people in there at the same time. It was really dark in there, when we visited so it seamed really dark and cold, maybe its a better experience when the sun, is",
          "I\u2019d love to say this was a highlight of my trip as I was looking forward to seeing the Sistine Chapel. However I was extremely disappointed. It was absolutely rammed with people and was baking hot. You could not move and although the art work is beautiful I was more taken with",
          "Super good.Due to old age, I could not look up vertically and thus missed seeing God and Adam. Lying flat on the ground was not an option. Wonder if something can be done about this.Was able to fully appreciate \"The Last Judgement.\" AKSrivastava",
          "I would suggest booking a tour to see the Chapel, they tend to let the groups in because you paid for a ticket, versus general public who is wandering through with ample time. The Chapel itself is absolutely incredible. Words cannot describe how stunning the inside is.",
          "The Sistine Chapel we did not visit because I do not think it\u2019s worth waiting in such huge ques in order to be \u201ccanned like a sardine\u201d into a place where you get a chance to throw a glimpse on the magnificent paintings. Then you will be pushed away for the next paying load that",
          "Sistine Chapel is the last room of our Vatican Museum tour and the highlight of all rooms we saw. This is the room where the famous painting Last Judgement by Michaelangelo is displayed at the ceiling of the room. However, the sacredness of this room is because Sistine Chapel is",
          "It was disappointing. For such a sacred place, the experience never felt that way. It is so crowded in the room that everyone whispering sounds pretty loud. The paintings are incredible of course; but there should be a better way of experiencing and appreciating this room other",
          "Magnificent but frankly you couldn\u2019t enjoy it. We paid 4 skip the line Vatican Museum/Sistine/Basilica guided tour. Guide leaves u @ bottom of steps 2 Sistine Chapel (by toilets/cafe) & gives u 15 mins to meet her @ the back wall of the Sistine Chapel 2 proceed with the tour",
          "I am thrilled that I got to experience a visit to the Sistine Chapel, as this is a bucket list item in Rome. I took a private tour with my family and recommend that visitors take a tour or at a minimum study on your own about the ceiling in advance to be able to take in as much",

          "Not only is the entire freso scene overwhelmingly beautiful, this is where a new Pope get voted for. One brown spot on the marble floor signifies where they place the wood-burning stove for the ballot paprs; Black smoke with charcoal means no vote, white smoke, with added salt,",

          "I was really looking forward to this experience... Before you get into the Chapel itself there are signs enforcing a dress code, no photography and no talking. I was expecting a 'library' atmosphere... what we got couldn't be further from it. We felt like cattle being herded in",
          "Another must see in Rome - the Vatican City and the Sistine Chapel. It\u2019s simply breathtaking and you can see why people come from all over the world view these amazing structures, paintings and sculptures. I would recommend a guided tour to fully appreciate it and also avoid the",
          "Sadly this was not an experience to remember for the right reasons. The sistine chapel is clearly a place that everyone who visits Rome wants to see and the Vatican seems to want as many people crammed through in a day as possible. We were herded in, in a sea of people that",
          "This place is a must see...... I really wish people would respect the rules and not talk inside the chapel. It was absolutely beautiful!",

          "After walking through the museum, this is a great finish to our tour just before we entered St Peters Basilica. The chapel was packed with people, unfortunately there are no photos in the chapel ! Still the best pls e to visit, well worth the tour....",
          "I had read somewhere that the best way to see it is to get there early and go quickly to the chapel and then go back for the other exhibits. That was a great tip. We got tickets as soon as they went on sale, for the day we would be there and got the first entrance time.",
          "It was amazing to see the works on the ceiling. I was there to see the separation of God from man and it did not disappoint. Very crowded and they tried to hurry us through. No pictures allowed.",
          "Really not sure about our visit . It is one of those must see sights but I left feeling underwhelmed by the experience. We visited as a tour and entered by the Museum entrance we followed our guide through the corridors looking at fantastic statues and elaborately decorated",
          "We visited the Sistine Chapel \ud83d\udc92 on a Monday and quite honestly it was a waste of my time. We queued for around 2 hours, due to the fact that many people had fast \ud83d\udca8 track tickets \ud83c\udfab that allowed people to skip the queue. We would\u2019ve bought these if they weren\u2019t considerably",
          "We absolutely loved exploring the Vatican and all the historical sites. The sistine chapel was probably one of the most anticipated sites which didn't disappoint even with all the people. Just be prepared even during the \"skip-the-lines\" tours to be packed like sardines!",
          "It was truly beautiful. The artwork is fabulous and we had time to sit on the side seats to view and take in the details. The highlight of our trip to Rome. Next time a Pope is voted on I will remember this very spiritual place.",
          "We took a tour, with the chapel being the last stop. The artwork and statues that lead up to the chapel are equally beautiful as the Chapel itself. Make sure you follow the dress code , or they will give you a coverup to wear.",
          "This is a must visit and make sure you spend time and study the paintings, they say you can not talk or take photos but we saw people doing both which was a real shame to see",
          "Simply breathtaking! One of Michelangelo's most amazing creations! Do not get discouraged by the crowds and the wait to go inside this beautiful place. Even with so many people around you will find it so peaceful to be there. You must not miss this magnificant chapel if you are",
          "As a Catholic, I found this very moving, detailed, and historical. This far exceeded my expectations and now I know why people have fussed over this for years. You cannot take photos inside -even without flash!",
          "Visited in August 2019. Fist thing to say is you have to walk through the Museum to get to the chapel but because it was August walking thought the museum was stifling hot and there were a staggering amount of people. Tips: do not go in August, you also need a day to appreciate",
          "Booked guided tour on Vatican website for 33 euros. Horrible. The female guide was nice and professional but the single ear phone audio is so bad could only understand 20 percent max of what she said. She speaks into a microphone that is transmitted to your audio set. It's was",

          "We were there about 10am after a tour of the museum, and it was very crowded. I am a fan of art though and wanted to see it. It was awesome to do once, but I don't know that I'll go back. Also, you're not allowed to take photos...",
          "A very special place to visit. It\u2019s a wonder how it was built. Really amazing. Walks of Italy tour guide Maria Grazia was great.",
          "This may not be a popular opinion but the Sistine Chapel is not all that spectacular. The ceiling frescoes are impressive and the restoration work on them has made them look brilliant, but the chapel itself is quite a simple building. Note that you WILL NOT be allowed to take",
          "Spectacular architecture and artwork. Amazing this collection has been built up over the centuries. Such detail in the artwork.",
          "You have to come and see this when in Rome. No talking or photos to be taking. Yet everyone was talking and taking photos. I wish I did now as want a photo of the guy in hell and michela self portrait. It's a must see",
          "The visit to the Vatican and sistine Chapel was amazing. The highlight for me was the ceiling painting by Michael Angelo in the sistine chapel. It took my breath away. Unfortunately you are not allowed to take photographs.",
          "Paintings are a wonder to behold but chapel way to crowded and rushed. Saw guards being very aggressive towards people who may have taken photos even one set of tourists pleading innocence but berated by guards. Constant shouting to be silent by guards. Go early in the morning",
          "Though the crowds can be too much and the over zealous guards a bit intimidating this is something that should be seen at least once in a lifetime. Any student of European art can tell you about the importance of Michelangelo's masterpiece fresco painting. The artist",
          "Overwhelmed by the blockbuster crowd. Seriously, you dont even need to walk because you will just be herded by the sea of people. Just go with the flow :) No pictures allowed inside the chapel but some still do it. Ticket lines to the vatican museum where the sistine chapel is",
          "One of those places that everyone should see. How to accomplish this is not easy. Definitely take this timed guided tour. You'll wait all day without and then not get in. A guide is essential but keeping him/her in view is a challenge so hearing what they have to say is hit",
          "One of the greatest masterpieces on earth. Michelangelo really did he best here. If you can only visit one place in Italy then this is the one. A few tips though. Get there as early as possible, and get some kind of priority entry, its worth it. As the day progresses it",
          "paintings are amazing but time to spent in chapel was at least in our visit limited. security was pushing people to hurry, of course it was crowded and people stop to enjoy the view.",
          "This comes in the latter stages of the Vatican museum tour. You are ushered in by guards who remind you to remain silent & not to take photos. The Sistine Chapel is much smaller than many of the rooms en route. That famed Michelangelo ceiling is certainly impressive.",
          "While the Chapel is very beautiful, the smell from the sweaty tourists was awful. I plan to go again in cooler weather.",
          "The Sistene Chapel was #1 on my list of things to see in Rome -- and I was not disappointed. It is magnificent! However, we had a tour guide and she was not allowed to be with us while we were in the chapel (so she had to tell us what to look for beforehand). Also, you are",
          "Visited the Sistine Chapel and found the whole experience amazing the only down side is you get herded into the room like cattle and get 10 minutes in the room and herded back out. It is beautiful to look at and a wonderful experience. You're not allowed to take photos whilst",
          "Pity we were too tired and saturated with art - so many beautiful things - when arrived at Sistine Chapel! See the movie about Michelengelo painting this wonder - \"The Agony and the Ecstasy\"",

          "Home to Pope, Vatican City is also a home to Vatican museum and Sistine Chapel which hold art of the state paintings!! Honestly, all of it will take you to another world. The paintings of Michelangelo, Raphael and few other will definitely leave you speechless. You can\u2019t stop",
          "Fortunately, when visiting the Sistine Chapel everything you want to see is high above you which means you look beyond the hoards of people crowding the space. Our private guide gave us a great intro to the chapel before we entered which made it much more enjoyable once we were",
          "We have selected a skip the line guiding tour where we had the opportunity to visit the place very early, before it becomes too crowded. The minutes we spend under this spectacular roof were exceptional. An experience that you certainly have to live.",
          "The sistine chapel needs no introduction. However what tourists must note is the fact that its super crowded all the time and hence there is some groundwork that is best done before going. Tickets: Generally the Vatican museum tickets will include an entrance to the Sistine",
          "No pictures a loud bit some things are so beautiful you don't need pictures! We were there when they had a brief service. Memory if a lifetime!",
          "You have to visit here! The artwork and architecture is just out of this world. What a gorgeous building. It's a must visit when in Rome!!",
          "Personally I would manage the s p.o Ave a little differently to reduce the overcrowding and allow time to sit and reflect on the masterpiece. It is a must see regardless and as with most things Rome, get there early.",
          "We visited this chapel with a skip the line 8 AM tour in hot July that included the Vatican Museums and St. Peter's Basilica (booked through TripAdvisor, company was Nicom Tours). Despite our early time, there was a massive line to get in and it took an hour to get from the tour",
          "It was a very colourful place, full of paintings and others but it was very small I thought this place should be bigger. Anyway I liked it.",
          "On last Sunday in the month entry to Sistine Chapel (and Vatican Museum) is free between 09:30 and 12:30 ! Get up early because the queue is substantial, but once open moves very swiftly and efficiently \ud83d\udc4d Just marvel at the frescoes by Michelangelo, you could sit there all day",
          "You spend your childhood looking at pictures in history books of this very special place on earth. Then you fight thru the horses of humanity heading down the steps and you enter into the single most SPECIAL place you will ever see. Hard to describe and difficult to believe",
          "Everyone has heard of Michelangelo painting the ceiling of The Sistine Chapel. You can't imagine it until you have seen it yourself. The entire ceiling is covered with paintings. The walls are covered with frescoes. It is a sight to be seen and remembered for life. Unfortunately",
          "The Sistine chapel is great, it is a shame that photos, even without flash, are not allowed. I would definitely recommend to see it once in their lives.",
          "This was so worth visiting. My family got a tour that allowed us to enter early before the mass crowds. Paying for the early entrance was worth while to be able to listen to the audio guide and actually walk to each part of the chapel to see the art. The story of the creation of",
          "Don\u2019t worry about the dress code, they were letting people in wearing whatever they wanted. Don\u2019t worry about being silent, nobody else is. A complete lack of respect from the majority of tourists ruins the whole experience! People taking photos whilst making a provocative pose.",
          "You've read about it. Books and photos do not do it justice. It must be seen to appreciate the richness of the colors, to hear how Michaelangelo laid on his back to paint for years! Get the lowdown on how he was coerced to paint it. A must stop among all the wonders of Roma.",
          "Only a mentally deranged insane person would not give 5 stars. Yes it's crowded, yes it's warm, no you can't take pictures, and it is still one of the greatest sights a human can witness. No words can describe the beauty. I almost cried just staring, it is very moving. And I'm",
          "It is one of the important place for catholics and also it is very important part of Vatican. Tickets for Vatican museum is together with sistine chapel. My suggestion buy tickets from internet so you can pass the long queue and try to go earlier. The architecture is amazing",
          "Beautiful. Don't know where to look. Floor mosaics amazing and the paintings are incredible. Booked a tour before normal opening hours to beat the rush. People were lining up for entry 2 hours before it opened.",
          "This is a place with lots of history. It is included in the vatican museums visit, near the ending of the visit.",
          "Beautiful piece of history but not for July. So hot and crowded it could not be enjoyed. There are no pictures permitted and talking is to be silenced. It wasn\u2019t. I wish I could say more positive things but I was disappointed. I would see only St. Peter\u2019s Cathedral if I had to",
          "We visited as part of a Vatican Museum tour. Without doubt it is impressive and a must see for any visitor to Rome. However I can\u2019t help but be disappointed by the tourist experience as you are herded around not allowed to talk (although there were constant announcements !!) and",
          "A must see .... a breathtaking experience shared by the whole family. Totally out of this world. If you visit Rome and don\u2019t visit Sistine Chapel \ud83d\udc92.... your mad ....",
          "If you are going to visit Rome, you have to see the Sistine Chapel. Nothing like it anywhere. Unfortunately, you may have to go thru the Vatican Museam to see it as I couldn't find a tour ot entrance to Sistine Chapel without the Vatican Museum which makes for a long tour.",
          "The title says it all, the Sistine Chapel is truly iconic. However, like other have said, you do feel herded into it along with a crush of other people and there are people constantly yelling for you not to take a photo. Also, it is quite far above your head so you're craning",
          "Almost too much to take in, just magnificent. The story in paintings is truly unbelievable. Last time we went we were ushered through like cattle and that it truly all I remembered. This time we went late and found it not crowded. So we sat and admired, and sat and admired more,",
          "The amount of art painted onto the walls/ceiling... Wow! Was surreal to see the Last Judgement in person.",
          "Very busy but has a lot of historical artworks. Definitely a sight to see in the Vatican- but be prepared for crowds!",
          "This chapel isn't big, but has significant history. Take the time to appreciate it and absorb the atmosphere. Note it is a place to be respected, not a cafe to chat with our friends. Note, no photographs are permitted, it's not hard to refrain.",
          "Visited the Vatican Museums with the Sistine Chapel being the final stop of the tour, the Chapel is awe inspiring looking at all the art on view, the only negative was even though you are clearly told photos and video are not allowed their are some disrespectful visitors that",
          "Well, i was fool with the skip the line tickets... We were suppose to enter at 10. We finally enter at 12 ( due to the fact that we were late for our appointment by 25 minutes .. was our fault) At that time there was no line! So we pay 100 for 4 persons , while the entrance",
          "This tour blew my mind away. The Sistine chapel is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. The pictures don\u2019t do it justice.",
          "I have been fortunate to see the Sistine Chapel on multiple occasions. It is stunning. We had pre-ordered tickets which was great. We had 22 people and a couple of people with us had knee problems. Make sure you take the elevators for those with leg issues. We went in June, so",
          "One of the most amazing place you can go to but security just screamed at you not to take the photos and there is so many people.",
          "Obviously this is a place you need to go, it can get swamped and Rome is underratedly hot, also you can get cheaper airfare from the US going in the fall...so yeah, go in the fall.",
          "We walked through the museum for at lease 1.5 hours because they make you go through it to get to the chapel. Once in the chapel, I expected reverence and silence. Instead, it was really loud, wall to wall people with some sitting on the floor. It wasn't worth it.",
          "We bought skip the line ticket and honestly it was useless as the line inside to buy tickets was pretty short. However, on the inside there were SO MANY people that it was hard to enjoy anything. We heard about the \u201cstrict dress code,\u201d and we wore modest clothing. But there\u2019s no",
          "Arrived in civitavecchia by ship , 5 mins to train station, 13\u20ac by train to st peters Make sure you buy from Vatican online your tickets b4 hand and make sure you open your email and bring up your booking as no wifi and internet very poor in there, there was a massive queue",
          "The chapel itself is surprisingly small and plain. The overhead frescoes are gorgeous. However, the Vatican doesn't limit the number of people it allows to enter so it is crowded, noisy and not spiritual. It's something you have to do if you visit Rome but it wasn't at all",
          "I was so looking forward to seeing the Sistine Chapel but the way the Vatican staff presented the work of Michelangelo was disappointing. Unlike the Vatican\u2019s decision to give Michelangelo all the time he needed, the Vatican of today rushes you through the jammed-packed room",
          "Guess one of those things you have to check off your bucket list in life, but to be very honest it was quite underwhelming compared to the hype around it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Michaelangelo was a genius and the paintings are awe inspiring but I just wish the chapel itself was",
          "You can see all the Apostles, the creation of Adam , scenes from the old testament, the quality and quantity its too much to take in! Its very impressive but the queue and the amount of people inside make it a bit oppressive.",
          "Once in a lifetime experience- strongly recommend visiting if you are in Rome. The paintings covering walls of the chapel are so beautiful and well preserved. Sistine Chapel is a part of Vatican Museums. Both the museums and the chapel get extremely crowded which makes the",
          "If you do nothing else in Rome; make time for the Sistine Chapel and the opportunity to see the most photographed price of art in the world, but no photo can do this masterpiece justice and when you see it for yourself I promise you\u2019ll be in awe.",
          "Yes it is beautiful but not peaceful. You will be rushed through it. People are not supposed to take any pictures ot talk inside the chapel but still it was very loud. I have heard if you book private tour then only your family will be there before it opens to public but will",
          "We bought tickets - \u2018skip the line tickets\u2019 but that is maybe just a buy a ticket before the day you go ticket .....you still have to queue. You need to go in the morning so that when you are lining up you have shade from the walls. I would not like to be in the queue from",
          "The ceilings, the frescoes! You must see them yourself and hear the stories from an experimented guide. It was just breathtaking!",
          "Best to visit the chapel via a tour (skip the line) so you can enter before the museum opens. Having several minutes for yourself to enjoy Michaelangelo's work is truly spectacular! Once the public comes in, it will be noisy and crowded. Best experience for me in Vatican!",
          "It is an absolutely beautiful chapel with great significance. It is crowded and there are rude people who talk and take pictures, but it is still something you have to see while in Rome. We went with a guided tour and were given over 20 minutes to spend in there. I did not feel",
          "It was so busy that we could not stop to look as it was full in the middle so there was only the walk way which you can't stop in.",
          "It was beautiful! It was jammed with people, and despite repeated announcements to NOT TAKE PHOTOS people were taking them anyway! Very disrespectful. It wasn't as large as i expected either.",
          "It's part of the Vatican museums This means you are following a prearranged route at which this at the end Its mighty impressive Frescos amazing Shame you can't cut out the middle man",
          "Beautiful to see but be prepared to walk long distances and if it is hot and humid, you will be sweating. We purchased our tickets from one of the skip the line places close to the Vatican. If you know when you plan on going, buy your tickets in advance. You will save money.",
          "The famous frescos if Michelangelo can be found there. Best to combine with the Basilica and Vatican tours. If you take a private tour the with guide you through rooms that are closed off to the public. We were able to go through the closed gate with our guide and see some Roos",
          "No denying the beauty of the art. Be sure to pay for the early entry \"private\" tour. The private tour meant we were in the chapel with only about 300 people. We went back after the general opening and in the chapel there must have been 1-2 thousand others! In the other parts of",
          "If you visit the Vatican Museums you\u2019ll soon come across the Sistine Chapel. It\u2019s an amazing place to visit however it is ruined by the way it is organised. This small room is overcrowded, the seats at the side are constantly occupied. No matter where you stand you are being",
          "Get there very early and you might get a decent experience. This was my worst experience in a queue. A lot of people trying to force on you the skip-the-line tickets. A lot of people think that cuts the queue times but the real frustration is the mini queues inside, you cant",
          "I actually recommend skipping the entire Vatican experience but, if you really want to go, go straight to Saint Peter's. The Sistine Chapel is crowded, noisy, and small. The noise and crowds diminishes the experience of seeing the beautiful ceiling. The guards also herd you like",
          "It's hard to really describe what you are seeing in the SC. The weight of histpry hangs heavy and the art is so priceless and famous that it's hard to believe that you are looking at the actual real paintings that youve seen so many times before. We are not religious and it was",
          "We joined a local tour to the Vatican museum and Sistine chapel with 2 kids. After a long battle through the crowd in the museum we finally reached the chapel. What I saw was sea of tourists that filled up the whole room. They were sitting and standing everywhere while the",

          "Try and go first thing in the morning by skipping the museums which you can go back to. The Sistine Chapel gets very busy. Make sure you follow the strict dress code.",
          "We visited with Pristine Sistine tour at 7 am. Less crowded at that hour. Guide was excellent. Many interesting stories and amazing history. It was an amazing moment when a priest came in to share a prayer with us in the presence of such treasured devotional art. An",
          "The Sistine Chapel is so incredibly impressive with the beautiful scenes depicted on its walls and ceilings!",
          "While the ceiling gets the most attention, the alterpiece is equally stunning. In its entirety it is magnificent",
          "Buy a ticket ahead of time and reserve your time slot. No waiting in line today. We combined the Sistine Chapel with the museum tour (maybe everyone does this) and loved it. Yes it can get crowded in there, but we didn\u2019t mind it. You can always find space or areas where there",

They also sometimes offer Catholic Confession to visitors and emphasize silence, which I found interesting but appropriate since it's still a religious space.",
          "Words can't do justice to this space. The sheer scale and magnificence of the artwork made me speechless. I do like the fact that photography isn't allowed inside. One tip, do try to go straight there as soon as the gates open, as it will be less crowded.",

Remember most of these places date so far back in time and they are all some how preserved so well it makes one wonder how much more the world and different countries have to offer",
          "Beautiful, but not as beautiful as other museums that I've seen. I'm not Catholic, so that probably explains a certain lack of enthusiasm. I enjoyed the guided tour, hearing the history and so forth. Most people are only aware of the most \u2026",
          "Great history, beautiful place. I recommend taking the trip to the top of the Chapel, the view is amazing and you can take really great pictures there.",
          "I would rate this chapel and its artwork way above those in louvre museum in Paris. Its a pity we are not allowed to take pictures inside the main chamber of the church. The fresco art work is really exceptional.  I imagine the place looks way more beautiful in the evening with the lit candles. \nDefinitely worth a visit.",
          "Good place for some history lessons. Entry is free on last Sunday of each month. But expect a long queue. Not worth the effort if you dont have time but if you do, I will recommend it. Must visit if you are into museums.",
          "do you need me to tell you? it\u2019s beautiful",
          "I was stunned when I enter the chapel, it was a huge chapel fulfilled with all the masterpieces. Rich history, incredible  artworks, and absolutely amazing experience to have in a life time. \nWe joined a tour and the guide explained to us \u2026",
          "At least once in your life time it is worth to visit it. Fantastic effort and and difficult technic of Michelangelo. Be sure to find a guide to explain you what you will see inside before you enter or at least document yourself or will not understand to much. Be prepared for crowd and still quiet people. Sad, no photo inside.",
          "A must see sight in Rome.  We took the self tour and enjoyed taking our time before and after the Chapel.  I like that we were not overwhelmed by a massive store at the end of our time.  The biggest bother was mostly many other tourists who \u2026",
          "Absolute masterpiece. Not allowed to take pictures though and speaking discouraged. A must see if in Rome.",
          "Amazing place! Highly recommended. Crowded but controlled and worth the wait and expense. Ideally bring small binoculars or opera glasses.",
          "Beautiful chapel make sure and buy entrance tickets on line and walk straight in avoiding very long ques. Great day out all very interesting.",
          "While the Sistine chapel, was beautiful, the number of people that were being shoved into this room was boarder lined dangerous for fire and killed the atmosphere and made it hard to appreciate the art. \n\nThe day we went the pope had a \u2026",
          "The art is very touching. Our tour guide explained its history and about the artist",
          "The roof and walls were amazing, but unless you can get in here on a tour outside of normal operating hours, this is probably worth skipping. The line was brutal, you were basically shuffled along with no chance to stop, breathe, or think, \u2026",
          "If you\u2019re in Rome you have to see this. Book a tour guide with first in the morning access. I toured this morning and counted less than 25 people inside the chapel at one point.",
          "The architecture was amazing. An eye popping experience who isnt see there before. A must see place for anyone whether you are interested art history or not.",
          "5* for the chapel itself, 2* for the the experience. The organized groups are causing chaos here, much worse than in any other spot of the Vatican. I think there are just too many people allowed in for the given space. There is no obvious solution (if there is any).",
          "People are saying this place is overcrowded... it is but that's kinda the point.  I really enjoyed my time here and was dumbstruck by how amazing it was.  43/43",
          "Spectacular! No photos allowed, it's a holy place. Make sure you book an early morning entrance with a small private group or the crowds can be overwhelming! Worth every dollar..",
          "Definitely worth a visit, but a good personal guide is recommended! So much to say, so many underlying stories to know about",
          "It is obviously something to behold. The entire Vatican Museum is better with an audio guide. Worth the money and probably much better than a guided tour for those who like to explore by themselves. Bank on 7 hours for everything",
          "BEAUTIFUL. Once in a lifetime opportunity. Don't miss. Ladies - remember to dress modestly to get in.",
          "If you haven't pre-booked tickets, there is another queue you can stand in to get tickets. It does move slower, but I stood less than an hour to get in, this off-peak in October. If time is not an issue, I suggest *not* spending exorbitant \u2026",
          "I loves the guided tour! We were like 5 people and the guide was a really nice and funny lady! She knows English very well tho! \u2764\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f Best",
          "Nice part of the Vatican to visit. I recommend going to see this earlier in the day when the room is less busy and quieter. Take your time in there as well as once you leave you can't get back in.",
          "No words can be to describe this word of art and what a holly place it is, I have the blessing to received a special pray in this holly place.\nPlease be quiet, they do not let you take pictures or filming, and they do not let stay a long period of time.",
          "If you've only read about this, put it on your list of things to do in life.  Amazing painting and history.  No photos allowed, but there is a nice little gift shop at the end of the tour to collect those memories.",
          "Very very old church and you can see Chapel art ,cupola. At least spend 5-6 hours to get everything information of Sistine chapel art and his ambitious things. There you can see city map with micro work on each place and color shading. Must \u2026",
          "Wow, the Sistine Chapel is beautiful!  It was an amazing thing to see!  We were one of the first tour groups inside, so we got to take our time looking at all of the paintings inside!  No photography was allowed inside, so I don\u2019t have any pictures to post.",
          "We couldn't take photos or make noise in the chapel. However it's amazing to go in their. We thought that there was a direct entrance to the chapel, but it's like a maze and you have to go thought maost of the vatican museums. I think it's worth and it's well organized!",
          "In Vatican city this museum inside museum is one of main attractions, a place not to be missed; rare collection or arts, paintings, statues, wall and ceiling arts are few to highlight. In times it can be over crowded, should carry planty of water at all times.",
          "This is a must for tourists visiting Rome.\nUnbelievable experience. \nThe Chapel is breathtaking beautiful",
          "Unfortunately, no one was allowed to take pictures or video record within this chapel.  It has all the paintings done by Michelangelo, including the ceiling telling all the Bible stories.  Some people tried to secretly record but were \u2026",
          "One of the most Beautiful Places I've Ever Seen and been to! It was a Blessing to be there and a place I'll never forget",
          "Amazing work of art, truly breathtaking. It truly blew me away. The level of genius needed to make the chapel in that time is unbelievable. Every painting has its story and every painting is filled with details that make them look like \u2026",
          "Amazing chapel, though too many people inside and the temperature was quite hot",
          "It has to be seen to believe that it actually exists. Michelangelo's masterpiece, a fine example of human ability and genius.",
          "Not much left to say about this absolute masterpiece of all times! You should watch it with your own eyes (mind you, there\u2019s tons of people doing the same thing with you). Pictures are not allowed so don\u2019t expect to do some, but be in awe \u2026",
          "Brilliant. Must see while in Rome. If you not taking a guided tour going later in the afternoon around 12p when the crowds die down would be a better option.",
          "Loved the art and the experience. Not excited about the crowd. Would love to pay the extra for a private tour.",
          "What a fantastic place. It was part of our bucket list and once you enter the room nothing compares to the picture you have seen. If the museum has lot of people the staff will ask you to move to other rooms. If you plan to visit it don't \u2026",
          "It's cool that the drawing above is about Genesis. However please note that it is very cramp in the chapel. Do not take pictures in the chapel.",
          "Beautiful. Must visit",
          "Long line to go in but so worth it. Last Sunday of the month is free entrance. Line moves pretty fast, but I\u2019d recommend getting there around 7:30 am.",
          "Can't describe my feelings inside the very long museum of priceless art pieces, more so once inside the Sistine chapel and seeing the famous art painting on the ceiling...",
          "2nd time visiting here as we always said we would come back to Rome when we had children as it is a fascinating place. We had the guided audio tour for the kids which was interactive and a bit of a treasure hunt which kept them busy and \u2026",
          "Beautiful art, architecture and sculptures. Must see if you find yourself in Rome. Beware bring water you will be herded through for hours with no escape. There is very little ventilation. The only thing that makes it bearable is it's \u2026",
          "Absolutely beautiful and breathtaking. Definitely visit if able. Can be a long wait. Worth the cost of the skip the line ticket. No photos allowed in the chapel, unless you're sneaky.",
          "Beautiful but very very crowded.  To be fair almost anytime is going to be super busy, but if you get skip the line tickets for the Vatican museum for a few euros more you can go in 30mins before it officially opens, go there first to get a chance to avoid the crush.  It's amazing!",
          "One of the single places on earth with the biggest concentration of artworks. Not only Michelangelo, but all the most important Renaissance painters left their mark in this chapel. The crowd in there is unbelievable, because of the tourists who take pictures (which is forbidden) rather than silently admiring.",
          "Nice pilgrimage for the scholars. We prayed for about 8 hours. Nice place for church gurus. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",
          "Overwhelming. Beautiful. Pictures aren't allowed, but they don't capture the beauty of it well anyway. Only gripes are with crowd control. It's too crowded and not organized.",
          "Lovely chapel and obviously a must see for tourists. That said, the Basilica in my opinion was even better, and far less strict on the time and manner to which you could view it. The constant shouting of 'move along' and 'no photo' \u2026",
          "Amazing, beautiful but very confining. Small area with a lot of people and very little air flow.",
          "Breathtaking! The art, the history, the emotions it brings out...this is definitely not the last time I will visit",
          "Gorgeous. Truly the pinnacle of western art. Michelangelo's genius is unparalleled. A must see. 4 stars only because of the crowds and the fact that you aren't allowed to take photos.",
          "Absolutely beautiful place. Remember no photos or video to be taken in the Chapel",
          "No pictures allowed but the tour guide explained it well. It is truly breathtaking with all the artwork on every surface. It is very, very crowded inside though. You won't want to spend too much time inside because of it.",
          "One of the most beautiful chapels I have ever seen. Photos are not allowed so take your time to appreciate the artwork all over. Not to be missed if in Rome.",
          "Very interesting and beautiful building to visit!!! Would definitely recommend to tourists.",
          "Beautiful paintings on all the walls and ceilings. They are very strict on not allowing photographs. Well worth a visit.",
          "Was very crowded, even if it was low tourist  season. But really worth a visit.\nParents with kids have priority line and no queuing needed.",
          "The chapel is not as big as one would expect but it is impressive. It is packed though making it uncomfortable and hot. Seems to get forgotten that this is a chapel with all the bustle and chatter! Remember there is a strict dress code and no photography in the chapel.",
          "Something really worth seeing at least once in a lifetime.",
          "Unbelievably detailed frescoes that unfurl across the ceiling and walls in a careful tapestry, telling the story of the Mankind across the ages.",
          "Art appreciation and all the work behind it is impressive when you consider the era this was made in",
          "It was amazing to visit Vatican and especially Sistine Chapel. Truly breathtaking. A must see for anyone visiting Rome.",
          "Although a VERY NICE place and lots of things to see... The whole experience is unfortunately completely ruined by the crowd. It's not possible to enjoy the place because of the quantity of people inside.",
          "Breath taking arts and architecture, historic",
          "It was absolutely beautiful. To be honest when I entered I thought I would be underwhelmed but when I entered the chapel it did take me back a moment",
          "The place is packed with people, they will tell you not to make noise and photo. But with a selfie stick, I took a bunch of photos without the guards noticing. The place is wonderful! Michelangelo\u2019s painting is vividly displayed through the \u2026",
          "Seeing the paintings of God and Adam and Eve was very interesting, and a bit moving.  It's such a huge ceiling of paintings within a very big room. We stood there for about 20 minutes admiring the works of Michelangelo.The Sistine Chapel is \u2026",
          "Wow the art and history here is incredible. If you have never been make a plan. Forget about religion just come and experience the grandeur that is and was Rome. Yes the Vatican is it's own state and police etc.... But the riches of the past are so evident.",
          "Excellent paintings but a bit disappointed by the venue itself. Expected something more than a rectangular room.",
          "While the artwork is fabulous, the overall experience of being in the Chapel isn't enjoyable due to the number of people there with you. It doesn't help that the people management system means you can't go backwards, and so you are funneled \u2026",
          "The greatest place in my life, unreal proportions, colors, ideas! The pride of all mankind",
          "We paid a large sum of money to see before the museum opened so only 10 of us but able to take our time and pictures as we learned the stories of the work of Michelangelo in the Sistine chapel. Truly incredible!",
          "Very crowded and stuffy. However, the paintings are stunning. Remember to be quiet, have your arms and legs covered and no hats. Photos are not permitted.",
          "Interesting but so very crowded. It was wonderful 20 years ago, wouldn't go there again. Once is enough.",
          "Very serene and beautiful space. \nStaff could be more friendly, but they probably get tired of all the hustle of tourism to the point of indifference.",
          "Amazing artistry, and all together great experience would definitely recommend!",
          "Lovely place, a must when coming to Vatican City",
          "The place is really beautiful and there is a lot to explore. The price is affordable. BUT the employes are kind of rude. \n*Note: DO NOT PAY for the queue or any plan street vendors offer. BETTER  do the queue by your own (15-25 mins). Much more cheaper.",
          "Nothing to comment on this. If you are in Vatican you have to go to Vatican museum and Sistine chapel. There is obviously a very long queue for this, especially with the groups. I would suggest to book your ticket online before you visit. \u2026",
          "Unbelievably amazing historical work by legendary artists, enjoyed every bit of it !!!",
          "Wow!!!! It's quite violent that they repeat over and over, \"SILENCE!! NO PICTURES!! \" but maybe necessary, It might be better just to say \"We remind you that you are not allowed to take pictures, please cooperate, thank you\" and people will do it.",
          "Pretty incredible and a must see. You should definitely go via an organised tour as early in the morning as possible to avoid the crowds. We met our guide at 7.10am.",
          "Extraordinary paints from centuries ago. Too much too see.",
          "Never seen anything like this. W.O.W.\nPriceless",
          "The most beautiful building and art. An absolutely must see if you're in Rome.",
          "The scale of this place is amazing. We'll worth a visit if you don't mind queues. It's best to go in the evening as not so many people then & alot cooler.",
          "Truly awe inspiring. Get a guide with a scheduled time to go through super crowded even I'm the off season.",
          "Wonderful even better than the rest of the museum",
          "Its beautiful - one most go once in lifetime to see the artwork done by Michelangelo",
          "It\u2019s quite a lengthy walk through the Vatican museum to get to the Sistine Chapel, but once you are there it\u2019s well worth the walk as you look up to gaze at the beautiful artwork.",
          "Excellent place. You have to visit when you come to the Rome.",
          "Beautiful, historic and awesome to be able to see it.",
          "You have to go there - see with your own eyes. Amazing:) respect this place: dress code, no photos, silence!",
          "The way you are herded around like cattle is not fun but the Sistine chapel makes up for all these indignities.They don\u2019t allow photography of the ceiling. The paintings and technique are amazing.",
          "Rafael 's chambers are more beautiful from my point of view.",
          "I am sorry to say that neither the wait nor the money was worth it.  Having been there I see that the online virtual visit is equally satisfying.  Not recommended.",
          "Better than in films. Once in a lifetime experience.",
          "Must watch art in the world...where we see the eternal bliss in advance",
          "Have to see if you ever go to Rome. Best way is get the early bird tickets so you can avoid the sea of people and enjoy the art in small groups.",
          "I have visited Rome three times in four years, and each time this site absolutely blows me away.  Photographs are not allowed as it is an active religious site, so the enclosed is a stock image from the Vatican website.  The enclosed image \u2026",
          "Beautiful artwork but you'll get little time to actually appreciate it. The security basically push you through the place and get you out. They need to limit the number of people in the chapel but the Catholic church obviously can't say no to the money.",
          "Bel\u00edssima! Amazing, unfortunately pictures  are not allowed inside  the chapel.",
          "Ok we all know the Vatican and its popularity but this place has a lot to offer from places to meditated to places to view lots of art like oleos, murals sculptures and all kind of amazing pieces that the only way to appreciate is to be there, specially pieces that where created in the 16th century from the masters of the renaissance",
          "No words to describe a absolute wonderful place",
          "Words cannot describes how beautiful this place is! The painting on the ceiling and the details to every single stroke is AMAZING!\n\nThe line is long, but worth the wait and the \u20ac12 entrance fee. We didn\u2019t get the audio tour and I wish we did.",
          "Art: Beautiful (5 stars)\nOrganization: (3 stars)",

Thanks for all PAPAS  who did so much to  gather and to save evrth for the future generation! Low bow to evrbd who did this... THANKS A LOT..... I AM SO HAPPY...",
          "The chapel is huge! I payed 35 euro for a ticket and walked around without a guide. History dating back past 500 BC is there. If you come to Rome and enjoy history it is a must see.",
          "Why so many photos on this website when it is written big and clear that photographing is forbidden there?Sistine Chapel is the jewel of the Museums, and as a church they invite you to be silent but they do it SHOUTING....what a folly. Plus \u2026",
          "Brilliant experience although it was extremely busy. It is a must see if in Rome. We managed to get que jump tickets from trip advisor for about 25% more which was well worth it as the kids could not have stood outside in the heat!",
          "This is the type of place hard to express in words. So many dazzling masterpieces... It's really amazing what Michelangelo have done there.",
          "So many masterpieces that its impossible to capture all the details in a single visit.\nWe opted for a guided tour to get as much information and guide our eyes to see the intricate designs, progression in technique and the variances in style.\n\nNo photos allowed but I'm sure you can easily find plenty.",
          "Was full of great artwork.  Sistine chapel was amazing.  My only complaints were the guided groups.  They would take the halls in the chapel, when individuals walked, they would stop at doorways causing a lot jam.  The walls were warm if \u2026",
          "One of the most amazing chapels ever awe inspired",
          "I felt very emotional looking at Michelangelo's beautiful paintings...",
          "Very beautiful place, unfortunately pictures are not allowed",
          "Beautiful, stunning paintings and frescos. Some areas of the museum will take your breath away and the Chapel itself is as inspiring. Book ahead to beat the queues.",
          "Paintings are incredible. I'm glad we had a guide who explained it before we went in. A little disappointed in the chapel itself.",
          "I stepped in from the museum tour and was left in awe. The detail of the artwork is amazing. \nSad to see and hear so many people breaking the rules by taking pictures and chatting amongst themselves. The staff there do everything they can to keep on top of the situation.\nEven so it can only be recommended, it just feels special.",
          "One of the most amazing places in the world. So much history to explore. Worth the visit without a doubt. You dont need a ticket to visit. Just get in the Q - and dont trust these so called 'skip the line ' crew.",
          "Avoid this place like the plague. It\u2019s become a tourist trap that\u2019s disgustingly packed (and I did not go during peak season). TIMES SQUARE DURING NEW YEARS EVER HAS BETTER CROWD CONTROL THAN THIS PLACE.",
          "It was amazing. Pure history. I never see something like that.",
          "Good points:\nLeft in awe\nEasy to find\nEveryone speaks English\nPerfect for history lovers\n\nBad points:\nCan seem expensive\nCrowds! Crowds! Crowds!\nAvoid summer at all costs for more crowds\nThe local street sellers are a pain in the backside! \u2026",
          "Breathtaking. the photos online do not do it justice.",
          "Amazing and heavenly. God knows I'm still dreaming. My 10yr old daughter is still talking about it.",
          "It's an amazing place, but I wish they planned the experience better. You're basically herded into a room where you can stand with a giant crowd in the middle staring up or walk out along the edge. There's no AC so it is very hot from the \u2026",
          "Michelangelo's work will have you mesmerised! So glad we had a guide to impart information to us about the numerous works of art.",
          "A wonder of the world! A must see...so long as you get a seat on the perimeter. It's a shame it's so popular, theres so many people it's hard to get enough space and time to soak in the ceiling views",
          "This was one of the most emotion compelling experiences I have ever had. Don't go to Roma and miss this. No pics -- they're not allowed!!!",
          "Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk. Lots to see.",
          "Very interesting place. Extremely beautiful highly recommend visiting if you have the chance. It is incredible sight.",
          "Simply amazing. Must go. If you can it's better to visit this amazing place in the evening.",
          "Of course it is quite impressive and incredible how it was painted by Michelangelo but there is absolutely no chance to move in there. It is way too stuffed, the Vatikan has become a touristic attraction and not what it used to be (not that I remember).",
          "My wife and I had our marriage blessed by a priest in the chapel. Was crowded but worth the experience. Beautiful place",
          "Historical bundling in Rome, well maintained.",
          "Although we were warned about wearing exposing clothes, they didn't appear bothered when we actually arrived. Lovely place to visit and a must when visiting Rome, but beaware that it is silly busy and don't expect to be able to read the numerous sign posts around.",
          "Do the whole Vatican tour. Its breathtaking and a little scary. Sistine Chapel is such an experience when there is very few folks around. You can sit and just stare until the crowds come in.",
          "Slightly underwhelming unless you're a fan of Michaelangelo. Very crowded as can be expected. The surrounding Vatican Museum and grounds are beautiful but expect crowds all year round.",
          "Rome is amazing so much beauty and history",
          "One of the Most beautiful pieces of art. One can stand there and observe it for hours yet find some new detail every time",
          "Would have been a 5-star visit, but we didn\u2019t see any Popes.",
          "Impressive, but be prepared to queue & walk slowly!",
          "To start, I am not Catholic, nor am I Italian. But I have never entered a place that felt so mesmerizing and electric as this. It is highly suggested you go on an early morning paid tour. This will grant you access with a small group for \u2026",
          "Don't go with super high expectations, we loved the creation of Adam by Michelangelo. Browse through a bit of history to find it even more interesting.",
          "Went on a happy hour tour (Later in the afternoon/evening) and highly recommend. Even though some of the Vatican museum isn\u2019t open.....the crowds are much more manageable than during the day so the chance to really take everything in is much greater",
          "I love the history of Michaelangelo and am fascinated by his life. I was saddened in the sistine Chapel by the bullying nature of the guards there. They shouted 'SILENCE' several times which made no sense when people were quietly whispering \u2026",
          "What can you say. One of the very great historical sites in the world. Ee did the early morning tour and it is well worth the extra expense to see this attraction",
          "The beauty of the ceiling is breathtaking. Very crowded though but you can stand and admire the ceiling.",
          "The chapel is magnificent and totally worth the queue to get in.",
          "Creation of Adam is so small!!! But so beautiful.",
          "Definitely the must visit place in Vatican. It is just beautiful",
          "Gorgeous artwork, packed but expected.",
          "Breathtaking and gorgeous. The paintings are so so beautiful, unfortunately, pictures aren't allowed in there. The chapel features several Michel Angelo's work. It's advisable to take a guided tour so as to have background information about \u2026",
          "Of the many historical places I have visited on this amazing tour of France and italy, the Sistine Chapel was pretty disappointing. It was far too crowded, hot, and honestly looking a paintings so high up rather that at normal level makes \u2026",
          "The Sistine Chapel is amazing. Many people trying to take pictures, and the guards are vigilant. Highly recommend the tours for skip the line access.",
          "This is a great place to visit, if you don't like being around a crowd of people tightly squeezed in the chapel, with very little room, this might not be acceptable for some folks",
          "An amazing experience, had a fantastic guide,marco,",
          "A beautiful tourist attraction to witness in the Vatican city church...",
          "Absolutely mesmerized by the Sistine chapel. It's hard to believe how old the paintings are as they look so beautiful. Unfortunately you're not allowed to take pictures in there out of respect but if anything that rule helps you really take \u2026",
          "The Sainte-Chapelle or \"Holy Chapel\", in the courtyard of the royal palace on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 (now part of a later administrative complex known as La Conciergerie), was built to house Louis IX's collection of relics of Christ, which \u2026",
          "Must see location in Vatican City. Incredible!",
          "Better than I expected.",
          "Sistine Chapel is the most beautiful place in the Vatican Museum",
          "Words can not do it justice.  Once in a lifetime experience.",
          "Amazing but you will get what's called the Vatican neck .",
          "I  personally was rather disappointed.  I  didn't  realised the place was so small. We were parked like cattle in the middle. The guards kept pushing us. There are so many paintings on the ceiling and on the walls that it is difficult to \u2026",
          "The chapel is simply beautiful due to the amazing artwork which is in 3D.",
          "A beautiful place to be sure, but very crowded and hot.  No place to sit to appreciate the ceiling - the few benches against the wall were full.  Standing room only.",
          "Incredible !!! If you leave the chapel by the exit at the right you go directly to San Peter Catedral",
          "Beautiful.\n\nVery busy but shouldn't have come in the middle of August I suppose. Would suggest coming in autumn or maybe spring. \n\nSet out enough time to see everything. There is a lot.",
          "If there was one and only to visit the Vatican Museum, the Sistine Chapel IS the main reason.\nYou'll be speechless by one of Michelangelo masterpiece. The room is split into two but you'll have plenty time to admire the paintings. Stand in the center of each room and take the time to scan the whole room!",
          "We had one day in Rome and decided to spend the entire day at the Vatican Museums. We came with our suitcases and left them in the secured area and took our time going through the museums before finally finishing our visit at the chapel. We \u2026",
          "Simply amazing!\nI was able to get this quick photo before security saw me. I'm so happy I took the photo.",
          "Croweded dark  , can improve on soft lightingvand ventilation",
          "Wow..just breathtaking. Visiting the Sistine Chapel was amazing. I suggest you go on one of those tours. We found out it was better since you get to go in all the places and don't miss anything as well as you get all the information. Some \u2026",
          "Breathtaking...worth getting the audio guide to follow the art work",
          "I was so fortunate to visit the Sistine Chapel while visiting Rome. The Sistine Chapel is honestly a bit hard to access because you would have to walk through most of the museum and everyone funnels into the chapel. Due to its popularity, it was really stuffy just trying to get into the chapel.",
          "Definitely worth the long wait and walking for two hours through most of the museum. The art is amazing, without thinking about religion, just contemplating the concept of the different passages of creation and final judgement are pretty amazing. Make sure to reserve online.",
          "Amazing to see, but part of the money making machine",
          "Is there ever a time this place isn't jammed packed? I would highly recommend paying for an early entry tour. You can get in an hour ahead of the public which will save you a lot of hassle, but the crowd will catch up to you eventually...",
          "Really beautiful but please don't ruin your experience trying to take a picture which is against the rule and it doesn't really make sense in a place like this. Just enjoy it.",
          "Must see place when in rome. There are no pictures that can be taken in the chapel because they have strict rules but they let you stay ss long as youd like.",
          "Astounding art in such a concentrated space it is impossible to take it all in in the limited time allocated.",
          "What an aura! Just amazing. To be in the presence of all the works of the great painters you read about in school. Just breathtaking!",
          "Beautiful chapel with colorful paintings on walls and high ceilings. Huge domes with artistic carvings. Most of the paintings are made by Michel angelo depicting the important events in the life of Jesus christ and christianity. You are \u2026",
          "Crowd or no crowd, I was speechless, and I talk a lot! \n\nHonestly incredible.",
          "Absolutely stunning....must visit....do not miss going to the Vatican. Crowded with tourists... Do take the skip the line tickets... otherwise the queues are long and endless.",
          "Fabulous, magnificent, humbling, inspiring. A must see in Rome. Unfortunately, we went in summer (July 2019) when there were masses of people going through. Despite constant announcements to the contrary,  people continued to take \u2026",
          "The most Amazing place I have ever been! Truly amazing.x",
          "Beautiful, big and full of people on weekends",
          "Wait can I say that wasn't said already. Go, enjoy and have plenty of time to see as much as you can. Well worth getting a private guide.",
          "It feels bizarre rating the Sistine Chapel on Google maps, I mean, if you are relying on a Google Map review to decide whether or not to visit the freaking Sistine Chapel, well then I can't help you. Yea it's awesome, make sure you take a \u2026",
          "Absolutely amazing. No photos allowed though, but that's ok.",
          "Too crowded, one of a kind paintings",
          "Exit to Basilica only for the better human beeings: Groups. Ordinary visitors have to wait two more hours at St. Peters square.",
          "I'm not really sure what to say as it is one of the places you just have to see. The art works though are quite high on the walls and ceiling. Huge crowd makes it difficult to admire.",
          "What can u say! It's very hot. Bring a fan!!!!  Such great works of art. Hard to see in just one day!!  Suggest going later. Seems crowds will be lighter!",
          "Everyone must see it with your own eyes. Despite it is prohibited to take pictures and videos,  I managed to take many pictures and videos :)",
          "Remarkable Michaelangelo paintings\nWorth walking the entire Vatican museums to get there",
          "you go with an open mind. Of course it is busy and crowded but what do you expect from a tourist must. Highly recommended alot of history and outstanding art. A place which if not for history would be nothing.",
          "The Sistine Chapel is located inside the Vatican Museum, you'll need to purchase tickets to access this site in Vatican City. Absolutely stunning views of Michelangelo's commissioned piece, no photography allowed in this dim lit room. It \u2026",
          "Wonderful!!!! If you go to visit the chapel, pls respect the place, no photos and videos are allowed and be silent.",
          "Review of Vatican Museums as well as Sistine chapel as all on same ticket and same place. Absolutely lovely to see. Amazing artwork. Lots of different exhibitions of artefacts, art and an Amazonian display. . Route was not very obviously \u2026",
          "Amazing!! Perfect.... was my second visit in this place and I feel blessed for this.",
          "A lot more to see than the chapel itself. Worth a visit, but the chapel itself is always packed out and you cannot take photos.",
          "We did a night visit. Advantage is that it was probably slightly less crowded. The disadvantage was that some rooms were closed and we could not see the gardens. The Sistine Chapel itself is stunning",
          "Must see. Beautiful masterpice",
          "The most beautiful frescos and art work. I have ever seen. Get the 'skip the line' ticket. Its more but well worth the extra.",
          "One of the amazing historical site in Rome! Even in Italy! They do not allow us to take photos inside of the chapel, it\u2019s a shame, because the painting is stunning and UNREAL! \nOne important tip: Do not talk or response to any of the \u201cstaff \u2026",
          "One of my favourite places at the Vatican... Visited the chapel as part of a tour... Love the story behind it",
          "Chapel is divine and holy.",
          "Peaceful and magnificent, do visit if you get the chance.",
          "Amazing art. So many people it was impossible to enjoy the paintings. Too small exits considering the amount of people they let in.",
          "BEAUTIFUL, BUT I AM AFRAID THET DO NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION \u201cMAXIMUM CAPACITY, I COULD BARELY BREATH IN THERE!!",
          "Richest Religious article and most valuable Painting you can see here",
          "Breathtaking... beautiful. So much to see and never enough time",
          "Amazing frescos and art.",
          "Brought me to tears despite the huge crowds. It's a must-see in Rome. You are required to go through the entire Vatican museum before seeing the Sistine Chapel. It is extremely crowded. The entrance is a tiny crowded hallway that takes about 20 minutes to walk through.",
          "Another landmark of Rome. (Actually Vatican City) Many frescos on the walls and the most famous on the ceiling is Creation of Adam by Michelangelo. No photos allowed. You will have to look at the stock photos to see what's in the chapel or just go in it yourself like I did.",
          "Too beautiful for words. Would see it again and again",
          "An incredible museum with such incredible history. Just be prepared for the incredible crowds of people.",
          "Wish everyone had to be quiet...",
          "Incredible artwork that one must see in their lifetime. My breath was taken away, either by the art, or my claustrophobia. We need a new plague. Definitely recommend.",
          "Amazing stuff...no more to say",
          "I was a little underwhelmed but glad we saw it. \nJust was not what I expected. The whole of the Vatican that you see is has beautifully painted ceilings and this was the same.",
          "Buy the que  jump ticket, well worth it!",
          "The only tip is to buy your tickets online. Skips the main queue which can be 2 hours long.",
          "Amazing with great art. Crowded and strictly controlled. They also don't allow photographing even tho everyone managed to photograph.",
          "Truly mpressed by what i got to see there.",
          "We booked our tour through the Vatican Museum.  Maria, our guide was effervescent and extremely knowledgeable of art.  It was a great idea to have a tour guide for many reasons. Not only did we not have to wait in loooooong lines to see the \u2026",
          "Breath taking beauty but you are not allowed to take pictures because it affects the art.",
          "Unbelievable! Everything it was described as and more. Still in awe over the beauty",
          "My expectations were higher, tbh i dont know if the museum ticket its worth the price",
          "Organization are able to contain the impact of an huge amount of tourist.. very compliments",
          "Beautiful chapel, but overly crowded! Security staff is pressing everyone into the room, like cows. You have to pay attention when you get in your ligne or you will be carried away of the room by the crowd without knowing it! The crowd and \u2026",
          "This place is amazing, it's too bad they literally rush you in and through it before you even realize where you are... We were being pushed and yelled at to keep going until we finally just turned around and went into a corner to try to take it all in. Just sooo many people..",
          "Absolutly stunning. The famous picture of god and man almost touching fingers finds itself on the ceiling here. It is truly a sight to see this work of art.",
          "Must see place. Everyone should visit ones in life. Litle disapointed with the size of michelangelos painting... expected, it would be much bigger...but place is mystic. \u2606",
          "Absolutely stunning.  It took quite a bit to get to this point in the huge Vatican Museum with the thousands of people that were there.  But worth every minute of slow lines through the museum!",
          "Amazing room but totally over crowded",
          "Spectacular. An absolutely beautiful place. Despite us going in off season, it was completely packed so be prepared to be shoe horned in. But that hardly takes away from the beauty. It's a must see for any lover of art and history.",
          "Chapel and apartments are truly magnificent. Only downside is the huge volume of crowds all jockeying for photos and views. Sound system on the tours is wanting. Prices for pretty much everything are very reasonable though the tours themselves can vary considerably.",
          "Way too crowded. No control from employees. Don't undertand why we buy tickets for specific times yet they are still overcrowded...WILL NOT RETURN",
          "Absolutely beautiful! Be prepared for a long day in the Vatican museum before you get to this point. It is well worth it though. All the art is fantastic. Also, be respectful. No photos are allowed in here and they ask you to be quiet.",
          "Entry fee for museum (Vatican Museum & Sistine Chapel) is only 17 euro a person if you buy at the booth. If you get there at 8:30am, before the 9am opening time, there is basically no line.\n\nIt does not matter if you get there early or late, weekend or weekday, you will get blocked by large tour groups. Good luck and God speed.",
          "It is breath taking! A must must see. Words do not do it justice... We felt the holy spirit.",
          "Phenomenal! The Sistine chapel is quite large so expect at least a half an hour walk from start to finish if you're only there for the Angelo piece but if youre a curious person you could take up to 3 hours in there! Would definitely recommend!",
          "Breathtaking,  a must see.",
          "This place is really crowded, get the audio guide as it will explain how to understand the paintings, and how to actually interpret them",
          "Wonderful and contains creation of adam paint",
          "It's a very nice building, beautiful and all that but the experience was ruined by the amount of people they let inside. If you enjoy going through a museum in large crowds at all time then by all means you should come here.\n\nIf you decide \u2026",
          "Rushed through and herded like cattle.  Pay for the tickets on your own.  The tours can be substituted for the audio guide and you will be able to go at your own pace.  Very busy.  Please respect the museum rules and do not take photos where it is forbidden",
          "Beautiful place with lots of Roman history and architecture. Must visit place if visiting Roam.",
          "Loved it.....a must see for Catholic enthusiast!!",
          "Terribly overcrowded. No pictures allowed. Guards pretty much yell at people for absolutely everything. They should limit the amount of people and let them take a freaking photo! Experience not worthy.",
          "Wow! Amazing place! Worth the crowds to see Michelangelos work!",
          "Roll tide!  Listen up yanks.  This place IS all that people say and more.  You will actually need a wide angle lens or panoramic function to get it into one picture... and the pictures are worth the wait.",
          "Beautiful and breath taking place.",
          "It's amazing a must see,  pictures dont do it justice at all to see it in person is absolutely amazing",
          "Architecturally magnificent, you may want to spend the entire day roaming around Sistine Chapel",
          "Obviously a great place . No photos allowed. Very busy here. Incredible painting",
          "Take a guided tour. \n\nThe story behind the paintings and the unique elements would take a year to understand on your own. \n\nMake the time to visit the Vatican Museum as well as view the Sistine Chapel. \n\nThe Final Judgment ( the front wall) \u2026",
          "A fantastic place, but crowded, too. Guided tours highly recommended!",
          "Amazing, pictures don't do it justice. We recommend using Maya Tours. Christine was so knowledgable and by far the best guide we've had to date. Must see",
          "Amazing room to be in. The work of art, the history, the details, we were left speechless.",
          "Vatican city is a great day trip, exhausting and exhilarating. We got a wonderful guide called Gabriel from getyourguide highly recommend",
          "A special place. Pity it's so busy you can't stop to enjoy the atmosphere",
          "Amazing, awe inspiring art, but security hates phones & cameras. Hope visitors are careful not to have their electronics confiscated (or just take sneaky pictures).",
          "The Sistine Chapel was absolutely amazing! Very beautiful art covering the ceilings and walls, however it was very crowded even off season in mid-December. The room was overcrowded, with people standing in the middle and others sitting on \u2026",
          "Book online directly with the Vatican website and enjoy on Fridays nights a buffet meal and glass of wine or beer from 7-9 then entrance to the museum for only \u20ac38 much better value and less crowds.Only the Vatican museum however. But very worthwhile.",
          "Amazing...What a fabulous world of history, architecture, paintings you name it...famous art, work of art...loved walking around taking it all in...such history...take your time,look up...enjoy",
          "Magnificent painting, with lots of details in them. One can visit just for the painting, even though the Chapel is not that huge. However access to this place is not that wheelchair accessible.",
          "Nice to see, bit over rated.",
          "One of the most beautiful chapels featuring Michelangelo's detailed artwork on the ceiling. Best to go with a tour guide to understand what you can expect in the chapel beforehand as silence is expected in the chapel. \n\nSummer time is the \u2026",
          "Nice visit!! Lots of people!! No pics allowef",
          "It's what you'd expect. Marvelous? yes. Worth dealing with the crowds and paying \u20ac20 to walk though a large museum beforehand? That's up to you my dude.",
          "Absolutely beautiful inside however as it was so, SO busy we barely got to see anything. We weren't allowed to stop and look around, the security was herding everyone through pretty quickly. Unless you're very interested I wouldn't say it's worth the hassle. Although it's free as part of the museum ticket so you might as well!",
          "Simply breathtaking. They only disappointing things are the crowds and people being disrespectful by taking pictures, video, and talking.",
          "The Sistine chapel is very fun, If you like walking around and looking at art. Our tour guide Jose was very helpful and took the time to explain every question we had. The Sistine chapel is very big and beautiful, the only problem was the \u2026",
          "The works of art are amazing. All of the museums and rooms leading to the Sistine Chapel are also breath taking. Pro tips: take your time in the rooms, don\u2019t let the huge crowds heard you through the experience (plan for an entire day here \u2026",
          "A little on the crowded side but well worth it. This is an absolute must for anyone visiting Rome.",
          "Long winding walk down the stairs to visit this iconic  place ,all hearded  into the centre  too many people  in there  craning your neck  being pushed  by the annoying guides with there sticks  so got quite costaphobic  didnt see much at all.",
          "Regardless of your religion and beliefs, this is a must see on your bucket list. There is such a great feeling of old, charged with history and significance that just overwhelms you. The artistry of each and every part from statues to columns and paintings cannot be described ij words. That is why you must see",
          "Amazing fresco by Michelangelo, telling the story of Genesis through paintings. Unfortunately, you are not allowed to take pictures, however, I did manage to get some  sneakily. It's worth a try!",
          "Absolutely beautiful History & Art! Make sure that you wear comfortable walking shoes and you are able to go up and down steps with no problems. I took a lot of pictures! It was truly amazing!",
          "When we started our museum tour, I was wondering what the hype about the Sistine Chapel. The walk to the Chapel took about 4 hours. Because of the rush they kept increasing number of rooms for us to visit but the wait was definitely worth \u2026",
          "it is breathtaking ...what else is there to say",
          "A very beautiful artwork which is not done justice in books on or television. The massive scale makes it impossible for those Media to capture the experience .  I could only visit it by passing through the Vatican Art Museum which is also \u2026",
          "Amazing is all I can day, make sure if you do one art/historical thing in Rome you come here.",
          "Great place.Whith a lot of history.",
          "Amazing and has my name on it.",
          "Disgusting dissapointing experience! Don't mind if you have to book years in advance but the amount of people this museum let's in makes the whole experience one of the worst in my history of holidays and tourism! Rather have a nice pizza somewhere else!!",
          "This is in Vatican Museum, take a full day for this, go in the morning at 9:00 to avoid a big queue. And especially do not take the \"skip the line\", does not worth the money. The museum is huge, and be prepared the take a lot of history lesson in that day. Takes around 4 - 5 hours to see.",
          "This has to be one of the most impressive sights I\u2019ve ever seen. I visited when I wasn\u2019t a catholic a few years ago and it impressed me greatly. I visited yesterday as a Catholic and it truly is mind blowing the amount of dedication and \u2026",
          "Very nice & really beautiful chapel. A must see for all visitors",
          "You will be touched by Michaelangelo's work, breathtaking.",
          "The Michelle Angelo frescos are impressive, but the peace and enjoyment inside are amazing.  We had the opportunity to visit the Sistine Chapel with a guide as  part of the excursion that gave more information about the paints.  Photos and \u2026",
          "Much smaller than I pictured, a very sacred spiritual place. The painting is astounding. Just to imagine the hours and hours and hours spent on scaffolding to paint the ceiling, for our enjoyment, is overwhelming. It is a must-see When in \u2026",
          "It's really hyped up. It's beautiful and intimate but the volume of tourists really make it difficult to take it in unless you're among the first there in the day or a special evening arrangement.",
          "The waiting was long. The line was longer. People are overflowing the area. It was hot and the drinks are expensive.\n\nBut all of that was all erased by the sheer magnificence of the talent and genius encased within the fortress.",
          "Very crowded.  hard to admire with a tour way to fast but amazing",
          "Such a spiritual place to be even if you're not religious. Awe inspiring to be in the presence of Michelangelo's masterpiece.",
          "Beautiful building but gets way too crowded. Can't enjoy in properly",
          "Amazing works of art, wear comfy shoes, lots to see and admire",
          "Completely overawed by the ostentation here. Galleries that seem to go on for miles with amazing murals. The chapel itself was overcrowded and it was difficult to truly appreciate the artwork. I was more moved by a painting in the contemporary art gallery. The Embrace - Pope John Paul II embracing a polish Cardinal.",
          "One way in-out, very crowded. Only come here if u wish to appreciate full scale human traffic madness.",
          "Another example of man made beauty it has to be seen to be believed what Michelangelo has painted on the ceiling here it's a most amazing piece of human effort and precision even so many centuries ago the place gives you a serene sense of peace",
          "Worth the wait, crowds, queues etc. A lot to take in, in a short time, no pics, silence. A must see for art aficionado's. Museum is full to bursting with culture to see. Free each last Sunday of month.",
          "Crowded, but worth it. No pictures allowed, as i saw if they see you talking pictures they will force you to delete them.",
          "Stunning place. Extremely busy so patience is required. The staff remain very friendly despite some people clearly not following guidance.",
          "Just gorgeous. The hall to the chapel is tiny and very crowded, inside is no different. So many people in such a small space, but the art and the history behind it all is so worth it!! Ypu are not allowed to take pictures, but unfortunately some people were disrespectful enough to do so with their phones",
          "Magnificent but not worth the time spending inside to stare at ceiling for 1 minute and then takes 30 mins to get out.  So crammed and seems worst than flying on economy class.",
          "Beyond words unfortunately the Catholic Church does not allow photography of any kind . My tour group of a dozen people had a private tour in which we were allowed to stay inside the chapel for 15 minutes. Definitely bucket material.",
          "Just AMAZING!!! I would have loved for it to have actually looked like a chapel or a church, I think people would respect more and be silent had it looked like an actual chapel or church, asking for silence and circulation in such small \u2026",
          "Beautiful chapel with Michelangelo paintings.",
          "fantastic monument,must see in Rome",
          "Absolutely breathtaking, I can't add photo's because you are not allowed to take any. Well worth the cost of your ticket. But oh so many people!!!!",
          "No photography or video allows. And no talking too. Some photograph of the renaissance art pieces in poster size are on sale in the museum.",
          "Truly indescribable if only they could control the crowd somehow.",
          "Wonderful. \nGreat paintings that have to be seen.\nVery crowded.\nProhibited to take pictures.",
          "Wonderful \ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude40\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Finally got to see one of the famous Renaissance masterpiece.  The room was dark for good reason and we were asked to move along so that gave us very little time to stay still to enjoy. But I guess we just have to learn to share with hundreds if not thousands of visitors :-)",
          "The Sistine Chapel at Vatican city was amazing  with so much rich history and beauty, it makes you wonder about all the stuff we don't see on display. With it being one of the oldest religions you have to wonder what historical items they \u2026",
          "Completely packed with people but all is forgotten when you lay your eyes on the artwork. A once in a lifetime experience.",
          "Beautiful art. Stunning to see. The crowds we're almost overwhelming and noisy despite frequent reminders that silence is required. It would have been a better experience with fewer and more respect people.",
          "An amazing place but way too many people.  Have limits, charge extra...  do something to make this more enjoyable",
          "An incredible work of art. Practice patience while getting through the museums because the lines and the amount of people are truly overwhelming. Please plan ahead, buy tickets and if you can buy skip the line tickets.",
          "Amazing and fantastic! Take your time to have a look at every different painting. A guide would be useful to show you the best parts and tell you some things over them",
          "This place is amazing.",
          "Chapel foremost but also a work of art.\n\nEnough said, again something you should see when in Rome/Vatican City.",
          "Nice but too many people",
          "It's everything that's wrong with mass tourism. Too many people herded around like cats with no time to appreciate the artwork and the history. The Vatican just trying to make money. If you are after a spiritual experience in the Sistine Chapel forget it.",
          "Amazing. Such a spiritual experience to see. You can't take photos in the actual chapel.",

          "Great place. But sincerely there are more expectacular paintings inside the Vatican Museum",
          "It was an amazing experience to see such a historic image up close. The history is rich and colourful, and it will always be a memorable day. Unfortunately, you can't take photos inside, but the surrounding artwork on the way to the Chapel makes up for that.",
          "Nothing so special. Just historically marvelous which you can Google it. Again italians are not very good people when it comes to costumer service. Me and my wife got lost in the tour and was separated from my son. We ask this attendant and nearly shouted at my wife for asking.",
          "This chappel is indeed beautiful and worth visiting however it is too crowded. From entry till exit, you will follow the crowd and be in queue.

          "Getting in and getting there requires comfortable shoes. Once there just shut up, look up and around and absorve the history, beauty and human achievement. It's truly a religious experience, as you are bumped from side to side by the other thousands of people who are there with you.",

          "As always. Magnificent to see and an important destination for the faith. The whole Vatican was filled with beautiful sculptures and artwork every step of the way. Please, you must get a \"skip the line\" ticket. It's worth every cent. The line is ridiculously long",
          "There is a lot to see here, however, there is a lot of walking and stairs involved. Visitors with mobility issues will have a difficult time. The crowds and lines can be overwhelming. It's worth the cost to sign up for an earthy morning Sistine Chapel tour. The museum is huge!"

        "wiki": "The Mausoleum of Hadrian, usually known as Castel Sant'Angelo (Italian pronunciation: [ka\u02c8st\u025bl san\u02c8tand\u0292elo]; English: Castle of the Holy Angel), is a towering cylindrical building in Parco Adriano, Rome, Italy. It was initially commissioned by the Roman Emperor Hadrian as a mausoleum for himself and his family. The building was later used by the popes as a fortress and castle, and is now a museum. The structure was once the tallest building in Rome.\n\n\n== Hadrian's tomb ==\n\nThe tomb of the Roman emperor Hadrian, also called Hadrian's mole, was erected on the right bank of the Tiber, between AD 134 and 139. Originally the mausoleum was a decorated cylinder, with a garden top and golden quadriga. Hadrian's ashes were placed here a year after his death in Baiae in 138, together with those of his wife Sabina, and his first adopted son, Lucius Aelius, who died in 138. Following this, the remains of succeeding emperors were also placed here, the last recorded deposition being Caracalla in 217. The urns containing these ashes were probably placed in what is now known as the Treasury room deep within the building. Hadrian also built the Pons Aelius facing straight onto the mausoleum \u2013 it still provides a scenic approach from the center of Rome and the left bank of the Tiber, and is renowned for the Baroque additions of statues of angels holding aloft instruments of the Passion of Christ.\n\n\n== Decline ==\nMuch of the tomb contents and decorations have been lost since the building's conversion to a military fortress in 401 and its subsequent inclusion in the Aurelian Walls by Flavius Honorius Augustus. The urns and ashes were scattered by Visigoth looters during Alaric's sacking of Rome in 410, and the original decorative bronze and stone statuary were thrown down upon the attacking Goths when they besieged Rome in 537, as recounted by Procopius. An unusual survivor, however, is the capstone of a funerary urn (probably that of Hadrian), which made its way to Saint Peter's Basilica, covered the tomb of Otto II and later was incorporated into a massive Renaissance baptistery. The use of spolia from the tomb in the post-Roman period was noted in the 16th century \u2013 Giorgio Vasari writes:\n\n...in order to build churches for the use of the Christians, not only were the most honoured temples of the idols [pagan Roman gods] destroyed, but in order to ennoble and decorate Saint Peter's with more ornaments than it then possessed, they took away the stone columns from the tomb of Hadrian, now the castle of Sant'Angelo, as well as many other things which we now see in ruins.\nLegend holds that the Archangel Michael appeared atop the mausoleum, sheathing his sword as a sign of the end of the plague of 590, thus lending the castle its present name. A less charitable yet more apt elaboration of the legend, given the militant disposition of this archangel, was heard by the 15th-century traveler who saw an angel statue on the castle roof. He recounts that during a prolonged season of the plague, Pope Gregory I heard that the populace, even Christians, had begun revering a pagan idol at the church of Santa Agata in Suburra. A vision urged the pope to lead a procession to the church. Upon arriving, the idol miraculously fell apart with a clap of thunder. Returning to St Peter's by the Aelian Bridge, the pope had another vision of an angel atop the castle, wiping the blood from his sword on his mantle, and then sheathing it. While the pope interpreted this as a sign that God was appeased, this did not prevent Gregory from destroying more sites of pagan worship in Rome.\n\n\n== Papal fortress, residence and prison ==\nThe popes converted the structure into a castle, beginning in the 14th century; Pope Nicholas III connected the castle to St Peter's Basilica by a covered fortified corridor called the Passetto di Borgo. The fortress was the refuge of Pope Clement VII from the siege of Charles V's Landsknechte during the Sack of Rome (1527), in which Benvenuto Cellini describes strolling the ramparts and shooting enemy soldiers.\nLeo X built a chapel with a Madonna by Raffaello da Montelupo. In 1536 Montelupo also created a marble statue of Saint Michael holding his sword after the 590 plague (as described above) to surmount the Castel. Later Paul III built a rich apartment, to ensure that in any future siege the pope had an appropriate place to stay.\nMontelupo's statue was replaced by a bronze statue of the same subject, executed by the Flemish sculptor Peter Anton von Verschaffelt, in 1753. Verschaffelt's is still in place and Montelupo's can be seen in an open court in the interior of the Castle.\nThe Papal state also used Sant'Angelo as a prison; Giordano Bruno, for example, was imprisoned there for six years. Other prisoner were the sculptor and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the magician and charlatan Cagliostro. Executions were performed in the small inner courtyard. As a prison, it was also the setting for the third act of Giacomo Puccini's 1900 opera Tosca; the eponymous heroine leaps to her death from the Castel's ramparts.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nDecommissioned in 1901, the castle is now a museum: the Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo. It received 1,234,443 visitors in 2016.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCardinal-nephew\nConcordat of Worms\nList of castles in Italy\nStand of the Swiss Guard\nVia della Conciliazione\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBruno Contardi; Marica Mercalli; Italy.

          "Big and very old monument of history. Quite crowdly. We were around noon and there were a lot of people.",
          "End October 2019: After walking around the castle I decided to do a self guided tour. Entry is pricey - E15. [see photo of ticket.] For those who get claustrophobic be warned there are some long, dark passages to get to certain towers and areas. I personally could only do a",
          "This place is absolutely gorgeous on the outside, especially at night when it is all lit up. I wouldn\u2019t recommend going inside though, although rich in history, the inside is pretty boring with not much to see. I will say however, the view of the city from the very top is",
          "A lot quieter than the other historic sights in Rome. An interesting fort from the Roman period to present day. A beautiful view of the city and river from the battlements",
          "We arrived a bit less than an hour before the Museum closed and were told by the guards that they are not allowing any more guests, since the last ones can enter an hour and a half before closing time. Of course we respected that, but for our bad luck we left an \"Ohh\" sound of",
          "This was the first time I went in, glad I did ! but beware it is a lot of walking and stairs ! Also cold inside, But go to the very top, there is a caffe and bathroom at the top , sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and a snack, amazing view of the city, and picture spot ! well",
          "I have waked next to Sant\u2019Angelo before.... And never dropped in... before this time! Great museum, great view, I will come back.",
          "Went here after a long day in the vatican and we found this to be more interesting and way less steps. Full of surprises and not expensive. Regretted eating before our visit as nice cafe inside with terrific views. Great value for money",
          "I went by myself, my wife's knee was bothering her. A bargain to enter and a free app for your smartphone makes the visit better. It is a very interesting structure with a quite interesting history. The picture from it are almost worth the ticket on its own. Be prepared to spend",
          "You have to got to be here for the most beautiful sunset you can witness. And the restaurant up there is nice place to have a break for coffee.",
          "this is amazing Castle very much the of Spirit and great Historical Structure and give the tells of life in the old times love it and it well worth the visit not to be missed its the shape of the Castle that is so impressive",
          "I enjoyed the building, and the view from the top is very nice. However, within the building there isn't a whole lot to see. If you just want to see a cool old building, go for it, but I would say there are much more beautiful/interest-filled places you could visit for the same",
          "Great historical structure. Should not missed vising during your travel to Rome. Very interesting to see and picture.",
          "I love the spirit of the castle. The castle tells the story of life in old times. The round shape of the castle makes it more impressive. And those old weapons make you think about battlefields that seems so far from today's digital world.",
          "The old fortress has seen many eras, and is a good site to check from your list. But don't expect too much, the views to outside are best it has to offer. Ticket seller Lady acted like a robot and didn't listen that I wanted something else that she was automatically doing. I got",
          "One of the greatest places i've ever seen. I've always seen it from the outside but never visited properly. Castel Sant'Angelo is one the places that makes you say \"wow!\". Built in the old roman times, it shaped into a cage and a fortress for the Pope. One of the most",
          "A must see monument of Rome, that besides its cultural significance offers spectacular view to St. Peter's Basilica, the river, the bridge, the city! Lucky enough to arrive on top just before sunset, I had the best experience just a few hours before New Year's",
          "Located Lungotevere was the mausoleum of Emperor Hadrian, transformed into a fortress centuries later; Today it's a museum, a must to visit with a stunning view over Rome, the Vatican and the Tiber, to take pictures, wonderful souvenirs.",
          "incredible!!! Hadrian's mausoleum !!! a big fort! It's worth going through the huge corridors, the giant walls, the inner gardens! Then get to the top and watch the sunset with Vatican in the background, wait a while for the lizes to light up and take beautiful pictures! we love",
          "Monumental buildingi in the center of Rome. It is a former castle with big historical heritage. Fortunately most of its parts are visible except of the basement (I think there should be...). It gives you a lot of information about the 2000 years history of Rome with a reasonable",
          "We had a few minutes between tours and so we popped in here and were glad we did. The view from the top was amazing. It had some military items which were really fascinating as well. We had to wait in line a bit, but once we got in it wasn't too crowded.",
          "I have been walking arround the city to explore all these location. what a beaty of architecture. well organzied by the state",
          "To my shame and and after three trips to Rome, I have not visited Castel Sant\u2019Angelo yet, so naturally it was my first priority. What a treasure! Castel Sant\u2019Angelo is like a layered cake of history starting with the days of emperor Hadrian at the ground level and then all the",
          "This place is huge and there are a lot of stairs to climb to get to the top but the views of Rome are well worth the effort. The place is interesting from an architectural standpoint, center of the structure was a tomb for the emperor Hadrian's family and the surrounding square",
          "This was a nice and unexpected detour on our way to see the Vatican. Beautiful castle with interesting history and great views of the Vatican. It also has a cafe on top to enjoy the views.",
          "After our visit to Vatican we pass throw this Castel, its just 5 minutes from Plaza San Pedro, it\u2019s a very interesting place to visit and not very well known in the local attractions.",
          "A building with a lot of history from Roman times through the renaissance. The downloadable app didn\u2019t seem to work for my wife but good idea and more venues should do the same Venue has a lot of steps.",
          "a great story and layering of history. if you can choose the time for going there- opt for sunset- nothing rivals the view from the roof...",
          "This attraction is not exactly worth visiting except for the view at the top and from a cafe before reaching the spot. I was expecting to see some exhibitions but sadly there was not much to see. The history of the saint angel is far more interesting.",
          "This was one of our kids favorite places in Rome. The old staircases and incredible views of the city from the top of the building were indescribable. There were also tons of stalls just down from this attraction where they could spent a few euros on gifts for their friends.",
          "Great alternative to explore outside the known draw cards. Emperor Hadrian certainly left is mark here and the secret passage to the Vatican is quite intriguing.",
          "We have been in Rome a few times but this was our very first visit inside the castle. Worth every penny, in my opinion! Make sure you are able to walk up and down stairs. We came early in the morning as they just opened and there was no line, no wait. It was a very pleasant",
          "This is one of my favourite places in Rome. Originally the tomb of emperor Hadrian that has become a fortress, a prison and a papal residence. I visited on a late Sunday afternoon in late September and queued about 5-10 minutes. Tickets 15 \u20ac. Inside you can to walk through the",
          "This is a really good preserved castle and the view from the top is really fantastic. It costs 15 euro to enter but worth it really. If you visit Rome you should definitely visit this castle also.",
          "Not worth 15 euros, there is not much inside. Nice from the outside with the bridge and beautiful view out of it, but the interior very poor",
          "Second time to tour this, first time was about 18 years ago. Much improved with great audio guide available through their app on your smart phone. BEAUTIFUL views of city of Rome from the roof.",
          "The best views of castel Sant\u2019Angelo are seen from the other side of the river : climb down the steps and walk along the river bank. The best time is sunset when the building looks like gold... and look at the reflections in the river... a stunningly romantic spot!",
          "Was surprise to learn that this castle used to protect the popes during war times ! Interesting reading about this rich history behind the castle that protected the popes during difficult times !",
          "I really liked that there is an application for phone and internet free, an application that tells you exactly about the places, the rooms you visit, the history of these places. The staff is very friendly and the panorama of the city, especially on a day with sun and clouds, is",
          "Arrived by chance in the evening and as it was dark we were surprised to find it open. We found the history of the castle fascinating, the artefacts intriguing and the views from the roof top of illuminated Rome, stunning.",
          "Castello St Angelo is a perfect place to see Rome from above. The building looks so big from the outside but actually it doesn't take so long time to walk around. There is a rooftop where you have this wonderful view of the city and the Vatican. There is also a cafe which you",
          "It\u2019s very beautiful place to see and learn about its history but very expensive . We paid 15\u20ac per person . Although if you are under 26 you pay reduced ticket of 2\u20ac . They could make it less than 15\u20ac.",
          "I took this and it was very cool. However, the kids on the trip (three girls ranging in age from fifteen to nine), were struggling to keep up and understand. They weren't sure what they expected- but apparently not crazy crowds. It was an interesting place, and filled with",
          "A great place, even to see. Didn't go inside but did walk around-beautiful castle and moat-like grounds. If we had more time in Rome, definitely would've gone inside!",
          "I didn't know what to expect, but from the little I read about the sight, it was appealing. I didn't make it there on my first trip to Rome, but 10 years later I made it a priority. There is so much to see here, from the oldest section (tomb area) to the battlements to the",
          "Its a very long walk, you walk around and up through the whole castle, before you get to the exit. its actually very nice that everyone goes in the same direction all the way. Its a interresting and pretty sight and it has an extraordinary view from the roof.",
          "We visited the castle on a nice, sunny day in November. It had rained on previous days, so we were happy to have nice weather for the rooftop view. The main reason we visited was to see this view. We were somewhat short on time and overloaded by other activities on previous days",
          "By far the best rooftop view of Rome that you can access. I believe this is the second highest point in Rome, after St Peter's, which you can't get to, with a stunning nearly 360 degree view of the city once on the roof. Not at all crowded, fascinating to learn how this started",
          "On previous trips to Roma, I\u2019ve visited 51 via Margutta, La Bocca de la verit\u00e0 and the Spanish Steps (sitting on all of them to be sure that I replicated the desired pose). Fans of fifties movies will quickly make the link amongst those sites - Vacanze Romane. This trip I wanted",
          "This is an attraction we visited on a total whim to get out of the sun for a bit and I'm so glad we did. The Castel Sant'Angelo is huge, incredibly interesting and beautiful inside. We used an audio tour on an app for extra information. As you walk through, you get to see a lot",
          "Not only a castle used by the popes, but also the mausoleum of Emperor Hadrian, with some small museums. Some of the Papal appartments have beautiful frescoes and ceilings. The views from the top of the castle are brilliant!",
          "Interesting introduction of history. There are also enough places to do nice picture of Rome, to sit and enjoy good weather, drink coffee.",
          "We visited at the beginning of Nov and it was beautiful. The design of it was amazing when you tour it from the inside, a real fortress! Amazing views of the city when you reach the top. Yet another historical gem in Rome's crown",
          "This is a beautiful monument, with a long and complex history, it has changed many times during the centuries. If booked in time, it is possible to visit the passage that links it to San Pietro, it was used by Popes to run away. I suggest you read the history of this fortress",
          "when i took the river cruise was the best angle to take a picture of this place. later I also walked by it. did not get a chance to visit inside. lots of people around it.",
          "Went to go just to take photos and decided to go in, well worth it, awesome history and incredible views from the top. Cafe was very good as well!",
          "ticket 15 eur waited in a queu of 5 min till i got it no need for guide or paying extra you need one hour maximum there if you are really into details it is not so big there is a small meuseam of two small rooms inside showing some customes of romans and some fighting tools",
          "I visited Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo in September 2019. It is not far from the Vatican. I had to wait in a very long line (slow moving) to buy my ticket which cost 15 euros. Castel Sant'Angelo was a very interesting place but a little hard to follow. There was no",
          "Outstanding architecture with great defenses. Popes took a refugee here when they were in danger for their lives .And that hapenned many times. Imposing walls and interior. Views over Rome are also great here.",
          "Climb to the top for a awesome view of Rome and the Vatican. We saw it as part of the \"Angels & Demons\" Tour.",
          "This museum had a nicely organized path that takes you through its entirety and exposes you to some beautiful views of Rome (especially from the top) and contains various exhibitions, from weaponry/armor to art and historic artifacts.",
          "What a unique place. We learned so much history and the views were breathtaking. The special exhibit about the gems and jewelry of the stars was exquisite.",
          "It was an amazing piece of vatican history. we enjoyed the tour and especially the views from the top.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed this site. This building has been a mausoleum, a fortress, a prison, and the Pope's quarters. Most of the building is original including frescoes throughout. The Pope's quarters are beautiful and includes a gorgeous bathroom! The view of Rome from the very",
          "As a child, I had a jigsaw puzzle of this building. Now I can say I have been inside the Castel Sant'Angelo. Go early to avoid the line up and enjoy a panoramic view of Rome from the tower. Steeped in amazing history, this is a jewel to see.",
          "This huge Castle is definitely worth a visit. Even though I did not go in (entrance fee = 15EU), I still loved the outside area and the little park next to it. When you go inside, it is recommended to go before sunrise, as the sunrise view on top of the terrace should be lovely.",
          "Me and my partner visited this outstanding building its awesome inside and out a lot to see inside if you not afraid of heights as i am but my partner went to the top and recommends others to do so well worth the price just to say you were there",
          "Splended castel you can visit just inside and take photo.for insid visit should pay and l think if you want miss and skip visit inside one thing in rome you choose it , because I think there is not special thing at inside this castel except the view of city and river.",
          "this fortress is easy to walk through, on the top you will have a perfect view over the city of Rome and the vatican, especially at sunset with all the lightings",
          "One of the best views of Rome. You have to pay the entry fee and go through the small museum in order to go all the way up but the 360 degree is worth it in my opinion. We had a perfect day and the panoramic view of Rome, both East and West was breathtaking.",
          "The views from the top level are fantastic especially the view of The Vatican. The whole of ancient Rome is laid out before you. There are many very interesting exhibits within the walls. Great view of The Tiber as well.",
          "Very close to Vatican City and Tiber River. Was once a fort and houses some interesting artifacts. Views from the top are amazing.",
          "Some tourist sights say it is not worth it...don't agree. Lots of history to it, large, lots to see, some museum pieces inside. Great views from the top. Sure, not the forum or collesium, but if staying in a hotel nearby, can see it, the vatican or even the pantheon and",
          "If your trying to see as much art and archaeology as possible in a short period of time (I had 4 days) this I thought was a waste of time and a lot of walking up and down stairs. Also they blocked half the artwork because of some bulgari exhibition inside. This used to be a",
          "A really important place to visit. History, artifacts, rooms that never cease to appear, and even a cozy restaurant at the end of your climbing. Those old popes had a very special castle!",
          "This place has so much history. I loved the old architecture, too. The best part, though? The incredible 360 panorama from the top! One of the most amazing sights I've ever seen!",
          "You get the best view of Rome from the Castel. When we were there, Bulgari was having a jewelry and fashion exhibit which was fabulous!! The exhibit lasts until first or mid November. Loved it!",
          "It was truly lovely in the evening. Much cheaper to get in, and almost no tourist. We went inside about 19.00 and it was perfect.",
          "The site has an audioguide app which you can download for free. Unfortunately, on the day I visited, no one seemed to be able to download the app onsite using the site's free wifi service. I'd try downloading the app onto your device before you visit if you can. The Castel is",

          "An impressive fortress with a lovely terrace on top and a magnificent view. The entrance is quite easy (10\u2019 minutes of waiting) and the tour is intuitive (there is an app on phone also, but not audio guide at the gate). The view over Rome is magnificent!",
          "This place is just great. The environment is beautiful, the views are awesome and the entire tripe is lovely and misterious. Once in the top you can see the entire city!!",

          "Although this isn\u2019t necessarily somewhere you are told to go for a short trip Rome as there is so much to see and do there. We were lucky enough to have this recommended to us by a local taxi driver. So after our tour of the Vatican we headed in this direction. The walk to it",
          "15 euros. Well, it's really amazing but everything is just to make money. It's a pity. Not enough staff. Crowded...",
          "This place was interesting and had some stunning jewellery in some of the rooms. It was a nice walk around the castle and the exhibitions were very interesting as they were full of history. I would definitely recommend it",
          "Maybe this isn't one of the top Rome tourist sites. However its still worth a visit. It takes you through several centuries of change. Fascinating to find out why, how and by who it was modified. There is an excellent view of the city from the roof top. Easy to spend 60 min plus",
          "A good time to go is the end of the day, we didn't have to queue long and we timed our visit so that we were on the roof for s spectacular views of St Peter's and the setting sun. It's quite pricey at 15 euros, but a real sense of the military history of Rome laced with the",

          "Called here on the way back from the Vatican and found it an unusual and interesting building with a varied history. If you are Roman Empired out this adds another layer of history to this fascinating city.",
          "A great attraction to visit with kids. A beautiful castle with lots of rooms to visit and a magnificent view of Rome from the top. We went early and there wasn't much of a queue but it was a lot longer by the time we left. It has a lovely cafe near the top with what must be",
          "Great and non crowded place to visit, good fun for kids to see how things were done in the past. Done good play material for them and learning in the side. One of the most interesting museums for kids in Rome.",
          "Did not go into the museum, only saw from the exterior, but was a wonderful experience seeing the Hadrian bridge and the Castle",
          "We stayed here across the road from Castel Sant \u00c1ngelo. A great place to stay in Ponte. A great museum. Worth seeing this and other sights in Rome when travelling there. Try and blend in and not look like a tourist. You will feel much safer then.",
          "We were going to come first thing in the morning but we ended up going at night -- and it was awesme!!! There was music playing and less crowded and weather is a bit cooler!",

          "It is very impressive from the outside but it is equally interesting from inside. A little pricier than other attractions at 15 euros each but you can download a free audio tour app. You don't need this though as there were information plaques in English and Italian",
          "It cost 15 Euro per person for admission. I think it's too much since there isn't really that much to see in there. Rich history which you can read up on the internet but basically an empty castle.",
          "This one is for anyone interested in military history as it is a true fortress. It is also connected to the Vatican Palace by a secret high walkway which was much needed in times past by the Popes.In it's grounds there is a large park with a play area for the kids and high in",

          "What an interesting place full of history from the height of Roman power - think Hadrian - to modern culture. On day we visited there was a Bulgari and haute couture show with iconic jewellery and dresses - free to see once general admission paid. Less queuing than the Vatican",
          "A must for all lovers of Rome. Steeped in history and amazing views. Lucky to see the Bvllgari collection as well.",
          "Definitely see this castle at night for great pictures! We went back during the next day because we were there on a free entry day - it was definitely worth the 25 minute wait to get in. don't know if I would pay the admission price but the views from the top may make it worth",
          "We bought a Roma Pass, which gave us free entry into a few different places, along with free travel on buses and metros. We didn't realize though that Museums were free on the first Sunday off the month (during the weekend we went away), the que was huge (had we went on the",

          "Wife and I booked tickets for a 9am entry. There were only 15-20 people in the queue, so it seemed like a good time to visit. To be honest, there isn't a vast amount to see - a few rooms with military memorabilia, a cafe (which was closed that early), and a lot of stairs....but",
          "Great site very long queues and I think the queue must have been nearly 1KM but it is very old and I think Hadrian built it originally for his own mausoleum. Good thing about it is that it is on route to to other top attractions and set in amazing surroundings.",
          "The famous emperor Hadrian had one of the largest tombs of all. the smaller tomb of August is just across the Tiber river. The tomb was remodeled into the Castel. The main reason why a heathen tomb still is erect in the Catholic State of the Vatican",
          "When I was a child, it wasn't possible to visit this place. Now it is a great museum, with a lot of history layers.",
          "First of all: impressive from the outside. But check out the inside too. It has an interesting history. Bonus: fantastic views from the top. They also have a cloackroom (i wish more attractions had this). Admission is 12 euros, if i remember correctly.",
          "Visited one morning and it was relatively quiet. We downloaded the app advertised at reception but was disappointed to see that it just repeated the information on the interpretation boards scattered amongst the site. It\u2019s well worth a visit.",
          "I really enjoyed Castel Sant' Angelo, but it didn't compare to the Vatican and Colosseum etc. There are gorgeous views over Rome from the top and a lovely cafe, so I recommend going up and having a look! It is also a lovely area, with the famous bridge of angels.",
          "Fabulous museum covering Ancient Rome, the Renaissance and the Papacy which tells the story of the city through this one building. Can\u2019t recommend enough. If you are visiting in the next couple of months there is also a free exhibition of Bulgari fashion and jewellery. There is",
          "Its all free and walking up the stairs to the different levels and views. Do go all the way to the top.",
          "It is not a big big castle but still is a castle that is now a museum. It is really near from the Vatican and beside the trastevere river",
          "Sant\u2019Angelo gives you the feeling of medieval times. Popes escaped here and lived here when they feared for their safety. Very historic ! Yes there\u2019s art, defences against intruders but one of my favourite highlites was the views from the very top... Wow!",
          "Impressive imposing structure but minimal exhibits not worth entrance fee. Suggest walk around exterior and visit inside walls up to ticket office.",
          "I would say this is a must see in Rome especially for the views from the top. It's a very interesting building with a huge amount of history.",
          "If you appreciate Castles, this is a must see. Lots of steps along with a history lesson. Close to the Vatican and the Sistene Chapel so it can be seen together. See this one last",
          "Really enjoyed this attraction and would recommend to all who visit Rome - the history is more of the same from the Catholic Church perspective but the views of Rome are superb. The one downside is the audio app - if you don't have access to mobile data then don't bother about",
          "I\u2019ve walked past this site nine numerous time during nine other visits to Rome because I always ran out of time. It\u2019s a not to miss- shorter lines, not as packed as other sites and in addition to the history of the site itself, the views are some of the best in Rome! Not to miss!",

          "Not visited inside but every day viewed from outside, located just a few minutes walking from Hotel Colors what was our nice hotel in the Via Boezio.",
          "This place is a must but it was great to find a cafe at the top of the Castle! After walking a lot that hot July day it was nice to have a cold beer and enjoy the view. It was 15 euro entrance buying at gate",
          "After visiting the Vatican in the morning, we finished off here and had made a reservation for lunch at the amazing restaurant, and owner - Claudio. He made our group feel welcomed and backed it with great service and great food at reasonable prices. A hidden gem not to be",
          "The original castle is fortress like, but various popes have made some rooms more comfortable and decorative. Small armoury. On one level there is a 360 degree view of Rome...including stunning views of St Peters and the Vatican through large window arches. On this level there",
          "Excellent tour with a guide and wonderful views of the city and drinks from the lovely cafe on the top level.",
          "Save almost half of day to visit the castle. The view from up is breath-taking. It's really worth it.",
          "Our walking tour of Rome ended at the bridge in front of this place. It has quite a history - much of it tragic. Do some research and you will appreciate the history as well as the spectacle of this building - and definitely come by at night for a dramatic photo of a well lit",
          "We stumbled upon this on our way to the spanish steps. We didn\u2019t book a tour and we are glad we didn\u2019t. It\u2019s all self explanatory there is even an app and WiFi throughout so you can walk around at your our leisure. We queued up outside for about 10mins the heat was insane.",
          "You have to visit this place!! Absolutely incredible! So much history and the scale of it all is just amazing. The cafe is a great touch too, lunch/drinks with an amazing view. Definitely go here!",
          "Very cool! They have some guided-tour app, but we couldn't get it to work (which is why I deducted a star - they had you log into their wifi, download the app, then it had to configure - anyway, we couldn't get it to work after 5-10 minutes so gave up), though it would have been",
          "This is a must visit, this site looks and feels very different from most things you see in Rome. Once inside you feel as if you go back in time to the days of Hadrian.",
          "Beautiful little Castel , easy to get to and worth seeing. Amazing when you tie in history ( used as a papal escape site) and Hollywood ( see Angels and Demons) Whatever you do don\u2019t take a tour or skip the line. Skip the line is 78 euros for 4 yet turning up there was no queue",
          "This was such an incredible treasure to tour. The views on top of the castle are breathtaking and made for great pictures. Take a selfie stick. Don't buy one from the vendors. Outside the castle, entertainers will play music and you can sit and have a beer, overlook the river,",
          "In all honesty, I didn't consider enter the Museum, just took a stroll around it and is rather beautiful - you should go from the Vatican or the other way around as it is a rock throw away. As a side comment, if you ever played Assassin's Creed, you must see it by yourself.",
          "Seen this a few times even from a river boat trip we did. Again history alive, amazing sights. I've seen many sights but Rome is definitely the best.",
          "I hadn\u2019t planned on visiting this but I was passing, there was no queue so I thought why not. It is a nice old building with a long history but tbh was only saved for me by 2 things. There is a coffee shop on the upper level with a view of the Vatican and when you get to the",
          "This Castle is definitely a must see going into St. Peter's Basilica! We loved this tour so much! We weren't able to go inside but took lots of pictures outside the Castle.",
          "I climbed all the stairs to the top, difficult but worth the view from the roof. The building structure, the arms, the amour made the trip.",
          "No need to prebook, we only queued for 10 mins before we got in. Well worth the 10 minute wait. The boards were most informative and the decorated rooms were superb. The cafe at the top was an added bonus with superb table service and delicious food.",
          "The view from the top is amazing. Long climb up, but worth it. You can enjoy a cold drink once you make your way up there.",
          "This very impressive structure offers an interesting perspective on the interaction of the Roman Empire and the Church. As with so much else in Rome, one has built upon and adapted the former. The cylindrical structure and added bastions make for an imposing papal fortress. The",
          "I was surprised at how uncrowded this wonderful cylindrical attraction was in peak tourist season. Once inside, the awful August heat is kept at bay by the heavy stone walls, and you can concentrate on the marvellous art and history. There are fabulous 360 degree views of Rome",
          "We arrived around 5 for the tour. As we climbed we started to notice windows overlooking St. Peters. There was a space to dine or grab snacks with seating to enjoy the view. After a nice break, we continued to the rooftop, arriving just at sunset. SPECTACULAR. Then back",
          "I had been in Rome 4 other times and had always taken a picture of this place but had never been inside. Last month I changed that and toured the place. I was not expecting much, it is usually not ranked high as a must see sight in Rome but it was actually quite nice. There",
          "Castel Sant\u2019Angelo is a beautiful old fortress that was once Hadrian\u2019s tomb. We used our Roma Pass to get in so we didn\u2019t have to pay anything extra to get in & we didn\u2019t have to line up to buy a ticket. We didn\u2019t go all the way to the top but went to the mid-level area where",

          "We went through this fort/castle/museum. Amazing history. You get a good since of the excesses and the unbelievable wealth of the popes that lived there. Hadrian is buried there.",
          "Not a whole lot to see as you work yourself upwards. The views from the top are excellent. Worth the time if you have some to spare.",
          "It is amazing castle, with a great restaurant on the top with a breathtaking view. Relax after the climbing and not so bad stairs, enjoy a cold beer perhaps while you admire the view as far as you can see. I would not miss this one, the illuminations at night makes it",
          "I love old places so this was another stunning visit. I like the way is looking decadent giving the idea that is still being used. nice place for eating as well if you can afford.",
          "This place was not as amazing as the others we visited in Rome. The exposition is quite small and the castle seems almost empty lacking the usual decorations from other historical buildings. The statue on the rooftop is worth the visit and the bridge with all the angel statues",
          "The place is a landmark in Rome and it is very popular, but if you get inside, there is not much to do. It is just a castle with nice views and pretty boring exhibitions. I would recommend to get your photos from outside and save your money for other attractions.",
          "Had a fantastic visit to this fascinating castle which incorporates the tomb of the Emperor Hadrian. We visited on a vert hot day and the climb to the top was exhausting but well worth it for the views across the city and especially the Vatican",

          "Well located attraction which dominates the area and seriously warrants a visit:some lavish restored rooms and statues with some decent info about the building which also clues you in about Rome's history also; although there is some climbing stairs involved, the awesome views",
          "It is really lovable place.. The view from the top is very beautiful. I recommend to take your ticket online.",
          "First, the views from the top are hard to beat, and worth the price of admission. The \u201ccastle\u201d (originally Hadrian\u2019s tomb) has an interesting story - initially the mausoleum of an Emperor, retrofitted into an fortified hiding place for the Pope - that is a tidy example of how",
          "Highly recommended paying for this attraction. Only 15euros each per person the building is wonderful and the view of the Vatican and surrounding area is exceptional. Lovely restaurant inside at decent prices also.",
          "The view from the top is great. The journey upward is interesting enough, you can see some of the fortress defences. A nice cafe inside. Definately a good one if you have kids.",
          "The cute cafe on top of the castle with a fantastic view is worth the ticket! Never had such a relaxed and impressiv rest in Rome. A simple must have.",
          "My family of 4 really enjoyed Castel Sant'Angelo. The building is magnificent and the views it offers are lovely. While it offers evening hours (until 10:00 PM), we went in the late morning before our reserved Vatican tickets. There is a cafe beautifully situated along the",
          "15\u20ac per ticket and there really isn\u2019t much to see. Great views from the top though. Cafes too. Wheel chair accessible.",
          "We visited Castel Sant'Angelo by night, much more pleasant than in the blazing summer heat during the daytime",
          "Rather large, this castle is pretty cool! You're afforded great photo opportunities and excellent views from the top of the castle, pretty much 360 degree views of Rome. Can't remember exactly, but it was either free or discounted if you have the Roma Card. There's a small cafe",
          "Having visited Rome umpteen times over 20 years, I've always been fascinated by Castel Sant'Angelo having often walked by. Prior to this visit I'd never entered as I'd no idea it was open to the public or maintained so immaculately/intact. We went in at around 10:30pm and it",
          "The history of Castel Sant'Angelo is an interesting one. Originally built as a mausoleum for Hadrian it became over the years a fortified castle giving refuge to popes in danger and a home to others. It is fascinating to walk through the structure and see how it evolved as",
          "Entering Vatican city across the bridge over the river, you are faced with this Castle. I did not get time to look inside as we were hot and desperate to get to the Vatican Square and the main sites.",
          "I\u2019m obsessed with this building- it\u2019s so pretty on the Rome skyline. Compared to the other museums in Rome, it was pretty quiet and the queue to get in wasn\u2019t particularly long. Really informative and interesting museum to walk through but the view from the top is the real",
          "After many visits to Rome, this was our first visit. There was no line so we were lucky to just walk in. Enjoyed the nooks and crannies, exhibits and the stunning views from the top. It was a sunny cool afternoon and enjoyed this visit. Recommended if you have the extra time",
          "My wife and I came across this castle leaving the Vatican knowing nothing about it. We decided to go on the tour cause it was a neat piece of architecture. We were surprised to find such a neat piece of history just by accident. The tour will take you a little over an hour, but",
          "accidentally stumbled upon this place but it didn't disappoint. tickets cost 15 euros per person but the view from the top was amazing. great place to see the st peter's square. some areas were dark and not very well-lit but overall still better than expected.",
          "We went to Sant angelo the ex-Mausoleum of Hadrian around early afternoon, after getting some Gelato at Gelateria dei Gracchi, which we can recommend. Tickets are at a booth just left of the entrance. We waited maybe 5 Minutes to get them. There is an app you can download for",
          "The single ticket to the museum is 15eur, there ia a diffrent price in the web. Museum is interesting and something that is worth of his money in Rome. Also in the top is the greatest view over the whole city and the hallways is spectacular!",
          "Well worth a visit, not as madly crowded as a lot of Rome. Grab a beer in the bar over looking the Basilica whilst you are there. Very interesting loved this place",
          "Visited in July. Arrived early morning and were pleased that there were no queues. Beautiful views and exhibits. Please be aware that there are many steps to climb and therefore those with mobility problems will not have access to many areas. Nice little cafe with view of",
          "The visit was a last minute stop after deciding to avoid the incredibly length queues at the Vatican Museum tour on a very hot day! The main point to take from this review would be simply that it was the best decision we made all day! Castel Sant\u2019Angelo is a stunning site",
          "Enjoyable trip to see this building that was built throughout history. You can see exactly where the \"newer\" part of the building was added which was cool. Walk the same procession Hadrian's body took at time of burial and see fortified papal apartments. Really interesting and",
          "Entrance to Castel Sant\u2019 Angelo was only \u20ac15 for both of us - a bargain given how spectacular it is. My older husband managed all the steps inside & out very well. As you wend your way up the one-way system, you can appreciate the various ages of construction from Hadrian\u2019s era",
          "It was amazing visiting we had a great time and enjoyed it very much the place itself is a unique love it",
          "It was really interesting to walk the castel. The view from the roof is great - you can see St. Peter's. You can save some money if you go later in the day. I will take less than 2 hours to tour so that is a great option.",
          "We didn't have to wait in a long line since we arrived early but when we left there was a pretty long line. The castle is pretty big but does not have many interesting rooms. It only took us an hour to walk around and we were bored by the end. A good exhibit was the jewelry one",
          "We used our Roman Pass to get inside and not expecting much but oh boy it was really a surprise! It offers great view of Rome and Vatican and rich history of this castle. It was not that crowded when we went here so our trip here was smooth.",
          "We only had time to look at the castle from the outside but the tour guide told us plenty of the history around it. Worth visiting as one of the landmarks in Rome!",
          "We picked our B&B to take advantage of its proximity to the Vatican, Castel Sant'Angelo, and the Trastevere section of Rome, and it being a short walk to the castello, we took advantage of the early bird discount and pre-paid tickets to skirt the long line that was forming",
          "An enjoyable visit with some interesting history. As we entered we downloaded an app on their WiFi and used it as an audio guide while moving around, which was interesting. The views of Rome were amazing as well as the art work on the inside. You learnt about how the different",
          "If you're looking for an awesome city view, take the steps to the top of the Castel Sant'Angelo! There are many areas to catch your breath along the way with beautiful art to absorb. There is also a cafe if you'd like to stop and sit in front of one of the many 'windows\" to",

          "Now a museum, this very old building has had many uses over the years, among them a fortress and a castle. There is a \"secret\" passageway leading from the Vatican to Castel Sant'Angelo. If the Pope was ever threatened he could secretly retreat to the fortress. These days, it",

          "Waited years to see this iconic building converted from Roman mausoleum to Papal prison and palace. Was worth the wait. Well maintained and breath-taking views over Rome. Interesting rooms. The audio-guide can be downloaded onto a phone, but may not be worth it as the same",

          "Its a good museum, lot of people but hey, in Rome..everywhere there are lot of people. The location is good, close to the old Rome, so after your visit to the museum Sant' Angelo you can head over to the old Rome and have some Italian food and a good whine.",

          "This is nota far walk from the Vatican and great inexpensive site to see. The views from the top of castle are some of the best in Rome.",
          "So, this place is just awsome. Although within the walls there isn\u2019t that much to see, the view from the top is worth all that money. You see the basilica of st peters, and all the way to the collesium. Its just crazy. Go. Stop, buy your ticket and go !",

          "Such an amazing, fantastic and brilliant place to visit. I've wanted to see this Castle in real life after seeing it in Assasins Creed. Seeing it real life brought so many memories of the game back and the attention to detail Ubisoft did to create it. The castle is well",
          "A very disappointing museum which includes Hadrian's tomb (not worth seeing), some nice views of the Tiber and some very uninteresting exhibitions on the Italian military. Definitely a must-skip on a trip to Rome.",

But it is most exciting as a hiding place for the pope during the sacking of the Vatican. It\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d direct path into the Vatican. For those history buffs and mystery",
          "one very attractive castle that is in good condition considering it's age and while it involves quite a lot of walking you'll be more than rewarded with what it has to offer including the views you get from the roof.",
          "You need to be reasonably fit to tackle this. There are lots of stairs and passages to be negotiated. If you get to the top the views are spectacular but the visit itself was a little disappointing. Perhaps keeping in mind the advancing years and the temperature of 34 degrees",
          "Everyone recommends this place. We thought it had to be good. There was a lot of walking. It was a nice spot especially for a view from the roof but that's about it unless you want to sit in the bar, which was gorgeous, shaded by flowers/plants and cool. it seemed like every",
          "Very interesting building, well signposted, a lot of stairs and slopes to navigate, but the view from the roof should not be missed",
          "Loaded with stairs but worth the climb. Interesting history and takes about and hour and 1/2 to get a decent overview. The view from the top is one of the best in Rome!",
          "Very interesting and the view from the top is worth the admission price. They do charge \u20ac14 to get in and want you to have exact change if paying with cash. The line looks long but it moves quickly it's a big place inside so don't be scared off",
          "It's huge! You do really feel the energy from the olden days. The ticket is roughly 10 euros, its worth a visit.",
          "My husband and I have visited this museum. A lot of stairs to climb to get to the restaurant at the top. If you are fit, no problem climbing the stairs.",
          "The castle itself is worth a visit but the best bit is at the top where the cafe offers good refreshments and amazing views of Rome and St Peter's dome",
          "Built for defense against enemies by the popes, this is more of a fortress than a castle. It still has beautiful art. The views from the top are amazing.",
          "I really enjoyed looking around this attraction. There are a lot of stairs but if you get to the top there is a cafe/restaurant. Great veiws.",
          "Since there is a quite long queue and more or less an hour wait, I advise to book online your tour, directly from the museum website. There, you have the opportunity to choose the the tour, guided or free (you can download a free application through the free wifi, showing you at",
          "As some other reviews have mentioned, this is not as crowded as other sites nearby, so I don't think a skip-the-line ticket is really needed. This is a really interesting castle with old school defenses and nice examples of weaponry and armor. At the very top you are treated to",
          "I haven't found this castle to be extreeemely interesting. It's nice tho, it's bigger that it looks on the outside, the history is interesting.",
          "We didn't venture in but it's a wonderful sight. Beware of the 'sellers' on the bridge. One became very aggressive because I wouldn't engage with him. It's not the usual behavior but it is annoying!",
          "This was on our must see list. Easy walk from the Vatican. Not as crowded compared to the other tourist sites in Rome. We weren't really planning to go inside but just to see it from outside and take pictures but as luck would have it they had a promotion to get in for",
          "This place is a must-see, as it is amazingly interesting. It is not as crowded as the other attractions, and offers a great view of the city at the top",
          "Billed primarily as the tomb of Hadrian, this is much, much more. Stunning architecture on the inside in the apartments of the Popes, plus great displays of armaments. And as always, the wonder of how such a structure could be constructed hundreds of years earlier essentially by",
          "We visited since it was within walking distance of our hotel. Views from the top were amazing, but I only gave 3 stars because I\u2019m not sure it was worth the admission cost?",
          "We did not go into the museum but from the outside it was very nice. We took a look at it in the morning and at night. To be honest, at night it was more beautiful! A little disappointment: it was reconstructed...",
          "We visited early on our way to the Vatican. The early entry fee of 5 euros was well spent and we had a really enjoyable visit. the views from the top are great and provide excellent photo opportunities.",
          "Amazing building with beautiful statues and past history of Rome. The beautiful Tiber River flows alongside the museum.",
          "We visited last week as we'd read about the great views from the top. The views are really spectacular. The rest of the museum is quite average with little to no explanations next to items. There is a room with incredible artwork on the walls and ceiling. Not sure we'd have",
          "Nice, but go early in the morning. Otherwise it is to crowded. But this os really a Nice spot in Rome.",
          "The castle is beautiful on the outside, but go inside is a must! If you go before 11am, it is only \u20ac5 to enter. From the roof there are wonderful views of the Vatican. Great place to visit!",
          "This structure has served several different purposes throughout its existence, and seen the many faces of Rome throughout that time.",
          "Takes about 1 - 2 hours to walk around this place and it's worth a visit as the architecture is impressive as are the gallery exhibits of medieval (and older) armour. The route around the attraction is well signed and thought through, ensuring you don't miss any rooms / spaces.",
          "I think that 14 euros are too much for what it offers. It is a good spot to take pictures with a panoramic view on the top. However most of the interiors are empty. Good is the free audio guide, but you need a smartphone to download it",
          "We visited on a whim late in the afternoon as we had a spare few hours. At first we thought the entry price was high and questioned if it was worth it whilst we walked around. It\u2019s a place full of history but there isn\u2019t much to see apart from the walls and corridors of the",
          "So happy that i decided to visit Castel Sant'Angelo. Fantastic museum with lots to see. Worth the visit.",
          "Spectacular old castle across from the Vatican. The views from the upper level of Rome are spectacular. This is a must visit while in Rome.",
          "It is the second time we go there and it was always very interesting.All is to be to visited but we did not have time enough.",
          "The Castel is nice on the outside, but the real treat is the view of the Vatican. You look down this wide street and there it is! There is also a pedestrian bridge to the other side of the river. There are some cheap souvenir stands, with the same stuff sold elsewhere but",
          "We went late afternoon and NO crowds which was great. My highlights were definitely the view from the top and the romantic cafe table settings peeping thru the walls. The rest I found a bit boring, also thought the entry cost a bit much - therefore only 3 stars.",
          "Unless you purchase your tickets online, get there early or be prepared to stand in line. Once inside, there is a steady line of stairs to get to the top, but at each landing there are interesting things to see. Originally built by Emperor Hadrian as his mausoleum, beginning in",
          "I was on the \u201cHop on and hop off\u201d bus when I decided to visit Angel Castle. I have passed it several times before but had no idea that it is a museum. So when I saw people getting off the bus, I decided to do likewise. The short walk across the bridge, was rather pleasant.",

          "This museum/castle is fascinating and has great views of the Vatican district. Packed with history it also has this super neat cafe close to the top for a quiet coffee. There are lots and lots of stairs so take it slow if you have mobility issues. Weather not so good on our",
          "We fell upon this attraction walking back from Colosseum. Don't pass it by, we were there about 4pm ish perfect time as nice and quiet and in time for a free guided tour into some of the smaller areas of the castle. They were fascinating, there is a board detailing these guided",
          "If anything, the view from the top is worth the admission. Tons of history, very interesting. I've been by this castle many times and never visited, the time spent was well worth it.",
          "Ok we were not going to go inside. We thought is ok. Well extremely happy we took the time. Fantastic history !!! Absolutely brilliant cafe up top with views to die for of Rome & Vatican !!!! You won\u2019t be disappointed. Late afternoon for the sunset, almost no crowd !!! ;)",

There are a few steep steps on your way up, otherwise it\u2019s a pleasant walk! Go during sunset!!! Absolutely stunning and",
          "A beautiful museum in the heart of the city with a beautiful scenery over the water canal. Tickets are required to enter this place.",
          "By far my favourite place we visited in Rome, as it's not so popularized and overly crowded. The experience is a lot of fun and the view from the top is probably the best one we have seen.",
          "This was the first place we visited, mainly due to its proximity to our rooms. Definitely get the headphones as this is a very informative way of walking through the site. Be ready for climbing steps but the views are well worth it.",
          "For 14\u20ac entrance was worth to see this castel. On the top we see Rome from above. We enjoyed being there",
          "Not so many exhibits to see inside as expected, but still enjoyed it very much, at the end had a nice cup of coffee and a tiramisu at teh cafe, beautiful, great staff, glad I went there.",
          "It was the ancient tomb of Hadrian Emperor, during the middle ages it was converted in a castle and a prison. Lot of history and sufferance.",
          "We arrived bang on 9, though it was quiet in Rome, so earlier if possible. This castle has probably the best view of the Vatican and out into Rome from its top platform. Get in early and take some fantastic snaps across the city. We visited on a wet morning and it was still",
          "This is an such an amazing castle that\u2019s been created by a Roman emperor. As now it\u2019s an museum, we could see armour used at battle fields and their special costumes.

          "Don\u2019t miss this venue for history,architecture,best view over Rome , great little cafe with views and Michaelangelo,s sculpture of the Archangel on the top. One of favourite things to do in Rome",
          "From the outside this looks like nothing but inside you get a complete surprise. From the typical castle ramparts and entrances to almost country house splendour. A real gem and well worth a visit, entrance fee is very reasonable for how much time you can enjoy in this lovely",
          "We visited this castle because we were told the views were amazing.There were numerous steps in order to reach the top so we decided to use the lift which we had to pay extra for. There is also a nice little cafe on the parapet walk where you can get drinks and food.The views",
          "We popped to the castle after our Vatican tour. It was 14 euros each to get in. The were no queues and it\u2019s laid out so well. So much information to take in without being over burdened. You don\u2019t feel like your climbing up! There is a bar at one of the levels so we sat with a",

          "We spent a couple of hours exploring this Castel. It was great to read the history. Worth visiting if anyone is in Rome.",
          "Interesting and light on artifacts, but a cool castle and park on the river. Good view of VC and Tiber, and a nice family park below. Get the audio guide. Easy walk from the Vatican (the road to St Peters Square ends here) or to Ara Pacis.",
          "The castle has many interesting stories to tell and they have done a wonderful job keeping many of the rooms in its original condition. The castle even has a little restaurant that offers amazing view of the vatican city. I will definitely come back next time im in rome",
          "Generally, I wouldn't consider this place to be among best museums in Rome. But the spectacular view would impress you for sure!",
          "This was one of the highlights in Rome. Should get more recognition. Plus it has the best panoramic view of the city!",
          "We booked a Secret Tour in English and were bitterly disappointed . The guide spoke very poor English and was consequently impossible to understand, she was obviously bored too and clearly did not want to be there. We didn\u2019t see anything more than the general public would see (",

          "Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo is just before the Vatican on the opposite side of the river to most of the main Rome attractions. If you get time to see the Vatican then you must stop and see this. It only cost us \u20ac5 in total (a couple) - I think it should have been more,",

          "If you are English speaking don't bother with the torture of downloading the Castle App onto your smartphone. It simply lists the information found on the boards at all the points of interest within the castle. Entrance is \u20ac5. Fantastic views across the whole of Rome from the",
          "We arrived here around 10am and the queue outside was very short, waited around 5 minutes. Then payed only 5 euros to get in - such a bargain. Wandering around at our own pace and enjoyed the many different exhibits and views, especially those of St Paul's Basillica. Spent",
          "Nice views, but little else. Because of the demands for personal information, we didn't take the \"free\" wifi or tour app. But it sounded pretty fishy.",
          "We went inside based on the recommendation from family and our tour of the city, and this was definitely a great stop! The views from the top of the castle / museum were beautiful and it really lets you see a full view of Rome. It was also interesting to learn more about how the",
          "What can you say about a city that has so many beautiful places that are world famous and compare it to a castle that while Iconic, little is known about it. It is not as busy as the other world famous places. It is higher than the other world famous places and the views",
          "It is a Great place,with great views. It takes About 1,30 -2 hours to visit. It is a MUST when it comes to roman history",
          "The exhibits were disappointing. The military displays were rather dusty and moth-eaten. The little outdoor cafe looked rather pleasant and had a nice view, but we had just eaten. If you have mobility issues, this is not the place - the stairs seemed endless, but the reward",
          "The panoramic views from the top of the Castel are breath taking! It was a fortress for Popes to retreat to, place where they Papel treasury was kept and a prison for those being executed. It was in interesting tour.",
          "This is a well preserved castle that reflects all the characteristics of old Rome. It has a couple levels to see and the old armor and weapons add more flavor of the visit. The view on the top is simply breathtaking with the Vatican being a perfect photo opp. This is a",
          "Going in, one does know the basic history, but as one goes higher, the surprises get stupendous and stupendous. It's an amazing feature of architecture, a combination of ancient tomb, with ancient castle and a little more recent palazzo. Everyone should see this. The details of",
          "A great walk around the museum, a lot of information and exhibitions to look at. If you arrive between 0900-1100 it is only \u20ac5 each so it is very worth while going between these times! There are some good views to see during your walk around the museum. There is a nice bar with",
          "We didn\u2019t have this on our radar, but had time to spend. Glad we went here! Amazing views and learned a lot about the castel. No need for a tour guide. Once you arrive, you can download the app and it will narrate you through the building. Lots of steps, so wear comfy shoes.",

          "This brilliant place is one of my all time favourites in Rome. Originally built as Hadrian\u2019s mausoleum, it was then taken over by the church in the Middle Ages and turned into a fascinating fortress. You can roam about as you please, there aren\u2019t guards everywhere and now",
          "It's a huge castle, which needs a bit of walking, step climbing, and at least two hours from entry point to exit, if you are planning to climb all seven levels. There's quite a lot of history to know about, but the vantage point at the top is the best. Located just opposite the",
          "What an amazing place this is. From the ground up to the spectacular views at the top, there is much to uncover and learn about this Castle. Highlights for me included the weapons room, popes chambers and artworks.",
          "A lot of history in this building, also a lot of walking and climbing. You should ask yourself how some of the elderly popes ever manage the climb especially the Pope apartment. This building has had many purposes over the century.",
          "We visited the Castel Sant'Angelo on our recent trip to Rome. Having visited Rome originally 5 years ago and not visited we made it a point to pop here to see what we had missed. The castle itself is stunning, and in all honesty I am quite disappointed I missed it on my first",
          "Waiting in queue wasn\u2019t very long, people in ticket window were friendly. When it comes to paying for tickets, it\u2019s better to pay by card or have exact amount of money. Inside the castle are clear signs that navigate all around the building, everything was great.",
          "While the entrance fee was a little pricey - once inside, it was worth every penny. We elected not to rent audio-guides and found that the site has multiple display boards that explained in good detail what you were seeing. (A little more reading versus listening on a audio",

          "The time we pass waiting to enter and visit the Museo was worth it and our family love to visit it .",
          "A beautiful castle but almost nothing to see inside. I loved the view but wouldn't visit the castle again.",
          "On route to Vatican City we stopped to view the Castel Sant'Angelo and were not disappointed. 14 Euros each: There is a lot inside to see and the roof top views of Rome are brilliant",
          "Yet another amazing piece of Old Rome. Very interesting with lots to see and views from top level incredible. Busy but still able to move around freely and admire this piece of Rome's amazing history.",
          "Visited with my wife on a long weekend trip to the capital. Fantastic historical site with ever changing ownership. The views from the various decks were worth the climb. Not too crowded and the down loaded tour guide worked a treat so the tour was at your pace unlike other",
          "I did not have high expectations for this museum but it was nearby after seeing the vatican so we decided to explore it. Fast line and easy to tour. Not a whole lot to see but what we did see was interesting. The highlight was the view from the top. I was also happy that there",
          "The castle is removed from the Vatican, but it is connected in history. It is a fraction less traveled, and a must see attraction. Amazing views of Rome from the top!",
          "Passed this hidden treasure so many times and can\u2019t believe I missed it! The most amazing views in all of Rome- and I\u2019ve stood on the roof of the Vatican! Genuinely it was the best \u20ac14 I spent on my entire trip",
          "Castel Sant'Angelo is an extraordinary circular building that started life as a mausoleum for the Emperor Hadrian and his family. Subsequently it has been a fortress and escape tunnel for popes, a museum and for a time the tallest building in Rome. There are exhibitions of",
          "Go here early - and book your tickets early on line - have morning tea in the cafe on the second level and enjoy the view which is breathtaking and very beautiful. I will always refer to this as Hadrian's Tomb...but it has been a Papal Palace and prison in its past - the museum",
          "Expect a lot of climbing on the stairs in this fortress. There are some sculptures and old things from the age of old Rome, but what is best here is the best view in Rome. On one side to the Vatican and the Basilica of St. Peter, and on the other side to the center of Rome.",
          "A rather unique historic building in this great city. It's perfectly circular architecture makes it stand out amongst European castles. Here Mario Cavaradossi sings one of operas most beloved arias: E lucena le stelle, from Tosca.",
          "I love the castel Sant\u2019Angelo because of the peaceful atmosphere and relaxing tour. No line and tickets that you purchased online and printed out are good to go. The most I like is the cafe on the roof top with the wonderful view of the St. Peter\u2019s basilica and delicious pizza.",

          "We hoped we could see a castle while in Italy, Castel Sant' Angelo is a must see. Only 5 Euro's to get in and you can walk around as long as you like. The view from the top of the castle, you will be in awe of the breathtaking panorama of the Rome. there are a few rooms with",

          "This place is a little understated and not too many know about the history. Just walking in the castle takes your breath away. there are tourers you can join in on and they cost no extra. the views from the top of the castle are unbelievable and you can't explain it. We went in",

          "After visiting the Vatican we walked over to see this big monument. We entered to go in but as it was late we walked around to see what we could that was free. If we were to go in it was less than e15- e20 . No line It has an inner wall and an outter wall built before early in",
          "Most of Hadrian's Musoleum is now gone, but the Papal residences, installed at the time of the ~1400 sacking of Rome are interesting.",

          "We debated entering the Castel Sant\u2019Angelo because it seemed like it might be crowded and overwhelming. It was not. Although there were clearly many people visiting, the museum does an excellent job with signage that guides you along a path through the complex and keeps people",
          "So why not five stars? Unfortunately the staff were generally quite disinterested in the people paying to enter this spectacular place.

          "The secret to this wonderful place, about 2 blocks from Vatican City on the River is go early. I believe it's from 9-11 am you can get in for $5 euro rather than I think it was 14 the rest of the day. We happened to go twice, once ourselves, and the again when our son stopped",
          "If you have the chance try to get here early. It's cheaper and less crowded, plus the lighting conditions are better if you plan to take pictures from the top terrace (you get a great view of the Vatican and the Tiber). There is a lot to see inside, much more than I expected so",

          "This is a really nice place to visit. I walked past it on my first night in Rome and was amazed how it looked at night, visited it a couple of days later and really enjoyed that as well. A breath of history breezes through this building - well worth a visit.",

          "Cool experience... It's less of a museum and more of a self guided tour, but it's a pretty cool tour.  You get to go to the top, and the views are amazing!  There's an app you can download that tells you what you're seeing, and no, you don't have to sign up for their \"free\" internet to use it.",

          "I loved the visit to this castle once at the top great views of the city and the Vatican. We took time to have lunch at the caf\u00e9 great pictures seating good service. So much to absorb if you love ancient history.",

          "A very historic and iconic building from outside but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s that worth while from inside. For 5 euro it\u2019s good. But I won\u2019t recommend anything more than 10. There are many other places with view as panoramic as this.",
          "An historical and cultural place. Very impressive and interesting. To really enjoy the tour I will recommend you to read a bit about the history of the place, do give some context and enrich the experience. Please notice the opening hours.

          "WOW I said this so many times in here. I could see very historical hard works. I can't belieave that so many years ago people built such a huge building with so many details. There are so many stairs and so many place to see but don't worry there is cafe inside building and also infront of the building.",
          "Amazing architecture.. great view of Rome at the top of the castle .. just amazing ..",
          "Not really value for money. The museum inside is somewhat bare-bones. The view is great but you can sit at a caf\u00e9 terrace across the river and enjoy even better view, way cheaper.\nFrom outside the castle is amazing and well lit. Definitely worthy of a visit, especially at night.",
          "This is a must visit, especially near sunset! Great view and excellent architecture!",

          "The castle is beautiful on the outside, but go inside is a must! Originally built as the mausoleum of Hadrian, many times rebuilt by the conquerors and rulers of Rome, the castle looks like a chest with surprises that await you at every \u2026",
          "A fantastic historical monolith that sits on the bank of the the river Tiber. This is a great place to visit that gives an interesting glimpse into the history of the city. The walk to its entrance is breathtaking if you approach it coming \u2026",
          "The Structure is beautiful and I don't have the words to describe it better. The view from the terrace is amazing as one can see the Vatican and the rest of Rome. But the audio guide app for the tour isn't very handy. One might as well read what's written on the boards. I wish there was a better audio guide.",
          "This place is charming and wonderful and has a view of the whole city",
          "A magnificent historical landmark and one of the most beautiful museum in Rome. When you visit Rome, you most visit this huge castle. It's an iconic monument. It has a panoramic view to the city from its tower. The entrance is 12 euro for adults. I recommend it.",

          "We visited at night, around 21:00. The ticket is cheaper at night, but since we are students, it only costs 2\u20ac each. The castle inside is beautiful. I took us about 20 mins to get to the top, but the view is stunning, and romantic. 4\u20ac well spent.",
          "Majestic castle by the river . Nice armor museum .",
          "One of the must see places. From the top of the building is the best view on Vatican. Try to menage it just before sunset and your lady will be in heaven ;)",
          "Not to many tourists and it was an amazing castle with a lot of good history. We almost didn\u2019t go. I\u2019m glad we did. And if you can get there before 11 it is cheap.",

          "So beautiful exploring this ancient castle so Rich in history.  One of my favorite places in Rome.",
          "A really interesting place with heaps to see and learn about. The views from the top are fantastic and you can see the Vatican particularly well. Be sure to go in the morning before 11am because they have a reduced rate for early entry and also to avoid the inevitable crowds.",

          "From inside the Castle to the view it's all amazing.",

          "Amazing 180 degree views. Super interesting! It's like they have just moved out. You can imagine them running up and down the stairs.  Its like a crazy stair painting, with tombs and beautiful mosaics. Statues, stairwells, amazing paintings \u2026",
          "Beautiful castle from outside, beautiful street musics along the riverside. They have a lot of mini markets along the road if you\u2019re looking to get souvenir. I have flight at 6pm, and this place is near the airport direct bus 6\u20ac.",
          "Such interesting history in this castle! Great walk around the old battlements, you can see for miles at the top too",
          "The woman at entrance is absolutely disgusting. We couldn't find the way out after visit and asked her for help. She was so rude and ugly that she has ruined our impression of Rome. I hope she was an exception of Italians who I think are genenerally helpful.",
          "Great piece of history. Nice to stop in on a rainy day and not too expensive. At least an hour of exploring.\n\nThe pope used this place as a strong hold to escape while Rome was under siege.",
          "The coolest castle ever! With a rich history beginning as a gravesite shortly after the life of Christ time. A real catapult on display was my highlight.",
          "There's no words to describe the beauty of this place",

          "CASTLE: It's sectioned to be a museum. Also an audio guided tour if you want to have a more thorough experience. The castle is a bit dark so make sure you watch your step since there are a lot of steps as you're ascending to the roof.",
          "It's a Mausoleum, palace and prison dated back to first century BC. Hadrian made it as a mausoleum for himself. Later it became a fortress to guard Pop and it was used as prison in a period too. Now it's a museum.\nIt's architecture is \u2026",

I'll never forget your kindness\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",

          "Great view over Rome! Worth the time and money!",
          "Nice history of the castle's uses thru the ages. Decent views of the city although I personally preferred those from St. Peter's basilica (do the dome climb). The closing hour should be listed as 6:30pm as that's the end of when they let people in. You probably only need 1.5hrs here. A bit on the pricey end imo.",
          "Unique beautiful.... Very spiritual place",

          "The castle tour is a 100% worth it. I recommend you to go after 19:30, because you will be on the roof right on time for the sunset. The view of all Rome, at sunset is MAGICAL. The tickets from 9:00 am to 11:00 am are 7.50 euro and 15 euro after that. If you go there after 19:30 to 23:00 on Thursday to Sunday, the ticket is 7.50 euro.",

          "Very fun to explore. Amazing views from the top.",
          "The place itself is amazing, with a beautiful view. User experience is not so great though. After entering, you're supposed to download an app and register to their wifi. The problem is, neither works. The wifi is not responding, the app doesn't even load. Trying to be smart, while being useless in reality.",
          "Still one of my favorite historical attractions in Rome.",
          "Definitely loved this historical site.  Well worth the $14 entry fee with all the information and exhibits.

          "Its an amazing castle of the holy angel. Architecture of the castle are really very very beautiful.",
          "Stunning from the outside, but worth a visit inside if you've the budget for it. The mix of ancient and Renaissance architecture is impressive, and the massive internal ramp is enlightening for aspiring architects. Panoramic views from the top are great for sketching.",
          "Worth recommening, especially for the beautiful panoramic view od Rome",
          "Adorable castle, really enjoyed all the info provided. Lots of shady places to sit and draw or have a drink \nEven a little Caff\u00e8 inside which looked so cute. \nOnly downside was some rude ticket staff, but to be expected in a tourist spot I guess.",
          "Amazing, amazing, amazing. You get to see so many places from the top of the castle but you have to pay for entry for this otherwise you can visit the place no payment required.

          "My visit to Castle was mostly okish as we did not get a chance to enter inside the castle though there was no queue but again it has 15euro as entry fee for each person. I could find it a bit expensive and would request the Vatican city tourist department to create a common ticket for all touristic attractions with reduced price.",
          "Very old castle in Rome next to the river. We went at sunset and got amazing views of the city from the top. There's a lot to see there but this is a must see if you're in Rome just for the views alone. You can see the whole city including an unbelievable view of St. Peter's basilica.",

          "My family (especially my 5 years old) enjoyed this visit.",
          "Amazing experience. But don't think you can see it fastly. It takes a lot to get through all its rooms but it is worth the time. They let you in many rooms and you can really see this place evolving through centuries",

          "Amazing castle with way less tourists than I expected, at least as interesting to me as the Vatican to be honest. I'm saying this because the Vatican is grand and spectacular, but much of it is the same style as you get used to seeing in \u2026",

          "It's definitely worth visiting! You will get the chance to see even suits of armour, guns, soldier uniforms and many more.

          "I love this place..the Cafe is so romantic.",
          "A lot of history combined in just one building. Honestly the crypt of the Emperors was the most interesting thing to see. The rest was built by different popes and are just a show of power of christianity. \n\nThe views are amazing from the roof top!\n\nNot really a site to visit with small children.",

St. Angelo castle is located on top of the hill and has a beautiful scenery. Downslope there is a Tiber river gorgeously flowing aside. Amazed views and unforgettable experience.",

          "Enjoyed walking through this place so much ! One of the highlights of my trip to Rome.",

          "Nice view from the roof",
          "Was not on our list to visit, but since there was not a line after our Vatican Tour we did.  The views of Rome from the top are absolutely amazingly breathtaking. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Very impressive 2nd century AD castle/fortress. It's one of the rare ancient buildings that is preserved so good. It has a great panoramic view over room. Except panoramic view it does`t offer to much as military museum.\n\nOffers to visit it \u2026",

          "Like many of the other reviewers I thought this place was fantastic. Lots of interesting history to absorb as well as beautiful frescoes, and amazing views of the Vatican and Rome. It's a good idea to bring some headphones as you get access \u2026",
          "I did not know that such a castle exists in Rome. As soon as I saw her, I wanted to go inside. Time options and little energy did not allow us. I'm looking forward to Rome so I can see this building inside. Nothing less, you can stop near \u2026",

          "Amazing views of Romes main landmarks",
          "Just after completing the tour of Museums, we came here. It's right in front of St Peter's Square and you can have a great view of Basilica from Castle. \n\nIt is a circular fort and castle complex that was once the tallest building in Rome. \u2026",
          "Fantastic price for students and great view from above!",
          "Much better with the tour for \u20ac10. Highlight of the tour was seeing the prisons and torture chambers, which was only for those who paid for the tour.

          "Brilliant viewpoint at the top of castel.",
          "Excellent visit with outstanding views. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "Went here spontaneously. My wife and I absolutely loved it. The voes of the Vatican and the rest of Rome were great. There is a cute Cafe at the top that you can eat and drink at with great view as well. I would definitely recommend it. The nearby streets are great for a leisurely walk without too many crowds.",
          "Must see in Rome. First Sunday in month is free of entry! Just in case",
          "Costs \u20ac14 per person to get in, and the price is totally worth it! You can easily spend an hour and a half here, as the Castel keeps rolling out in front of you! Room after room of ancient artifacts and interesting facts. There is even a fairly-priced Cafe near the top with a beautiful view of Rome while you eat.",
          "There are no enough star to review a rich in history place. Professionally talking ( I'm a wedding photographer in Rome) Castel Sant'Angelo , especially by night  is one of the most beautiful landmark of Rome where to be portrayed. The \u2026",
          "Well worth the visit. There is a free app you can use as you tour, but it has issues such as not detecting your location. There are signs along the way that are sufficient so don't bother struggling with the app. There place is fascinating with an very interesting history.",
          "A very nice view of the city. But too expensive for what it offers, especially if you compare it to the Vatican museum or Borghese gallery.",
          "Always enjoy the views from the roof of this fortress/castle that is steeped in history. Tosca fans will recognize much here. Be warned- there are many many steps and handicapped access is problematic. There is a small elevator marked for staff but if you really need help with the stairs you might want to request its use.",
          "Nice view and nice musical mood outside the castle walls. Filles with street music performers.",
          "Good place to visit. The entrance ticket is 14euros.however, you can buy the ticket for 5 euro between 9-11 am. \n\nThis place might take an 1-2 hours of your day.it has some nice art and several views to take pictures.",

          "Good place to visit and to learn a bit of history. It's couple of hours tour and I wanted to warn tourists who finished visiting the castle. Probably you will want to take brake and eat something around the area. Restaurants are aware of it \u2026",

          "So much fun to visit!",
          "Castel Sant'Angelo is right by the Vatican, so don't miss it. We went on a whim and it was amazing. 14 Euros for adults, and it can easily take a few hours to make it to the top and back. There is a cafe towards the top if you need food or drinks, but the history and sights are amazing.",
          "I have just visit Mausoleum of Hadrian (Castle Sant'Angelo) definitly worth to visit and enjoy the beauty of the tenth century. You'll have an amazing view when you'll reach the top of the Castle",

I definitely recommend it. Great for photographers during sunset. We also had coffee and pastries on the mid level restaurant.",
          "Very nicely preserved castle and it's a wonder that something like this exists in the heart of a big metropolitan city. Definitely worth going, just for the views. You can even use your Roma Pass to get an entry here.",

          "Magnificent castle build on ancient Rome mausoleum. Where are buried several Roman emperors. Lately it is rebuild into the Papal fortress",
          "Aside from the historical element, the story behind it is awesome. If you book online in advance you get a guided tour for free and it gives you access to areas not available to the public. The tunnel from the Vatican to the castle is under renovation, so you can't see that, though. Even my grumpy children loved it.",

          "A truly one of a kid tour. The Necropolis was where Christians buried their own before Roman rulers converted and actually persecuted the Christians. Apostle Peters bones are here where they guide claims thee is a 95 % chance they are his. Truly a amazing site whether you are a",

          "Vatican City tends to be very crowded with long lines for entry into St. Peters Basilica and its cupola or the Vatican Museums. So, the tour of Vatican Necropolis is unique in that only 12 people are allowed on each tour. And, there are no lines. Given the limited",
          "You will need to book this in advance, and probably way in advance during peak season. Really interesting to see the pagan ruins and hear the history behind the basilica above your head. Our guide was very informative and spoke good English. The only issue was it was a cold day",

          "Amazing tour of a place not many people get to, underneath St Paul\u2019s Basilica. Well worth the effort of finding the website, the rather well hidden entrance (ask the lovely Swiss Guards and not the grumpy Italian Police) and braving the underground humidity. A fascinating place",
          "This is by far the most awe inspiring place I\u2019ve seen. Not for the claustrophobic, and if you are tall, duck! Book tickets way in advance online and go see it!",
          "Though we have been to Vatican City before this is the first time we were honoured to receive a confirmation for the Scavi Tour. It was an amazing tour and we both found ourselves emotional and overpowering at different parts of the tour. Also, read \"The Fisherman's Tomb\" before",

          "I really enjoyed this tour. Booked it in May fpr a September tour. You must email the scavi office directly. Its very good value. You see the part of the Vatican UNDER the crypts where the pope's tombs are (other tours bring you there ). It is the most ancient part. You can see",
          "At the end of this brief tour is the tomb of St Peter and although it is behind glass it is still worth a peek just to be close to such an Holy sight. There is a secret tour available to groups of 12 run by the Vatican but you will have to research this and contact the Vatican",
          "I was nearly put off this tour by some of the reviews saying it was claustrophobic. I'm 5 foot 7 and didn't have to crouch down to get through any of the doorways, I just walked normally throughout. There is a corridor right at the beginning that is dark and would be",
          "I had read a book on the archaeological excavations under St Peters and knew what to expect, but none the less, I was profoundly moved by this tour and learnt a great deal. It's not recommended for people who suffer from claustrophobia: the spaces are tight and there are stairs",

          "We saw this for the 2nd time this year and were liked it even more the 2nd time. Our guide this time was much better. She explained things very well and had some diagrams and pictures to help us understand things better. I would highly recommend this tour, especially, if",
          "Located just beneath St. Peter's Basilica, the Vatican Necropolis is a must visit for first time visitor to Vatican City. It's fascinating and rich in history. You will be able to learn a lot from the angle of archaeology. The queue can be daunting but definitely worth the wait.",
          "Although in the Vatican, this tour includes pre-christian Roman history. Fascinating and the tour guide was an archeologist who had a good presentation and welcomed all questions. At the end of the tour you will come up by the entrance to the Vatican and so can skip that line if",
          "When visiting Saint peters basilica come be sure to allow the little extra time to visit the Necropolis.",
          "Get there early for no line up. The entrance is a bit tricky and truth be told, we found it by accident before there was a line up at 11:00 a.m. The tranquility you feel going down there is surreal. Nothing you might expect.",
          "A very holy and central part of a pilgrimage to Rome. The Clementine chapel is a place of great peace and serenity. At all costs this must be preserved - so visitor numbers are restricted and people must respect the place. I was privileged to visit early in the morning and take",
          "Very glad we did this tour \u2013 an unusual way to go under the Vatican to see the old early Christian crypts and in particular the one alleged to be that of Saint Peter. The guide, while somewhat difficult to understand, was friendly and knowledgeable. Be prepared for the humidity",

          "It was without doubt the most amazing experience and tour I\u2019ve ever done. I felt very privileged to be allowed on this tour & to walk in a place where the citizens walked in the 1st Century. To witness the Beauty & architecture of the mausoleums was very humbling & to see the",

          "We finally got a reservation to tour the Vatican Necropolis on our third visit to Rome, previous attempts on other trip were met with no openings. Well, the wait was worth it getting the reservations and fortunately we were on the first tour of the day. Did not realize how old",
          "Because of the tight spaces there is a limited number of tourists allowed per tour. The tour costs 13\u20ac per person (only above 15 years permitted) and needs to be booked a few months in advance. But it's totally worth it! Amazing history and unique experience! Among the tombs",

          "The Necropolis is the highest on my list of must see sights in Rome. It does not matter if you are a staunch Catholic, history lover or just want an experience, this place defines history. As has previously been said, book in advance. Yes it is small, but I am 6ft tall and I did",
          "The advice to book this tour as early as possible is correct. It is worth every minute. It must be booked through the Excavations (Scavi) office of St. Peters. When we booked the tour, we asked if they would assign us to a specific time period for a tour and they were happy to",

          "A tour that needs booking months in advance BUT so worth the visit. Learning the history of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and what lies underneath will open your eyes to the way Romans were back in the day. Unfortunately only 200 people are allowed a day to visit due to oxygen and other",
          "I enjoyed the tour overall. Wear Comfortable shoes, it\u2019s a lot of walking. If you are claustrophobic, then going to this tour may not be for you. A lot of the exhibits are in tight spaces and humid. The tour guide was knowledgeable but very moody. If you asked her questions",

          "We were able to obtain tickets by reserving them 6 months in advance at the Scavi website. It is an amazing tour that shows the 4 layers of the Basilica and the small areas of remains believed to be St. Peter. It is a high humidity environment to help preserve the early grave",

          "We booked our tickets about ten months in advance, so nice of Vatican to have our money early. The fact they found another city under the Vatican is amazing but the main event of viewing Saint Peter's remains was really difficult to view at all. Also if you are uncomfortable",
          "I had been to the Vatican before but hadn't taken this tour. It is well worth it. Our guide was really interesting. It is more about archaeology than religious stuff. Really good.",

          "Going down to the Roman Necropolis was definitely the highlight of my trip to the Vatican City. Only 225 people are allowed down here everyday so you need to email the Vatican to get permission for a particular date and time and be able to buy your tickets online. I emailed them",
          "We heard about this truly unique opportunity, so decided to take it and were not disappointed! It consisted of an intimate group of up to 12 people, age 16+ years. A guided tour takes you underneath the Vatican Basilica at the tomb of the Apostle Peter. Karen was our English",

          "We had a brilliant young American tourguide who led us on the 1.5hr guide in the Necropolis beneath St. Peter's Basilica. The ruins are incredible and the history behind it even more fascinating. Would definitely recommend anyone in Vatican city to do this tour, but you've to",

          "The Vatican bronze pinecone is an ancient bronze sculpture located at one of the courtyards of the Vatican.",
          "This is a highly visible object- about 12-14 feet in dimension- that occupies and important place on a courtyard at the Vatican. It is very interesting and our tour guide spoke about it. I cannot remember all of what she said about it, except I think it was originally located",
          "The pinecone is distinctive and looks out of place at the Vatican Museum. But everyone points it out so it is an object to discuss.",
          "Our tour guide took us to this. Can't real say much about it though. I guess I just don't see the history with it?",
          "We bought an early morning (6:45 am) tour that included breakfast here, which was very nice; a large buffet, good food and attentive service. Would highly recommend this tour; we got into the museums before the general public was admitted and it was well worth the money not to",
          "This formed part of our tour of the Vatican. The Fontana della Pigna or simply Pigna(The Pinecone) is a famous Roman fountain which now decorates a vast niche in the wall of the Vatican facing the Contile della Pigna. Well worth seeing.",
          "Once inside the Vatican Museum this one of the 1st things you see & it\u2019s odd & massive. You can read it\u2019s History on nearby signs & make your own mind up.",

          "Public courtyard where visitors can stop during the beginning of the museum tour. There is a modern mirror like spherical sculpture in the center of this classic courtyard. There is also a nicely carved fountain that helps to soothes the mind before entering the museums. Won't",

          "This area, plus many more points all part of the City Wonders Tour of the Vatican. Very worth the time and I highly recommend CWT. The guide was so knowledgeable.",
          "This courtyard is a sea of green surrounded by buildings of the Vatican. It is named for the enormous bronze pinecone that dates from the 2nd century. Besides the large pinecone, you will also find here the Sphere within a Sphere; this sculpture by Pomodoro is the same size as",
          "You will find this big Pine Cone at the Pine Cone Courtyard in the Vatican. The 13 foot-high bronze fir cone was discovered in the Baths of Agrippa and dates back to 1 BC..",
          "Do take a tour of the Vatican and its wonderful gardens and sculptures. The Cortille della Pigna is huge and so beautifully detailed. One of the many marvels of the Vatican.",
          "The cortile of the pinecone (pigna) is located inside the Vatican museums, and you'll see it when you walk along the designated route. It's OK to step outside for a bit of fresh air - lots of space and the crowds are not too bad.",
          "From the large courtyard you could over look part of the city of Roma. The sculpture are very very old and from other parts of the world. Was amazed what they could build is the early century BC and AD.",
          "Our guide did a nice job during her talk in the courtyard - I liked the pinecone. Much more comfortable place to talk - not as crowded as the museums and chapel.",
          "Probably an item easily ignored but our guide gave us a brief history of this which brought it alive in the context of its surroundings!",
          "Giant bronze acorn located within the Vatican Museums which you will undoubtedly see during your tour of same. I didnt find it hugely interesting or appealing but thats just me.",
          "Walking through the Museo Pio Clementino you find a courtyard, called the \"Cortile della Pigna\". Beyond is the main entrance of its library and the entrance to the Secret Archives of the Vatican. The entire courtyard is the roof of the Archives, which, as of safety reasons can",
          "Nice bit of history, our guide was wonderful at explaining the significance of the pinecone (fertility symbol). While we were visiting restoration was underway - interesting to witness someone taking a hammer and chisel to the side of such a historic building.",
          "We had special after hour tickets to a Cocktail Party in the Pine Cone Courtyard. It was an amazing experience to enjoy the Vatican after hours with live music, a very nice buffet and open bar. The courtyard was aglow in soft lights and we enjoyed the experience.",
          "Vatican just collected artifacts through time, move them from here to there. This has to be in Rome in a public place not enforced to a place accompanied by some other reproduced and or stolen artifacts from here and there.",
          "We ate breakfast in the Pine Cone Courtyard with early entry to the Vatican. If it had not been named the Pine Cone Courtyard, it would have been easy to miss the Pine Cone. Need to read up on the art objects beforehead to maximize your visit.",
          "This sculpture can be found in the gardens of the Vatican museums. This area is called the courtyard of the papal palaces. The name comes from the huge pinecone. Beneath the pinecone are some interesting fountains.",
          "While not overly impressive, the bronze sculpture likely dates back to the 1st or 2nd century AD if not before. Flanked by two large bronze peacocks, the real eye catching part of this display, the giant niche behind the sculpture, was covered with tarps during our visit.",
          "Ok, so a huge pine cone fountain, relocated so it no longer works; replica peacocks and the building behind it under renovation. You'll likely see it... but not really that amazing.",

          "Even though the courtyard can be crowded there is plenty of room for all, not like the Vatican Museums. There is plenty to see and it is great to wander at leisure, instead of feeling part of the herd. The courtyard was once part of a larger area named Belvedere, designed by"

          "Oh my goodness, where to start.. Totally preserved and complete. The beautiful dome, gorgeous marble from around the world and Raphael's burial place. This place left me speechless. Now on street level but excavations around will show you (part of) the previous level - what more",
          "One of the most astonishing place in the world. The dome of the Pantheon is one of the wonders of buildings of all time. You are immerse into the atmoshere 2000 thousands of years. You are immersed in the atmosphere of 2000 years ago",

          "Knowing the Pantheon is so ancient is pretty much all it has going for it, in my opinion. Otherwise I\u2019ve never found it to be that interesting of a place. It\u2019s cool to know that people were able to construct such a large and high dome so long ago, and it\u2019s changed religious",

          "The Pantheon is a marvelous example of how structures are continuously repurposed throughout history. The Pantheon was a former Roman temple, now a church, but on the site of an even earlier temple. It\u2019s a spectacular sight from both inside and outside and truly embodies its",

          "This is a large historic building, but you can see everything inside in about 30 minutes. The biggest draw for me was the architecture of the building and dome. Also that Raphael is buried here. I spent as much time outside the building as I did inside. It's worth stopping by on",
          "We visited this in the evening. Takes about 15 mins or so to take in the building. It was free entrance. The dome is massive and is the largest non reinforced concrete dome in the world. There are holes on the floor for water that may come through the opening in the dome. Must",

          "Another amazing sight in Rome. It's amazing this structure has survived 2000 years. Entry is free and we recommend you go as early as possible as it fills up with tourists as the day goes on. An early visit allows you to get outside photos without hoards of people filling",

          "The Pantheon is magnificent but the lines and crowds are ridiculous. There are far too many street vendors selling cheap rubbish. There are also scammers trying to slap \u201cfriendship bracelets\u201d on your wrist. Although we enjoyed the Pantheon, the whole experience is overshadowed",

          "I did not expect such a wonderful structure. We knew we were close but we stumbled across one of the oldest structures in Rome just by accident and we were mesmerized. It remains my favourite overall in Rome. The inside takes your breath away \ud83d\ude0c",
          "I just loved Pantheon. It is so amazing to listen to its history and admire it from a distance as well as admire it from inside. It continues to be one of my favourite places in Rome (more than Colosseum)",

          "The dome of the building was extremely high, but there was not much depth from the door to pulpit, but as with most older European churches, it still had quite ornate decor. Our guide stayed that the dome atop the Pantheon was the model for other domes on buildings in Rome.",
          "If you can't make it to the Vatican, this was a great second choice for us. Very spiritual experience to be in this building celebrating Christmas Eve mass",

          "After seeing so many ruins today at the Coluseum, it is hard to believe this is almost 2000 years old. It doesn\u2019t have the beautiful ceiling art of other churches but still has stunning architecture and is worth seeing.",
          "Was part of a walking tour and learned a lot of interesting facts. The piazza was crowded in front of the building",

          "I can\u2019t imagine traveling to Rome and not seeing the Pantheon. We stopped in - it\u2019s free - and walked around for 15-20 minutes. 2000 years old and now a church. Beautiful.",

          "The Pantheon is always one of my first stops when in the Eternal City. An ancient temple, still standing from millenia ago, the Pantheon is a testament to the brilliance of the design as well as a living, breathing journey through the ages of Roman history. It's well-preserved",
          "On our visit to Rome we visited The Pantheon. As you walk into the square from the narrow side streets you are welcomed by this huge church with marble pillars to the entrance & enormous domed roof. Once inside your eyes drawn to the huge dome with its open oculus & the sun",
          "If you do the walkabout tour this should be on the list, if you miss it on a tour go on your own, it's a circular church with a domed roof, its standout talking point is the huge skylight in the top of the dome....no glass, open to the elements. Snow, rain, cold, glorious",

          "We visited in late November, so was reasonably quiet. This is a fantastic, historical building with plenty of notices and signs explaining what the various artefacts were. About 10 to 45 minutes viewing depending on how interested you are in history.",
          "We didn't expect to go inside but were walking around Piazza Navona and decided to check it out, quite a large line before it opens, but we got a spot and were quickly inside once it had opened. Beautiful church, particularly the ceiling and different altars.",
          "This monument never disappoints! Even full of people it is peaceful! So much history bound up in one building - to stand where an emperor once stood is not easily forgotten!",

          "Would recommend guided tours, they explain so much more about the place which makes it more interesting and gives you a better understanding of what you are looking at and the history of the place rather than it just becoming another church to visit. Very lively outside in the",
          "The dome is a wonder, impressive in its magnitude even with today\u2019s engineering and construction. No wonder Michelangelo came to study it!",
          "It\u2019s just like stepping back in time to the imperial age of the Roman empire. This building is magnificent and should not be missed if you come to Rome.",
          "We walked through it viewing the various walls and their statues and inscriptions Wasn't crowded so it was an easy walk",
          "The fact that the dome was built of concretes coufers over 2000 yeras ago is amazing. the building itself is roman clay bricks, so all in all the people who built it originally without cranes were incredibly gifted.",

          "When you goto Rome the list of things to see and do is huge. Ours was about a page of A4 and we had three days. A friend had visited the Pantheon a week earlier when Celtic had played and the pictures looked amazing. Like alot of Rome's wonders the pictures didn't do the",

          "We listened to Rick Steves' tour. Recommend downloading it before you go. There was a passing squall while we were inside. So cool to watch it rain in. Apparently, it's slightly slanted from the middle out so when it rains, all the water (if there's a lot of it) runs to the",
          "Free admission and plenty to see, Guards keep everything running smoothly. Lots of tourists here, but worth a look.",

          "An amazing piece of architecture that has withstood the test of time and religious change. The art works inside are amazing and well preserved. The Occulus is a wonder to see and experience during the day as the sun shines down and hits the sundial above the entrance. A tour or",
          "The Pantheon is a remarkable feat of ancient architecture and construction, but is not terribly interesting. I found nearby churches much more so.",
          "Amazing that these strictures were built so many centuries ago. I was fascinated by the opening in the ceiling (and the fact that they built drainage!)",
          "Our hotel was just down the road so we were able to visit the Pantheon a number of times when it was least busy. An amazing place with a unique atmosphere that has stood the test of time. This is a MUST DO in Rome, you will not be disappointed.",
          "Amazing place and crowded as expected. Serene atmosphere and the highlight is definitely Raphael's tomb. Gave me goosebumps just seeing it there!",
          "Simple by comparison to other attractions in Rome but a must see for its design and amazing ceiling structure. Added bonus of free entry and very little queueing",

          "with a map in hand we followed the streets in Rome and ended up at the pantheon. was free to enter and no long line. took some nice pictures inside. worth the walk",
          "The hole in the domed ceiling open to the air was fascinating as was the artistry in the place. Nothing like it.",

          "I missed this on my last visit its a must, how a building could be built like this is amazing, it can get busy but its free to go in to",
          "The dome really is a wonder. Despite everything you've learned about how it was constructed you still can't quite believe the scale of the dome even when you're standing inside. A pity the monotheists came along and despoiled it. And it really is true that there is a gentle",
          "We walked to the Pantheon in the afternoon as we stayed quite near. It\u2019s free to enter. The history of the building is very interesting it\u2019s an ancient Roman monument to the Gods. It\u2019s incredible that the oculus leaves all the artwork inside open to the elements! Houses",
          "We planned our 4 day trip but got to see so much more than we planned this building is so beautiful and definatley worth the visit",

          "Great piece of Roman history. Very worthwhile when in Rome. Make sure you go inside, it's free. It is much bigger than we expected.",
          "A trip to Rome is not complete without a visit to the Pantheon. It\u2019s survival probably comes down to the fact that it became a an early Christian church. The day we visited was Italian Remembrance Day and a military band turned up to play outside, two Italian kings are buried",
          "The Pantheon is truly breathtaking and I could have stayed for hours. We sat down for a while to just take in the awesomeness and feel of the place. You can just walk in, no need for tickets unless you want the history. I would thoroughly recommend \ud83d\ude0d",
          "A house with a hole in the roof you might say. I say no queues and no need to pay is a dealbreaker in Rome. A remarkable piece of history this is, considered the building is 2 000 years old. Looking impressive from the outside, the oculus, the hole in the ceiling is what",
          "If you have the time, stop by the Pantheon. It really is a sight to see! It isn't huge though, and won't take more than 30 to 45 minutes to see it. I was really impressed at how well preserved it was, and its beauty.",
          "They have added lights since the last time I was there so you can imagine how long it's been..... But well worth a second visit .",
          "Very nice scenery. A great experience. A down side is all the sellers that come up to you and ask you for your information. Military and police walk around regularly but don\u2019t really do anything.",
          "We popped in for a visit twice while walking past on other tours. The Pantheon is simply stunning and amazingly, admission is free. Highly recommended!",
          "A temple dedicated to the history of Rome. Something you have to see in any case. In the heart of Piazza navona",
          "Visited the Pantheon while we were on tour. It was so amazing inside. Full of history statues/monuments,tombes, frescoes. What was so impressive was at the very top of the church was a hole where water would drip through onto this amazing tiled floor. Such a beautiful icon. A",
          "Truly a magnificent structure. It is still free, and it still amazes me how they were able to so accurately position the hole dead center in the the top of the dome. Obviously a must see while in Rome.",
          "My favourite structure on this plant to date. Over 2000 years old built in the Roman Empire for a pagan temple. You need to see this world marvel.",

          "I love this building. have been to Rome five times and still love to come there and just take it all in. The Pantheon is a marvel of engineering. Although built around AD124, it still holds the record as the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world. The interior is all",
          "The outside and inside of the pantheon is just amazing. The detail that has gone into it was just unreal. Definitely worth the time to visit if you can.",
          "We arrived here at twilight so it was hard to see all the sights but this is a beautiful place and one we would like to return to. Even better...no lines and it was free!",

          "This is one of the most wonderful architectural sights in Italy. There is nothing like it. If in Rome it is an absolute must, and you don\u2019t have to stay long to appreciate it, and it\u2019s free!!",
          "Really made the trip for me to wander in [free] on a humid day. It can be crowded and now a church, postcards contain quotes from Mother Teresa, but an amazingly beautiful structure. Make sure you take a walk around the exterior to see the ancient brickwork and marble remains.",
          "I can\u2019t put into words how beautiful this building is, it just takes your breath away. This was my favourite attraction in Rome.",
          "I was amazed at beauty of this magnificent historical structure. The audio was good but I would lose myself in all of the figures and monuments that I would have to rewind. This is a must see when in Rome.",
          "We stumbled across it by accident, it was pretty cool but something you cam walk by it and see it without needing to really stop",
          "One of the free entry attractions in Rome, just join the queue, Wasn't worried about doing an Audio Tour, wait time 5-7 mins, quite busy but comfortable. Definitely a must see in Rome, beautiful piece of history,",
          "Top of the must do things when visiting Rome! This ancient roman temple , converted church is a stunning piece of engineering and stands beautiful in all its glory after 2000 years. You should take time inside appreciating it\u2019s true splendour and the fabulously designed ceiling",
          "If you don\u2019t have a tour guide that talks about this, download the Rick Steve\u2019s app. He has a 30 min episode just on the Pantheon. We were there in November. For nearly empty pictures, go during the week and when it\u2019s misting rain. You\u2019ll have it all to yourselves.",
          "After seeing so many beautiful uncrowded churches the pantheon seemed crowded and unimpressive. My wife thought it was great. She is more interested in the history and architecture than me.",
          "Not to be missed when you visit Rome. Free entry here. To step into a two thousand year old Roman temple so well preserved is very special.",
          "still standing and in use. Marvelous dome with open air oculus. Truly an engineering marvel and inspirational space.",
          "The Pantheon, among many other building, was on our bucket list to see. The incredible engineering gives us the most preserved building of ancient Rome. Built between 113-125AD, it is awe inspiring as you enter and look up to the dome. It is the biggest brick dome in",
          "Basically you are paying for the audio explanation, the entrance to the place is free, so unless you are very interested with the architecture it is not worthy.",
          "One of my favourite memories from Rome is walking through the alleys of the city then turning the corner to see the great Pantheon sitting in front of you, coming almost out of nowhere. It is just so impressive to see. Take a moment to sit back and take it in, and think about",

The engineering in that time is unbelievable and technology of the concrete to support this massive dome was mind blowing for sure.",

          "Does a building standing for almost 2000 years need a review? People must obviously think there is something to it considering the amount of them surrounding and within its walls. It was converted to a Church so those that do not feel comfortable in such a building should just appreciate from the outside.",

          "I was here in here September and the line look crazy it was extremely long and all around where is located the place is the heart of a very busy area in Rome where there\u2019s a lot of tourists. The next day I gave it a try because someone told \u2026",
          "Absolutely beautiful. The Pantheon is a huge church essentially. One of the best things is the giant hole in the center of the buildings' domed roof. You can literally see straight up to the sky. The building was designed with this in mind \u2026",
          "When you visit this Basilica, remember that this spectacular architectural masterpiece was originally a space for worshipping the pantheon of early Roman (Etruscan) goddesses and gods, and try to feel beyond the Roman Catholic overlays and \u2026",
          "Pantheon is an amazing place. From its architectural design to its engineering build. From its historical beginning to its present use.  Another must visit for any visitor to Rome.  (I'd  rate this place much higher than the sistime chapel!)",
          "From Inside its so beautiful. And very impressive how they built it 2000 years ago.\nOur guide tour told us it's the first dome building in the world...",
          "Incredible architecture, just enter and feast your eyes with the beautiful resting place of the king of Italy which unified Italy. Best part of all, it is free.",
          "So much to say about this place, but it's a highlight for us of Rome and special because of its use over time as a place of worship.  Beautiful architecture!  Does not take long to see and it's free.",
          "Among the many iconic locations in Rome,  I find the Pantheon a particularly special place. The hole in the ancient dome is fascinating and the ceiling decoration has a gentle geometric beauty. Around the circular walls are altar-like \u2026",
          "The history of the Pantheon is impressive enough but, seeing the building is a whole other level of wonder. It is a must-do in Rome and you can easily spend a long time reading in the Pantheon as well as gazing into the big hole in the ceiling! Amazing to see the hole fill with water on a rainy day.",
          "If you come to Rome you HAVE TO visit this place. It's iconic. Recommended for it's history and interesting past.",
          "I always love to go there and actually study my Italian sitting on one of the benches they have inside.  I also like to go during the rain.  Even though there is a large hole in the ceiling.  It was built like that.  Love the Italian designs.",
          "Worth visiting monument. Rich decoration inside with noumerous pieces of art. Architecture identical to Rotonda of Thessaloniki, Greece. Both very rare round buildings.",
          "A very historical place - here you can see really well how Christianity conquers things and overtakes other religions. It's really sad since I wanted to take a look at the original pantheon with the roman gods inside and not Maria and \u2026",
          "Pantheon is one of the best monument to visit in Rome. It is completly free! An advise, read the story of the monument (also online) and you can learn a lot of little things that helps to enjoy the Pantheon more.",
          "Panthenon is part of the art and history. Every corner it is wowm you must visit this place.",
          "Awesome spot! Picture couldn\u2019t describe the spatial effect of the dome. And also it\u2019s the place with the great artist Raphael\u2019s tomb.",
          "The biggest dome ever built by men and that, without the use of modern technologies. The Roman intelligence is again here at its best and the surroundings also with fortune tellers all around. All those elements which make the pantheon a \u2026",
          "It's immense and imposing. You can have breakfast in the Piazza in front of it. You can touch the pillars. It's easy to access.",
          "Place of a cult for ancient Roman gods. Incredible sight inside and outside. Must see for everyone in love with Roman Empire.",
          "Probably one of the oldest man made monuments I have been to. The doorway itself mesmerizes you and shows you the importance of this building back in the day. Inside it's great to see so much of preserved artwork that's still intact. The \u2026",
          "The Pantheon is another great architectural landmark in Rome that\u2019s worth a visit. You can go inside, but there\u2019s also a great square immediately outside the building that is great for photos, as well as a number of restaurants and coffee shops to hang out in.",
          "Pantheon is one of the best-preserved monuments of ancient Rome. An architectural masterpiece. Definitely a place you should visit when in Rome...and allow yourself enough time to appreciate and take in. Best to visit early in the day, on weekdays, to avoid the crowds.",
          "The only complete ancient building in Rome. It is free to visit though we ended up paying a guide 20 Euros to tell us more about it which was worth it considering that there is no information displayed within the building. Touts outside \u2026",
          "An interesting building, amazing to believe such a large dome has survived since the Roman era. I would have loved to see it when it was still a Roman temple, before the Roman idols were removed and the Christian stuff was all added.",
          "Truly memorable visit. Drinking in 18 degrees in Feb watching the world go by! Pantheon is stunning inside.",
          "Incrediblly preserved and full of super interesting historic stories. Free to enter. Must be seen while you're in Rome. There's no excuse as it's in the middle of everything!",
          "An architectural marvel. One of the few good examples of the genius of Roman engineering. A must see.",
          "Amazing how this still stands. Worth visiting. Free admission. \n\nHeard a rumor that rain never comes through the hole on top. Not true. Rain comes through the hole on top as I saw it with my own eyes!",
          "Very nice temple. It was primarily a temple for several gods, built between years 118 to 128.\nThe temple was transformed in a catholic church and the original gods statues were removed, but the building itself still very well preserved - maybe the better preserved one.",
          "One of the best architecture Marvell in Rome and you should not miss this place during your trip to Rome. The church is recommended to be visited during the day time or during the late afternoon (sunny day ) when you can see the thick beam \u2026",
          "Very nice landmark, it is so amazing such a construction! Must get inside to discover its magnificent details.",
          "Absolutely wonderful place to see. Now a Christian church.\nOne of the oldest buildings in Rome dating back to the Emperor Hadrian and beyond. The first building in the world to have a dome, awesome! Inside the floor is original and very \u2026",
          "Totally amazing. Go at night if you can. I believe the doors close at 8pm during the week. The restaurants around it with outdoor seating are all just OK but the view is amazing to sit there and look at the Pantheon as you drink some wine and relax. Get an outdoor table and enjoy.",
          "This Roman temple is a true marvel and even though it can be crowded never seizes to amaze me, the building has a kind of magic atmosphere that you is really beautiful, the only downside is that it's currently a church which takes away from \u2026",
          "Amazing architecture and history. The dome was breathtaking. It would have been awesome to see how the lights work but we weren't fortunate to be at the right time",
          "Definitely recommend getting the voice tour so you can truly appreciate the history of the place!  Without it you might just think this is a cool old building.  It\u2019s much more than that!",
          "A very beautiful monument still standing. It is a marvel of architecture. I would recommend to search and view a documentary prior visiting... Astonishing",
          "Touring the Pantheon was a wonderful experience I cannot say that a tour guide was absolutely needed for the tour but we were fortunate enough to have a wonderful guide  who provided specific historical details and pointed out facts that we \u2026",
          "Wow. I mean wow. Walking through Rome after viewing the Trevi Fountain, my son and I were looking in shops and enjoying the atmosphere. We both knew the Pantheon was a place we wanted to view. We turn a corner and there it was, a truly \u2026",
          "Absolutely awesome inspiring,  the artwork is a sight to see. How they constructed wonderful structures almost 2000 years ago, AMAZING!!! A must visit venue when you're in Roma",
          "Definitely worth a visit since it\u2019s free anyway. Best to get an audio guide online to understand its significance.",
          "Amazing place, do not miss a chance to visit it, and do not miss a chance to go inside. You will be able to see how magnificent it is when you go inside, look up and you'll see how huge it is.",
          "I always stop by during my visits to Rome because I love it.  Check out the Piazza Navona and St. Ivo's Church (only open Sunday mornings now-look up the times) nearby.  There are lots of people in this old Roman part of town.",
          "Iconic landmark in Rome. Surprisingly open to public for free and no long lines. Personally see and feel ancient ruins. Humbling, impressive, grandious. In walking distance from fountains.",
          "Free to enter and lovely to look around. Such a beautifully preserved building. It is useful to have a guide. I downloaded (for free)  Rick Steves Audio Europe. before we traveled to Rome and he has a tour of the Pantheon, which I would recommend. It was busy but we didn't queue for long. Visited mid October.",

          "Divine experience, simply magnificent space with a rich history.",
          "The Parthenon is amazing.  It's an absolutely beautiful building and learning about its history is fascinating.  If you're planning a trip to Rome, make it a point to check out this historical site.",
          "Come here early in the morning before the visiting has opened and you'll be in for a treat. Take a photo with barely anyone else in frame, dine at the cafes out front with a picturesque view. Interesting to learn about the drainage system they have in place when it rains",
          "Out of all the sights to see in Rome this one I found was the most spectacular. The size inside is beyond what you imagine looking at it from outside. Area surrounding this is also very cute and there is a nice restaurant me and my \u2026",
          "Also a must see one of my personal favourite places in the world chilled cool and pretty nice cafes around it!",
          "A beautiful large Roman building,  a surprisingly decorative surroundings.  Free admission,  a serene atmosphere regardless of the amount of tourists that visit. Family friendly.  Well worth a visit.",
          "A very unusual structure with a hole in the middle, makes it all the more memorable. Rain, sun, moon rays all fall freely onto the marble floor. One wishes the gods of old to whom this monument was dedicated had been left in peace... instead they were replaced by thier Christian conquerors.",
          "Beautiful!! Would highly recommend you get a tour to tell you about it otherwise your just looking at a beautiful building. \nWould recommend: Romes ultimate walking tour with Nick! (TripAdvisor) He was utterly awsome!!",
          "Finally got to see something in real life that I've either read about or seen in shows and movies. It was awesome. Highly recommend going during \"off-season\" which is when we went for our honeymoon in early November",
          "Stunning architecture from nearly 2000 years ago.",
          "Beautiful granite structure that makes up The Pantheon. Very rich in history and its great to just simply stop and take in in the surrounding area. Amazing to think about all the happenings that have gone on where you stand when you visit. #rome #wheninrome #santamaria #eternalcity #prego #pantheon",

          "Beautiful building. Grabbed a guided tour out front. \u20ac10 for a 30 minute tour. Perfect for anyone interested in history.",
          "Wow! I was thoroughly looking forward to visiting the colosseum before I landed in Rome but when I left I knew the Pantheon was the jewel in Rome\u2019s crown. What an absolutely astonishing building with such grandeur and only a mere 1900 years old!",
          "One of the best preserved ancient Roman buildings. Grave site of the artist Rafael. Looks amazing at night. Don't want to miss this one if you are in Rome.",
          "Breath taking place to visit in Rome! It's a must! The architecture and natural lighting in the Pantheon is truly amazing!",
          "I was amazed by the statues and art that had survived to be preserved to this day. Never in my lifetime did I think I'd be able to stand in the same room as millions of others had come to stand just to witness the testaments of time through these ancient works.",
          "This structure takes your breath away. Go during the day to see the inside, go back at night to see it lit up. Really spectacular.",
          "I was so excited to walk up by chance. It wasn\u2019t a goal. We were looking for places to shop and just so happened to find the Patheon. Had lunch near by.",
          "It's ok.... One room basically. But free, and the queues go quick. In a nice square surrounded by lovely cafes.",
          "A hidden gem, very unobtrusive from the outside, but wow when you get inside , defo worth a visit to this one.",
          "Stunning. If you only have time to see a few things in Rome make this No1. Beautiful. Spiritual. Awe inspiring and infused with living history",
          "Amazing history... Walked in got audio tour. Ate a great lunch across from it... Great memories with my daughter!!",
          "Amazing place. Beautiful and rich of culture, very beautiful!",
          "The earlier you can get here the better, it's a religious location so dress appropriately. Once you are inside, take a moment to enjoy the majesty!",
          "The place was packed and there was a Holy mass when we got in,  we were restricted to take photos. Outside was very lively.",
          "Omg!! Impressive, there\u2019s no words to describe this place. You see this in history books, tv documentaries, but there\u2019s no word to express how little you feel when inside. I must visit place!",
          "If you're visiting this area you need to go through this place. It can get crowded and people are enjoying every view from every angle. Take your time though, it does space out. This is one of the coolest buildings I have ever seen.",
          "I had a great time with my family, I was visiting from California and honestly the place is unbelievable, the staff is super helpful if they ask all the questions I had, the place is free and it is incredible all the atmosphere.",
          "We went back twice. Once during the day and once at night. Both times were very beautiful. Truly an architectural marvel",
          "Amazing free chruch. Is currently a church, but was a Roman temple. The wait can be long, especially in peak season (summer) so get here with plenty of time. There are lots of good restaurants and gelaterias nearby!",
          "Does history get any better?  What an awesome building.  Masterfully constructed  and still standing after centuries of use, abuse, and weather...a tribute to Romans' intelligence and ingenuity.",
          "Magnificent monument. You must visit it.",
          "Pantheon is my favorite meeting point. The name \"Pantheon\" is from the Ancient Greek \"Pantheion\" meaning \"sacred to all the gods\". It is one of the best-preserved of all ancient Roman buildings, as it has been in continuous use throughout \u2026",
          "Breathtaking!!! I took my parents there (they are in their seventies) and they loved it! Very easy to access.",
          "Impressive ancient roman architecture. Audio guide is very helpful to understand the history of the Pantheon.  Worth the visit !!",
          "A must visit. While you are in Rome. Also entrance is free. One of the most spectacular sites..   a place to reflect for few minutes.",
          "Another amazing place in Rome!  I love the name, the architecture of this huge stone building, the layout, the art work, I was in awe! Waking in here I was amazed at the tall ceiling and the overall feel of it. Not much to do here, but this \u2026",
          "This is an magnificent structure. It captures history for all to see & wonder how this structure can still stand after centuries.",
          "Awesome preserved temple built in 125 year AD. This is must visit place in Rome.",
          "Possibly one of my favourite 'tourist atteactions' in Rome. Really worth going to see, I was in absolute awe. (free entry to go in as well)",
          "Language is a good place to start and discover what your are visiting. The Greek words for pan, meaning \u201call,\u201d and theos, meaning \u201cgods.\u201d  so I just visited  a pagan temple.\n\nAccording to Roman legend, this is the place where the founder of \u2026",
          "Such wonder and beauty. I went on a Friday and was able to walk right in, on Saturday there was a line but only a small group of people went in at a time. Free to visit. A must see when in Rome.",
          "Breathtaking views from the inside and out must see. Amazing restaurants around the area very vibrant atmosphere.",
          "What a beautiful place, the architecture is magnificent and the tombs within are a MUST SEE while in Roma! Its free to go in and the volunteers get you in in a very timely matter",
          "Definitely go in and marvel at the Dome when in Rome! Victory of ancient architecture. Long line is there just to enter, so be prepared.",
          "For m e, one of \"the\" Highlights in Rome.\nDefinitely google for more informations about this Building, and u will understand, why it is so spacial!",
          "The most impressive location in Rome. Take some time to learn a bit of the engineering that went into the construction and you will enjoy it even more.",
          "The Pantheon is amazing. I manage to visit it each time I'm in Rome. There are some excellent Gelato places around nearby and the Trevi Fountain is very close as well.",
          "Must visit place. Modern day people don't know how ancient history and civilization. Great place.",
          "Absolutely beautiful structure filled with fine artwork. A must see even for repeat  visitors who notice something they missed seeing last visit. Amazing that entry is still free.",
          "This was a temple erected to honour all the gods of Old Rome. Built by August right-hand man Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in the first century CE and renovated by emperor Hadrian in the second century, it was consecrated as church and thus \u2026",
          "The Pantheon hosts numerous graves of prominent Italian political and art figures. There was a long line to enter the Pantheon but it moved pretty fast so we were able to get in in a matter of 10 minutes. The Pantheon also hosts several chapels thus it can be used as a religious worship place",
          "Such a stunning place. Originally a Pagan building converted into a Catholic Church, this has been preserved for over 2,000 years. We went right when they opened on a weekday morning and had the place practically to ourselves!",
          "I love architecture and history, there is a nice plaza before you enter where you can sit by a fountain and people watch. When you enter the pantheon it's an open space to wander and explore. You have to time it well so it's not so crowded though.",
          "Over 1800 years old!  Self guided tour would be fine.  Not much in the way of lighting aside of the awesome natural light.",
          "Awe inspiring place. Was closed for mass on Sunday. Was able to walk straight in on Monday afternoon. Just 1 large room, pretty crowded, but bags of atmosphere.",
          "Good place to know about other\u2019s architecture. Tour might take some time. Enjoy this place tour and surroundings.",
          "An architectural marvel! The oculus is breathtaking.",
          "Came in the afternoon and also at night. Both times were equally impressive. However, we did not get the chance to go inside in the afternoon because we arrived around 5pm and they had mass inside. I love the name, the architecture of this \u2026",
          "This is a definite must visit in Rome! The architecture is awe inspiring. The pillars are tremendous, and inside you can feel the gods looking down on you in judgment. Just a really cool and historic place to visit, and it's free! \ud83e\udd18",
          "Lovely building. Couldn't believe how big it was until I went! It was free to enter. You'll spend maybe 20 minutes in there as theres isn't much to look at but such a gorgeous bit of architecture",
          "This building is incredible and has aged so well. It's a testament to concrete and the engineering prowess of past civilization's.\nUnfortunately modern italy lets it down. Though free to enter (great) it has no signs about artifacts, \u2026",
          "Simply the most perfect building in the world. The structure is a couple of thousand years old and the floor is level, the walls are plomb and the rain doesn't come in through the oculus .  Have someone with modern computer support try to hang cabinets in your kitchen that well.  Read up on this place before visiting.  Outstanding.",
          "Really impressive. Fun fact: it does get wet when it rains \ud83d\ude02",
          "Awesome! Free entrance, one of the most important sights in Rome. Once you're in, you don't know where to look. Definitely a must.",
          "Huge structure hidden nicely in the middle of the city. Its a fascinating tourist attraction. You can just stand around, walk and admire its stunning beauty. Well worth the walk.",
          "The Pantheon is a phenomenal building, one of a kind and a must-see while in Italy.  I've never done a tour of Italy, and generally just like walking around inside of the Pantheon, reading signs and eaves dropping on tour guides \u2026",
          "Came in the afternoon and also at night. Both times were equally impressive. However, we did not get the chance to go inside in the afternoon because we arrived around 5pm and they had mass inside. I would recommend not visiting at that \u2026",
          "Hotel really neat, and well organized. Nice location, I enjoyed my stay there.",
          "The most surprising aspect of the architecture in the Pantheon is its measurements: the circular building has exactly the same diameter as its height: 43.5 metres. The dome, which has the same diameter, is bigger than that of St. Peter's \u2026",
          "Great place to visit and the bars surrounding make a good spot to relax and take in the views after dark",
          "Beautiful grand building, however the is not much to do aside from taking a few photos",
          "Amazing place. Come early in the morning for less crowded experience.",
          "In my opinion, it's better to visit the Pantheon during Spring time to avoid the crowds. There are little shops and local restaurants in the area. I would love to visit this place again when it's a little quieter.",
          "One of the oldest and we'll kept for its age buildings in Rome. And full of history as well. Seeing the mish mash of religions from Greek to Egyptian and then the church taking it over.",
          "Had one of the best nights of my life at one of the restaurants in front of Pantheon, singer in the square, fireworks, great food, great wine amazing and funny waiters, all with great friends.....life should always be like this.",
          "Awesome structure. The US is only a little over 200 years old. The structures of Rome and other Italian towns over 2000 . The sculptures paintings and beautiful structures are just incredible. If you have ever had a desire to visit ancient Europe it is well worth it.",
          "Beautiful, amazing architectural feature, makes you wonder about the amazingness of the previous era",
          "In my opinion, it is a little over-rated! The history behind the building is quite interesting, but it is very very crowded; and this was in December. I hear in Spring/Summer it is much busier and the weather is very hot.",
          "It took my breath away. It's soo amazing building. And it's still standing all those years.",
          "This is an evening romantic place. Sadly the police now vigorously keep people off the monuments and prevent them having a romantic night (we used to have and share a bottle of wine)  this has all been stopped due to unruly tourists",
          "Mystic, beautiful, around places also very beautiful. Best icecreem nearby",
          "Impressive, shows the history of one of the most important places, first build in the first Centauri for the Pagan Gods and now turned to the Christian religion as a temple.",
          "The symmetry of the structure is breathtaking. The oculus is an engineering mystery. Wonder how it should have looked before Pope Urban VIII removed the brass roof to make cannons which caused the saying \"what the barbarians didn\u2019t do was done by the Barberini\" (the Pope came from the Barberini family; a pun on words).",
          "Don't judge a book by it's cover. Outside looks very grey but very authentic, the inside is just amazing.",
          "Fabulous intact original Roman construction, later a church.  The dome is a wonder.",
          "One of the hallmarks of Rome. The infinite dome takes your views to heaven and gives a feeling of endlessness. It's also interesting how this ancient temple was transformed by the Catholic church into it's own domain. The sculptures and the paintings are signatures of what you expect of a Roman place of history. Amazing!",
          "Awe-inspiring masterpiece of a building! The highlight is the dome of the temple which has a circular opening at the highest point. You can spend hours inside just marveling at the architectural brilliance.",
          "Incredible ancient building, still has it's original, 2,000 year old doors.",
          "The Pantheon was great, it's free so it's crowded. Here's a tip if you're awake go there early I believe it opens at 8 or 9 and there is no on there. You can the whole place to yourself. Other than that it's full of beauty, the architect is amazing. Definitely stop there while in Rome",
          "Very impressive to visit, especially looking towards the ceiling and seeing stars in the night sky.",
          "Historical and super impressive place. I went there late night (11 pm) so I could not go inside. It was beautiful from the outside though. It sits on a square full of bars and restaurants that are open until late hours. A lot of people were sitting on the stairs by the fountain creating a nice vibe.",
          "One of the most amazing places I've been to. January is great since it is the off season for tourists.",
          "Impressive, as artistic realization and as engineering. Recommend to take audio guide, is very useful, provide many details about Pantheon history and details, legends... etc. Enjoy!",
          "Stunning! This is a must see if in the area. The light coming through the opening is fantastic, it changes all day and looks different depending on your position inside (don't forget to look up). The fountain out side looks at the front and a great place to hang out and enjoy the sights. It's free also which is always a plus!",
          "Really beautiful architecture. Free entrance. A lot of visitors, though.",
          "The entrance is free... there is a line but it was actually  pretty fast! Once in its just beautiful!",
          "It's so silent it's almost scary, but that makes it also a great place to visit. To look at it and realise that it was even more beautiful before it was plundered is unbelievable. To think that Rome was full of these temples gives you an \u2026",
          "Not much to do here, but this place is extremely beautiful and full of history. This city honestly has so many cool spots that are so significant you run out of adjectives.Another amazing place in Rome!  I love the name, the architecture of \u2026",
          "Well worth the visit. Close walk to other tourist sites and plenty of great restaurant options to choose from nearby.",
          "One of the top 10 things to see in Rome...and it is just stunning.  It is still a working Church,  so respectful behavior is a must.",
          "What a beautiful place to see first hand.  It is so easy to look up pictures and videos online or from friends, but nothing compares to seeing it in person.",
          "Amazing roof. Roman concrete no cracks. Well worth a look",
          "One of the marvels of Rome. On the right side of the church, you can find the tomb of Raffaele, the great artist. The beautiful statue of Our Lady, the Crucifix, and the stations of the cross are also very special to me..",
          "This temple has been standing for nearly two millennia, and remains amazing to experience. Pictures or videos will not do justice to the size of the dome, the intricacies of the sculpture, or the feel of the place itself. It is larger than \u2026",
          "On the outside it looks cool and interesting, it is very well kept. It's very crowded, I didn't get in because of the crowd, so if you want to come in, go in the morning. Worth a picture for Instagram.\ud83d\ude09 It's free and it doesn't take long to see it. \ud83d\ude0e",
          "Nice place but I feel over rated. Unnecessary queue. Very crowded place as it is everywhere. However once you get inside it feels good. It's near Trevi fountain, so you can visit it on your walking way.\nOverall good.",
          "Beautiful visit to the Pantheon. Would highly recommend the audio guide available for \u20ac5.50 so that you get context to what you look at. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit. Absolutely loved being in the center right under the uculas in front of the \u2026",
          "This was probably one of the best things to see in Rome. Just the idea that they built this 2000 years ago just blew my mind. Truly amazing.",
          "A true wonder of the ancient world and a Rome must see.",
          "One of the most beautiful and fascinating buildings in the world. You can enter for free.",
          "One of the ancient beauty of rome. Mesmerrising temple of ancient roman Empiror Romulus, later converted to church.\nA must visit for all history lovers.",
          "A very good piece of history to see but as most of the attraction's in Rome are now, it was very packed with tourists. Would recommend seeing it earlier in the day as I assume it would be a lot quieter but not too sure. Free entry and can finish within a few minutes",
          "The oldest concrete dome structure that never been reinforced!!!  It\u2019s a architectural and engineering masterpiece that is still standing and has been used throughout the centuries. This is a must see places in Rome and it\u2019s free !!!",
          "I thought it was beautiful and even my grandkids 7 and 6 thought it was a beautiful building.Hard to think it's  been there for 2,000 years",
          "Massive dome from two centuries ago.  Free entrance.  Delicious food and coffee nearby.",
          "As an architect I am amazed. As a person interested in history the story is very abbreviated.",
          "A definitely important experience in Rome. A free and culturally rich experience. Though you must be aware of pickpockets!",
          "One of the most brilliant architectural feats of the world. The crowds are huge but for a good reason. Dont skip the Pantheon!",
          "I want to do all pantheons so check one off the bucket list great place to visit for the spectacular architecture",
          "Really huge from inside. An amazing piece of architecture. Just go see it.",
          "Amazing ! You have to enter to see its full glory !",
          "Magnificent building of an ancient era! I am thrilled, what humans could do that would last that long!",
          "A wonderful piece of history. There is no charge and if you get there early or later in the day there is no line. Take your time it's beautiful.",
          "It's amazing to see the opening in the ceiling and how it doesn't allow for water damage inside. Admission is free and it's worth to visit but we didn't spend any more than 15 minutes here.",
          "Always amazing. The ancient Roman's were incredible engineers.",
          "What an achievement!  It\u2019s unbelievable how the early Romans used physics and architecture to create this incredible structure.  It is awe inspiring.",
          "Favorite stop in Rome! Seeing rain fall inside was mesmerizing. Really beautiful in the evening as the sky was growing dark. Defintely make the stop if you can.",
          "Beautiful building with ancient history. Highly recommended.",
          "Lines moved fast. Free entry. Historically significant but not much to look at. Sitting area by the pulpit was much appreciated. Gift shop had coins in small and large sizes.",
          "I suggest a guide to explain about the place , but can feel the importance of the place",
          "Fantastic! No other words for it! We trekked from the Pope's Gaff, to here, then onto Trevi Fountains and then on to Spanish Steps-all were very good, but this was the most awesome!",
          "Incredibly atmospheric. \nIt can, as you'd imagine, be rather crowded. However there was a well worked system to stop over crowding. \nYou can't really come to Rome & miss seeing it. It's a little tucked away, but not that hard to find.",
          "Impressive architecture, normally I find the outside gets me more but this time I found the inside truly amazing.",
          "It's just gorgeous from the inside and the Rick Steve's app does a great job of explaining the history behind it. It's definitely worth visiting even if you have a short time in Rome.",
          "Simple brick walls from the outside, georgous and admireable from the inside.",
          "Very busy but also writer a wow. If you love history worth a visit and there are some enchanting squares around it.",
          "This is one of the modern technological wonders of the world. The resources needed to build this huge domed structure is mind-blowing even in modern times much less more than 1000 years ago. However the Pantheon in its current state is \u2026",
          "Absolutely stunning! If you visit Rome, you just have to visit here. An amazing structure.",
          "Such an awesome site, beautiful and I love how it\u2019s right in the city!",
          "Mind blowing. Go with a guide. The history is alive when a local tells you details.\nThe hole at the top is open to the sky. Flooding? No. Hot air from inside rises up and through hole and turns it to mist. Small drain holes in the floor also.",
          "Magnificent!! Free enterance you should see inside. Its really incredible the structure is still alive until now.",
          "It\u2019s a pretty cool church to visit. It\u2019s free to enter and there\u2019s normally no queue. Make sure to take your hat off before entering otherwise you\u2019ll be told off by security. Outside the Pantheon it\u2019s usually quite busy. As it\u2019s a free & \u2026",
          "As amazing as always inside. Very crowded so perhaps better to visit during term time. Again you can't sit and enjoy it from the outside anymore unless you opt to pay a fortune and eat or drink in one of the many horrible tourist places.",
          "AMAZING FOOD, and lovely architecture!",
          "Not as grand as the surrounding area (Vatican, Castel sant'Angelo, Colosseum) this Temple was once a building dedicated to all roman gods but is now a church. You can see all that the Pantheon has to offer in approximately 20 minutes.",
          "Only saw from the outside so can't comment on the experience inside. We would have ventured in but by the time we arrived the queue was about 200 strong.\nStill, another great place to see when in Rome.",
          "Rome is made up of places like this, beautiful sculptures and art everywhere, a must see if you visit Rome.",
          "Amazing, to think how old this building is! Really surprised to find the centre of the roof is open to a the elements. This is a must see, for any tourist visiting Rome and it's free to get in, but go early, to avoid the crowds.",
          "I NEVER grow tired of this awesome place. My favourite spot in all of Rome!",
          "A very old building which can only have been built by aliens because it is do perfect. I think 900 years old. Visit this place",
          "The Pantheon, one of the world\u2019s most famous buildings located in the middle of busy Rome, surviving thousands of years, through thick and thin, through wars, prosperity, upheavals, bombardments, seiges, debates, and weather! \n\nThis \u2026",
          "Since I was a kid I have dreamt of coming here and seeing the historical sites around Rome. I finally did and it was as amazing as I hoped. A lot of people and a lot of tourist traps but great overall. If you have the time to go you should. I didn't get to go inside the pantheon but from the outside it was beautiful.",
          "We loved our time inside.  It is truly beautiful.  We have spent most of our time eating around the square.  Good food and nice atmosphere.",
          "As you walk in the quietness and it's feel of the building almost hugs you. I am not an everyday religious person but this felt so amazing.",
          "Impressive old place where you can see Vittorio Emanuele monument",
          "Magnifico. It is a magnificent structure. To think it was constructed without modern equipment is mind blowing. We need to thank our ancestors in not destroying all the pagan temples to build Christian churches. If they had done this, these wonders of ancient architecture would be lost.",
          "One of most mystical local places for me. Do not be afraid of long queue, just stand ASAP and you\u2019ll get-in in 5 mins.",
          "This is a former Roman temple, now a church, in Rome, on the site of an earlier temple commissioned by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus (27 BC \u2013 14 AD). It was completed by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated about 126 AD. \u2026",
          "The church is shaped in circular shape. Different compared to others and worth a visit. Near Trevi fountain and so making it easily accessible by walk. Walk from Trevi fountain to Vatican city is best to explore many such architectures in Rome",
          "Amazing site, with a historical story everyone will enjoy, but use a guide for best experience.",
          "Very very nice! You come from such a little street and suddenly you find this massive temple! Really impressive",
          "Another must see attraction. It is worth understanding the history of this magnificent building, now a church but originally built by the Emperor Hadrian with a very interesting roof design. Gets very crowded but well worth the effort. The square in front has several restaurants.",
          "It\u2019s breathtaking! One of the best parts is finding it by accident, walking around a corner and getting slapped in the face by its grandeur. The interior is a must see, and the best part is, it\u2019s free.",
          "Absolutely stunning. It's an eye opener, just the sheer perfection",
          "One of my favourite places we visited on our trip to Rome. We entered as part of a tour group which was worth it as the guide highlighted facts which we would have never known. Such a nice building and definitely one to add to your bucket list.",
          "Beautiful place to visit by day, fantastic square to hang out when the sun goes down.",
          "An absolute must visit when in Rome. Beautiful architecture, rich history, and wonderful people watching.",
          "An ancient temple that is incredibly well preserved given it is almost two thousand years old!! Entrance is free and the place is not very crowded unlike other major attractions like the Vatican City. The dome is open and the rain gets \u2026",
          "Just stunning to look at. It's presence is overwhelming. One of the best preserved Roman buildings you can visit, and it's free to get in. It does get busy, but it's so large inside it holds tourists well, but it is worth going to early in the morning if you can.",
          "Wow, what a site. Great tourist spot, plenty of places to relax and have something to eat/drink",
          "Incredible historical monument, absolutely a must see if you're in rome. Surprised they still havn't gotten the roof fixed yet though! /s",
          "Absolutely stunning place to visit, inside is amazing.",
          "Wow, just wow. The atmosphere there is brilliant, I absolutely loved it!",
          "Truly incredible. The best surviving Roman monument and the only intact temple. Built by Augustus as a place to worship all the gods. Being unable to put statues of all the different gods together (they had family issues), he had none but \u2026",
          "Stunned! That was my immediate reaction, simply stunned into silence. Unexpectedly looming and then the sumptuous and serene interior even though there was constant excited chatter - beautiful",
          "Beautiful and impressive Roman building that has endured to our times, with magistral use of the architecture that let's you understand the power of the Roman Empire.",
          "Very beautiful exterior facade, however I was not as impressed inside the building. There were many tourists, and felt very crowded and congested even during the winter months. The opening in the roof was unique and interesting.",
          "Brutally majestic atmosphere in this old monument of ancient power located on the small square in the very heart of Rome represents the greatness of old Romans at its best. Everything from the bottom to the hole in the roof. Even one of the ninja turtles lies here :)",
          "So much history, it's breath taking. It's hard to understand. The hole in the middle of the roof actually let's rain in.",
          "Wow! I real piece of classical Roman history nestled amongst the maze of little alleyways scattered with cafes and restaurants. This is a must see. It is a real feat of engineering that we'd be hard pushed to replicate even today. Truly stunning and beautiful and free to go in. What's not to like?",
          "Very well preserved temple constructed 2000 years ago to honour the Roman pantheon of deities, inside has been revamped in the 1600s by the church so the inside is about 400 years old. Entrance is free although a modest dress code applies (covered shoulders and knees, although it was not as strictly enforced as the Vatican).",
          "The Pantheon is a former Roman temple, now a church, in Rome, Italy, on the site of an earlier temple commissioned by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus. It was completed by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated about 126 AD. \u2026",
          "Such a majestic place, must see.",
          "A must see in Rome, also a Good food by the location",
          "I was so excited to see the Pantheon because of my high school art history studies. It is huge! There is no fee to get in, and there\u2019s not even a line. It\u2019s big enough that there is room for hundreds of people in there, but small enough \u2026",
          "This place was STUNNING. The size and grandeur literally took my breath away. As the oldest continually in use Roman building, this is a must see. And it\u2019s free!",
          "Amazing place, you must go there if you visit Rome. Free entrance",
          "A stunning building. The square outside is really busy and on the first day we went, the queue at about 2/3pm looked crazy. On the next day, we went about 4pm and the queue still looked big, but it moves really quickly! It doesn't cost to \u2026",
          "Amazing place. It's one of the oldest buildings. With roman n Christian structures. The hole on the dome is unique.",
          "Amazing preserved temple. Indulge yourself in the building history of the copula and all the different techniques and materials used.",
          "No words can truly express this awesome, Incredible building along with it's history. (David) brings every piece of information alive with his amazing character,humour and love of this beautiful structure.",
          "Beautiful location and the most cool thing is the free entrance. NO FEE, which is amazing for such an important monument.",
          "Cool place.  A must see in Rome, but do yourself a favor and buy a tour with the skip-the-line option.  It is WELL worth it!",
          "Amazing. Built by the first emperor, Augustus, in 31BC. A superb feat of engineering",
          "Impressive building overlooking a small square. There is an Egyptian obelisk in the square. Significant queues to enter.",
          "Seeing ancient Roman architecture preserved so well is awesome. Highly recommend a guided tour. A must-see if you're visiting Rome!",
          "Be carefull with the restaurant on the left side of the Pantheon!!! They charge for the bread which you usually don't order and they charge a 6euro fee.for the table you occupied. Never announced in advance! It's too annoying! Tbe prices are high enough and one hidden charge or a small amount could spoil your mood! Its super annoying!",
          "You can actually feel the history here.",
          "Free, one of the few places that is free to visit and it is amazing. It is an ancient place and even though now a church you almost get that feeling that you are in the middle of an important and sacred place. The energy level is palpable.",
          "The pantheon is possibly Rome\u2019s greatest building. Originally a Roman temple it survived a s a result of being converted into a church. It is also the burial place of the famous artist Rafael. A must if you are visiting Rome.",
          "Very nice church impressed how it was built with the big hole in the ceiling. And also free entrance",
          "I love it. Stunning, for its age, Greek architecture.",
          "My favorite building in Rome. It is amazing to me that a building so old is so accessible to the public, free of charge. The Pantheon has a palpable gravity while in its presence and I was drawn to return two or three times during my last stay in Rome.",
          "It's free to enter. Inside is wow. Come back at night to see it lit up on the outside. We found a nice little place around the back that sells delicious pizza.",
          "This historic and imposing building is magnificent. Before entering, we notice the impressive size of its unusual columns, then the door the colossal door. When you enter the interior you can admire the vast interior of the Pantheon with \u2026",

          "Perfect construction. Nothing more nothing less. You have to be there.",
          "Very cool inside. The square outside is always rammed though, so you'd have to go as the sun rises to get a decent picture of the exterior. It's a shame that they have a tanoy asking people to be quiet in every language... ruins the \u2026",
          "This is a very special place. It's really very well preserved 2000 year old building. And an important building to the Romans. There is nothing else like it that I saw in Italy. It's not the biggest building by modern standards. It must \u2026",

          "Spectacular and a must visit photos dont do justice - look up!",
          "The Pantheon is amazing on its own, but be sure to do the official audio guide ( they hold your I.D. until you return the audio player). It was so much more informative with audio and even more beautiful to experience.",
          "Incredible this place is 2000 years old, you can even see the original marble floor... Incredible what Romans were.",
          "The largest free standing concrete dome in the world and its 1,900 years old. How could you give it anything less than 5 stars...",

          "The Pantheon is the oldest Roman temple and the only one left. Worth a visit, even if it might be a bit on the expensive side to enter (around 20 - 30 euro) but worth a visit for those who love the history, culture and learning about the ancient ways!",
          "This is an amazing building, and there is so much history - but real quick, for tourists: entrance is FREE, so that's awesome. There are audio guides you can purchase, but we learned more by looking up information on our own and reading the \u2026",
          "One of my favorite sites. Amazing architecture. The design and style are impressive. Even more impressive when you stop to consider when it was built and how it was built. Entrance was free. It's not a huge site but there is plenty to see \u2026",

          "Very nice place only a pitty that you also find some modern stuff inside and that there are these guys that try to sell you something on the streets. They're everywhere and are very annoying. Still a great place you should visit. Be aware: shoulders must be covered",
          "Very beautiful historical place. For some personal reason I would remember it for life... Definitely worth visit!",
          "This was a personal highlight of my trip through Rome. It is busy, yet never crowded. It has aged over time, but that adds to the history behind the Pantheon. It holds the tombs of some of the most respected Italians in history, such as \u2026",

          "I loved that this was something that has been here for thousands of years. It is just breathtaking to see in person.",
          "The most impressive building in Rome seeing it's insane architectural design with its amazing dome with the hole at the top. Which is breathtaking but if you are (un)lucky to see it in the rain it's even better!",

          "Highlight of Rome for me! Best time for me was around 1am at night. At night it is beautifully lit and seems larger and more spectacular without the urban crowd. During the day you can walk in without a ticket, when I went there was no \u2026",
          "Please don't be those loud tourists. observe the signs that it is an active place of worship, it's staggeringly beautiful, but you can still talk in hushed, respectful tones.",
          "Very impressive and - unusually in Rome - there are actually times when the Pantheon is NOT overfilled, even though entry is free. We stopped here as part of a long stroll through the center of the city which I would strongly recommend. Relax, visit the monuments you want to see, stop for coffee or gelato where and when you please...",
          "Impressive structure. Extensive maintenance being done and you can only see from the outside. You will be able to walk through in years to come. Huge crowds.",
          "Best part : IT ia free!",
          "The monument is incredible. A masterpiece itself. You will find it hard to observe the details and to take nice pictures due to the crowd. There are no spaces on the ground to take a detailed look or a photo. You need to take care of your belongings.",

          "This is the most amazing building I've ever seen.",

          "Amazing place that brings you back in time. This place is very well preserved and deserves to be seen. I dont suggest to do it as an organized tour. It is free to visit and there is ample information on Google to learn about the place. It was our favorite place in Rome. Beats the Vatican and Colosseum by 1000 to 1!",
          "IN LOVE WITH THIS MONUMENT. Such a shame it's a church now! I can't get over it, though I should be grateful since it's the reason why it's so well preserved. Still though. Such a waste... I wish I could see it how it looked before - both the inside and outside.",
          "Most amazing building I have ever visited. Still can't believe that this was built almost 2000 years ago. A must see while in Rome. If you visit at 12 noon you will experience the oculus.",

          "It was the highlight of our first-day walkabout in the area. The Pantheon is definitely worth the visit! Probably try getting up real early and get ahead of everyone else or stay real late to snap nice angles of the structure with the least number of people.",
          "One of the most incredible buildings in world history, wit the open circular window to see the sky. A temple to all the Gods that is what it was and should still be today....",

          "Truly a marvel that it's stood for so long and been preserved so well. A really unique sight, and you can enter for free!",
          "So many places have copied the style of its domed roof but when you see the Pantheon's occulus with your own eyes, you know that none of the copies has suceeded in surpassing the original. Impressive architecture from 2000 years ago... thank goodness it still stands though its internals have largely been sacked...",

          "This 2nd-century Pantheon dedicated to \"all gods\u201d is now officially a church\u2014though more of a tourist attraction. But one day when Jesus rules the world, men and women won\u2019t merely tip their hats to Jesus. They will bow the knee. Isaiah 45 \u2026",
          "if you like history, this place is must on your list! this is free entry museum with tight security gate. u cannot bring your drink and wear a proper shirt to go inside",
          "The Pantheon is a very big tomb but then the church transformed it into a church. It's open to tourists, but sometimes they celebrate and you need to wait outside for about an hour. The strangest thing of the Pantheon is it's hole in the \u2026",
          "Amazing place. While the place is slightly crowded, the amazing Roman architecture is truly a monument to visit if you're in Rome.",
          "Altar of the fallen gods, place if worship for the one God, tomb for one of the great renaissance masters(and other great artists, like Carracci and Peruzzi with his astonishing designs), Raphael. Ingenious architectural design. Wondering how it looked like in its early days, when it was a temple, and not a church.",
          "Worth seeing in the day and night. Bats at night are cool there also.",
          "Free entry. Seemed much less crowded in the morning than in the afternoon. Interesting that the hole at the top is the only source of natural light, and isn't glazed! So if it rains, people inside just get wet.",
          "The best example in the World of the unique Temple build before Christ time! Excellence outside and inside.",
          "Nothing compare to the pantheon in Rome to me. \nThis temple transformed in church withold the tomb of Vittor Emmanuele the founder of Italy and it's first king. \nHave been there many time over the years and it is as good to visit a striking sun and observe the sunbeam passing through the coupola than under the rain.\nEntrance is for 3.",

          "Beautiful inside with only natural light and at night the outside is just as magnificent",
          "Absolutely brilliant. Words and photos do not do this place justice. It's free, but leave a donation to help preserve this beautiful monument for another 2000+ years.",
          "Once you start to look around you, you are taken in by the opulence. Monumental tombs are set into the walls of Pantheon, including that of the artist Raphael (on the left side as you enter). There are requests and signs for silence at all times while you are in this religious place. You are allowed to take photos.",
          "This is a truly amazing building to visit. I walked around a corner and there it was in all it\u2019s glory",
          "Beatiful place that reeks of historic presence. It was built around 27 AC and it's greatly conservated since. Inside there is a beautiful church and the huge dome with some decorated altars and the burying site of Raphael and Vittorio Emmanuel II, the founding father of Italy. Great place if you eant to appreciate arquitecture.",
          "This place is amazing and can be crowded during day time. You should try to visit either late after dusk or in the morning. There are so many shops/eating places in front of this building, where you can enjoy your breakfast or dinner.",

          "Beautiful. Crowded. Unlike anything you will see in Rome.So be prepared. The fountain is lovely as is the surrounding plaza. A truly unique site. It costs to go inside, but simply seeing the exterior is so worth the walk. Lots to see nearby, too. Not far from the Fountain of Tripoli.",
          "Good from the outside.No payment needed.\u0131nside is eeh.Not worth seeing inside.",
          "A spectacular site to visit while in Rome. Entrace is free. Had a tour guide and was very fascinated of its history. It was very crowded, people came in and out. But You still have the chance to make good pictures. it was an awesome experience to see this in person and not only in books.",
          "Massive and impressive structure. I would avoid the pricy restaurants surrounding the Pantheon. Be sure to enter inside the building and observe the large interior. There is a very high roof and lots of paintings on the walls. It is busy most of the time as everywhere else in Rome.",
          "Great place don\u2019t miss \nAnd go inside and take a photo in the middle of the pantheon \nTake care about the shadow of the sun \nTake your time and you will enjoy \nThe historical church \nBefore you going try to read about pantheon and see the photo of the place",
          "A roman creation that was respected through the dark ages.  It's clear how history has transformed this place and it's amazing to see all of the ages represented here.  A big contrast from the Roman forum.",
          "Beautiful dome and interesting history. Worth a visit inside.",
          "Great historic place, free to go inside, but please note this is a place which asks visitors to be silent.",

Free to visit and you may have to que to go in for 5-10 minutes however however it is so worth it you can get some amazing photos inside and out. Very busy area however some nice cafes/restaurants around the side roads. Will definitely visit again when I come to Rome.",
          "History enthusiasts will love the place especially with guided tours. Although, as on date, the place is in disrepair and needs restoration. Also, the area is really crowded and beware of pick-pockets. The ice cream shop just around the corner is really good.",

          "Really spectacular building. The front with its massive columns and the giants slabs of marble looming above them, it is a lot to take in. The inside was just as great, beautiful stone floors, and the sight of this massive dome room is just \u2026",

        "wiki": "Piazza Navona (pronounced [\u02c8pjattsa na\u02c8vo\u02d0na]) is a public space/plaza in Rome, Italy. It is built on the site of the Stadium of Domitian, built in the 1st century AD, and follows the form of the open space of the stadium. The ancient Romans went there to watch the agones (\"games\"), and hence it was known as \"Circus Agonalis\" (\"competition arena\"). It is believed that over time the name changed to in avone to navone and eventually to navona.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDefined as a public space in the last years of 15th century, when the city market was transferred there from the Campidoglio, Piazza Navona was transformed into a highly significant example of Baroque Roman architecture and art during the pontificate of Innocent X, who reigned from 1644 until 1655, and whose family palace, the Palazzo Pamphili, faced the piazza. It features important sculptural creations: in the center stands the famous Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi or Fountain of the Four Rivers (1651) by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, topped by the Obelisk of Domitian, brought in pieces from the Circus of Maxentius; the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone by Francesco Borromini, Girolamo Rainaldi, Carlo Rainaldi and others; and the aforementioned Pamphili palace, also by Girolamo Rainaldi, that accommodates the long gallery designed by Borromini and frescoed by Pietro da Cortona.\n\nPiazza Navona has two other fountains. At the southern end is the Fontana del Moro with a basin and four Tritons sculpted by Giacomo della Porta (1575) to which, in 1673, Bernini added a statue of a Moor, wrestling with a dolphin. At the northern end is the Fountain of Neptune (1574) also created by Giacomo della Porta; the statue of Neptune, by Antonio Della Bitta, was added in 1878 to create a balance with La Fontana del Moro.\nDuring its history, the piazza has hosted theatrical events and other ephemeral activities. From 1652 until 1866, when the festival was suppressed, it was flooded on every Saturday and Sunday in August in elaborate celebrations of the Pamphilj family. The pavement level was raised in the 19th century, and in 1869 the market was moved to the nearby Campo de' Fiori. A Christmas market is held in the piazza square.\n\n\n== Other monuments ==\nStabilimenti Spagnoli\nPalazzo de Cupis\nPalazzo Torres Massimo Lancellotti\nChurch of Nostra Signora del Sacro Cuore\nPalazzo Braschi (Museo di Roma)\nSant'Agnese in Agone\n\n\n== Literature and films ==\n\nThe piazza is featured in Dan Brown's 2000 thriller Angels & Demons, in which the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi is listed as one of the Altars of Science. During June 2008, Ron Howard directed several scenes of the film adaptation of Angels & Demons on the southern section of the piazza.\nThe piazza is featured in several scenes of director Mike Nichols' 1970 adaptation of Joseph Heller's novel, Catch-22.\nThe Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi was used in the 1990 film Coins in the Fountain. The characters threw coins into the fountain as they made wishes. The Trevi Fountain was used in the 1954 version of the film.\nIt is featured in National Lampoon's European Vacation\nIn the 1964 Italian comedy film Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (\"ieri, oggi, domani\") Sophia Loren's character Mara lives in a second-floor apartment overlooking Piazza Navona in Rome.\nThe piazza is featured in Eugene Levy's film, Once Upon A Crime.\n\n\n== Vandalism ==\nIn the early hours of 3 September 2011, the Fontana del Moro was damaged by a vandal. Police later found the man, who had been captured on security cameras climbing in the fountain, wielding a large rock and decapitating some of the larger and smaller figures, after they recognised him by his sneakers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nObeliscus Pamphilius\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nNorwich, John Julius, ed.

          "The prices on this street are higher than in other streets accross. Food in restaurants close by was not do good. We found old funny man who is selling paintings on the street of Navona. He made us a day. He was so funny, and was having a really bed life so we ended buying 4",

          "I saw this Piazza on a tour during my first week in Rome. There is a lot going on in the Piazza and there were definitely a good amount of people, but it wasn't too crowded. There are a lot of restaurants along the outside of the piazza so maybe a good place to get dinner.",
          "Obviously very impressive and a great place to sit and have a - hugely expensive - coffee. After that, pop around the corner to Mastro Ciccia and have a great lunch.",
          "Piazza Navona was a highlight of our trip. It's a beautiful, quaint, not over touristy area. saw a concert in the church at night that was wonderful. Take a little time to slow down, have a glass of wine and absorb some great Italian ambiance.",

          "3 fountains ( one big central) 1st century open plazza surrounded with wee cafe restaurants and with a church Sant'Agnese free to pop in. Must have got it on a bad day cos the hordes of tourists did not make for an attractive visit and although the grand architecture is fine to",

          "Plenty of restaurants to choose around there. Worth the 20 minute walk and picutre opportuninties. Watch the beggars and pickpockets",

Was probably expecting more based on reviews. \u20ac5 was the price for a cup of tea - didn't pay it - had a glass of vino \ud83c\udf77\ud83d\udc4d for less. Nice to sit and relax but there are much nicer spots in Rome.",

          "The Piazza Navona is a lovely spot to take a break whilst sightseeing in Rome. Make sure that you visit the Stadium of Domitian which is located under Piazza Navona before you leave the Piazza. The site is only small but never the less very interesting. The entrance is",
          "Really pretty and to imagine there used to be horse racing right their in the piazza. I would recommend the mesueum around the corner, they actually excavated the area below and you can see part of the old stadium really a great experience. Their are really great place for food",
          "This is a beautiful plaza that you need to go see during the day or night. While there there are a few church you can walk into around the plaza, make sure you visit because what you find inside are amazing. From the outside most churches look old and uninteresting but everyone",

          "There\u2019s not one single soul to travel to Rome and not wanna see Fontana di Trevi. Better visit it early in the morning or late in the evening, otherwise even if you will get a chance to touch it (Italians are well organized to let everyone near the fountain), most probably it",
          "Have you ever wondered how beauty looks like? Well if you did here is the answer for you La bellissima fontana di Trevi will mesmerise your attention and you will end up throwing the famous coin in the waters to gain yourself an other trip to Rome in the future",

          "Situated on an historic Roman Stadia, this piazza is not far from the Pantheon. When you walk in, the size of the piazza and the three magnificent statues strike you immediately. They know how to erect an impressive statue! The Piazza is flanked with overpriced restaurants",
          "Piazza Navone is beautiful, for sure. But once you're there, you get hounded by vendors. There are many restaurants around the Piazza but so many people are smoking that they are hard to enjoy unless you go inside. My advice is to stop by, enjoy, take some pictures and move on.",
          "A great place to relax. Not on the usual tourist spots, although there are many there. Lots of cafe's surrounding the actual plaza for a coffee or gelato. I chose to walk down a few blocks to a cafe - away from the hustle of the plaza.",
          "Our hotel Navona 49 happened to look out over Piazza Navona so we were fortunate to see it in the morning, afternoon and at night. It is spectacular at all times. My favorite time was early morning and at sunset. The lighting is fabulous and the crowds thinner. There is a",

          "Just picture the Roman chariots racing around this Place in the days of Cicero! The three gigantic statue groupings in the piazza are most beautiful. Visit the church of Sant Agnese - in the middle of the piazza. It is the private church of the Doria Pampijli family - whose",

          "We came here five years ago and loved it. We returned today and hated it. The difference? Now there is an endless amount of immigrant street vendors hassling you to buy their cheap fake lousy products and you don\u2019t feel safe. We sat down for ten minutes and were approached 16",
          "The place has multiple fountains, that are simply out of this world! The architecture of the fountains is awesome. The place is really buzzing, lined with with restaurants around it. We went there a number of times, both during the day and at night. There is a really nice you",

          "Well, out of all Piazza (okay, Piazza means Square in English), I liked this most and I am glad I visited this in the night. Perhaps one of the best known of Rome's public squares, the Piazza Navona dates back to the end of the 15th century. This large square is usually full of",
          "I had been recommended a visit to this square prior to going to Rome and it didn't disappoint. The spectacular sight of the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers) was a truly special one and made the slightly inflated prices of the food and drink in surrounding",
          "Stunning square but can get very busy - head there at start or end f the day for a more atmospheric experience. Lots of restaurants with great views of the square but what you win with the view you lose on food quality so maybe eat there for a quick lunch rather that a special",
          "If you have the time the Piazza Navona is a nice stop but not one I would say is critical. Some one Bernini fountains and a number of restaurants.",
          "This is a lovely place to sit around and have a aperol or gelato. Lots of street performers. Very Italian. Not a must do but if u have extra time or are visiting the museum there then stop by.",

          "Large area that includes lovely fountains & magnificent churches, as well as street entertainers. Great on a fine day",
          "Great place to take that perfect picture alone by the fountain in Rome (because Fountain di Trevi is very crowded). Enjoy different street artist musicians and dancers just sitting on a bench or pavement (or in a restaurant if you aren't on a budget). Also a good place to buy",
          "This is a wonderful destination in the evening, we ate here every night of our city break. There are over 20 restaurants and once the sun sets the fountains are lit up and the piazza becomes busy with street artist and music. A definite must for anyone visiting Rome",
          "Piazza Navona is a beautiful piazza, with 3 fountains, another wonderful place in Rome to lose yourself in the wonderful history and architecture. There are plenty of place around the piazza to just sit and have a coffee and take in the atmosphere.",
          "There are many outstanding piazzas in Rome but in my opinion none compared to this as it was so buzzing. There were 3 very grand fountains and a buzzing atmosphere. The restaurants around the piazza were nothing amazing and were very overpriced but that did not take away from",
          "Very nice place with a beautiful fountain. This place was not as busy as Trevi. There\u2019s a lot of beautiful architecture and ruins. There\u2019s a lot of restaurants close by.",
          "At the center of this large square is the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers), an amazing fountain and a sculptural masterpiece. Aside from the Trevi Fountain, I think this is the most spectacular fountain in Rome (although the sinking boat near the Spanish",

          "It is a well known Piazza of the city. Many of the top attractions of Rome are scattered around Navona (Museo di Roma, St. Ivo, St Andrea della Valle etc); so you shall find yourself here numerous times. There are many restaurants and caf\u00e9s around; some of them are tourist",
          "Although there are many more popular places to visit in Rome, the Piazza Navona was a romantic surprise. It is large, containing three fountains that are beautiful. Not as large as the Trevi Fountain but also nowhere near as crowded which was a very pleasant change in this",

          "Quite a large piazza with three fountains to take in. The central fountain was certainly the most impressive. Lots of restaurants surrounding the piazza. A beautiful place to people watch",
          "The Piazza Navona owes its shape to the fact that it was built over an ancient stadium. In 86AD, the emperor Domitian built a stadium of white marble here, to hold athletic contests (but not chariot races nor gladiatorial fights). It could seat 30,000 people. But eventually it",
          "We went early morning and the place was nice and quiet. Loved the place and intend to return to experience the evening atmosphere",

          "One of the better spots in Rome that we visited.  Rome, unfortunately, was my least favorite area in Italy.",
          "Highly recommended, worth the wait. Service, food and wine are amazing.",
          "This is a much larger Piazza than most in Roma. So does not get crowded out as Trevi and Spanish Steps. It seems to have less of the annoying street vendors that many Piazzas have. The day we visited (Sunday) there were some good performers \u2026",
          "Great Piazza, beautiful fountains and very lively place with live music and entertainers for kids. Restaurants around the piazza and whichever street you walk into.",
          "Lovely square with a charm of its own. Take a rest and enjoy the scenery while you yourself enjoy a cappuccino or might it be an espresso?",

          "Crowdy place but worth its fame!",

          "Ok looking piazza. A bit to wide and crowded for my liking.",

          "Lots of tourists but, it's definitely worth a visit",
          "Attractive piazza, we went there at night and enjoyed the fountains and statues, along with the architecture. It's semi-touristy, with the usual collection of people trying to sell noisy spinning robots, flying bird toys and selfie sticks, but not overly so.",
          "Great place to stop at one of the many restaurants and rest your feet whilst on a day's exploring. You can visit the fountain used in the Angel and Demon's film or visit the underground attraction. Usually quite a queue for that. The Piazza \u2026",

      "name": "Trevi Fountain",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Trevi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi) is a fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini and several others. Standing 26.3 metres (86 ft) high and 49.15 metres (161.3 ft) wide, it is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world. The fountain has appeared in several notable films, including Roman Holiday, Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita, the eponymous Three Coins in the Fountain, The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and Sabrina Goes to Rome.\n\n\n== History before 1629 ==\nThe fountain at the junction of three roads (tre vie) marks the terminal point of the \"modern\" Acqua Vergine, the revived Aqua Virgo, one of the aqueducts that supplied water to ancient Rome. In 19 BC, supposedly with the help of a virgin, Roman technicians located a source of pure water some 13 km (8.1 mi) from the city. (This scene is presented on the present fountain's fa\u00e7ade.) However, the eventual indirect route of the aqueduct made its length some 22 km (14 mi). This Aqua Virgo led the water into the Baths of Agrippa. It served Rome for more than 400 years.\n\n\n== Commission, construction, and design ==\nIn 1629, Pope Urban VIII, finding the earlier fountain insufficiently dramatic, asked Gian Lorenzo Bernini to sketch possible renovations, but the project was abandoned when the pope died. Though Bernini's project was never constructed, there are many Bernini touches in the fountain as it exists today. An early, influential model by Pietro da Cortona, preserved in the Albertina, Vienna, also exists, as do various early 18th century sketches, most unsigned, as well as a project attributed to Nicola Michetti one attributed to Ferdinando Fuga and a French design by Edm\u00e9 Bouchardon.Competitions had become popular during the Baroque era to design buildings, fountains, as well as the Spanish Steps. In 1730, Pope Clement XII organized a contest in which Nicola Salvi initially lost to Alessandro Galilei \u2013 but due to the outcry in Rome over a Florentine having won, Salvi was awarded the commission anyway. Work began in 1732.\nSalvi died in 1751 with his work half finished, but he had made sure a barber's unsightly sign would not spoil the ensemble, hiding it behind a sculpted vase, called by Romans the asso di coppe, the \"Ace of Cups\", because of its resemblance to a Tarot card. Four different sculptors were hired to complete the fountain's decorations: Pietro Bracci (whose statue of Oceanus sits in the central niche), Filippo della Valle, Giovanni Grossi, and Andrea Bergondi. Giuseppe Pannini was hired as architect.The Trevi Fountain was finished in 1762 by Pannini, who substituted the present allegories for planned sculptures of Agrippa and Trivia, the Roman virgin. It was officially opened and inaugurated on 22 May by Pope Clement XIII.The majority of the piece is made from Travertine stone, quarried near Tivoli, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) east of Rome.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\nThe fountain was refurbished once in 1988 to remove discoloration caused by smog, and again in 1998; the stonework was scrubbed and all cracks and other areas of deterioration were repaired by skilled artisans, and the fountain was equipped with recirculating pumps.In January 2013, it was announced that the Italian fashion company Fendi would sponsor a 20-month, 2.2-million-euro restoration of the fountain; it was to be the most thorough restoration in the fountain's history.Restoration work began in June 2014 and was completed in November 2015. The fountain was reopened with an official ceremony on the evening of 3 November 2015. The restoration included the installation of more than 100 LED lights to improve the nighttime illumination of the fountain.\n\n\n== Iconography ==\nThe backdrop for the fountain is the Palazzo Poli, given a new fa\u00e7ade with a giant order of Corinthian pilasters that link the two main stories. Taming of the waters is the theme of the gigantic scheme that tumbles forward, mixing water and rockwork, and filling the small square. Tritons guide Oceanus' shell chariot, taming hippocamps.In the centre, a robustly-modelled triumphal arch is superimposed on the palazzo fa\u00e7ade. The centre niche or exedra framing Oceanus has free-standing columns for maximal light and shade. In the niches flanking Oceanus, Abundance spills water from her urn and Salubrity holds a cup from which a snake drinks. Above, bas reliefs illustrate the Roman origin of the aqueducts.The Tritons and horses provide symmetrical balance, with the maximum contrast in their mood and poses (by 1730, rococo was already in full bloom in France and Germany).\n\n\n== Coin throwing ==\nCoins are purportedly meant to be thrown using the right hand over the left shoulder.

        "brit": "Trevi Fountain, Italian Fontana di Trevi,  fountain in Rome that is considered a late Baroque masterpiece and is arguably the best known of the city\u2019s numerous fountains. It was designed by Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini in 1762. According to legend, those who toss coins into its waters will return to Rome.Trevi Fountain, Rome; designed by Nicola Salvi, 18th century.Pixland/JupiterimagesThe fountain is located in Rome\u2019s Trevi district, abutting the Palazzo Poli. An earlier fountain on the site was demolished in the 17th century, and a design competition for a new fountain was won by Nicola Salvi in 1732. His creation was a scenic wonder. The idea of combining the palace front and fountain was derived from a project by Pietro da Cortona, but the grand pageantry of the fountain\u2019s central triumphal arch with its mythological and allegorical figures, natural rock formations, and gushing water was Salvi\u2019s. The Trevi Fountain took some 30 years to complete, and after Salvi\u2019s death in 1751, Giuseppe Pannini, who slightly altered the original scheme, oversaw its completion in 1762. The immense fountain stands some 85 feet (26 metres) high and is approximately 160 feet (49 metres) wide. At its centre is Pietro Bracci\u2019s statue of Oceanus, who stands atop a chariot pulled by sea horses and is accompanied by tritons. The fountain also features statues of Abundance and Health.  Its water, from the ancient aqueduct called Acqua Vergine, long was considered Rome\u2019s softest and best tasting; for centuries, barrels of it were taken every week to the Vatican. However, the water is now nonpotable.OceanusOceanus, statue by Pietro Bracci; detail from the Trevi Fountain, Rome.\u00a9 kbrowne41/Shutterstock.comThe Trevi Fountain was featured in numerous books and films, notably Federico Fellini\u2019s La Dolce Vita (1960). In 2014\u201315 the fountain was closed for a major renovation. The coins that are thrown into its water are collected daily and donated to charity.Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg in La dolce vitaMarcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg in La dolce vita (1960), directed by Federico Fellini.Riama Film and Path\u00e9 Consortium Cin\u00e9ma; photograph from a private collection\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\n ",

          "It must be the Baroque style surprise of casually walking in the narrow streets and seeing it unexpectedly when turning the corner, but surrendering to the immense beauty of the Trevi fountain is always a must do when in Rome.",
          "This a truly splendid fountain. I visited during the evening period when it was beautifully lit up. The crowd there was huge and gettingta spot at the front of the fountain is only if you are lucky. From my observation it seems like a popular wishing well and filled with",
          "It is unbelievable how magnificent Fontana di Trevi looks after a pretty long facelift. Nicola Salvi\u2019s white masterpiece is young and beautiful again after its lengthy and meticulous restoration and I was very happy to see my old friend looking so good. Despite the crowds, I",
          "My (now) husband proposed to me in front of the Trevi Fountain - so we are biased to love it and visit it every time we are in Rome. It is VERY busy, so plan some extra time to enjoy it and get close enough to take pictures. We recommend visiting it in the day and at night",
          "It is beautiful and impressive but nothing more than that. I would say only visit it if it is in your way. If not it does not worth the time. I would not visit it again.",
          "It is like a fantasy. The fountain is really glamorous. So, it is obvious you want to stay there and enjoy the statues.But, all you see are tourists, tourists, vendors, and security guards. Once you get through the peaks of people's heads, then the view is beautiful. I arrived",
          "The Trevi Fountain is a must see while in Rome. It is located in a small piazza in in the central part of the city. The fountain is the largest and the most famous one in Rome. The sculptures of the chariot and horses are beautiful. You should take the time to visit this",
          "This wasn't my first visit to Rome having thrown dozens of coins into the fountain. The architecture is magnificent and the landmark is iconic. As such is overcrowded with tourists at all times of the day and night (with the possible exception of 6-7am. There are guards",
          "You must see this! It's not just the pictures, in person it really looks this blue and beautiful. Be careful of tourist traps around the area but definitely worth visiting! Even more romantic at night.",
          "The first time we were in Rome in 2014 the Trevi Fountain was undergoing renovation and cleaning. Hence, no water, scaffolding and board walkways around it, along with tons of people around it. This time, it was truly like seeing it for the first time. Yes, there were tons of",
          "What a magnificent site! It is definitely tucked away from the street. While we were walking, I was unsure if we were going in the right direction until we rounded the corner and heard the water. We went early in the morning and avoided the crowds.",
          "It is another place that you have to visit in Rome strictly. lots of beautiful sculptures. You can met with many tourists there.",
          "Another \"must\" while in Rome, is one of the most beautiful sculpture/water fountain in the world, just be ready for the crowds at all times.",

          "We were there on March 4 so there was a very small crowd. Within 5 minutes we were very close to fountain. Granted it still was a little difficult to take a photo without others being in it but overall not a bad experience. Beautiful fountain well worth the trouble. Time",

          "Always crowded which brings the risks of pickpockets and the annoyance of people trying to sell you everything portable. Still go. The artistry is captivating. Trevi is a short walk to the Pantheon and Piazza Navona, among other things. Rome is so walkable.",
          "You have to make time to see this beautiful fountain. We were lucky it was not too busy and we were able to sit and enjoy the beauty of the architecture and romantic feeling. We loved it so much we even we went back to experience it at night as well.",
          "Not sure why, but there seemed to be a presence at the fountain. It was a spiritual, uplifting experience",

          "The Trevi Fountain is amazing and very beautiful. Unless you go in the middle of the night though, there will be a lot of people and it will be pretty crowded as it is a big tourist spot. I went here twice during my time in Rome and there were a lot of people both times, but",

          "Visiting off season meant we didn't experience the crowds you would during the summer months. Seeing the Fountain for the first time was incredible. Such a fabulous piece of work, sparkling white in the sun and the water looked so clean and blue. You can still throw a coin",
          "Our hotel wasn\u2019t far from here so we tended to walk past it several times each day/night. Beautiful during the day, but even better at night. Would recommend grabbing gelato from the nearby Melograno and eating by the fountain, taking in the atmosphere and the details of the",

          "I have been here with my family (wife and 12 years dother) and it was just beautiful. We visited Fontana di trevi in February. The weather was splendid not to hot not to cold. In this period is not to crowded. The Fontana is beautiful but you have to take care of 2 things-1 you",

          "Ok this is a decent fountain but the hordes of tourists don't make for a pleasant experience. I suppose you have to do it but move on",
          "A city nice peaceful place to visit either in the evening or in the morning. You can have an easy way of achieving your dreams and wishes by throwing a coin in the falling water . Lots of restaurants in the vicinity Italian and international. Do not forget to order gelato it is",

          "Being my first trip to the eternal city this was just one place on a long list of places to see.....and it didn\u2019t disappoint. The water and sculptures are incredible, I can see why this place would be packed out with visitors in the summer but in March not so busy. Couldn\u2019t",
          "A must see, highly guarded with police and security making sure that visitors \"behave\". It was very crowded but still a place to remember!",
          "Love this place, could sit for ages looking at all the detail. You dont expect to find it tucked away down little streets, then all of a sudden you find it.",
          "We were blown away with the beauty of the fountain. It is everything they say and more. My wife commented that she liked it more than the colosseum. We almost cancelled out trip due to the corona virus. So glad we didn\u2019t, it is so un-crowded here.",
          "The tourists were few and far between today but can see this would not normally be the case. There are lots of little places to get icecream and a snack in the piazza and a big shopping street nearby .Got my photo opportunity done.. when in Rome!...",
          "A must visit whilst in Rome, great experience, throw a coin in & make a wish, definitely a photo opportunity too.",
          "Went to see the fountain in January ....still a lot of people around!! Be careful not to sit on edge of fountain...police will ask you to get up!!!",
          "The fountain was always busy when we visited so not sure there is a quiet time to visit but well worth seeing it both day and night as it really does make a difference. You can\u2019t really visit Rome without calling at the fountain and the saying of throw money in the fountain and",
          "A very important attraction of Rome. It can be visited for free, so it is always crowded but it is worthwhile to stop for a few minutes at this sight.",
          "This is one of those places where there's always a lot of people because the place is known on the Internet and social media. Go there early if you want it to be an enjoyable visit. To my opinion it isn't the prettiest fountain in Rome, it isn't the oldest one and there are",
          "We accidentally walked up on it while roaming the town. It was PACKED ... seriously packed!! Beautiful but really not all that and more to me.",
          "Even in off season, there'll be a lot of people. So it's a little bit busy, but at night you get the streaming flows of water. Definitely worth being on your plan.",
          "After a long time, the fountain and all its beauty can be seen entirely. All the rennovation work is complete. We went in winter but the weather was really nice. There weren't as many people around the fountain and one could easily photograph all the details. There was also",
          "Wonderful architecture!!! Definitely an important Roman landmark to see!! Most of the time is very crowded, I've been there in the night...",
          "The fountain itself is beautiful and we had fun tossing coins into the water, but it is just crazy crowded, and we went there in December when it was supposed to be slow season! Didn't the other tourists get the memo?!",
          "Thanks to Federico Fellini the Fontana di Trevi is always crowded. It is worth going there and paying atrention to its lovely marble structure.",
          "One of those places you just have to visit when in Rome... Highly recommend you go in the evening when dark to gain the full affect.",
          "What impressed me the most about the Trevi Fountain was its location - you're in the middle of busy streets, surrounded by tourists and suddenly the Trevi Fountain is in front of you! The fountain is protected by security, so don't try to jump in!",
          "It's a wonder, impossible to miss very well guarded by police since people want to sit on the edges and it is prohibited luckily there weren't so many people and we could observe it from very close, you can walk as it is in the center of the city it was not our case since we",
          "This was a great surprise as I was expecting something else, when you walk round the corner you are taken aback. Can get busy but recommended",
          "Impressive and the biggest fontain I ever seen. We biked here in the evening in February when it wasn't that croudy.",
          "One of the rare things that is free to visit in Rome, in reality you are not going to spend a long time visiting it as there is not that much to see, I guess 15 minutes. I visited it on a Thursday afternoon late February and the place was crowded with tourists taking selfies, so",
          "Gorgeous fountain is a must-see but get there early for a less crowded view. Toss in a coin in hopes of returning again in the future.",
          "We walked to see Trevi Fountain after taking two different tours the same day. We almost decided not to go because we were so tired, but we pressed on anyway. Thankful we did. The fountain was breathtakingly beautiful. Lots of shops and restaurants around there to recharge your",
          "Nothing really prepares you for the site of the Trevi Fountain. It\u2019s amidst many buildings so when you are hunting for it, you almost stumble across it. It\u2019s surprising how beautifully kept it is. Many travellers congregate around this beautiful piece of art and through in a",
          "Beautiful piece of Roman history. Only downside is that there is always a giant crowd of people there.",
          "Magnificent and sparkling in the evening and in the morning, always surrounded with tone of people. You can hear the fountain from the adjacent streets calling you to come and admire it",
          "We went at night as didn\u2019t have much time to fit everything in, it was however the best choice not too busy and looks lovely all lit up we got right up to the front for photos as not too busy def recommend visiting in the evening",
          "I did not expect this fountain to be so big and beautiful. It was crowded when we were there but we were still able to take pictures. There are places to sit which was a nice break from all the walking we did. The architecture of the fountain was truly amazing. There are a lot",
          "This fountain is truly beautiful- the design and size is mindblowing and is so wonderfully located in Rome you can stop by anytime if you are in the area. Has wonderful and interesting traditions as well, such as if you throw a coin into it over your head \"you will return to",
          "very nice fountain as seen in the movies. too many tourist as expected , event at midnight, but nice to stop by multiple time at different hours to catch all the beauty of the fountain. and you have to throw a coin!",
          "Unique fountain, unique experience, unfortunately largely spoiled by the immense crowd permanently surrounding it and by the recent interdiction to sit on its bank or touching the water, thoroughly checked by police.",
          "One cannot just glance or even look at Trevi Fountain. One must spend a significant amount of time taking in the beauty, the artistry, the sculptures from many angles. It is breathtaking!",
          "This is one of Rome\u2019s landmark\u2019s. I am not sure what all the fuss is about. I thought it was a little disappointing.",
          "An iconic attraction and a must see. It is in a rather small area and is always extremely crowded, but it is as good as it looks in pictures and well worth seeing.",
          "Trevi Fountain is the most famous baroque fountain in Rome. Beautiful, magical, unique, romantic , the only minus is the crowd. It was built on the initiative of Clement XII in place of the existing fountain designed by Leon Battiste Alberti from 1435. In 1640 Urban VIII",
          "Beautiful site, was able to get right up close to the fountain and was in such awe. Highly recommend seeing this site even stopped for an amazing ice cream right outside.",
          "Went during the day and at night, at night it's so much more spectacular. The lighting makes a world of difference...",
          "We walked to the fountain on a beautiful sunny day in February. It was very crowded and fenced off so you are unable to throw coins into it. Despite this it was very pretty and worth the visit it didn\u2019t take long to find a space for selfies and photos.",
          "We really enjoyed this little place. Rome is covered with dozens of piazzas and fountains but this was possible one of the prettiest. We returned again in the evening to see the fountain at night all lit up - very beautiful. The only annoying part were the dozens of street",
          "An absolutely stunning fountain. Very busy with tourists all trying to make their wish and throw that coin over their shoulder. We did it too. Stunning to say the least Don\u2019t miss it",
          "Great to see in the sunshine, such intricate work all around the fountain but spoilt by the sprawling city location",
          "You should not come to Rome without taking in this breath taking sight! It\u2019s spectacular in every sense (expect big crowds)",
          "Best to go at night, the lit up fountain is beautiful. I believe there are less people as well! People were throwing coins over their shoulder for good luck, a sweet tradition!",
          "Very nice and magical place i love it so much what ever I tell I will never explain the magic I felt when I arrived and saw this fountain . I highly recommend this place to anyone come in Rome",
          "Bit of a shock that something so iconic is surrounded by shops, but nonetheless it is beautiful. We threw our coin into the fountain and enjoyed an ice cream. Touristy bit done!",
          "This is simply breathtaking. I found myself sitting on a bench simply trying to take in the beauty of this amazing fountain. The day we were there it happened to be a Roman holiday, so it was very crowded, but we found it just meant being more patient and we were still able to",
          "I made it over to the fountain on a Saturday and it was packed. However, it was an incredible sight, especially at night!",
          "enjoyed a pizza slice from the little supermarket on the corner of the fountain. Really busy place but still lovely to visit.",
          "This place is always busy but still everyone wants to see it and get close so you can throw your coin in it. It\u2019s a shame that tourists invade it for selfies and perfect profile pictures these days. It\u2019s a shame that it cannot be just admired for its beauty.",
          "Went there with my 10 and 6 year old and they both loved it. Fountain is amazing but can get busy. Don't miss it!",
          "Love this fountain. I visited twice, once in the day and once at night. I could only throw a coin in the day. It's always crowded but you still can take some great pics! A must visit when in Rome.",
          "We eventually got the correct fountain you have to stand back in awe. Seeing it is the only way to do justice to the spectacular view",
          "Such a beautiful place. It's a shame it gets let down by people constantly trying to sell you things.",
          "Obviously a must when coming to Rome. We went in the day time and the evening the latter is a much nicer experience.",
          "Stunning place to visit, third time and am still amazed at the beauty of the fountain. Great pizza and gelato cafe nearby.",
          "Another must see in Rome. The fountain is massive. We got there in the afternoon/evening and it was pretty crowded, but worth the little bit of time it took to get close.",
          "you need to show up in social media please go there and take shots its very wounderful place to take more picture with this white stone archicture",
          "Absolutely stunning go early in the morning to avoid the crowds. There a beautiful little restaurants just up off the side streets to get some amazing Italian food and wine.",
          "Must see in Rome, throw a coin in and make a wish with your back to the fountain so the story goes. Beautiful fresco behind the fountain - keep an eye out for pickpockets as its rammed with people",
          "Before we came to Rome two relatives told us that they thought that the Trvi Fountain was disappointing so we had low expectations. We now have NO idea what they were thinking but we suspect that they saw the wrong fountain! This is stunning, awesome, unforgetable, beyond",
          "Seen it over and over in the movies but didn\u2019t expect it to be so big and grandiose..sheer beauty is what I thought...all the details when you visit other countries such as France the fountains are often not on but this one is full on clean, beautiful and awe inspiring..",
          "Blimey. What a spectacle. But we visited mid Feb on a Friday afternoon and the crowd was much larger than I expected. Not sure when you could visit to enjoy without the bustle.",
          "I went to see the Trevi fountain after midnight 7 years ago and my group of 15 were the only ones there! It was fantastic. I tried that with my husband this past year and it was packed. There were tourists all over, locals selling flowers and trying to get you to buy cheap",
          "Last time we went to Fontana di Trevi, the rain caught us off guard and poured like a waterfall from the sky. This time, it wasn't the case. We walked and praying that it won't rain and it didn't. We enjoyed walking around, it was a bit crowded, but not too much like last time,",
          "It is a beautiful fountain but there were so many people. I went on the off season and still has huge crowds to deal with. Go at night or early morning!",
          "A must see place to visit, with beautiful statues, but a little over hyped especially when you want a drink nearby",
          "went twice - during the day it was packed. Went again about 7pm and it was much less busy and able to get a better look and photos/ Very impressive",
          "As I recall all the jaw-dropping sights in magnificent Rome, it's the Trevi Fountain that comes to mind the most. Approaching it from a side street, it suddenly appeared - much larger than I had imagined. It wasn't just the sheer beauty of the sculptures that got me, but the",
          "I didn\u2019t quite appreciate how special this Fountain really is .The detail typifies the richness of everything in Rome .A true cherished gem .The timing of a marriage proposal ,loud cheer added to the special short atmospheric visit . Situated a short well to the Spanish steps .",
          "Great place to visit when you visit Rome, can get crowded, but so beautiful especially during the evening",
          "So beautiful, a little hard to see with all the tourists, but well worth a visit. Be sure to look from many angles. Gorgeous",
          "Many have written the same things I would so I say ditto to most. We viewed during the day and at night. I agree it is better at night. Very crowded all the time but it\u2019s not out of your way from most things to take the journey to stop.",
          "It's a bit random, but well worth a visit if you are wandering around Rome, there are some nice bars and restaurants around too",
          "Can't explain how beautiful the Trevi is. Go at night when it's lit up is my only advice. Be prepared for crowds. This was my favourite place when I was in Rome.",
          "Constructed beginning 1732, The Trevi Fountain was designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini thirty years later. Open day-through-night, with tourists and security reliably present, Trevi is the largest Baroque Fountain in Rome and nearly",
          "Busy fountain situated amongst shops selling ice cream its a lovely place. Great place for a photo with your loved ones",
          "so whole love fountain thing is a lie... i tossed so many coins yet i am single... maybe i used the wrong hand though. dunno",
          "While in Rome you have to see the Trevi fountain. It\u2019s a special romantic place. See it in the day and night. Throw a coin over your left shoulder with your right hand. It\u2019s just a experience. Brings a smile. But watch out for pickpockets.",
          "Trevi fountain at night is beautiful. Can sit around with hundreds of other spectators and take in the environment while enjoying a gelato if you desire.",
          "Was worth the walk to find it, got there when there were less crowds, 8pm ish. Was beautiful! Definitely worth an evening visit",
          "Me and family visited here 15th February. Very busy but got lots lovely pictures. The architect absolutely stunning. Yes we threw a coin over our shoulder. We also visited it following night when was lit up. There are plenty of restaurants and cafe bars around here. Lovely ice",
          "It is worth the trip since it is seen in all movies through the decades but not what you think it will be. Its actually on the back side of a wall and CRAZY crowded all the time. Need to plan the time of day to go our your pictures will all be shadowed.",
          "This is a great place to visit in the evening even if it is crowded. Beware of anyone who doesn't look Italian and kindly disregard anything they are selling.",
          "The fountain is much bigger than I thought. It is very beautiful but there are so many people all the time so to be standing a couple of minutes to admire it, is almost impossible. Still worth a visit",
          "Really great fountain and well preserved, gets very crowded even until late at night. Not far from the Spanish Steps so plenty to see in the area.",
          "World famous tourist attraction and breathtaking at anytime of the night or day, however extremely busy and suffers from lack of any good planning by the authorities to manage the tourist numbers.",
          "Another landmark to be seen here in Rome the fountain is build In a tight environment so better going when not to busy so you make the most of it",
          "Rome is so full of many beautiful places, around every corner there is another treat! The Trevi Fountain is one such place, fantastic water and statues on the front of yet another beautiful building. Worth the visit!",
          "Ok, i wasn't looking for it, I walked round a corner and there were hundreds of people taking pictures. It looks great, and the cops whistle to tell people off. Its extravagant and watery.",
          "We visited this in the evening and it was extremely busy - lots of people trying to get to the front of the fountain to take photos. One of the tourist landmarks to tick off your list when visiting Rome, but not as inspiring as some of the others.",
          "One of the main reasons i wanted to visit Rome was to see the Trevi fountain and boy I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Spent an hour just sitting and watching all the people visiting and taking photos.",
          "We saw the Trevi Fountain in February on a beautiful morning. There are always crowds there, even in winter, so its best to go early. Don't forget to toss a coin in over your shoulder!",
          "beautiful, but beware gets very busy - its a must to go and view this beautiful monument, and of course throw 3 coins in the fountain lol",
          "The place is worth visiting but be prepared for crowds. We went on a public holiday and it was crazy. Standing room only. We then went another day and although busy, it was fine. There is plenty of shops and restaurants near the fountain. Right near the place is a great",
          "Very beautiful fountain It\u2019s crowded but you always get a great pic Be sure to take small coins to throw",
          "We went to Trevi fountain on our trip in Rome. It was one off the stops of the hop on hop off tour. It was very crowded but nice to see and beautiful.",
          "... unless you don't like fountains of course. A lot of people but worth it and close enough to the Pantheon to combine the visit and enjoy strolling through the tight roman back alleys.",
          "The Trevi Fountain, one of the most popular fountains in Rome, is an unmissable sight. We were all invited to throw coins into the fountain as it\u2019s a charitable fountain, over \u20ac3000 thrown in there each day, even more being thrown in during peak periods such as Easter and during",
          "One of the best things we did in Rome. It was so beautiful. We were there in February in the afternoon/evening time so it wasn\u2019t too busy. It is absolutely worth getting to see though.",
          "I love Trevi Fountains. This place is absolutely magical. There is something special about this place that just takes your breath away. The only problem is the sheer amount of tourists around here and trying to get that perfect shot on your camera will warrant you to be patient",
          "Have been fortunate to visit a couple of times since the beauty of this stunning landmark was restored ... marvellous sight.",
          "Must see!! We saw in the day and night and I have to recommend night as the best option. So beautiful, I did not let the crowds ruin the view.",
          "This is a must see, if you've seen la dolce vita. Rome is so crowded by tourism that its difficult to get a feel of the square where the fountain is located, so I recommend going early in the morning.",
          "It is big and beautiful. Intricate carving, but prepare to have people all around you. Even so, it is easy to get right next to the fountain to throw your coin. For photography lovers, it is difficult to get a photo without other tourist and shade is often on the fountain. Plan",
          "The Trevi Fountain is a must see when in Rome. It\u2019s the selfie capital of the universe. It\u2019s cool but way overcrowded. Try to go early Free Entry",
          "Unexpected spectacular fountain,in a little square at the confluence of several narrow streets. Dramatic statues in gushing waters-fairytale qualities",
          "The walk up to this feature along the cobbled streets and the movement itself is an experience. Arriving at the trevi fountain and seeing both in the day and the night is simply spectacular. A really beautiful and a must see !!!!",
          "Not much else to say except, it's one of Rome's show piece spots.. Get there before 8am for a quiet photo opportunity",
          "The Trevi Fountain is definitely a sight to not be missed in Rome. It's beautiful marble statues and architecture is breathtaking and although busy and a popular spot there are still plenty of spaces to admire the fountain from. Lots of lovely small restaurants and shops around",
          "Such a stunning masterpiece, so clean and well cared for. Be aware this is extremely busy, went a couple of times different days but was always rammed, people trying to get the best pictures.",
          "Beautiful place however too crowded! Plenty of tourists taking selfies, and people trying to sell you stuff!",
          "This was 1/2 block from our hotel. I was initially disappointed at the huge crowd late in the afternoon. Jam packed, in January! Also cold! But, at 4 am (I have a sleeping disorder) there was just me and the fountain! Beautiful. Oh, and 2 police in a car! I would suggest",
          "A must place to visit when visiting Rome. If you really want to have a great experience I would suggest visiting in the early hours of the morning to avoid the crowds.",
          "Absolutely monumental. Such a vast structure, & it is amazing to see during the day or the night. It is always packed with people. We went to there at 7:30am and there was only a handful of people which was much more manageable. Definitely see it!",
          "Beautiful place and wonderful piece of architecture. The only downside when visiting is the crowd. There is so many people that its difficult to breath...Something to see once in your lifetime...",
          "We were returning to our hotel by foot when we stumbled upon this beautiful place. A lot of tourists there even during the winter afternoon. Rome just happens to be the place where you accidentally see the most beautiful fountain you've ever seen. Free to visit but lots of",
          "Great at night very quite! Nice easy photos and not cramped like the daytime! Was a quick and easy visit",
          "End October 2019: I first went to this fountain in 2012 and it is so hard to find and the area around it was narrow. It is still hard to find despite better signage around Rome [many of the Hop On & Off buses stop nearby] and they seem to opened up the pathways around it just",
          "Is situated in the middle of old streets of Italy difficult to find unless you know where it is, quite busy even in cold season, will struggle to take a photo, tried to have engagement pictures done here and couldn't because of the crowds sitting on the walls. Too many women",
          "It\u2019s just like in the movies, only a bit more crowded. This is a terrific spot and water fountain with sculptures. Easy to get to this site of interest.",
          "Was on a tour and it included a visit to the Trevi Fountain. It's a beautiful location, lots of visitors. Saw it at day and at night. It is beautifully lit Because it is in an older location in Rome, there are buildings all around it. The location is not like monuments in",
          "I first came here in 1995, I threw my coin in the fountain and have been coming back every year since. Best time to visit if it\u2019s your first time is the night time. It\u2019s very special",
          "We were look to arrive in a quiet day, making the experience even more enjoyable. I loved the Fountain!!!",
          "Very simbolic place, which its nothing but a beautiful place field with love. If you have a chance to bring you other half, please do it. Best thing ever. Thank you Fontana di Trevi",
          "It was even more impressive than I thought it would be, stunning. Even though it was January, still thronged with visitors, a special place.",
          "During our stay we returned to the Trevi Fountain several times both during the day and at night. It is the most beautiful place to sit and contemplate, especially at night when the fountain is illuminated. There are always crowds there at all times of the day and evening but",
          "Very busy area. Don't sit on the water edge or you'll get whistled at by the boys and girls in blue. Make a wish whilst making a selfie. Looks to new to be believed. \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f",
          "A fountain is a fountain. It\u2019s very pretty in day and at night. Is worth a visit if you can get between the tourists. In summer there are thousands of tourists around it.",
          "Save this visit for night time!! With its waters all lit up up and sculptures illuminated it's the perfect time to throw a coin in over your shoulder to make a wish!",
          "Arrived at our hotel at 8pm and within half an hour we were enjoying the spectacle of the Trevi Fountain. Can\u2019t imagine how busy this must be in the height of season as a February evening it was still pretty packed but so worth seeing. Enjoyed a proposal whilst we were there and",
          "We was there for night city walk, it was beautiful. Most amazing fontain what I ever saw. I fell in love in this city",
          "Trevi Fountain is the largest fountain in Rome. To say fountain is to say water. flowing water, gurgling, intimidating and welcoming water. Trevi Fountain is huge, elegant, rich and extraordinarily noisy. It is the absolute master of the square and the surrounding area. Everyone",
          "don't waste your time waking up early and running to get a seat right in front of you or take pictures by yourself! always crowded !!! but, i realized that late afternoon and early evening or very late at night, the tour groups are gone and the chance of getting space and great",
          "If ever in Rome one must definitely visit the Trevi Fountain. This fountain is hands down the most beautiful fountain I\u2019ve ever seen. It is even more stunning at night when it is all lit up. I will say be prepared for a crowd, but so worth it!",
          "The Trevi fountain was my FAVOURITE attraction in Rome, it is an absolute must see. It is so beautiful and clean. There are alot of people looking to view the same thing, but with a bit of patience you will get pictures from all angles of the fountain. There are staff there who",
          "Always crowded with tourists, this is the largest Baroque fountain in this remarkable city! Just walk there, take your turn to take pictures and don't forget to throw a coin. It's a must!",
          "For anyone that has seen a number of movies set in Rome the Trevi Fountain is a must. It is a beautiful Fountain. When we were there in the middle of the day it was sardine squashed with tourists. Trying to get down to the waters edge was an exercise in itself. My husband",
          "Yes it's packed, but still a must. The fountain is so beautiful. Incredibly intricate statue work and artistic lighting and of course we had to throw in a coin each. Well worth going at different times of day to see the lighting.",
          "We visited quite early morning do there were not many people around. It is an amazing fountain and such lovely stories surrounding it. We duly threw our coins and hope our wish to return comes true.",
          "I truly remarkable sight in Rome. Close to the Spanish steps, both of which are free. Also quite entertaining watching the wannabe Instagram influencers trying to get an iconic pose.",
          "When the tour guide said we were going to see a fountain I didn't expect something so impressive. Very glad I stopped here",
          "There\u2019s so much history in Rome and everything is just stunning. Be sure to stop by the Trevi Fountain. Take a euro with you to kiss and make a wish. Be prepared for crowds all day unless you go at sunrise. You can still wiggle your way to the front of the fountain. There are",
          "This majestic fountain is mesmerizing at night. Impressive craftmanship, beautiful lit up. The sound of water is enchanting. You will never enjoy this place alone. But this is one of those places you have heard of and seen in movies.",
          "Amazing exciting place for everyone!!!!!! We went night and day , we recommended it it\u2019s like a dream !!!!",
          "We arrived in the morning and this place is full already. Was lucky to have a chance to get great photos. Water is sparkling and very clean.",
          "Having shunned the fountain during my first visit at Christmas due to the sheer amount of people, I managed to to finally see it in its full splendour during my most recent trip to Rome. Nestled in an unassuming square amongst narrow streets, suddenly you find yourself in front",
          "Feels like 1 of the places you must visit in Rome. The fountain and surrounds is beautiful and much photographed. Again, sadly the area was overcrowded, there were a number of tour parties pushing through which reduced the charm of the area. We were there in February, not sure",
          "Trevi fountain In our Europe tour during April -May 2019 by Chariot Travels , Bangalore,we stayed in hotel Midas Roma , which is situated at a strategic place , with very good services . After visiting Colosseum,as we were walking through the narrow streets of Rome ,we could",
          "Worth the walk through the busy streets to find this, it's incredibly busy. I'd recommend a night time visit, also. Still busy, but light up it is stunning",
          "The fountain is beautiful, never seen anything like it before, it's amazing to see. We went to see it one evening, it was still fairly crowded but looked lovely all lite up. A must see.",
          "It is absolutely beautiful but incredibly busy. Worth it to take that perfect shot! Oh and don\u2019t forget to throw a coin.",
          "A little crowded .. but moving around is still okay . Security is there.. so do feel safe . but please don't take my word for it . and Do take care of your personal belonging at all time . And Hope your wishes will come true.",
          "The legend holds that a coin thrown into the fountain will ensure a return to Rome. This tradition also dates back to the ancient Romans who often threw coins in the water to make the gods of water favor their journey Bach home safely. Throw in a second coin if you\u2019re seeking",
          "In a city where turning every corner gives up another architectural wonder, the Trevi Fountain is truly majestic. Its allure cannot be captured in the cinema, photos or paintings. It's a \"must see\" and I hope that the wishes cast with our coins are granted sooner rather than",
          "I excepted it to be bigger. Our guide took us there early in the morning. They clean and remove the money every morning. Luca with Vespa SideCar Tours wanted use to see the fountain when they turn back on. If you are look for a good tour look him up.",
          "guess you have to go here to throw your coin, and take a picture, But not a place to stay long, very crowded. To your right is nice nice little church to sit and visit and get away from that crowd. Also behind is benneton store for some great shopping. You must see asap",
          "I was pleasantly surprised to find the Trevi fountain and its area has been cleaned up since my last visit. It is an absolute must see during your Rome visit. It is packed with tourists taking selfies and throwing their three coins into the fountain but it is quite a quick",
          "Very beautiful place.. a place which everyone who came at Rome must see it.. lots of crows all day time..",
          "Do beware they will not let you take food on the level of the fountain. I had to move to the stone bleacher area. But still had a great view of the fountain and all the many young people posing as if they are models. Quite a show.",
          "The best hour to visit is when the sun goes down because the atmosphere is much better and also the lighting. You should definitely visit this place when in Rome.",
          "I have lost my interest in there, lot of peoples!!!!!! it was difficult to arrange a place for taking photos.",
          "Many tourists, even off season. Try to come when the sun is shining or in the evening when the lights are on",
          "Beautiful fountain and so glad we visited. Lots of places to eat and a McDonald's nearby too. Pushchairs pram stroller friendly just a few small steps if you want to get very close. Very crowded considering we went January.",
          "The fountain at night is simply magical. It is beautiful during the day but couldnt recommend a night visit enough... It will take your breath away... plus it's not super busy...",
          "Another must-see sight in Rome. Can be difficult to get close with all the tourists flooding to visit. Avoid the restaurants and coffee shops in the vicinity. A lot of nicer places a couple of minutes' walk from the fountain",
          "It's amazing but there were so many people there it was hard to get a good photo. Worth a visit though.",
          "Looks nice but nothing but a tourist trap all the shops and restaurants are all very expensive \u20ac6 for a soft drink !! At least it's free",
          "You walk down an ordinary street with tat in the shops and then stumble upon the most breathtaking sight. Beautiful stunning. Needs to be viewed at night",
          "The Trevi fountain is beautiful, a must see in Rome, both in the day and go back again for night time view, as its all lit up",
          "Even though it was January there were many people crowded round looking at this masterpiece. Amazing to see what was achieved so many years ago without technology - breathtaking and a must visit when in Rome",
          "It is a tourist attraction for sure and therefore very crowded, even in January. Even though you have to make your way through the crowds for your turn at the front, It is worth seeing and throwing in a coin.",
          "A popular tourist attraction hidden away in the streets of Roma. The film \u201c3 coins in the fountain \u201c cannot do justice to this breathtaking and beautiful aqua sculpture.",
          "Wonderful fountain, one of most crowded sites we visited. I can understand why it would be a big risk for pickpockets. I thought it was great but I thought the Pantheon and the Spanish steps were nicer.",
          "We couldn't believe this beauty was right in the middle of the city. Definitely recommend checking it out and throwing a coin in.",
          "This is a monumental work of art. But go early in the day to avoid the wall to wall tourists crowding round it.",
          "This was pretty busy even in January best to go early morning. Beautiful to look at and a must see while in Rome.",
          "The fountain was spectacular and incredibly detailed. It was beautiful and was near several good gelato shops.",
          "We didn't spend a very long time at Trevi, but it was absolutely beautiful. I'd like to just sit and look at it for a long time. There were a number of people around , but not unbearably crowded.",
          "Amazing to walk out of the cobbled streets into the Trevi Fountain a feast for the eyes. The white marble certainly does not disappoint. Can get a bit crowded however a early start will ensure time to take some amazing photos. Ideal with a loved one as it feels a special place",
          "Although this site was crowded, it was easy to find a spot to sit, watch people and enjoy the fountain. Many people were available to take our photo! We didn't see all the details of the fountain or columns until we had time to look closely at the photos.",
          "This was so beautiful! Definitely go see it but be aware that it's almost always jammed with tourists (I passed by it lots of times at different hours and it was always crowded) and also the surrounding area has the classic tourist drawbacks, such as being more expensive than",
          "I liked it during the evening when the lights comes. Crowds are big so mind your belongings \ud83d\ude0a Very clear water and don\u2019t forget to thrown a coin into the fountain to come back one day \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf40",
          "One of the most famous symbols of Rome! And yes it is beautiful. Always crowded. Day or night. But that's the best part, you can stay for hours and enjoy the atmosphere. The problem are all the scammers who want to sell you something. And they are quite pushy and annoying. So,",
          "Totally stunning sight to see in Rome. A must see for any couple. Usually crowded but you can make your way down to the fountain. But beware!! Of very friendly people willing to take your photo (Polaroid style). They\u2019ll take your photo with your camera and then offer the",
          "Very Beautiful, intricate fountain! I came back here twice. Just staring at it whilst enjoying my gelato was perfect. I visited on the month of jan that\u2019s why i think it was less crowded. I managed to take decent photos.",
          "A beautiful fountain in the middle of Rome. It isn't as big as TV and photos make it look, but lovely all the same. A famous icon well worth visiting.",
          "The Trevi fountain is Beautiful. We Visited in January 2020 on a sunny winter day. Which was perfect as it was not as busy as my summer visit in August 2018",
          "This was a great site to see but it was so crowded. Maybe visit very late at night or at sunrise to try and beat the crowds.",
          "You have to do this one early in the morning, otherwise it becomes unpleasant. But, it's beautiful and a must when in Rome.",
          "Never seen before Roman fountain (Trevi), It's so so beautiful & historic one. We had to struggle to take selfie because of a huge crowd. We three times again during our stay over 4 days. Absolutely free to visit Trevi fountain.",
          "Oh what a beautiful sight to see this place, I've only ever seen it on TV but to see it in person was a sight to behold. Tip do not let anyone take your picture with your phone or their camera as these men will charge you for it. But enjoy it",
          "The fountain is beautiful. But it is crowded with people jostling to take their photo in front of it and then move on to the next thing. Not sure how I feel about this aspect of tourism, but it is not positive. I prefer more immersive sights like the pantheon where I feel like",
          "Just wow takes your breath away. Cant consume food in the area and it's usually over crowded so dont expect to get a seat.",
          "A very special and romantic place which is transformed at night by illumination. The whole area around this feature is crammed with restaurants, too.",
          "Just followed street signs to the fountain. Suddenly at the cobble stone narrow street opens into a jam packed small square facing a fountain with huge nude statues and crystal clear water. It\u2019s breath taking !! Around the small square are little shops and restaurants. We had",
          "As one of the big attractions I guess this is always busy not much to say really be prepared for it to be very busy though nice to see at night as is lit up.",
          "Walked here on our first night in Rome. The atmosphere is festive and fun. The fountain is pretty at night with the lights and turquoise water.",
          "Absolutely stunning. Surprisingly located down a back street, I expected it to be more open air. Very very touristy obviously. Has to be visited.",
          "it is such a beautiful place to see. make sure you throw a coin and make a wish. terribly crowded but well worth seeing this piece of art.",
          "Also a must see for tourists and therefore very crowded with people taking selfies and making a wish by dropping a coin in the water. Very impressive. The film La Dolce Vita from 1960 had Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni jumping into the fountain.",
          "Trevi is definitely a must see! Be prepared to muscle your way thru the crowds. There is no good time of day to go. Just fit it into your schedule and do it. You must work your way down to the water. You must throw in your coins. We did - twice. And we returned - twice!",
          "Too many people taking selfie\u2019s Try to find a spot to sit or a time where there are few people so you can enjoy the stairs",
          "No trip to Rome is complete without a brief visit to this site. Visited Rome over a decade ago when family were much younger; they curtail the enjoyed returning as young adults to soak up the rich history for themselves. Busy all year; we visited in early Jan and still very",
          "A hot spot of the city that attracts a lot of people especially during the night. You cant miss it walking around the city.",
          "This is a real art , it\u2019s impressive! Better to visit during the daylight to appreciate it totally . Drop a small coin and make a wish ! It works :)",
          "This is amazing, well worth the trip, lots of people crowding around the Trevi fountain even in December. Lovely little pizza shop right next to it, very reasonable prices. Do not sit on the marble fountain wall Lots of police stood around to blow their whistle for anyone who",
          "I went to the Trevi fountain at night and it was very beautiful! I enjoyed it less than some of the other attractions, because there was police blowing whistles the entire time as the tourists posed for photos near the fountain. There were no (obvious) signs or spoken language",
          "Rome was just way too crowded for us. Would never go back during holiday. The Trivi fountain was so crowded (and we waited to go at night) that you had maybe 2 minutes to spend before getting shoved out of the way by other visitors.",
          "You can't miss this. I hope they still allow tourists close enough to toss coins. We were told by locals go super early in the AM for no crowds, but that didn't happen! Great shops, restaurants and a scenic church right there. We loved the experience of saying we were there!",
          "Worth visiting day and night. Was really packed with tourists at night. No place to move. Truly amazing views",
          "The fountain is a must see! It takes no time wasted in a line, it costs nothing. You would be seeing one of the greatest and largest pieces of art, ever!",
          "3days in Rome has taught me it is full of stairs and fountains. Trevi fountain is the grandest, absolutely beautiful and very easy to navigate to through the city. Best to go very early in the morning if you\u2019re wanting some quieter time and best photo opportunities. By mid day",
          "The fountain is amazing. The only thing that is not amazing is the number of people always milling around it. I would recommend seeing it at night time (also). It looks beautiful and way fewer people :)",
          "We traveled to Rome in December, off season. Although cooler, less tourists. The fountain area was not crowded and we were able to get good pictures.",
          "One of the most magnificent monuments in Rome,but you should go early in the morning because after 10 in the morning it is full of people which they push and shouting for one photograph.",
          "i have respected to the traditional thing of dropping a coin, one of the most beautifull location that i have ever found in rome",
          "Absolutely stunning...very busy but stunning... history and art..again a must see at night vs daylight. Make your wish and take in the beauty. Rome is absolutely stunning",
          "Three coins in a fountain ,is the song inspired by this most magnificent work of art .If you are romantic it is the place to see.There may be crowds but you can find a spot to gaze at the beauty of the statues, listen to the water, throw in a coin and make a wish.Yes pure bliss",
          "Worth braving the crowds for when you are up close to Te fountain you can almost imagine you have it to yourself well almost toss a coin and create a memory it\u2019s all worth it beautiful and unforgettable",
          "This a definite must see when in Rome and they look very different during the day and night so go twice.",
          "There are many tourist visiting the Fontana di Trevi, but it's worth visiting it. There is a magic feel to it, and it's close to the spanish steps, so you can visit both at a time. Children love it:)",
          "This is a very lovely fountain, and definitely should not be missed. Just be warned, it is very crowded.",
          "We loved the Trevi Fountain so much that during our 5 day stay we went to see it 4 times! It's even prettier than you see in pictures and honestly one of our favourite places to go in Rome.",
          "Didn't want to leave Rome without seeing the famous fountain. Was taken aback by the amount of other tourists but we managed to get a few good pics and it looked better in real life.",
          "This is an amazing monument, viewed either during the day, but especially at night. However, for me it was ruined by, so-called professional photographers, rudely pushing me out of the way, as they were taking pictures of customers. Totally unacceptable and left a sour taste.",
          "oNE OF THE THINGs i like about Rome is that they are really proud of their city and all the hotels have paintings either of this fountain, or the Colosseum or any of the other famous landmarks all across Rome. Trevi fountain is just magnificent, being the biggest in the world",
          "Impressive by day, magnificent lit up at night. Very difficult to get up close due to the number of visitors but we did eventually manage to get a seat for ten minutes in the evening to take it all in.",
          "We stopped at this fountain during our tour of the city. Extremely crowded by well worth the visit. Shopping in the area also looked great but unfortunately we didn't have the time. Can't wait to go back again.",
          "This is a must see, it\u2019s not under construction anymore (it was when I first visited in 2015) so this was very exciting. This place gets packed quick so try to take a beautiful picture and go. Be careful at your belongings since there are so many tourists and it gets packed",
          "Engineering feat of bringing the water from mountain and precisely calculating the force of water and commissioning natural fountains... hats off...",
          "Central position,, beautiful view and history. Beautiful photos, not too much people. Great by night too",
          "My daughter and I visited Rome last month and visited Trevi fountain in the evening. It was breathtakingly beautiful! The vibe was amazing and the streets were filled with activity and Christmas cheer. I had the absolute time of my life.",
          "A stunning fountain, and definitely worth seeing, but go early, the crowds are insane. We did try one evening and couldn\u2019t even get close. Worth reading some of the history so you get why each element was included.",
          "It was magical. I like how you are not allowed to sit on it. It is as beautiful as the movies. I enjoyed it. You don't have to stay very long. Throw a coin in and make a wish.",
          "Never mind the crowds and the tacky touristy shops, this timeless monument, hidden away down a side street and revealing itself all of a sudden cannot fail to take your breath away.",
          "This is a must see in Rome! The 1st time I viewed it I was amazed at its size and how beautiful the sculptures are! Loved seeing it at night even more fun Yan in the day !!!We were able to throw a coin in and make a wish ...although have heard back hey stopped it. Be",
          "This fountain is amazing in its detail. It is even better at night when lit up. You must follow tradition and throw a coin in the water. It is very busy there, but worth it",
          "It is a battle to see the fountain. There were far too many people. The fountain is breathtaking but the crowds dampen the experience. We had to push and shove to get a glimpse of the fountain. The surrounding area is dirty and poorly managed.",
          "In one word: amazing. Really crowded place, you can barely take a picture, but it's beautiful, especially at night.",
          "To many people for a Fontana not so great! There are better places to go around in Rome! Surrounding streets are fun to walk!",
          "Visited while in the area, not too busy and worth the walk. Recommend going early morning to avoid the rush although you can get a view from 180 degrees around.",
          "It is really worth seeing, but we were a little bit disapointed, maybe too crowdy and difficult too access.",
          "Immortalized by Fellini's La Dolce Vita , the Trevi Fountain is one of the emblematic icons of Rome. It has been fed for 2,000 years by the Aqueduct of Eau-Vierge, which owes its name to an old Roman legend. This fountain today presents the monumental face that Nicola Salvi gave",
          "Seeing the fountains and statues at night is amazing, adds a whole different dimension to an amazing sight. It's very busy, even in the off season, if there is one, but work your way down to the front so you can really take in the beauty of it all.",
          "Loved the area around the Trevi Fountain, the Fountain itself was one of my favorite places to see in Rome. It is near the Spanish steps where you will find all of the high end stores. Rome is hands down, one of the most beautiful cities and we hope to return to Italy soon.",
          "Is another must when you visit the city. Even in the late fall it was kind of crowded but still it was worth wile",
          "The first attempt to get a good view and photo of the was a struggle. Elbows and backpacks being swung around to keep their rightful space in the public place. I nonetheless strong armed my way to get a decent photo without a direct back of the head shot. I decided to get up",
          "It's a place to visit but the number of tourists makes it hard work getting a picture or close to the attraction, great Pizza House (Trevi Pizza) so go there until it gets quieter !",
          "Beautiful! Expect crazy tourists to crowd everyone out. An Asian tourist actually used my shoulder to steady his hand for a photo opportunity... without asking!!!",
          "The recently washed Trevi fountain is spectacular but if you want to photograph it go on a dull day or late in the day. Glare was thru the roof.",
          "Worth a visit. Watch out for con men and pick pockets. Grab an ice cream and go uphill to visit via venetto too \ud83d\ude0d",
          "As nice as in the picture... beautiful at night but avoid the crowd and go instead early in the morning to enjoy the moment",
          "Its the most famus fontaine in Rome, its fame is completly true, marvalus monument. I would suggest to go very early or late due to during the day its impossible to see it, its full of people.",
          "As beautiful in real life as it is in the pictures. Very busy but not too hectic you can\u2019t get a decent photo",
          "Magnificent, and much bigger than you realise looking at photos! Try to avoid peak times (0900-1900) and you\u2019ll be able to get good photos. Well lit late into the night. Walk about 5 mins in any direction to escape the overpriced tourist traps.",
          "One of the most popular tourist attractions in Rome, the fountain where people throw coins to pray for their wishes to come true.",
          "Stayed around the corner so was lucky to visit a few times at different times of the day, beautiful at night.",
          "Full of selfie takers and people ticking it off their list. Best to go early or late when it\u2019s less crowded so you can admire the beauty of the fountains.",
          "This place is insane because it\u2019s just crammed with tourists. My kids didn\u2019t even want to get up close enough to throw coins in. It\u2019s such a beautiful piece of artwork. I wish they could limit the number of people viewing it at one time. If you can go first thing in the morning",
          "It is HUGE and super crowded all the time. My tour guide said the best time to have the whole fountain all to yourself is after midnight. Watch out for touts at this famous tourist spot. It looks beautiful in the day and at night so do come visit the fountain twice to see its",
          "Any trip to Rome must have a stop at the Trevi Fountain! We arrived in the morning before the throngs of people arrive. The kids were able to throw their coin into the fountain to ensure their safe return at some point in the future. This is a nice place to take a rest",
          "The fountain itself is breathtaking, and of course you need to toss a few coins in! The crowds are crazy, and it can be hard to get all the way down to see it. Polizia carefully monitor the crowd to protect the fountain, so there\u2019s a lot of noise, between people and whistles",
          "The fountain is glorious but tucked away in a cramped Piazza it is difficult to gain a true view of this monument.",
          "One of amazing structure in Rome. This place is busy during the day and at night too it is hard to take a picture without other tourists but what do you expect when you are in a famous place :). You are not allowed to eat or drink in the lower area of the fountain. You are not",
          "Make a wish and throw from a distance - because even in December it is busy. Still lovely but just one place in an amazing city",
          "We went here at night and during the daytime. I would recommend going at night. It is a bit crowded at night but well worth the effort. It is such a beautiful place. A must-see if in Rome.",
          "The fountain it\u2019s soooo beautiful! You must go and see. Worth visit if you are in Rome. It\u2019s free. I went during the day and also night. Night was better because there was less people and the lights in the water is on. Very nice!!!",
          "Very pretty but good luck getting a good picture unless you go early early in the morning. So many people it\u2019s crazy. And we went during the slow time of the year!",
          "Girlfriend loved it, so I loved it. The fountain itself is stunning. Make sure you take time to enjoy it and not just get a photo. Also read the coin toss rules before you do that as well!",
          "Fontana di Trevi is always breathtaking!! One of the most beautiful parts not only of Italy, but of the world!!!",
          "We walked from the airbnb near the vatican to this site through the city streets. The site was amazing. In early on a December morning the visitors were light. A quick view and a few pictures and we were on our way by bus back to the airbnb.",
          "No visit to Rome will be rounded off without visiting the Trevi fountain. The fountains are very beautiful and even though there are hundreds of tourists it\u2019s still feels serene.",
          "Recommend going during off-hours. This place is always shoulder to shoulder! It's pretty hard to get good photos when there are so many people around you. We thought it would be less crowded in December, which is was, but still overwhelmingly uncomfortable near the water.",
          "Like the bull in NYC and the Bean in Chicago, this attraction is incredibly crowded. It is absolutely awe-inspiring and worth a look. The fountain is huge, about a block wide. But every time we walked by, the crowds were 4-5 people deep. Wish we could have seen it unobstructed,",
          "This fountain is an absolute work of excellence and it is much larger than the photos show. Dont forget to make a wish by tossing a coin!",
          "Must see fountain where you meet the world and our many cultures. Excellent art. Highly recommend. Remember to throw your coin into this historic monument",
          "A must visit on your walking tour of ancient Rome but to be honest, just a fountain with a mass of people surrounding. I didn't bother pushing my way through to the front, and I didn't throw a coin over my left shoulder. But I hope I'll be back to Rome one day.",
          "What a beautiful monument, has always been on the wish list. Visited with a tour group. Please note was very crowded and we could not go straight up to the fountain, We where up one level. Beware of scammers trying to take your photo for money, also pick pocketers.",
          "This is not what we expected when we came across it - just so so much better than we thought that it would be and WoW what a sight. We just stood and stared at the fountain and the detail in the sculptures - highly recommended.",
          "It was a stunning site, in the heart of Rome, especially that we got there in the evening and the lights highlight the fountain itself as well as the sculpture and the building. After taking pictures, throwing the coins and making wishes, we took a pause and just admired the",
          "Beautiful fountain, but it is crowded with tourists (myself included). There are a lot of street vendors, so I would also advise to be on the lookout for pickpockets.",
          "We visited this fountain twice when we recently visited Rome....once in the day time and once during the evening...which was definitely better as the fountain is all lit up at night and was stunning. The security guards were keeping the tourists from sitting on the walls but you",
          "It is huge, famous and there are always a lot people. Take a while, stop taking photos and look at the details of the sculptures.. I find this a good way to appreciate this work of art.",
          "A delightful and \"must see\" landmark! Makes you want to sing \"three coins in a fountain\" and make a wish.",
          "A compulsory place to visit in Rome. Beautiful photos must be taken and you should throw coins so that you definitely revisit Rome again.",
          "A must see when you visit Rome , it's always full of people day or night ! The sculptures are awesome and the when complex of the monument and fountain keeps you there !!!",
          "The Trevi Fountain is a must see for those who want to return to the enchanted country of Italy. Just make sure that you remember your coins. Did I forget to mention that the Trevi Fountain is a spectacular site and feast for the eyes.",
          "A beautiful fountain! Tourists still throw coins into the fountain. Security watches carefully so don't sit on the edge or they'll whistle to let you know! Grab a gelato from the little place that's right next to the fountain and eat while you watch and listen to the water",
          "So Beautiful one of the place more beautiful in the world. i love this place i love italy. We return in March 2020",
          "Amazing landmark would definitely come to see again. A must see on any visit. Visited with family and was definitely worth it.",
          "Loves the fountains, beautiful! Very busy and hard to get close to.... the streets around are lovely. We choose to stop at a nearby bar and celebrate with champagne and people watch... \u2764\ufe0f",
          "A must to see in Rome even though it gets very crowded. Lovely architectural fountain steeped in history.",
          "This has to be the most beautiful fountain I have ever seen. You could stare at it for hours as there is so much to take in from just one structure. The only issue I had is that it was packed with other tourists so it was tough to get a good picture. Even with that, it was an",
          "The beauty of the fountain has been recently enhanced by a skilful clean thanks to the people at Fendi. Be aware of the rules about sitting and eating on the steps near the fountain. Take a water bottle and get a sample to drink.",
          "Not our first visit Won\u2019t be our last Busy as usual even in December Hard to get to front But better view from back anyway",
          "A legendary fountain that takes your breath with the detailed and beautiful sculptures. I visited at day time and it was beautiful but when came back at night time I was amazed with the beautiful lighting.",
          "We enjoyed visiting the fountain, but it was way too crowded to fully enjoy. Arrive early or late to avoid the crowds.",
          "gets very busy and overcrowded you be lucky to get near the fountain. lots of security there to stop people Jumping in . worth a visit though",
          "I visited on a cold, wet early winter day and it was extremely busy, so may people at this attraction. there were police controlling the crowd and monitoring the fountain for people who where not doing the right thing. you were able to see the fountain but needed time to get to",
          "Place of many legends. Once you are there you must see it. But it is not easy as there are always a lot of people. You cannot get directly near the fountain as there is a fence which makes it quite hard to throw a coin over your shoulder into the fountain - you should try but",
          "The Trevi Fountain is magical! It spans a city block and draws crowds even in the off season. The fountain is stunningly beautiful. A must see!",
          "Don't go in the middle of the day, it is so crowded you can't get near, Early morning or evening is probably best. People were queuing 10 deep and that was in November!",
          "Beautiful sculptures and fountains in a small square. Nice to have seen it. Please avoid cafes nearby as doubly expensive to those a few streets back.",
          "The great beauty :La Fontana di Trevi in Rome. The exceptional Capital of my Nation, has a lot of monuments and attractions, it's no simply to describe theyr magnificent.",
          "In this summer I spent time all over the Europe and one place that i visited in Italy was this fountain. I have been in Italy before but not have seen this before. All my family members were just wowed by this view.",
          "This fountain is just as beautiful as on the pictures. Throw a coin over your sholder in there and you will have luck in your life. You could just sit there and stare and stare because it is so beautiful. In the middle of the city centre.",
          "this was on my must do things when visiting Rome and was a bit disappointing. Not the fountain it'self but the whole area was just surrounded by stalls and people selling cheap merchandise. They need to ban these people from the area as it ruins the attraction - or and selfie",
          "When we first went it was empty as maintenance was being done however we couldn't leave Rome without seeing the Trevi Fountain with water so we went back the next day. Apart from the crowds we were glad we did.",
          "It's like what you see on the movies and books. It was a bit crowded, but the guide said this was not bad. By the way, you are not allowed to sit at the fountains edge and also not allowed to touch the water. There are securities around will watches everyone. I think it's",
          "The fountain itself is beautiful. Although a little breezy due to the water. The location of the fountain lets it down. It is very secluded and requires a map or sat nav or directions to find it otherwise it would be an impossible find. It's a very small square with shops,",
          "The Trevi Fountain simply cannot be missed. It is absolutely beautiful. We've been a few times and it is always over crowded. You just have to go when you have the time and patience. It's certainly worth it.",
          "Although it is a \"must see\" in Rome I cannot fathom what the crowds are like in peak season. They were 6 to 8 rows deep I early November! The nearby gelato store was the best part of this fountain.",
          "Visited the Trevi fountain during the night as well as day. Everyone in our group agreed that the night visit was much better as the area is lighted up and appears a lot more romantic and atmospheric than visiting during the day where it is \u2018duller\u2019 with only white marble to see",
          "My best friend and I traveled to Italy in November of this year and Trevi was one of the highlights of our time in Rome! This fountain is so beautiful and made me feel like I was in the movie \"Roman Holiday\"! We tossed the coin over our shoulder as the legend goes to return to",
          "We've stoped by while crusing around the old part of Rome and landed on it. Tough to get close, I can't imaging in the high season. The fountain is nice but not worth the detour...",
          "Amazing view, lots of crowd (careful of pickpockets), best gelato around, but the night view is really good.",
          "Even in November (off season), it's crowded! Regardless, still larger and more impressive than I/we we imagined.",
          "No doubt it's the fountain everyone must see. This place is like a Roman trade mark since it was filmed so many times. But plan to be there at a very early morning unless you really enjoy a huge and very noisy crowd around it, especially during a very late evening.",
          "We were in Rome twice. On our first visit we were on our own, not on a tour, so we went to see the fountain early in the morning. There were only a few people around and we got great views. On our second visit to Rome, we went past it much later in the day and it was wall to",
          "spectacular view...easy walking distance and close to other historic sites. also close to gelato and refreshments",
          "The Trevi Fountain itself is amazing and I highly recommend it. Just be careful as there are people there trying to get you to pose for them and take your picture for a fee. I wish the Italian authorities would run them off as they are a nuisance. I almost got into a fight with",
          "Beautiful, especially at night. We walked past the fountain at 1am, the crowd had left, it was raining, and absolutely beautiful. Beware of pick pockets. A gentleman who kindly offered to take our photo had warned us of people sending their children up to pick pocket!",
          "The Trevi fountain.. Most famous in the world.. Its a very beautiful fountain.. amazing design..very big and just amazing to look at..",
          "This is quite frankly the most amazing fountain I\u2019ve ever seen. It gets really crowded and there\u2019s lots of people selling tat that don\u2019t seem to know how to take no for an answer, so you need to go super early if you want to escape them. Nevertheless you can still get great pics",
          "When in Rome, you most do as the Romans!! You will see many fountains, but this is Trevi Fountain and besides all of the romance and allure surrounding this beautiful fountain, it is all that it appears to be!! Beautiful, and charming and not too many people in November!!",
          "Visiting in mid-November was great because there were less crowds and we had ample opportunity to view the site for a prolonged time. Truly amazing. Had a great gelato nearby - rather expensive but a real treat",
          "A beautiful place. Amazing art. A magical fountain. Be aware of the big crowds. Try to also visit the fountain at night. It is really amazing with the lights.",
          "Best seen at night, it lacks the majesty in daylight becoming just another fountain, but WOW under cover of darkness once those floodlights come to life it's a sight to behold.",
          "Wow, this beautiful fountain is just unbelievable, breath taking. On our first night exploring the city we stumbled across the fountain without actually looking for it. At night it is totally breath taking with all lights & alot quieter. We were there around 10pm & there were",
          "A must while in Rome....the fountain is just so pretty and the crowd wasn't real bad in November so go then",
          "A must see when traveling to Rome. The city is so filled with wonderful things to see that you become numb after awhile. No matter what, a must see is the Trevi Fountain. It is simply mesmerizing. The many and varied sculptures are astounding. It is hard to fathom the time and",
          "As far as fountains go this must be the best. Very fine marble statues and water fall. Obviously a tourist attraction so crowded even out of season! Not sure why you can\u2019t sit on edge but Police with whistles on you very quick if you try.",
          "Its sheer scale is overwhelming. Go early in the day if you want to try to get a picture without giant crowds, as they only get larger as the day goes on. Weekend insane, weekdays more manageable.",
          "very interesting to see, masses of tourists in the area, but worth the crush. Local guide did give some misleading information which we were able to amend.",
          "The Trevi Fountain was a highlight to my trip in Rome. Although the fountain is rammed with tourists and the ear piercing sound of security staff blowing whistles each time someone attempts to sit on the feature is a bit intense, once you manage to get to it, it\u2019s beauty is",
          "The fountain itself is absolutely stunning! The clear blue water and the massive sculptures truly captures your eyes and puts you in an awe, BUT even during off season it is extremely packed, almost impossible to squeeze your way through. We went twice, the first time during",
          "I love the atmosphere here. Yes, it's packed full of tourists but the hustle and bustle to fight your way to the front to throw in your coin just adds to the experience. Don't be one of those people who get in others' way or sit on the wall or you'll get the whistle from the",
          "The fountain itself is very beuatiful but the massive overcrowding, pushing and shoving and trying to step over the poor people begging was a little oppressive. I found it very sad that people were that absorbed with getting a picture that they were literally falling over the",
          "Best to come at night. Still crowds but cooler and the water and lights are pleasing. Watch for scammers, pick-pockets, and other harassing people. The fountain is beautiful and a wonderful example of Baroque architecture and art.",
          "Rome is so wonderful and I always want to come back. Throwing a coin ensures I will be back. This place was packed with tourists wanting to get their selfie.",
          "This is my favorite place in all of Rome. Be prepared for the crowds but overlook heads too see the grandeur.",
          "Yes, a worthwhile stop for 10-15 minutes. View it, snap three pictures, and you are on your way! Rome has so much to offer.",
          "Even if the majority of people only care to get their picture taken, you dont need to be a history major to appreciate just how magestic this fountain is. The details, the concept and the beatiful work done for it have very rightfully given it its iconic status. Impossible",
          "I loved visiting the Trevi Fountain and it\u2019s just mesmerizing to be standing so close to such a brilliant work of art. I visited during peak season and because it was so hot, I got the perfect shot that I wanted of the trevi fountain in just a few minutes! It definitely wasn\u2019t",
          "Extremely busy at day and night. If you're patient you can get good pics. Sitting on the wall is forbidden but it is funny to watch people who are completely unaware of this and sit on the wall, whilst at the other end of the fountain is a 'guard' screaming at them get off the",
          "It's definitely one of the best fountains in Rome. I would totally recommend a visit at night it gets even better!!!",
          "Offcourse when in Rome you have to visit the trevi fountain. It is absolutly beautifull. Insanely crowded but worth it. Throw in a coin, or two, or three, depending on your wish.",
          "This piazza is really worth going out of your way to visit, day or night. I found myself just hanging out for a while, listening to the water, enjoying the vibe of happy visitors... It's really beautiful.",
          "By seeing the sights in November...on a good day...it may be rainy season; you eliminate the crowds, the heat, the CROWDS",
          "Couldn\u2019t imagine visiting Rome without seeing this amazing site. Make sure you bring your coin to make a wish. Be aware of the street peddlers that offer you cheap trinkets. They are persistent and they are everywhere.",
          "Super crowded, lots of scammers, watch you stuff when there. The scale of the fountain is remarkable.",
          "A beautiful, spectacular piece of architectural history. We went in the quiet season (late November), but it was still quite crowded. Great for photographs. A 10 to 30 minute visit depending on whether you want to stay and take in the ambience.",
          "Seriously, turning the corner to look upon the fountain was one of the most incredible moments of my life, truly magnificent-it was so big. Go early, like ~7:45 for good photos, honestly the water is so blue, it's incredible.",
          "The Trevi fountain has been beautifully restored and is charming however it\u2019s let down by the huge crowd and street sellers.",
          "It was easy to find from the Big Bus Hop on Hop off stop but the plaza was super crowded.

          "We walked down the Spanish steps and in 5 mins reached the Trevi Fountain. Way to busy to get anywhere near but overall impression is that it is smaller than we imagined. Also found the street sellers a real nuisance. Please Rome try and control these aggressive sellers.",

          "One tour guide told us that 1/2 of the people at the fountain are tourist and then the other 1/2 that look like tourist are looking to pick your pockets. He probably exaggerated on that but the main point which is a word of caution in this typically wall to wall packed square",

          "The Trevi fountain is in the slap bang middle of Roma, which immediately also explains why it is so crowded! Beautiful fountain of course, very grand and sculptural. Good for some quick admiration, some pics and maybe a coin toss, but longer than that and you will want to drown",
          "If you like heaving crowds, selfie sticks and misplaced (but excellent) sculpture this is for you. it is at least close to good shops, but the inevitable tourist trap cafes and restaurants. There are better places o go in Rome",

          "We stayed only a few minutes because of the huge crowd. Ten minutes was long enough to see the fountain and to have at least 10 street vendors ask us if we wanted to buy selfie sticks. I guess this is maybe a must see, but you probably won\u2019t want to stay long.",
          "When in and around Rome I would recommend a trip to the Trevi Fountain. Of course it's usually really busy, especially during the day but once again out can chill out and take it all of its splendour in We chose to return a few times, the last time at night. Being all lit up",

          "Great baroque masterpiece. If you really want to enjoy the sculpture in its details, then take time to watch it from the sides or little distance...rather than fighting among the crowd for a selfie.\ud83d\ude44 Reading about the meaning of the sculpture is also recommended..adds an extra layer of enjoyment.",

          "Amazing fountain! Would recommend arriving before 8am to get a good photo opportunity without many people. Often crowded from 11-18:00. Sunset is best time for portraits - light bounces off buildings facing the fountain and lands on your face as you pose in front of the fountain.",
          "Iconic fountain. Everyone knows they want to go here to throw their coin(s) into the fountain, so there\u2019s always a large crowd, but then everyone just seems to loiter and wonder how much time they are supposed to spend gazing at the \u2026",

          "A must see in Rome.  Find a walking tour and have the guide explain to you the awesome back story of it.They say in the summer, $3000\u20ac is removed a night from the fountain. Crazy or what... Make a wish while you are here.  Your right hand over your left shoulder \ud83d\udc9c",

I also don't recommend touching the walls as the police will whistle as you. Found that out after our pictures \ud83d\ude02",
          "Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic place,  could be magical,  but even in the off season is very  crowded, a pickpocket's dream.  I would suggest going early in the morning.  The Pantheon is close  by is so much more.",
          "Very busy but still a good place to tick off the list. Seemed to have good security with armed police and officers in the area which was good. Hard to get a good picture with the number of people however and lots of litter due to the sheer volume of people",
          "I'll never be grateful enough for such a stunning masterpiece.",
          "This was one of the very special places in Rome for me.  The water is rushing, there is marble in every corner of your photo lens.  The sunlight hits it just right around noon.  Go there and throw the coin, then have some gelato and people watch! Photos as of February 2020.",

In the middle of a shopping area surrounded by cafes and restaurants. Close to other historical buildings. Spent there like 10-15 minutes I think.",
          "The fountain is a beautiful surprise, hidden between buildings where 3 streets (tre vie) meet.  Get close enough to see the details and marvel at all the flora and fauna that have been carved into the rocks, which you'll miss unless you look closely",

          "It is a fabulous and larger in real life than the pictures give it credit. The only issue was the sheer hoards of people all literally taking selfies in front of it! Definitely worth going to as it is beautiful",
          "We came here recently for the winter to avoid the crowds but dang the crowds were still crazy. Other than that its so beautiful and picturesque. Just try to strategize in getting that perfect shot. We came back here twice, in the morning and evening. The night scene is also pretty. Dont miss it!",
          "Fountain with beautiful carving. Come in early morning to avoid crowd",
          "Heavily crowded!!\nI visited for the new year celebration and the crowd was hilarious. Not even enough space to place our feet. My suggestion is to visit during any normal day in order to enjoy the place and speciality of it. Avoid visits during festive days",
          "This fountain is absolutely breathtaking! I went in mid-November at 10 pm. It was raining a little, but there were limited people present. Try to avoid peak times if you don't like a crowd... but the fountain is well worth seeing while in Rome.",
          "The polished stone, crystal blue fountain and simmering buzz of excitement from visitors really made for a great visit. Especially at night where the fountain is lit up in spectacular fashion.",
          "Trevi Fountain. It's an old fountain. Fortunately when we visited it wasn't too busy. The fountains were recently cleaned and refreshed. Fun place to visit in the middle of Rome. Beautiful architecture with so many different carvings to look at. Get down close if you can.",
          "It's beautiful and magnificent . We visited while we were out for evening walk. Good place if you want to click some nice pics",
          "This place has got amazing vibe.  Tossing  the coin in the fountain was so much fun . From kids to elders this place is so full of life.",
          "The most famous fountain in the world. The only way to appreciate it in all of its splendor and take decent pictures is to go at 4am in the morning. During that time, you'll have it all for yourself",
          "Worth the 15 cents I threw in there. Although the policeman won't let you to sit on the fountain.\n\nBut being serious it's really nice in there. I'd say it's the prettiest place in the city",
          "Beautiful Fountain with larger than life sculptures and carvings. Clean water and a fountain connecting 3 streets. Trevi Fountain is a very famous spot amongst tourists and will always be crowded by them. Best time to visit is anytime in day after 9:00am. Fountain is open till midnight so one can enjoy the night view also.",
          "Nice place, an interesting point in the city's history.\nGo very early or later in the evening,  unless you like crowds!\nOh and a local guide informed us that the right way to throw the coin is to hold it in your right hand,  with your back to the fountain,  and throw the coin over your left shoulder with your eyes closed!!!",
          "Such an impressive work of art. A must see when you are in Rome. However the crowd is crazy as well. Even in off season its very busy in the weekend. Highly recommend to go during a weekday.",
          "Beautiful place..rush is there but worth it.... There are some gelatin ice cream shops that serve fabulous ice creams for 15-20 euros.",
          "Great famous place in Rome. A lot of tourists, but January is not so busy like summer time. I recommend. Today was 18 deg C",
          "Beautiful place to visit, even at night while it\u2019s all lit up. It\u2019s definitely a tourist trap though so be on the look out for pick pockets. If you\u2019re visiting Rome on a short trip, download and follow the Rick Steves audio walking guide. \u2026",
          "Absolutely beautiful. It was raining on a Sunday so there weren't as many people as it typically would be. Walking down the road then all of a sudden seeing this monument it its beauty was wonderful. Take note of all of the detail put into this architecture. Many shops and many other historical statues in the area.",
          "We visited at nighttime and the crowd was not too bad specially for not beeing during the summer time. We had a great time",
          "Wonderful. Even if you don't like fountains. Or sculptures. Or being outside. Or people (it's always full). Still wonderful",
          "Just Beautiful. Make sure you throw a coin in to ensure your return!",
          "The fountain itself is 5/5. The crowds make it 1/5. It feels like you stepped into an elevator that had been packed to the brim (... if elevators had brims). It will take you good several minutes to elbow and push your way to the fountain. \u2026",
          "What an amazing sculpture, definitely something you have to visit. I'd recommend going early in the morning though to avoid the crowds",
          "One of the most beautiful places in Rome. Definitely a must see, but it can be too crowded sometimes. It is better to visit very early morning as well during the night time.",
          "Beautiful and grand - the fountain is best scene at night. The lights and the atmosphere are magical. Crowded, but manageable with the family - an absolute must see during a trip to Rome.",
          "Having seen it once I'm in no hurry to go back.  Free to visit which is good.  But the crowd of tourists and angry whistling police trying to control everyone makes it great to see only once.",
          "I visited twice during my trip to Rome, once during the day and once at night and it was absolutely stunning both times.\nThe crowds can be a bit much so best to go very early in the morning or very late at night. However, nothing can take away from the beauty of this sculpted fountain. A treat for all!",
          "The most crowded place in Rome that I met. \nThe fountain is the greatest out of any doubts! I recommend it for visiting for sure! Don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s prohibited \ud83d\udeab to sit on it, even for taking a photo! ;)",
          "Most amazing place in Rome. Very romantic",
          "Simply stunning. No visit to Rome would be complete without visiting the Trevi. Love it.",
          "Absolutely beautiful fountain that has recently undergone restoration & cleaning. The area is very busy with tourists but you have to see this wonder of the world. Spectacular sculptures & architectural design. I loved it \u2764",
          "It was beautiful! I went when most of the city was closed so it was soooo crowded here.  Beware you might have to wiggle your way to the front to take a picture and throw a coin into the fountain.",
          "Love it. Let\u2019s cross our fingers and toes to see if the wishes come true. It was absolutely beautiful. I really loved it.",
          "What can I say about Trevi Fountain. It's an old fountain. Fortunately when we visited it wasn't too busy. The fountains were recently cleaned and refreshed. Fun place to visit in the middle of Rome. Beautiful architecture with so many different carvings to look at. Get down close if you can.",
          "Crowded place. There is nobody and nothing around but when you come over to the fountain there is like a 10.000 people in one place taking selfies and doing absolutely nothing and watching the fountain. The fountain is awesome but the atmosphere is a definite no no.",
          "Beautiful both during the day and at night. Just wish it wasn't so crowded but it is one of the most popular tourist places so it's understandable",
          "Beautiful, iconic and picturesque. A little hard to find and always crowded, but worth it to get the perfect view. At time of writing there's talk of bringing in barriers to stop people going into the water.",
          "The iconic Trevi fountain, a must see in Rome  A nice place to stop and sit while walking around.",
          "Trevi Fountain is beautiful. I had seen pictures so many times but never realized it was built on the back of a palace. Amazing. It is a must see and has a great history. I gave 4 stars only because it is really dirty around the fountain. \u2026",
          "Very beautiful place. Its quite crowded with people from all over the world . Though the place is crowded , still people love to sit and  persistently search for a place so that they can take a picture of them with the beautiful background . Coin tossing is a tradition over here and people believe that the wishes do come true .",
          "You can\u2019t miss this spot when you are visiting Rome. Iconic and majestic.",
          "Absolute must-see if in Rome! I went early in the morning to avoid crowds, and it was easy to get down to the water. I went later in the evening as well when the sunset was coming up, and it was PACKED with people everywhere. I was able to \u2026",
          "Very beautifully lit fountain with stunning sculptures. An iconic must-see. Grab a gelato or coffee and savor the moment. Deducted one star from the overwhelming crowd :)",
          "The Trevi Fountain is a fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini and several others. Standing 26.3 metres (86 ft) high and 49.15 metres (161.3 ft) wide, it \u2026",
          "It's big, impressive and always busy but well worth a visit day and night. I think night time gives the best photos!",
          "Magnificent fountain/sculpture that should be on the list of things to see when you visit Rome. Be sure to visit both day and nighttime since it is almost like two separate experiences. Count on this being a crowded place any time of day though.",
          "Legend says throw a coin into the fountain and you will come back to Rome. Very beautiful sight. I will also visit this place whenever I am in Rome.",
          "Breathtakingly beautiful. Watch out for people trying to take your photo and charge you for it. They will offer to use your phone as if being kind and want money before they give you your phone back! Saw it happening to so many people. Just say no!",
          "Walking in Rome is fun. You see so much more when you walk. You get close to the locals and learn and taste the authentic flavors of Italian food. Trevi fountain is on huge attraction. And there are many paths to take you there. Google map does a pretty good job of finding a walking path to it.",
          "Uniquely located in the heart of Rome metropolitan. It\u2019s beautiful and no wonder for the crowd you can find always in front of this art peace which try to take a photo. If you want to find it empty you can be there very soon in the morning or very late in the midnight. Anyway don\u2019t miss this gem.",
          "I just recommend. Go early, like 7.30am early, you actually get to hear the water and it\u2019s so peaceful. Anytime after that and it gets hectic as. Best of luck",
          "Saw it the night all of Italy went into lock down so no one was there. Cool without people crowding around it.",
          "One of the best places to visit in Rome, Trevi Fountain is said to hold a promise that you'll come back to Rome again. Hence, most travellers see this destination at the end of their trip. A serene atmosphere, hopeful tourists and wonderful \u2026",
          "8 years ago I went and it was trashed and crowded. I just went again last night and had a great time. The area is clear, well patrolled,  and just a great atmosphere.  Grab a gelato and sit for a spell...you'll be glad you did!",
          "Went during Christmas time in Rome. In the mist of the area of small merchant stores is the Trevi fountain. A most beautiful fountain well visited. Be sure to toss a coin with your right hand over your left shoulder. A must see.",
          "Beautiful, but absolutely packed with tourists. If you go first thing in the morning, you can take nice pics. Not much to do but seeing the fountain and photographing it.",
          "The fountain is very beautiful.  It's best to go early to beat the extremely large crowd.  It was very hard to get a good photo of myself. But it's a must see.",
          "Beautiful Roman landmark, but don't be brokenhearted if you miss it. Even on a cold day in February, which is considered low season, there are hufe crowds. And beware of the guys who offer to take your picture with your camera as you're \u2026",
          "Prepare to be surrounded by people coming from all directions! The fountain itself is quite remarkable and well worth the hustle and bustle. On the whole people are very patient and polite offering to take photos for one another and the area is heavily policed.",
          "Beautiful place. Statues are so attractive. However, if you want to take a picture you should go before 10 am.",
          "Very grand and impressive, however when I went back to visit again, the barriers had been placed. I understand why this happened but it spoils the experience and the view vastly.",
          "It's beautiful piazza but it can be very crowded. My husband and I spent 6h around the fountain admiring its inspiring architecture. We had an ice-cream around the fountain. We noticed that we are not allowed to seat around the edge of the fountain. Just be aware of it.",
          "Great place to see at night. We've been there at about 20:00 and it was full. Just grab a slice of pizza, sit down on the pavement and as always... enjoooooy!",
          "Absolutely beautiful and well worth the visit! On my original visit there was no barrier and we managed to get real close to the fountain however when we returned a few days later a barrier had been put in place. This spoilt the experience \u2026",
          "Amazing place, amazing city... A place where you have to go without hesitate.",
          "Extremely crowded but once you get a nice spot to sit, you can fully enjoy the beauty of this piece of art! This was one of my favourite places. We googled the role of each statue and their story which made the experience a whole lot more enriching!",
          "I saw this fountain at night. Its really beautiful , the lightning gives it an additional up. Then 2 days later I went there during the day. It had another beauty to it. You  should see it at night first  and later by day.",
          "Beautiful place it's love point you go there for wishing something. Mostly people go with their life partners and lovers.",
          "Nice place, but, for today's standards, it looks to plain. It was probably a great fountain centuries ago.\nThere are much better ancient fountains in India\nYou get good icecream around this place",
          "amazing ,the craftsmanship and the history behind it ,definitely need a guide to explain the history of the trevi fountain to give it the justice it deserves.  I would be proud to have that in my city.",
          "Gorgeous fountain in Rome and a must-see for all visitors love the Trevi fountain and wish it was a little bit less crowded and more of a romantic feel. It's gorgeously carved, huge, and you at least have to walk by it a few times while in \u2026",
          "Amazing fountain. Must see in Roma. The place is busy all the time. In middle of night as well.",
          "Not much changes here, still a magical area very clean and very popular with tourists, local police on hand to stop you sitting on the edge of the rim around the fountain, blowing their whistles at offenders. Clear blue water in the fountain and magnificent sculptures at its head, a must visit when visiting Rome.",
          "Please drink hot water after every three four hours\nAnd drink hot tea with cardamom and cinnamon",
          "The most beautiful fountain in the planet, would give 10 stars.",
          "Stunning place!!!! If you wanna take beautiful pictures I recommend you to go around midnight. The place looks more beautiful and quite. Usually during the day there are a lot of tourist, also it could be a good idea to appreciate this place during the day and at night. Two different scenarios",
          "It was amazing to see. This is a must see if you ever get to go to Rome.",
          "The fountain is great, but the whole experience its a little bit tricky. The piazza ia almost full at almost any hour of day, so it nearly Impossible to have your moment with almost 1000 people in a small piazza. Visiting in the late night seems to be the best way to visit the Trevi Fountain.",
          "Amazing place! This place is breathtaking! I arrived there early in the morning, at 7:30 am, so in that way, the place was not crowded with people, making the experience nicer. I recommended get at the fountain at least before 8:30 am, it is the time where people come to show up!",
          "Fantastic place. One big downside is tourists but obviously that is something that wont change so you have to take it as part of the experience.\nI have now been three times to Rome and seen the Trevi twice. Its a beautiful fountain and \u2026",
          "U go to Rome, u have right away this FOUNTAIN in ur mind. \nWorth going without a question! Take some time with u, to get the Spirit \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Such an iconic site, so being able to see it and pass by it was excellent. Such exquisite work, and feeling the excitement of the other tourists around you is quite the buzz.",
          "As heard of it and saw it in late 1960's picture, it was not that magnificent may be because seems like sandwiched between the trail of other buildings in the vicinity blocking the profound view but still one of the great Italian art work.....",
          "Beautiful fountain with statues around it. The coffee shops and the atmosphere around it is nice, especially during the evening. But it gets crowded a lot of the times, you need to pick a good time for a good photo!",
          "This is very busy as you would expect it is packed full of tourists.  There are constant guards to make sure you don't sit on the fountain (please be respectful) best views are from the side.  If you have to go all the way down again try \u2026",
          "Come early to beat the crowds, otherwise it could take thirty minutes to move thirty feet. But don't let the crowds scare you away, this magnificent historical fountain is well worth the elbow jostling if you can't make it early. Simply put, this is an incredibly beautiful site which looks even better in person.",
          "This is the prettiest monument in Rome. You have to see it at night, because it is just beautiful. Don't be startled. There are many people proposing to their significant other. But the most important thing is: Don't sit on the outburst of the fountain.",
          "A spectacular and beautiful monument! Great ambience created by the sound of the fountain and its sheer size. Be wary of the massive crowds though. The area around the fountain has plenty of good stores and restaurants. All in all, a must visit!",
          "Beautiful architecture, amazing sight. Very busy, but managed to capture some great shots.",
          "SUPER HELPFUL TIP!!\nI visited Rome in the summer and it was very crowded and hot. Going to Trevi Fountain early in the morning helps with both of these things. There are only a few people and it is easier to get clear pictures.",
          "Beautiful, even better at night. Lots of places to eat and easy to get to.",
          "Beautiful hidden delight, in the heart of Rome, surrounded by lots of restaurants and stores , whether you want to grab a snap shot picture , or sit and relax in the ambiance of the fountain, Definitely a must see, and most importantly a flip of a coin into the fountain for good luck :-)",
          "I had the pleasure of visiting this place twice. Once in winter and another in summer and the difference is night and day! The crowds in the summer are unbelievable. You won't be able to frame a good shot or even go close. However, it is a \u2026",
          "Beautiful and whenever I can will always go back to see it \ud83d\udc95 I was there a month before the quarantine so still experienced it together with 1000000 people haha",
          "Beautiful, yet crowded. One most know what lies ahead. Manage expectations and it will be worth it.",
          "Checked it on night seems to be a better experience than day. Wasn't so crowded and you can take some good pics as well.",
          "A beautiful place, but usually very overcrowded during the day. Maybe try going there early in the morning? Probably would be a much nicer experience.",
          "Surprisingly fun place to visit.   The fountain fills a small Plaza whose only approach is from one of several alleyways.   In the evening it is well lit and dramatic.   We heard it was always crowded and our visit seemed to bear this out.   Still we enjoyed the atmosphere of friendly crowds and souvenir hawkers.",
          "The Trevi Fountain was a great piece of history and quite a sight. Note that there isn't really much \"to do.\" It's basically enjoy the impressive sight, then go on your way. It is surrounded by a myriad of shops, though.\n\n*NOTE: Be sure to make a trip after dark as well to see the fountain illuminated.",
          "The most beautiful fountain I have ever seen! We threw a coin in so we will definitely be back!",
          "Lovely place. Beautiful architecture \nWorth the walk and visit \nLots of tourist taking photo",
          "Must see, however there are many other gorgeous places in Rome to visit that are just as beautiful and not as crowded.",
          "Very beautiful, especially at night. It\u2019s a must to visit if you\u2019re in Rome, and if you want to, you can also throw a coin into the fountain. The legend says that if you do so, you\u2019ll return to Rome in the future or something like that. A \u2026",
          "Very busy tourist trap. Maybe one of the worst. Be ready for a sea of tourist you have to maneuver through. Then the constant sound of whistling from police at tourists behaving badly. Worth a quick stop to say you have seen it, but there is nothing romantic or enjoyable about it anymore.",
          "Simply beautiful especially later on when the crowds thin",
          "This is definitely a must see attraction when you visit Rome. On initially visiting the site it will seem very crowded but don\u2019t let that put you off. Can actually make your way through the crowd and get to some of the nice parts of the \u2026",
          "Beautiful area.  But then again  I would go back to Rome anytime. Loved my time there and the rest of Ital3.",
          "Magnificent! Simply magnificent!\nThe amazing sculptures and the fountain itself is a gorgeous creation!\nHundreds of tourist hustling to get a good selfie is a bit of a irritation when it comes to enjoy the view. But if you can find a corner for yourself, you can enjoy the fountain and the view quite a lot. A must visit in Rome.",
          "When I visited here at 2014, it was under construction. So I couldn\u2019t see the whole. Now, 2019, it\u2019s second time to visit. Satisfied to see this fountain finally. You have to throw the coin with right hand over left shoulder, then you will come back like me.",
          "I know it's traditional to visit but to me it wasn't much to see and far too many people even in November. Definitely worth seeing just to say you have though.",
          "it was truly awesome and beautiful.\nif you want to visit it too make sure not to go on a weekend because its harder to enjoy such a beauty with so many people's around (but that's just my personal opinion)",
          "Beautiful fountain tucked away in one of Rome's many small cobbled streets. Highly recommend a visit! Very crowded with tourists during the day but eases up at night.",
          "Crowded, romantic & worth the effort. However fighting your way to front takes skill & good luck trying to get a photo of just you or your party.\nIt's a classic site so no doubt you'll visit, but if you weren't sure, you'll have missed a gem if you don't go.",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit both by day and night.  The carving are amazing.",
          "Roma is amazing, the whole city is an open air museum. For me, la Fontana di Trevi is the jewel of the crown, my most favorite spot. Yes, it will be full of people, but visiting it will be also completely worth it <3",
          "This place again was an ok place to see. The craftsmanship of the stone was quite the sight to see. \n\nPeople kept tell me when I visited it toss some coins in. However the day we arrived their were so many people there taking selfies that \u2026",
          "We had to go there it's packed. Really beautiful we liked it a lot and did what everyone else does throw coins in, grab a gelato at the end.",
          "An amazing place to visit in Rome Italy. It\u2019s a no brainer to go. My personal recommendation is to go both at night and day. It looks very different depending on the time you go. You can have a very nice meal in the little restaurants around. It\u2019s a safe zone, just be careful with the many pickpockets in the place.",
          "One of my favourite places \u2764",
          "Great spot but too crowded during the day. Either visit early in the morning or really late in the evening.",
          "Beautiful, but can be quite busy. People don't stay long, so just wait a bit and then you can get your favourite place.",
          "Very beautiful place, but too crowded! If you are planning to visit, it is best to do it first thing in the morning ir during sunset. Otherwise, you will have a really hard time trying to get a good nice picture.",
          "Grab a coin and hold your breath, make a wish\ncount to three! The beauty of water \ud83d\udca7 here will engulf you and the happiness surrounding you will no doubt bring a smile to your face! The Trevi Fountain is here for you and absolutely a fun, \u2026",
          "A places one must without fail. Don't forget to throw the coin. Right hand over the left shoulder \ud83d\ude09",
          "Very cool, but if you don't like crowds then you are not going to be a big fan of this place",
          "hard to make a deep solemn wish due to lots of people taking photos! Perhaps perfect time to visit would be early in the morning while people still sleeping \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Would be nice to be with someone special. \n\nAccording to legend, tossing \u2026",
          "Absolutely gorgeous, spent 5 days in Rome, and went to the fountain everyday. Stunning place, very busy but worth it",
          "Unremarkable beauty between narrow streets of Rome centre. May be a little surprise for people just walking around :) Tons of people around. Remember not to sit on it.",
          "One of the most amazing touristic spots. Every time I visit Rome, I go to the Trevi fountain. I think it a must spot for sightseeing while visiting Rome. Check it out, it's g ready spot among many other beautiful spots in Rome.",
          "Gorgeous, usually VERY busy. Stores directly in the square are extortionate, going around one corner will see prices halve.",
          "Must see. Simply awesome!! One of those places that once there you can always say I was was there and people will understand. Going through the neighborhood to get there is an adventure into itself. A gelato and toss a coin or two or three, wow!!!",
          "best time of the year to come around is January.. can\u2019t even think of the crowds in summer",
          "Must visit on Rome. Has a different vibe in day , looks completely enchanting when lit up. Consider visiting it twice.",
          "Beautiful fountain but ridiculously overcrowded.\n\nLate night or early morning are best times to go. Also, avoid nearby bars as the prices are ridiculously high.",
          "A must see attraction when visiting Rome, the only down side is, that is also what everyone else is thinking. It\u2019s very crowded which can add to the spectacle of the place but it would be interesting to experience what it is like with just \u2026",
          "What an experience! It does get super busy but incredibly well managed by police.\nCan\u2019t wait it fo back again!",
          "Another wonderful monument, and just a fountain \u26f2, amazing. Trevi Fountain is known as one of the most stunning fountains in the world. The Trevi Fountain is one of the oldest water sources in Rome\nThe fountain dates back to ancient Roman \u2026",
          "Obviously amazing to see, but I would suggest to visit during the week rather than weekend, because its too busy and you don't get the space to toss a coin and make your wish.",
          "Beautiful , you will need to get here early to beat the crowds. Don't sit on the foundation or the whistle police will tell you off",

          "This fountain is very beautiful and well worth the visit (there is also singing priests from nearby church).\n\nCrowds are big and usually 3-4 people deep during peak times. I was able to get a picture with no one else around but had to do that at 2am in the morning (luckily our hotel was only 1 minute walk away).",
          "This is a really huge and beautiful fountain but especially crowded during day and night. Should watch it at dawn as there are only a few people there at that time. If you want to visit Rome again, don't forget to drop a coin. Remember: right hand, left shoulder with your back to the fountain. Good luck!",
          "A beautifully-carved fountain which dominates the square. The light catches the stonework excellently and glinta off the crystal-clear water. There's a quieter area to the right of the fountain  with some drinking water as well. The main \u2026",

          "Pictures don't do it justice, it is a great site to behold. The detailed sculptures and architecture are spectacular. The building itself is bigger than I thought. It stays pretty crowded throughout the day, that is the only downside. Don't forget to throw a coin in!",
          "Nice place however you need to mark your lane or you will come back to Trevi Fountain again. Late evening is nice time to visit",
          "I visited at night and it was really crowded, but still worth to visit. Don't forget to throw three coins! As the urban legend said the first coin will makes you come back to Rome, the second coin will get you to meet the one you love, and the third coin will makes you come back to Rome with the one you love.",
          "its huge, and it seems was sculpted in a monolith, you can' t see any joints",

          "Beautiful place to visit, quiet at the moment so perfect to visit with beautiful photo opportunities",
          "Very beautiful but too crowded. I was here in the evening around 9pm and it was very busy. The sculptures are wonderful to see, while the water and the lighting makes it even more pretty (hope it was less noisey, which unfortunately we can't help). \ud83d\ude42",
          "Nice place to visit, but it is always a crowded. I would recommend to visit early in the morning it late afternoon",
          "What an amazing place to visit. The fountain is so beautiful. Even though it was very busy it had something peaceful. Beautiful atmosphere.",
          "One of the most amazing places to visit in Rome! Great architecture, great history, great culture. You can join the enormous crowd which gathers around the fountain every evening and enjoy the atmosphere. There's a story about throwing \u2026",
          "Bigger than expected. It's allways full of people (mostly tourist), street vendors and homeless. It's a really nice street attraction/fountain.",
          "We went here 6am to get a nice family picture. No need to edit out people in your pictures. Just wake up early",
          "Master piece. Try to avoid evening time. It looks perfect at sun light and your photo too. There are also some other tourist attractions nearby. Area is small. Some restaurants and hotels available surrounding areas.",
          "A truly magnificent place! You already know it is must visit in Rome. I advised you to go early in the morning or late at night if you don't want crowd",
          "The most iconic Fontana of Rome. Tip, visit at early hours to take pictures with Noone around. Around 7-8 am there were 5 other people. It's stunning at night hours but you appreciate it at day. There is police nearby because some sit on \u2026",
          "Too many tourist so I retreated to Magnum cafe. Nice ice cream in winter. Yummy",
          "Very nice and beautiful..very well maintained.. should go in the evening to enjoy the lights and ambience",

          "Crowdy crowdy crowdy",
          "This place IS Rome! I always visit the Trevi Fountain when I\u2019m in Rome. It is just beautiful! If you go early in the morning or late at night the crowds aren\u2019t too bad, but do NOT miss this stunning landmark if you are going to be in Rome.",
          "The Trevi Fountain kind of shocks you with its beauty. As you walk down the narrow streets and approach it, it is hard to anticipate. Once you turn the bend in the road to face the square, the view is absolutely astounding. Absolutely worth a visit.",
          "Very pretty fountain. Over crowded and you need to almost queue for a very quick photo and to throw a coin. It was difficult to appreciate the fountain because if the large crowds even in Autumn.",
          "I love the Trevi fountain! It is so magical especially if you go at sunrise when no one else is there!",
          "One of the most famous fountains in the world and one of the classic romantic sites in Rome. Once you get there it truly takes your breath away even though it usually gets very crowded. Would definitely come to see it again.",
          "It's a beautiful fountain that is definitely worth seeing. Be prepared for the crowd though. Don't forget to throw a coin in to ensure you'll return to Rome one day.",
          "Very spectacular but very busy come at night it's well lit up",
          "This place is stunning! It is a very marvelous place. It can be crowded here so it is wise to go during off season as well as off times. This place is something you have to see to believe and it a masterpiece. Loved it here.",
          "Breathtaking! It doesn't matter how many times you visit, it always makes you feel in love with the city. It's always crowded, so pay attention to pickpockets.",
          "The fountain view is best at night. I would suggest to visit Trevi Fountain at night to experience best view .",
          "Beautiful place and beautiful statues. But lots of lots of tourists will be there . It\u2019s very hard to take a picture also in front of the place. Don\u2019t sit on the edge of the water . Security don\u2019t allowed any one to sit on the edge of the water.",
          "I'm sure most know about this beautiful fountain everyone throws coins into.  However, at random times the fountain is drained and the coins are removed.  Depending on ones perspective, this is even more interesting if a little less romantic.  Just go see it--it's free.",
          "One of them must see attractions in Rome. Great for people watching. Visit it during different times of the day, and at night.",
          "Who doesn't like a fountain? Too crowded but lovely place, easy to reach, many restaurants nearby. You require a wide angle camera to take a great picture.",
          "The foutain looks awesome during the night, such a blue water. It was bigger than I imagined and also more crowded that expected. \nSince its in the very center, its quite easy to add other near by places.",
          "The sight is absolutely amazing but the amount of people surrounding it don't make it worthwhile for me. It's not only close to the fountain but all the roads leading to it are busy and full with street merchants. But if you can get there in relative piece you could just look at it for an hour and still see new details.",
          "A little crowded but what else would you expect. Was able to find space on back wall just to still and watch others enjoying life. Loved the guy with the whistle to was there to tell people not to sit on the fountain ....... yes I got \u2026",
          "This place was pretty unknown and dead until I posted it on insta a couple of months back and look at it now. In all honesty I don't go and see alot of fountains so don't have much to compare it too but it was decent.",
          "A must visit if you are in Rome. However, you have to be there before sunrise, otherwise it will be filled with tourists. Early in the morning, the sun is shining in the other direction, which makes it difficult to take good pictures. But \u2026",
          "It's amazing, but really challenging to take a photo \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",
          "Loved it ! Would like it better if it was less crowded. But then it was new year's Day. Well worth a visit whilst in Rome.",
          "I have been there a thousand times but every time I feel like going there I always feel a great emotion in seeing it in its majesty. Wonderful",
          "I love a Trevi fountain in Rome so much. It is the most romantic place. I saw a lot of guy propose a girl for a marriage.",
          "Stumbled upon the fountain accidentally as it's right in the centre surrounded by other buildings and things. Absolutely beautiful and completely worth a visit. It's very busy with lots of people taking photos and people can be a little rude about shoving you to get a photo",
          "One of my favorite places in the world.",
          "Super cool and romantic, but jam packed full of people. It's an amazing place and work of art. Clearly a must see. But everyone else thinks so too.",
          "The fountain is so beautiful. The water is so clear and clean. I went there 3 times of a day to see at which period less crowded and the early morning around 7 - 8 am is perfect timing.",
          "From the Most Famous fountains in the world. Full of tourists every time of the day or night!",
          "This place is absolutely beautiful. Impossible to believe that this was created my years ago without the help of technology or some sort of special equipment we would use in today\u2019s world. My only recommendation about this place is to visit in the morning, less crowded so you can take as many pictures.",
          "What a beautiful site. I think coming first thing in the morning would just be amazing !!",
          "Fabulous... fantastic...a must for all...Less people who don't respect the walls by standing on them wouldn't be a miss...",
          "Great place to visit in Rome. Especially because it's surrounded by good cafes and \"Gelaterias\".",
          "U better be there in a early hour or a very late one. Otherwise it's just impossible with all the people and tourists. Trying to get pictures and stoping u from moving to get a shot ..",
          "Difficult to get a good picture as there was so many people by the fountain it was a job to get near. It is away from main roads which surprised me as it's really only unapproachable by foot",
          "Trevi Fountain is most visited place by tourist. Its the fountain connecting 3 roads that's the meaning basically. Biggest fountain ever seen. And it collects coins nearly 3000\u20ac per day. And its an offence to take out coins from the fountain. Visit before 9Am to avoid rush. Must visit place. Well maintained.",
          "It's a  beautiful place and sculpture to spend an hour around.",
          "How can you not appreciate the beauty of such fine craftsmanship?  This is a must see!",
          "I liked very much , but I wanted to see during the day.",
          "Growded always but its a nice piece of art! Worth seeing!",
          "Must see place at Rome. Great Architecture and very beautiful. However very crowded. Best time is to visit the place early in the morning or late in the evening. Lot of shops and restaurants around",
          "Amazing historical site well worth the visit. It is very busy so maybe go early or later at night but I think attractions like this tend to be always busy",
          "I mean, it's the Trevi fountain; it's amazing. Don't miss this if you're traveling rome.",
          "Completely out the way, unexpected and worth seeing! Very romantic, great for photo opportunities \ud83d\ude0a",
          "A must see in Rome. A pretty impressive & unexpected view.\nIt is very crowded but still very easy tu get good views and nice picture memories.",
          "Fantastic experience, please remember to go at night as well as through the day, not over busy at the moment \nA great time to visit Rome",
          "One of the best sites in Rome. Ended up visiting 4 times in 3 days. Late night visit is advised though (after 2200)",
          "These places are always worth visiting\nTrevi Fountain\nEiffel Tower\nEverest Base CampGrand Canyon\nGreat Barrier Reef\nThe Colosseum",
          "Right in the heart of the city amidst the most elite branded shops and archaic buildings is this marvellous place!! Found it better than many of the historic places visited by me in recent times",
          "The fountain does every bit of justice to its history as well as popularity. Reach early in morning by around 7 or 8 if you want a nice photograph or want to admire the magnificence that it is. Its generally very crowded after that even on \u2026",
          "Despite the tons of people, both during the day and late at night, it's easy to see why millions of people would visit this beautiful piece of art.\n\nCan't touch the water so don't force the ever present police to have to whistle at you. \u2026",
          "Very beautiful!\nHowever it can get really crowded during the day in the summer.\nSo if you want to go there for pictures, the best time of day is early mornings before 6am.",
          "Obviously this is a thing!  Truly beautiful and  amazing it's a must see in Rome Do Iran drop a coin so you will return",
          "Great spot to visit and great places to eat in and around the area",
          "Amazing tourist stop. Go early in the morning to avoid very heavy crowds. Be sure to throw a coin over your shoulder to ensure a repeat visit to this very interesting fountain. The statues and building are very detailed, but it's hard to get to see up close. The water is greenish in color.",
          "Really beautiful place , too many people to enjoy something , not interesting at night",
          "Very beautiful nice happening place. Relief to visit in summers. A bit over crowded but worth a see. Also the place is happening with good eateries around and live music occasionally in evenings adds up to the romantic atmosphere. Must see place !",
          "Great place for some nice pictures and a coin toss into the fountain. There's some excellent Gelato right next to it.",
          "Nice fountain, but I went their on a Saturday, which is not recommended at all, the place was so busy and full of people there is literally no place for you to walk let alone sit there.\nMy advice is going in the middle of the week where there are less people and you can actually enjoy it.",
          "Does this actually need to be reviewed?  It's the Trevi fountain.  You all know it. You all know you want to visit it.  Just beware it's busy, it's crowded, keep an eye on your stuff.",
          "Very beautiful. Very peaceful. Well worth a visit. Can get very crowded, but I can see why. It's lovely.",
          "Fantastic. Unforgettable. Unfortunately too many people, and people flow on the street isnt restricted which makes it nearly impossible to get close to the actual fountain",
          "More impressive in person than I expected but avoid the people trying to sell you flowers or take your picture! The Italian police should get rid of them...",
          "Definitely worth a visit, the marble work is outstanding.",
          "Beautiful piece of art... Loved the fountain.\nSadly there are too many tourists and it is difficult to click pictures of just the magnificent fountain without the crowd.",
          "Beautiful fountain, but usually overcrowded. Better visit first hour in the morning or late at night.",
          "If you want a great shot without too many people, come early mornings.",
          "Surprisingly beautiful, you do not expect to see such beauty around the corner when walking up to it, just incredible!",
          "Beautiful! If you want to avoid crowds, visit at night. The fountain lights up and we didn't have to fight with crowds to get out pictures.",
          "Great tradition with the three coins. Although it gets really crowded at night that  is the best time to see the fountain. The lights make all of the statues stand out.",
          "A marvelous achievement of marvel but the crowd is so huge and so overwhelming that it ruins the moment. Perhaps try in the very late hours or in the morning but I heard that even then, you can never have a moment alone with the fountain.",
          "Wow absolutely stunning. Definitely a place for proposal \ud83d\ude09. One of the crowded places. There is a house in front of the fountain. You cabln get in and take beautiful photos",
          "My favorite place in Rome.  You've heard about it, saw it it many films....nothing like seeing its magnificence in person.",
          "Beautiful fountain but go early to avoid the crowds. (We were there at 8am!)",
          "One of the best sites to visit in Rome. Do not leave without checking this place. People crowd round the edge so my recommendation is to stay on the higher pathway to get better photos of the fountain. There is also a local shop that lets you go upstairs to look out of their windows if you wanted a photo from a different perspective.",
          "Amazing tourist attraction !One of the musts of Rome! Just be careful! Many many pick pockets!",
          "I really did not expect to be this amazed at the Trevi fountain but I was truly amazed at the size of it.  It was a truly remarkable experience.  Wish I visited it during the night when it will be lighted up.  The architecture and details \u2026",
          "Gorgeous spot at night.  Beautifully lit up, cafes / bars / gelato very close proximity.",
          "Beautiful fountain but the swarm of people near it was like being in actual hell. It's not worth the hassle of getting near it.",
          "A must go!\n\nDrink the water and enjoy the vibe and energy for this place \n\nCan be a bit crowded but it is worth to go and stay there and observe the environment!\n\nTry to go with a coin and make a wish!!\n\nA lot of stores and food around but \u2026",
          "Very beautifull, but always there are a lot of people.",
          "Having seen the fountain in the daytime previously, we discovered that it seems even better at night. It is beautifully  illuminated to show off the amazing impact of the dramatic sculptures, and the dazzling whiteness of the whole huge edifice.",
          "As beautiful as a fountain can get... of course be amazed by the crowds! Come early or very late for a less crowded photo",
          "The fountain is amazing , we went very early so we could beat the crowds and get pics without fighting other people. Only problem is on that day they had the water off for cleaning so it was empty. They turned it on later and we went back \u2026",
          "Totally worth the walk in the heat. Great experience just being there",
          "We have made an offering to Oceanus each time we've been here, and he's never failed to bring us back to Rome! Plus star for watching silly tourists who do not know proper coin toss technique. It's right hand over your left shoulder, \u2026",
          "Even though I've seen it countless times in the movies or on TV, I was in completely awe of its beauty and enormousness! We saw it at night, it was absolutely spectacular!!",
          "A fantastic monument and a must see! \nVery busy as you can expect so keep you valuables close!",
          "Best to visit in night time, especially during the rain",
          "Its been great. Rome it's a great city to visit. The Fontana di  Trevi its amazing",
          "One of the most beautiful fountains I have ever seen, the sculpture is awesome and attracts thousands of people there everyday. Well worth seeing it during the day and at night as the atmosphere they produce are completely different. Be \u2026",
          "Our advice: if you go there around 8 pm, it's less crowded so you can take the best pics. Also: don't seat on the edge of the fountain, if you don't want the police to tell you off!\ud83d\ude01",
          "Great architectural masterpiece but also very crowded. Best to go in the early morning or late evening/night if you're looking for less of a crowd. Either way, take a moment to admire this beautiful art piece and throw a coin for the heck of it.",
          "Beautiful and mind blowing experience to see it.\n\nIt will be super crowded , I suggest to carry a selfie stick for better pictures.\n\nActually it's the perfect spot to be with someone you love. If you want to save some money don't forget to carry a wine bottle and glass in the bag. You may sip the wine while enjoying this beauty.",
          "\"Crowd magnet\" tourists are everywhere.  Italian \"Cabarlie\" police officers monitor the area on foot constantly. The prevention of damage to the site is particularly important, no sitting at the fountain's  edge, no alcoholic beverages are \u2026",
          "Absolutely wonderful to see this in person. I was there in the high season and soon learnt to view this sight very early in the morning. Later in the day, crowd's are so dense, you just can not see or experience this wonderful place.",
          "I went there at 2018 October 3~10 but it was great the sight is awsome too!! Also I'm Korean\u314e\u314e",
          "Better to go in the morning here (7-8am), in February were a lot of tourists all day.",
          "My favorite place we visited in Rome. Pictures do not do it justice. It's traditional to throw a coin with your right hand over your left shoulder into the fountain and make a wish. Rome uses the money to subsidize a supermarket for the needy. So it's definitely worth making the wish!",
          "Certainly the most famous and photographed fountain in Rome, legend has it that whoever throws a coin into the pond will return to Rome. very recommended if you're in rome and remember to throw a coin to the fountain",
          "A nice, holy and spiritual place in rome, you feel good on reaching Trevi Fountain. You will find many people making their wish in the pond. It is said that the wish you make with pure heart here is definitely fulfilled.",
          "It\u2019s a great tourist attraction.",
          "A truly wonderful fountain. Nestled into the heart of Rome and surrounded by visitors. Looks great in the daylight, but in my opinion, looks even better at night",
          "Beautiful sculptures and impressive fountain. Very busy with tourists. Don't forget to toss a coin and make a wish",
          "Famous fountain. Extremely crowded.",
          "Super cool and beautiful. It was more for the wife but I enjoyed experiencing the Trevi Fountain",
          "Really good place to go, full, but it's worth it.",
          "Lots of stores around it. Lots of tourists so always be careful when walking around.",
          "The trevi fountain was impressive. It\u2019s massive actually. It is hard to capture in the photo how impressive it is. Go there early morning to get a good view and photo. We went at 8am and tourists just started arriving not like when we went there around 3pm- packed with tourists you can barely move!",
          "It is beautiful but too many tourists to pass by easily, plus the ubiquitous street hawkers.",
          "See the world's most exquisite fountain & throw in three coins as you make wish. As charming as the city it's in.",
          "Best place and district in the evening.",
          "I highly recommend to visit Rome's fountains at night.",
          "The Trevi Fountain is located in Piazza di Trevi, 00187 Roma RM, Italy. It is an aqueduct-fed rococo fountain designed by Nicola Salvi and completed in 1762 with sculpted figures. This fountain is always visited by local and foreign tourists who come to enjoy the beauty of the fountain.",
          "One of our favorite places we visited in Rome. Make sure you see this both during the daytime and nighttime. Fun place to sit and soak up the atmosphere. We found a little shop & enjoyed some wine and a view.",
          "Constructed beginning 1732, The Trevi Fountain was designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini thirty years later.  Open day-through-night, with tourists and security reliably present, Trevi is the largest \u2026",
          "Well it\u2019s probably the most famous fountain in the world, so large crowds were expected, as with most of the big draw cards in Italy they bring massive crowds. Worth a look but I wouldn\u2019t come again. The beautiful day helped with the look of it that\u2019s for sure!",
          "Really beautiful! But: go there at night (21:30 or later). It's only at night as overwhelming as it can be, and there are less people so it's more romantic and just better in every way (at day it's sunny and very hot).\nSince Rome at night is generally just a cool experience (in both ways) I really recommend going there only at night.",
          "One of the most beautiful fountains, its said that if you throw a coin in it you will go back to Rome some day.",
          "Loved all the little streets and restaurants around the trevi fountain",
          "It's definitely something to see when you visit the city. But it is very crowded during the day time. If you are looking for that perfect shot, you might want to try the evening or night time. But it is very safe as there is police presence everywhere!",
          "Very busy, try and go early in the morning. Beautiful",
          "Lovely, but yo many tourists.",
          "A majestic place every time we go there \nIf you love ice cream go to the store called gelato on Trevi and get the 6euro cup it\u2019s 3 major scoops of delicious heaven watch for pickpockets they are floating around there and respect the monuments don\u2019t sit on the brim of the fountain you will he told off from the police enjoy",
          "It's much more impressive than it looks in the photos. Visit early in the morning when there is no crowd. You'll love it.",
          "Great place to visit but it\u2019s super crowded and hard to get to it by transportation, it\u2019s easier to get there walking",
          "What can you say, it's the trevi fountain! It's a work of art, a tourist Petri dish and a photo will prove that you've been to Rome lol",
          "Lovely place to visit and the church close by stunning just beautiful",
          "Be careful of amateur photographer with a huge instax camera. Their photos are too closed up and they don't know what good photography is",
          "Too many people! Come here early (before 8, specially for good pictures)",
          "Really nice place to visit, specifically at night where there is a different atmosphere. Always crowded so if you have intentions to throw a coin to the fountain to make a wish, throw 2 and ask to find your way through the tourists up to a \u2026",
          "Beautiful place to stop and just take in the view. Nice gelato shop right next store. My is it overly crowded though. Go early morning or late in the evening.",

          "Very impressive. Fine and huge piece of art. Very popular for tourists. Always crowded.",
          "Like a public square in the middle of a busy street. \n\nBeautiful architecture, awe inspiring! Looks all the more splendid at night. \n\nWish the wouldn't have let locals construct buildings so up and close though. \n\nIt's sandwiched between civilian construction which does constraint it in terms of space. \n\nInany case, worth a visit",
          "Very, very busy but worth it as it is the most beautiful fountain",
          "Loved all the statues and the water. We finally got to see the place that we have seen in so many movies. Of course it did not look as nice as it was so terribly and exhaustively over crowded, that we could not just sit somewhere and look at it.",
          "Beautiful lovely romantic fountain. Lots of people. Police presence made it safe. Not many signs available to find the fountain. Better place for souvenir shopping, we found out too late, less expensive than the shops around the Colosseum",

          "The wall is stunningly detailed so amazing it's even possible to get this detail from stone",
          "Great to see again as last time was 1974. However now the crowds are enormous and no control whatsoever so very little chance to get near enough to throw a coin in let alone get a good photo.",
          "Was such a stunning place to go! Italy should definitely be on ur wish list to go.. especially seeing how fasinating the architecture was, the views, the freshly produced food, the friendly people were.. even the history..",
          "It's difficult to walk through Rome because every 5-10 minutes there's something else that completely stops you in your tracks and takes your breath away. This fountain was just insane! It must be seen and the fact that you can walk right up to it and touch the water makes the existence all the better. It's breathtaking!",
          "This place has a special vibe. The most beautiful at the day time, but try to avoid the crowds",
          "I don't see the allure this place, way too crowded. Its beautiful but there are so many more beautiful things to see in this amazing city.",
          "This fountain sits in a little square in Rome. I was walking around the little streets and and walked into a little square and there was the Trevi Fountain. You would never believe how little the square is and the location from the pictures. But, it is a beautiful fountain. A must see when in Rome.",
          "One of the mos famous lucky fountain, if you are in Rome you must take e picture here and throw a coin in the water for good luck. Coins are purportedly meant to be thrown using the right hand over the left shoulder.This was the theme of \u2026",

          "One of the most romantic destination in Roma...since Marcello's Mastroiani and and Anita Ekberg's movie ,the Bernini's masterpiece it's a must in Rome...",
          "It is by far one of the prettiest monument to explore. A nice place to chill alongside the fountains with some gelato there. A lot of roads by walk can take you there. Lot of beautiful places to explore around. Visit this place at night too if possible, it looks spectacular.",
          "Grand opulent fountain in the center of Rome. A must see! The crowds are huge, so be aware. Good to see morning and night for the atmosphere.",
          "Spectacular! Photos and movies don\u2019t do it justice. You have to see it in person. It\u2019s a sight to behold. It\u2019s beautiful both day time and night.",
          "Absolutely beautiful site to see!! This fountain was one of my highlights from my trip to Rome! Massive structure, much bigger than I expected. Must see during a visit to Rome.",
          "Roman Holiday isn't complete without visiting this place.",
          "Monumental, but overcrowded as hell. Also full of police and soldiers with assault rifles.   Doesn't make you feel safe lol.",
          "Went at night and still popular. It is a nice tourist spot.",
          "After all ,  its a fountain. But the place has its atmosphere",
          "Nothing to dislike! Unlike early summer, you will find less crowd in late summer/fall. Beautiful fountain and worth visiting!",

          "Whew just gorgeous, but incredibly jam packed with tourists!",
          "The sculpture is impressive, but is too busy, also in February.",
          "We've visited the fountain on several occasions whilst in Rome and found the best times to be early morning or evening to avoid the crowds and pickpockets as it's located in a small square. The fountain is stunning with its various Baroque \u2026",
          "The Trevi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi) is a fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini and several others. Standing 26.3 metres (86 ft) high and 49.15 \u2026",
          "Good place, at least there is no unnecessary ticket. Good market compared to other places of Rome.\nBut at the end it's again same like other a Big gate with some statue of naked man and horses and water flowing through..",
          "The menu has beer (birra) chicken wings, fried olives, banana milk shake and the meat in the burgers absolutely delicious",
          "Fontana de Trevi at night is very crowded on weekend night. This is off season but school spring breaks are different from every country, expect more people during summertime.",
          "Fountain is beautiful but too many people so it's hard to get a good photo. Best to go during quiet periods. Lots of nice pizzerias and gelaterias so that's a plus",
          "The Trevi fountain is a spectacular view. It has been completely renovated and looks incredible with all the white marble and the blue water. The fountain might have a lot of its reputations from a movie scene but it is worth a visit in its \u2026",
          "Tourists overflow this area, making it very difficult to take pictures, which is expected as it is a main tourist attraction. Sitting on the rim / edge of the fountain is not allowed, so there are officers constantly blowing whistles at \u2026",
          "Don't get me wrong - it's a FANTASTIC fountain especially in the night when it's lit in light blue. The problem is the over crowding around the fountain.\nI see why it's so popular and a must see, but why should it be a must see for everyone in the same time?",
          "Crowded, lots of police officers blowing whistles to stop folk taking photos by sitting on the rim of the fountain... Total waste of police rescourses! Better views in the evening."

        "wiki": "The Roman Forum, also known by its Latin name Forum Romanum (Italian: Foro Romano), is a rectangular forum (plaza) surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of the city of Rome. Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the Forum Magnum, or simply the Forum.\nFor centuries the Forum was the center of day-to-day life in Rome: the site of triumphal processions and elections; the venue for public speeches, criminal trials, and gladiatorial matches; and the nucleus of commercial affairs. Here statues and monuments commemorated the city's great men. The teeming heart of ancient Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world, and in all history. Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archaeological excavations attracting 4.5 million or more sightseers yearly.Many of the oldest and most important structures of the ancient city were located on or near the Forum. The Roman Kingdom's earliest shrines and temples were located on the southeastern edge. These included the ancient former royal residence, the Regia (8th century BC), and the Temple of Vesta (7th century BC), as well as the surrounding complex of the Vestal Virgins, all of which were rebuilt after the rise of imperial Rome.\nOther archaic shrines to the northwest, such as the Umbilicus Urbis and the Vulcanal (Shrine of Vulcan), developed into the Republic's formal Comitium (assembly area). This is where the Senate\u2014as well as Republican government itself\u2014began. The Senate House, government offices, tribunals, temples, memorials and statues gradually cluttered the area.\nOver time the archaic Comitium was replaced by the larger adjacent Forum and the focus of judicial activity moved to the new Basilica Aemilia (179 BC). Some 130 years later, Julius Caesar built the Basilica Julia, along with the new Curia Julia, refocusing both the judicial offices and the Senate itself. This new Forum, in what proved to be its final form, then served as a revitalized city square where the people of Rome could gather for commercial, political, judicial and religious pursuits in ever greater numbers.\nEventually much economic and judicial business would transfer away from the Forum Romanum to the larger and more extravagant structures (Trajan's Forum and the Basilica Ulpia) to the north. The reign of Constantine the Great saw the construction of the last major expansion of the Forum complex\u2014the Basilica of Maxentius (312 AD). This returned the political center to the Forum until the fall of the Western Roman Empire almost two centuries later.\n\n\n== Description ==\nUnlike the later imperial fora in Rome\u2014which were self-consciously modelled on the ancient Greek plateia (\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1) public plaza or town square\u2014the Roman Forum developed gradually, organically, and piecemeal over many centuries. This is the case despite attempts, with some success, to impose some order there, by Sulla, Julius Caesar, Augustus and others. By the Imperial period, the large public buildings that crowded around the central square had reduced the open area to a rectangle of about 130 by 50 meters.Its long dimension was oriented northwest to southeast and extended from the foot of the Capitoline Hill to that of the Velian Hill. The Forum's basilicas during the Imperial period\u2014the Basilica Aemilia on the north and the Basilica Julia on the south\u2014defined its long sides and its final form. The Forum proper included this square, the buildings facing it and, sometimes, an additional area (the Forum Adjectum) extending southeast as far as the Arch of Titus.Originally, the site of the Forum had been a marshy lake where waters from the surrounding hills drained. This was drained by the Tarquins with the Cloaca Maxima. Because of its location, sediments from both the flooding of the Tiber and the erosion of the surrounding hills have been raising the level of the Forum floor for centuries. Excavated sequences of remains of paving show that sediment eroded from the surrounding hills was already raising the level in early Republican times.As the ground around buildings rose, residents simply paved over the debris that was too much to remove. Its final travertine paving, still visible, dates from the reign of Augustus. Excavations in the 19th century revealed one layer on top of another. The deepest level excavated was 3.60 meters above sea level. Archaeological finds show human activity at that level with the discovery of carbonized wood.An important function of the Forum, during both Republican and Imperial times, was to serve as the culminating venue for the celebratory military processions known as Triumphs. Victorious generals entered the city by the western Triumphal Gate (Porta Triumphalis) and circumnavigated the Palatine Hill (counterclockwise) before proceeding from the Velian Hill down the Via Sacra and into the Forum.From here they would mount the Capitoline Rise (Clivus Capitolinus) up to the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the summit of the Capitol. Lavish public banquets ensued back down on the Forum. (In addition to the Via Sacra, the Forum was accessed by a number of storied roads and streets, including the Vicus Jugarius, Vicus Tuscus, Argiletum, and Via Nova.)\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Kingdom ===\n\nThe original, low-lying, grassy wetland of the Forum was drained in the 7th century BC with the building of the Cloaca Maxima, a large covered sewer system that emptied into the Tiber, as more people began to settle between the two hills.\nAccording to tradition, the Forum's beginnings are connected with the alliance between Romulus, the first king of Rome controlling the Palatine Hill, and his rival, Titus Tatius, who occupied the Capitoline Hill. An alliance formed after combat had been halted by the prayers and cries of the Sabine women. Because the valley lay between the two settlements, it was the designated place for the two peoples to meet. Since the early Forum area included pools of stagnant water, the most easily accessible area was the northern part of the valley which was designated as the Comitium. It was here at the Vulcanal that, according to the story, the two parties laid down their weapons and formed an alliance.The Forum was outside the walls of the original Sabine fortress, which was entered through the Porta Saturni. These walls were mostly destroyed when the two hills were joined. The original Forum functioned as an open-air market abutting on the Comitium, but eventually outgrew its day-to-day shopping and marketplace role. As political speeches, civil trials, and other public affairs began to take up more and more space in the Forum, additional fora throughout the city began to emerge to expand on specific needs of the growing population. Fora for cattle, pork, vegetables and wine specialised in their niche products and the associated deities around them.Rome's second king, Numa Pompilius (r. 715\u2013673 BC), is said to have begun the cult of Vesta, building its house and temple as well as the Regia as the city's first royal palace. Later Tullus Hostilius (r. 673\u2013642 BC) enclosed the Comitium around the old Etruscan temple where the senate would meet at the site of the Sabine conflict. He is said to have converted that temple into the Curia Hostilia close to where the Senate originally met in an old Etruscan hut. In 600 BC Tarquinius Priscus had the area paved for the first time.\n\n\n=== Roman Republic ===\n\nDuring the Republican period the Comitium continued to be the central location for all judicial and political life in the city. However, in order to create a larger gathering place, the Senate began expanding the open area between the Comitium and the Temple of Vesta by purchasing existing private homes and removing them for public use. Building projects of several consuls repaved and built onto both the Comitium and the adjacent central plaza that was becoming the Forum.The 5th century BC witnessed the earliest Forum temples with known dates of construction: the Temple of Saturn (497 BC) and the Temple of Castor and Pollux (484 BC). The Temple of Concord was added in the following century, possibly by the soldier and statesman Marcus Furius Camillus. A long-held tradition of speaking from the elevated speakers' Rostra\u2014originally facing north towards the Senate House to the assembled politicians and elites\u2014put the orator's back to the people assembled in the Forum. A tribune known as Caius Licinius (consul in 361 BC) is said to have been the first to turn away from the elite towards the Forum, an act symbolically repeated two centuries later by Gaius Gracchus.This began the tradition of locus popularis, in which even young nobles were expected to speak to the people from the Rostra. Gracchus was thus credited with (or accused of) disturbing the mos maiorum (\"custom of the fathers/ancestors\") in ancient Rome. When Censor in 318 BC, Gaius Maenius provided buildings in the Forum neighborhood with balconies, which were called after him maeniana, in order that the spectators might better view the games put on within the temporary wooden arenas set up there.\nThe Tribune benches were placed on the Forum Romanum, as well. First, they stood next to the senate house; during the late Roman Republic they were placed in front of the Basilica Porcia.\nThe earliest basilicas (large, aisled halls) were introduced to the Forum in 184 BC by Marcus Porcius Cato, which began the process of \"monumentalizing\" the site. The Basilica Fulvia was dedicated on the north side of the Forum square in 179 BC. (It was rebuilt and renamed several times, as Basilica Fulvia et Aemilia, Basilica Paulli, Basilica Aemilia). Nine years later, the Basilica Sempronia was dedicated on the south side.Many of the traditions from the Comitium, such as the popular assemblies, funerals nobles and games, were transferred to the Forum as it developed. Especially notable was the move of the comitia tributa, then the focus of popular politics, in 145 BC. Particularly important and unprecedented political events took place in 133 BC when, in the midst of riots in and around the Forum, the Tribune Tiberius Gracchus was lynched there by a group of Senators.\nIn the 80s BC, during the dictatorship of Sulla, major work was done on the Forum including the raising of the plaza level by almost a meter and the laying of permanent marble paving stones. (Remarkably, this level of the paving was maintained more or less intact for over a millennium: at least until the sack of Rome by Robert Guiscard and his Normans in 1084, when neglect finally allowed debris to begin to accumulate unabated.)In 78 BC, the immense Tabularium (Records Hall) was built at the Capitoline Hill end of the Forum by order of the consuls for that year, M. Aemilius Lepidus and Q. Lutatius Catulus. In 63 BC, Cicero delivered his famous speech denouncing the companions of the conspirator Catiline at the Forum (in the Temple of Concord, whose spacious hall was sometimes used as a meeting place by the Senators). After the verdict, they were led to their deaths at the Tullianum, the nearby dungeon which was the only known state prison of the ancient Romans.Over time, the Comitium was lost to the ever-growing Curia and to Julius Caesar's rearrangements before his assassination in 44 BC. That year, two supremely dramatic events were witnessed by the Forum, perhaps the most famous ever to transpire there: Marc Antony's funeral oration for Caesar (immortalized in Shakespeare's famous play) was delivered from the partially completed speaker's platform known as the New Rostra and the public burning of Caesar's body occurred on a site directly across from the Rostra around which the Temple to the Deified Caesar was subsequently built by his great-nephew Octavius (Augustus). Almost two years later, Marc Antony added to the notoriety of the Rostra by publicly displaying the severed head and right hand of his enemy Cicero there.\n\n\n=== Roman Empire ===\n\nAfter Julius Caesar's death, and the end of the subsequent Civil Wars, Augustus would finish his great-uncle's work, giving the Forum its final form. This included the southeastern end of the plaza where he constructed the Temple of Divus Iulius and the Arch of Augustus there (both in 29 BC). The Temple of Divius Iulius was placed between Caesar's funeral pyre and the Regia. The Temple's location and reconstruction of adjacent structures resulted in greater organization akin to the Forum of Caesar. The Forum was also witness to the assassination of a Roman Emperor in 69 AD: Galba had set out from the palace to meet rebels but was so feeble that he had to be carried in a litter. He was immediately met by a troop of his rival Otho's cavalry near the Lacus Curtius in the Forum, where he was killed.\nDuring these early Imperial times, much economic and judicial business transferred away from the Forum to larger and more extravagant structures to the north. After the building of Trajan's Forum (110 AD), these activities transferred to the Basilica Ulpia.\nThe white marble Arch of Septimius Severus was added at the northwest end of the Forum close to the foot of the Capitoline Hill and adjacent to the old, vanishing Comitium. It was dedicated in 203 AD to commemorate the Parthian victories of Emperor Septimius Severus and his two sons against Pescennius Niger, and is one of the most visible landmarks there today. The arch closed the Forum's central area. Besides the Arch of Augustus, which was also constructed following a Roman victory against the Parthians, it is the only triumphal arch in the Forum. The Emperor Diocletian (r. 284\u2013305) was the last of the great builders of Rome's city infrastructure and he did not omit the Forum from his program. By his day it had become highly cluttered with honorific memorials. He refurbished and reorganized it, building anew the Temple of Saturn, Temple of Vesta and the Curia Julis. The latter represents the best-preserved tetrarchic building in Rome. He also reconstructed the rostra at each end of the Forum and added columns. The reign of Constantine the Great saw the completion of the construction of the Basilica of Maxentius (312 AD), the last significant expansion of the Forum complex. This restored much of the political focus to the Forum until the fall of the Western Roman Empire almost two centuries later.\n\n\n=== Medieval ===\nThe city's estimated population fell from 750,000\u2013800,000 to 450,000 in 450 AD to 250,000 by 500 AD. The populated areas contracted to the river. Strenuous efforts were made to keep the Forum (and the Palatine structures) intact, not without some success. In the 6th century some of the old edifices within the Forum began to be transformed into Christian churches. On 1 August 608, the Column of Phocas, a Roman monumental column, was erected before the Rostra and dedicated or rededicated in honour of the Eastern Roman Emperor Phocas. This proved to be the last monumental addition made to the Forum. The emperor Constans who visited the city in 665 AD stripped the lead roofs which exposed the monumental buildings to the weather and hastened deterioration.  By the 8th century the whole space was surrounded by Christian churches taking the place of the abandoned and ruined temples.An anonymous 8th-century Einsiedeln Itinerary reports that the Forum was already falling apart at that time. During the Middle Ages, though the memory of the Forum Romanum persisted, its monuments were for the most part buried under debris, and its location was designated the \"Campo Vaccino\" or \"cattle field,\" located between the Capitoline Hill and the Colosseum.\nAfter the 8th century the structures of the Forum were dismantled, re-arranged and used to build feudal towers and castles within the local area. In the 13th century these rearranged structures were torn down and the site became a dumping ground. This, along with the debris from the dismantled medieval buildings and ancient structures, helped contribute to the rising ground level.The return of Pope Urban V from Avignon in 1367 led to an increased interest in ancient monuments, partly for their moral lesson and partly as a quarry for new buildings being undertaken in Rome after a long lapse.\n\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nThe Forum Romanum suffered some of its worst depredations during the Italian Renaissance, particularly in the decade between 1540 and 1550, when Pope Paul III exploited it intensively for material to build the new Saint Peter's Basilica. Just a few years before, in 1536, the Pope had issued an invitation to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to hold a triumph in Rome on his return from conquering Tunis in North Africa. To prepare the Forum for the procession intended to imitate the pageantry of the ancient Roman triumph, the papal authorities undertook sweeping demolitions of the many medieval structures on the site, to reveal and better display the ancient monuments. This required the clearance of some 200 houses and several churches, the excavation of a new \"Via Sacra\" to pass under the arches of Titus and Septimius Severus, and the excavation of the more prominent monuments to reveal their foundations.In 1425 Pope Martin V issued a papal bull inaugurating a campaign of civic improvement and rebuilding in the city, which was depopulated and dominated by ruins. The demand for building materials consequently increased significantly, making the forum a convenient quarry for stone and marble. \nSince the 12th century, when Rome's civic government was formed, responsibility for protecting the ruins of the forum fell to the maestri di strade under the authority of the Conservatori, Rome's senior magistrates. Historically, the maestri and the Conservatori saw themselves as guardians of Rome's ancient legacy and zealously protected the ruins in the forum from further destruction, but in the 15th century the Papacy gradually encroached upon these prerogatives. The Bull of 1425 strengthened the powers of the maestri in protecting the ruins, but in conferring papal authority the Vatican essentially brought the maestri under its' control and away from the independence of the Conservators.In the 15th century, the Vatican escalated the issuance of excavation licenses, which gave broad permission to individuals to mine specific sites or structures for stone. In 1452, the ability of the maestri to issue their own excavation licenses was revoked by the Bull of Nicholas V, which absorbed that power into the Vatican. From then on only two authorities in Rome had the power to issue such licenses: the Vatican and the Conservators. This dual, overlapping authority was recognized in 1462 by a Bull of Pius II.Within the context of these disputes over jurisdiction, ruins in the forum were increasingly exploited and stripped. In 1426, a papal license authorized the destruction of the foundations of a structure called the \"Templum Canapare\" for burning into lime, provided that half the stone quarried be shared with the Apostolic Camera (the Papal treasury). Between 1431-62 the huge travertine wall between the Senate House and the Forum of Caesar adjoining the Forum Romanum was demolished by grant of Eugenius IV, followed by the demolition of the Templum Sacrae Urbis (1461-2), the Temple of Venus and Rome (1450), and the House of the Vestals (1499), all by papal license. The worst destruction in the forum occurred under Paul III, who in 1540 revoked previous excavation licenses and brought the forum exclusively under the control of the Deputies of the Fabric of the new Saint Peter's Basilica, who exploited the site for stone and marble. Monuments which fell victim to dismantling and the subsequent burning of their materials for lime included the remains of the Arch of Augustus, the Temple of Caesar, parts of the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, the Temple of Vesta, the steps and foundation of the Temple of Castor and Pollux, and the Regia. The Conservators protested vehemently against the ruination of their heritage, as they perceived it, and on one occasion applied fruitlessly to Pope Gregory XIII (1572-1585) to revoke all licenses for foraging materials, including the one granted to the fabbrica of Saint Peter's in the forum.\n\n\n=== Excavation and preservation ===\n\nThe Roman Forum was a site for many artists and architects studying in Rome to sketch during the 17th through the 19th century. The focus of many of these works produced by visiting Northern artists was on current state of the Roman Forum, known locally as the \"Campo Vaccino\", or \"cow field\", due to the livestock who grazed on the largely ignored section of the city. Claude Lorrain's 1636 Campo Vaccino shows the extent to which the building in the forum were buried under sediment. From about 1740 to his death in 1772, the artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi worked on a series of 135 etchings depicting 18th-century Rome. Renowned British artist J.M.W. Turner painted Modern Rome \u2013 Campo Vaccino in 1839, following his final trip to the city.\n\nThe excavation by Carlo Fea, who began clearing the debris from the Arch of Septimius Severus in 1803 marked the beginning of clearing the Forum. Excavations were officially begun in 1898 by the Italian government under the Minister of Public Instruction, Dr. Baccelli. The 1898 restoration had three main objectives: restore fragmented pieces of columns, bases, and cornices to their original locations in the Forum, reach the lowest possible level of the Forum without damaging existing structures, and to identify already half-excavated structures, along with the senate house and Basilica Aemilia. These state-funded excavations were led by Dr. Giacomo Boni until he died in 1925, stopping briefly during World War I.In 2008 heavy rains caused structural damage to the modern concrete covering holding the \"Black Stone\" marble together over the Lapis Niger in Rome.  Excavations in the forum continue, with new discoveries by archeologists working in the forum since 2009 leading to questions about Rome's exact age. One of these recent discoveries includes a tufa wall near the Lapis Niger used to channel water from nearby aquifers. Around the wall, pottery remains and food scraps allowed archeologists to date the likely construction of the wall to the 8th or 9th century BC, over a century before the traditional date of Rome's founding.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\n\nThe Roman Forum has been a source of inspiration for visual artists for centuries. Especially notable is Giambattista Piranesi who created (1748\u201376) a set of 135 etchings\u2014the Vedute di Roma (Views of Rome)\u2014in which the Forum figured significantly. (Many of the features documented in Piranesi's views have now vanished.)\nNotable artists of the Forum include Maerten van Heemskerck, Pirro Ligorio, Canaletto, Claude Lorrain, Giovanni Paolo Panini, Hubert Robert, J.M.W. Turner and many others.\n\n\n=== Temple of Saturn ===\nThe Temple of Saturn was one of the more significant buildings located in the Roman Forum. It is believed to have been built in 497 BC and located in Regione VIII Forum Romanum. Little is known about when the Temple was built, as the original temple is believed to have been burnt down by the Gauls early in the fourth century. However it is understood that it was also rebuilt by Munatius Plancus in 42 BC. The eight remaining columns are all that is left of the illustrious temple. Though its exact date of completion is not known, it stands as one of the oldest buildings in the Forum Romanum. The temple originally was to be built to the god Jupiter but was replaced with Saturn; historians are unsure why. The building was not used solely for religious practice; the temple also functioned as a bank for the Roman Society.\nThe Temple stood in the forum along with four other temples. It stood with the Temple of Concord, Vesta, Castor and Pollox. At each temple, animal sacrifices and rituals were done in front of the religious sites. These acts were meant to provide good fortune to those entering and using the temple. Since the Temple of Saturn also functioned as a bank, and since Saturn was the god of the Golden Age, the sacrifices were made in hope of financial success.Inside the Temple there were multiple vaults for the public and private ones for individuals. There were also sections of the Temple for public speaking events and feasts which often followed the sacrifices.\n\n\n== Other fora in Rome ==\nOther fora existed in other areas of the city; remains of most of them, sometimes substantial, still exist. The most important of these are a number of large imperial fora forming a complex with the Forum Romanum: the Forum Iulium, Forum Augustum, the Forum Transitorium (also: Forum Nerva), and Trajan's Forum. The planners of the Mussolini era removed most of the Medieval and Baroque strata and built the Via dei Fori Imperiali road between the Imperial Fora and the Forum. There are also:\n\nThe Forum Boarium, dedicated to the commerce of cattle, between the Palatine Hill and the river Tiber,\nThe Forum Holitorium, dedicated to the commerce of herbs and vegetables, between the Capitoline Hill and the Servian walls,\nThe Forum Piscarium, dedicated to the commerce of fish, between the Capitoline hill and the Tiber, in the area of the current Roman Ghetto,\nThe Forum Suarium, dedicated to the commerce of pork, near the barracks of the cohortes urbanae in the northern part of the Campus Martius,\nThe Forum Vinarium, dedicated to the commerce of wine, in the area now of the \"quartiere\" Testaccio, between Aventine Hill and the Tiber.Other markets were known but remain unidentifiable due to a lack of precise information on each site's function.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nColossus of Constantine, colossal statue formerly in the west apse of the Basilica of Maxentius\nFarnese Gardens (1550), immediately overlooking the Forum\nTarpeian Rock, a traditional execution site overlooking the Forum\nVeduta\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nReconstruction in 3D of the Roman Forum, Circus Maximus, and the Tiber Island \u2013 www.italyrome.info\nRoman Forum's 360x180 degree panorama virtual tour\nDigital Roman Forum, 3D reconstructions of the Roman Forum in c. 400\nChristian H\u00fclsen: The Roman Forum (at LacusCurtius; H\u00fclsen was one of the principal excavators of the Forum)\nForum Romanum (photo archive)\nMap of the Forum in AD 100, blank or labelled",

          "It's Roman. It's in ruin. You are going to visit it. I was not disappointed.  You have to see with your own eyes to understand it.  Enjoy!!!",
          "The thing that's rarely mentioned about the Forum is that it's like a huge park, it's not like you just follow path to a gated area and look down on it. No, it's like a bit of hike over large uneven cobblestones, up hills, and down dirt \u2026",
          "The Roman Forum is definitely a must-see. It is vast, impressive and breathtaking. You could spend an entire day just walking around and listening to the history talking to you.",
          "Not for kids, they wont understand or appreciate the history. It is a great place for history lovers and helps us understand life in the roman times. Lovely place, one everyone should visit.\nI would recommend bringing a guide as you'll \u2026",
          "Second stop after Piazza Venezia. Situated between the piazza and the colloseum, it shows remnants of an amphitheatre where Romans usedbto have chariot races. Its worth a stop if your in the area. A guided tour would be best bundled with \u2026",
          "AWESOME experience. The architecture, the history... Italy is beautiful and warrants many return trips.  Also, my tour guide was fabulous!",
          "This was a side trip from the collesseum for me but I ended up enjoying the information we discovered here even better.  Walk the whole area to see the sites with a guide or it might all blend together. I found the marks from the years of mud on the pillars of the pagan church to be the most interesting once I heard the explanation.",
          "What a wonderful place to visit while in Rome! The ruins & history was amazing to see. Highly recommended vacation destination \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Amazing place with great view on Colloseum. Walking in the ruins I felt the spirit of ancient Rome and imagined how its citizens lived there. \nI highly recommend to visit this place but better not in hot weather because there is little \u2026",
          "Roman forum is one of the most attractive touristic destination at Rome, Italy. To visit this spot, you have to buy a ticket or Roma pass. You can also visit Collosium using the same ticket within validity period. Very beautiful view with historical signs of Roman Empires.",
          "Do yourself a favor and download Rick Steve's Europe app. It's free and has free walking tours in it. \n\nThe walking tour for the Forum was the best one we listened to. It was how he made the forum come alive while I was walking in it. \n\nThat app and the forum will make for an unforgettable experience. Do yourself a favor!",
          "A great place to see ancient Roman ruins, and the heart of the ancient Roman state. Go early in the day! At mid-day, even in February, it was hot and dry, and severely overcrowded with vast numbers of tourists. Most interesting bro contemplate the rise and fall of empires, and the building of new ones upon the ruins of the old.",

          "Impossible to find the right words to describe the site as it transports you back in time... Truly magnificent. I love Rome and this place is at its heart. The Roman Forum can be accessed from a few different points. You typically buy one \u2026",
          "If you like visiting historical places i prefer to visit that place.",
          "Beautiful ruins. I really mean it. They are simply ruins, but they are great. The whole place is just rocks, grass and some pillars, but their colors greatly complement each other.",
          "Love this place it\u2019s like a time machine! If you are planning to visit it prepare few hours and get equipped with comfortable shoes as all the pavement and stairs will hurt your legs for the next few days but you won\u2019t get disappointed!",
          "Take your time... the site is huge and there is a ton of things to see. You will have tons of opportunities to take pictures, soak in history and vantage points to view the beautiful city.\n\nThe audio guide however is not great. It's hard to \u2026",
          "Beautiful open museum. Worth visiting. Wear comfortable shoes, bring a map and some useful information. Requires a ticket to enter but worth it.",
          "I arrived the day the Italian President decided to lock all tourist sites down. You could only observe this from behind lock gates. A shame.",
          "What an amazing place. You must experience this part of history. We recommend you use a guide as it adds so much to the experience. we booked through tripadvisor and our guide Lucia was great.",
          "Great and full of history. Absolutely spectacular. One ticket grants a visit to the Colosseum, the Palatino Hill and the Roman forum. You can easily spend one or two days there, depending on how much you're interested in history and also depending on the season, since the closing hours are according to the sunset",
          "A must place to visit, but with a tour guide. You don't need a pass the line ticket but it comes with colosseum ticket. Huge place, so many things to see and learn but not alone. Put on comfortable shoes you'll need them.",
          "Very cool place. Get a map. Its easy to run into dead ends or get lost. And you'll be walking enough as it is. So don't get lost, get a map.",
          "Another must see. The tour guide was fun and did a great job answering all questions. Some of the things I wanted more in depth answers but we only had so much time I didn't want to bother. This place is gorgeous. Another that I wish I could've seen in it's prime.",
          "It is just about impossible to be a tourist in Rome and not visit the Roman Forum.  Expect to find large crowds, few places to get water or shade, and a great sense of confusion if you try to mentally reconstruct the Forum of 2,000 years \u2026",
          "Give yourself at least three hours to walk through! Also, you can buy tickets to a museum and special spots while inside the gates. Our travel and ticket sellers didn't tell us so we missed out.",
          "Very interesting part of European and more specifically Roman culture. With a guide is recommended, otherwise you are just staring at some old ruins without any extra explanation.",
          "Highly recommend this place. Few suggestions - check the weather before you decide to visit. If it\u2019s hot make sure you have your sun lotion on. Good shoes is a must - the surface is a bit uneven so recommend a good shoe. In all great place and you will get great shots. Try the guided tour if you really want to get into the details.",
          "One cannot say much about this in words...it's one of the must visit places in this world. Only advice is to go well rested especially if you've been doing other things that day. A good 2 hours would be great but if already tried it's tough \u2026",
          "Not very friendly to wheelchair users or baby carriages due to the very unstable floor. There was an elevator to access the Forum  but was broken and no warnings about that.\nDespite that, if you can reach the viewpoints, the view is just amazing.\nPoint to the kindness of some people that really want to help (not people from security).",
          "It is unbelievable how Roman empire could build such a wonder by that time. Not much is preserved on many of the constructions left, but it clearly shows how amazing and unique this was in its glory days.",
          "We really liked it here. Included on the Colleseum ticket. Lots of interesting things to see. Information boards in Italian and English. We spent 3 half hours here. Not really suitable for people with mobility issues as lots of cobbled \u2026",

          "In order to understand ancient Rome you need to be exposed to the heart of it all - the Forum.  Government, business, and religion all were here.  It can be daunting.  I would strongly suggest hiring a local guide to explain it all to you.  Well worth the cost.",
          "Truly immense, beautiful architectural achievement at the heart of modern human history. Pictures or videos can not do justice to the scope of the central building or surrounding structures. This is a must-see, and costs nothing to explore (aside from the optional panorama elevator). Would recommend a visit without hesitation.",

          "We went here on a guided tour with  LivItaly Tours. Our tour guided was very knowledgeable and explained in a way that is understood easily also by kids. We were a family of four so I highly recommend to go on a tour with them not group tour so you can have a better understanding of the structures not just snapping photos.",
          "So much history here and the ruins are amazing. We went as part of a combined guided tour of the Colosseum and Roman Forum which was great as the guide was able to educate us throughout the tour. The whole site is very large so allow at least a couple of hours here to be able to take it all in",

          "One of the most impressive places I\u2019ve visited in my life, it\u2019s like walking around in a different era. It was even more impressive to me than the Colosseum and the Vatican. I recommend you to wear confortable shoes and visit every corner of this incredible place.",
          "Pack some good shoes because you going to be here a lot, there's a lot to see and walk, too much history in just a place, if you can get an audioguide you will learn a lot of things here, take your time and enjoy this piece of history, when \u2026",

          "This place is full of stories. Get a professional guide! We visited once years ago without a guide. It was only a place with some historical buildings. The last time we hired a guide, Dino. He has a Ph.D. in history. He gave us so much information. \nGet a guide and enjoy the imagination.",

          "It's crazy to think how most of this was buried underneath farmland and swamp for centuries. I recommend visiting with a tour. Very easy to miss crucial details if you visit yourself for the first time.",

          "Very big and alot to see.!! The guides are useful but without a guide you can still read the boards and learn alot. I took about 2 and a half hours to walk through.",
          "Beautiful spot to see ancient Rome. I bought a combo ticket to visit Colosseum and Forum Romanum. Definitely worth seeing both. Don't leave Rome without seeing this beautiful piece of history.",

          "Really crowded, but so is everything of this cultural magnitude, especially on a day when entrance is free. A must do is going up the stairs to the plateau, as you will get a gorgeous view of the surroundings, the forum, house of senate, temples and the coliseum.",
          "A great insight to Roman history and how they lived. Give you an idea of vast their empire was.",
          "Amazing place. But 10 times more meaningful if you have a guide. So much of the history will pass you by without an expert telling you what's what.",
          "We visited the Coliseum and the surrounding areas as a combo tour package. There is so much information that it was worth it having someone guide you. It was about 40 euro per person, but not having to wait three hours in line to get into \u2026",
          "Beautiful Roman architecture to see. It is very big and the beautiful view all around. Must visit place",
          "An awesome piece of Roman history to explore. Signage at most of the sights fill in the history if you turn up too late for the audio guide like we did. Allow yourself plenty of time - 2 hours is definitely too short. The view of the terrace is not to be missed.",
          "Roman forum and Colosseum are just must see! Although you can't see so much from old Rome anymore its still impressive and you will be asking yourself all the time how the could build it and then why it's so destroyed. Anyway best way to \u2026",

          "It\u2019s way bigger than I thought it would be. I saw someone said that it would take a hour for each area which is covered by the Colosseum ticket. It depends on the people for sure but it took me twice as long to see the Colosseum, the Roman \u2026",

          "Amazing walking tours of the forum. was a warm day to walk but all worth it. there are several entrances, so choose the one other than the one close to the Colosseum. we also bought tickets for the Colosseum by the forum entrance and skipped much of the queue.",
          "This place is w o n d e r f u l. It reflects the historical rome perfectly and its very interesting! As a history fan, this place made me very interested and entertained walking along the way. You can see various things like Arco de Tito \u2026",

          "Loved visiting! So much history to see! We spent 4 hours here!",

          "It's so impressive to walk between so much history. If walls could talk ....",

          "You can feel the history there. We were lucky because there wasn\u2019t lot of people so we could see almost everything and spent time where and when we wanted.",
          "Nicely restored history. I will need several visits at Roman Forum to learn a bit about ancient Roman.",
          "Amazing place of incredible historical importance well maintained. Might be a bit busy but worth it and incredibly cheap especially for the people under 24 living in the EU",
          "Along with a walk around the coliseum and the palatine hill this was an excellent day out, if a little tiring. Get an early start, the forum and hill can take over two hours, so get here well before you start the coliseum (allow 30mins for \u2026",

          "Somewhat of a mixed bag. Undoubtedly hugely important to modern civilization, and worth a visit for that reason alone. However, better-preserved monuments are around, and without the squillions of tourists to boot.  \n\nIf you want to walk in \u2026",

          "Cool place. Research it or get a guide to get maximum enjoyment. It\u2019s big so bring a water bottle and some hiking shoes. Colosseum ticket includes access to here. There are water taps all over to fill up.",
          "Beautiful place, the history everywhere... I would like to see this place again",
          "Take a walk through ancient Rome...just ignore the busses and remember to bring sun protection and plenty of water",
          "WOW! To be fair, I actually enjoyed this more than the colloseum. We took a guided combination tour with this and the colloseum, which I actually don't recommend. Don't get me wrong, the guide was super genuine, funny and knew very much of \u2026",
          "A place too few visit. Go with a guide or to group to learn some interesting things about one of the oldest places in Rome. Well worth it.",
          "So much to see at the forum.  What we thought was going to be a short stroll turned into several hours. A shortcut is to go to the top of the hill on the left shortly after the entrance and listen to online tour histories while over looking \u2026",
          "The center of the world for a millennium the forum does not disappoint.  With the weight of history around you immerse yourself in the ruins, having some knowledge to flesh out the small placards helps immensely, and look at the progression \u2026",
          "Highly recommended when you go to Rome. Obviously a lot of the Roman ruins should be explored. It\u2019s definitely great part of history to see how the Roman forum looked and hopefully continues to be excavated and brought back to life.",
          "Perfect place to just walk around and see at your own pace, beautiful gardens and huge monuments.",
          "Could have spent at least another day exploring and discovering the historic monuments. Rome history at its best.",
          "Such a lovely place one should not miss in Rome trip. Just opposite to Colosseum. You can buy the ticket as a package included Colosseum.",
          "The best part of Rome!!!   \nYou're going to wear your feet out, so don't plan other activities that require a lot of walking on the same day.",
          "A crazy amount of history is on display here. I do, however, recommend a tour guide unless you are a huge Roman history buff.",
          "The ticket offices near the colosseum are always the busiest, choose any other for a better experience.",
          "Very historical, make sure you read what everything is and use your imagination to rebuild it. Very inspiring",
          "Oooooh, ancient shopping mall! It amazes me how structures built hundreds of years ago are still standing, yet the average strip mall is collapsing 32 years later in America....",
          "This place is great and full of history. If in summer bring water, and comfortable shoes. It is better to do it with a guide so they can highlight little details and share some info that you miss otherwise.",
          "Even though I could've done more research, I was pretty disappointed that you have to pay for the experience. And I know that the money would probably go to the preservation and keeping it intact.  \nBut besides that I really appreciated the \u2026",

          "So much history there, had a great guide booked it with a ticket for the Colosseum combined.",
          "Great place to see the ruins -- you can view them from the outside but it's well worth taking a guided tour",
          "I think it should be for free to visit. You can see most of it from the bridge above but still it's beautiful place and very interesting history.",
          "Very open spaced and it creates the feeling that there are many different levels. You can enjoy a walk in there, and you can take great pictures of the Roman city from the top of the hill",
          "Really important historical site. But I think you need a guided tour to appreciate it at all. The plaques are THE WORST! They explain nothing! If anywhere could use an augmented reality app it's the forum.",
          "Historical, amazing, beautiful, and great place for photos! Be sure to have hiking shoes because the ground is uneven. It's also hilly so be prepared to walk up and down slopes. Bring a hat or umbrella because it's usually how and sunny here",
          "Apart from being bit by bugs this was such a vast exploration area. Be prepared and well rested as the ground is very uneven with bulging pavers. Wear comfortable shoes to really soak in the experience and all it has to offer. So much \u2026",

          "Wonderful visit! We enjoyed having a guide take us through to give us better information than if we had gone through in our own.",
          "This is one of my favorite spots in all of Roma. Also great spot on New Years eve for viewing fireworks",
          "We made our way over here after the coliseum. Take a water bottle and fill up and the fresh fountains. It\u2019s very beautiful to walk around and see the ruins and imagine how it originally looked",
          "Waste of time.  Mostly just a pile of rocks.  Terrible audio guide.  On the plus side its not too crowed and we went the day it was free.  Be careful buying tickets on-line.  If it's free the day you book tickets there is no refund and nothing to warn you on-line.  Even if it's free I think you're wasting your money going here.",
          "Truly rich with history but if making it on your own, make sure you map out the walking route starting from Palatine Hill down to forum. One suggestion is use Rick Steve's audio tour. On a hot day, there are plenty water fountains dotted \u2026",

          "I could have spent hours here. A must visit. Is close to the Coliseum (and the Coluseum Metro stop on the red line). Make sure you get a guide or audio guide, because you are standing where many important historical events happened.",
          "Great day looking at the old site .  We had a guide to walk us around and we also did the coliseum as well. Was very warm but they had plenty of water fountains to get extra water. This was my 6th time to Rome but we took other members of \u2026",

          "I was not as impressed with the roman forums. The park of ruins is nice but the ruins aren't as interesting as other parts of the city. The overall architecture is everywhere in the city so it doesn't really stand out. Also, the whole park \u2026",

          "I love this place! Beautiful and historic monuments/ruins which are well preserved and well worth the visit. \n\nIt costs around \u20ac6 to enter and you can walk around for as long as you want. We spent around 2 hours there.",

          "Rome is my city. And I love it. Probably one of the most beautiful one in the world. The forum is a magic place in.the heart of the city. Take a walk if you need to thought, go there for a romantic walk. The magic of the place will make your moment unique",
          "Amazing ancient city. Bring water and walking shoes.",
          "What a stunning place. We started our visit by first walking up and around the Palatine Hill before descending into the Roman Forum. We had already done the Colosseum before this and as we had a 3.5 month old baby, it was quite a lot to do \u2026",
          "The pictures say it all really. This should be top of your list in Rome and you can easily spend a full day here :)",

          "Amazing ruins of old Rome. Walk roads built 2000 years ago and see arcs and temples built that long ago also. This is a must see if you're in Rome. Get there early and get a good guide to avoid lines and fewer people. You can also learn a lot more from a guide which also helps to get a better understanding of what you're seeing.",
          "Be aware of pickpocketers. Although the place has a great history but depends on the individual if you like it. It is next to Colosseum so do not get confused with the directions. Entry is not free. And you will have to go through a huge \u2026",

If you are in Rome you need to go to the Forum. You can see a lot from the road above but if you want more info a tour is only \u20ac13. Bring water and a hat or umbrella.",
          "It's a great historical landmark but there are very few site descriptions inside. I haven't seen such a poor organization since Polish muzuems in 90'. I don't say that they need to change everything to interactive like we do in Poland right \u2026",
          "To walk on the same places people walked 2000 years ago is amazing!",
          "Incredible place to visit, the real center of the ancient Rome life. The thing impress me the most are the signs (carved in the stone) of every day life of the forum: cuts made by carts on the cobble stone, or the \"latrunclui\" board carved on the steps of Basilica Julia. If you visit during summer, bring a lot of water and sunscreen.",
          "The opening hours change with the winter time however it is poorly communicates: says so on he English-version website, but not on an Italian one, the boards outside aren\u2019t clear and the stuff isn\u2019t too happy with helping. It\u2019s a shame!! Hoped Such a place would be more used to organizing and informing visitors.",
          "Best time to go is between 1-4 pm in my opinion.",
          "This is one of the stops which you should pay a visit too. With really interesting selection of ruins and histroy.\nWe went on the free day, which meant the queues were huge. As such we didnt go in, but walked around the side. If you are \u2026",

          "Without a tour guide is pointless. We did a tour with Storytelling Rome Tours and that was a blast!!!",

          "Just next to colloseum if you want a perfect picture of colloseum this is the best place. Also with lots of historic and beautiful artifacts. Old Roman city well maintained and a must visit place",

          "Incredible place! At first glance, the place look small, but once you come in you realize just how big this place is! The place is so big, and full of gorgeous fallen old buildings. As the guide said, everything used to be just a basement \u2026",
          "A visit to Rome can't be complete with a visit to the Forum Romanum, the cultural, economic, and spiritual heart of ancient Rome. Once an unrivaled sight of temples, statues, arches, and halls of commerce. Today, a few columns are still \u2026",

          "This place is kind of like the Grand Canyon, you cannot appreciate how huge it is from pictures.   It was way too hot in September, but well worth the effort.   So much ancient history packed into a few acres.",

          "Great visit and wonderful experience. Please take in a guided tour in conjunction with a Colosseum tour. The price of the ticket covers both. Go early to beat the massive crowds and the late afternoon heat. Take water and a bottle. There \u2026",

          "Does make you wonder how massive Rome was when these buildings were standing. Everthinging on a huge scale.",
          "Spent a good couple of hours exploring the forum and Imperial palace on Palentine hill. We visited the day after on a combined ticket with the Colosseum which was great value however there are a few areas you need the 'super' ticket for which would have been good to know before.",
          "South side of the Palatine Hill is now accessible, meaning you can make a full circuit of the site. Found it best to enter from the Colosseum side entrance.",
          "Just an incredible experience with so many incredible sites.  Allow one to two hours and bring plenty of water in a refillable drink container, you can refill it at multiple places in the park.\n\nThere will be lots of walking and many steps...",
          "Another highlight of a visit to Rome. A guided tour is not an absolute requirement and being in the open helps as the crowds seem less and are spread out. Still, a lot of things to see and take in. Good photography. Take sunscreen and hat. One of my favourite places in Rome.",

          "This place was soo cool! You could easily spend about 3 or 4 hours here just to see everything. If you love historic places this is a must see. I enjoyed it more than the Colosseum even, and it was far less crowded.",
          "So so much history and a wonderful place to walk around and spend a day. It's worth it to pay a little extra once inside for Nero's/Augustace's tours",
          "Love this place . Even though it\u2019s in the city it feels so relax !",
          "Without an appropriate tour or guide, this could be seen as a set of old stones and cobbles, with a guide, it's an ancient bustling Roman Forum with stories and legends galore. You can get a free audio guide from Rick Steves via podcast or \u2026",
          "Must visit during a visit to Rome. Near the Coliseum. This historical attraction has many aspects of Roman life. Get your walking boots out for this bit.",
          "Amazing, takes around 2-3 hours to see the garden (palatine hill) and the forum. Well worth the money.",
          "Must visit place when in Rome. While walking around the forum , we will able to imagine many scenes from the Julius Caesar . This forum has got a historical significance and the ruins of buildings around the forum highlights the morph that Roman empire had gone through in passing ages.",

          "Fascinating to walk around the ancient ruins. Could easily spend half a day here walking around, especially in the heat! Good value for money with joint tickets from the Colosseum at \u20ac12 each. We decided not to do any tours and just meandered around reading the signs.",

          "Amazing and very interesting, very historical, if you do a full tour of the Rome Forum, you get full information of what everything was.",
          "Very interesting, we spent about 3 hours here. The Forumapp was very useful for both the Forum and the Palatine hill. Not to be missed when visiting Rome.",
          "Walking here is like taking a stroll through time itself. Most every rock and pebble on the ground may have at one point met the hands of a stonemason, potter, or artisan. You will see \"newer\" buildings on top of older ones, most of which \u2026",
          "Gorgeous. Once again bay for the complete tour. Although you can also self tour with your phone using the historical markers. You can also just jump on a tour. There's so many none will notice. Its huge! So prepare to walk alot to cover it all. Make sure you're comfortable",
          "Definitely a must see if you want to have the Time experience. And ruin sight seeing.",
          "I entered Palestine Hill and the Roman Forum with much lower expectations than the Colosseum, but was absolutely blown away the entire area, which is essentially the core of the city of Ancient Rome.\nYou will walk miles and miles and not \u2026",
          "Feel those Roman's walking next to you,what a buzz",
          "Very nice archeological site closely associated with the Colosseum and a part of many escorted tours. Make sure to include enough time for a guided visit of this site after the Colosseum. Great Roman history!",
          "A top site for those interested in Ancient Rome. The Forum is the flat area at the base of the Palatine Hill. You can easily walk to the Palatine Hill from the Forum as  noth sites are basically one site. I prefer the Palatine Hill as you have great views and monuments up there \ud83d\ude00",
          "Many ruins and the imagination of how it really looked runs wild. Just fascinating. Highly reccomend it and be sure to take advantage of every shaded area by viewing around and cool down. There are various water fountains but definitely take at least one water bottle with you to refill at each station.",
          "Okish place to see, unless u r tired from visiting many places",
          "I'd definitely recommend visiting here if you're in Rome - The Roman Forum and Palatine Hill are both beautiful attractions with loads to see! Climb high for the BEST views!\nthe Roman Forum where we saw the square, the markets, the Temples \u2026",
          "Probably the most gorgeous historical landscape in Rome together with the Colosseum. You must check it out and try to imagine how Romans lived there 2000 years ago.",
          "Definitely a bucket list location.   Impressive.",
          "As so many buildings, outstanding, again built without the tools, etc.we have today, but the beauty, strength, and still standing is above  belief",
          "We were in Rome for a special wedding anniversary and it was amazing. I could just imagine the Roman's going about their everyday things. Worth a visit.",
          "A must see when in Rome, place of timeless beauty especially if you let yourself imagine it in all its glory.",
          "Roman forum which is a must and worth a visit during the Roman trip. This is located near Colosseum you can buy tickets for Colosseum, Palatine hill and Roman forum together. I remembered visiting Hampi which is located near Hospete in \u2026",
          "Simply amazing. Words can\u2019t describe the feeling of seeing and being in such a remarkable place. I\u2019ve been multiple times and it\u2019s better each time. I would recommend going in the early morning to beat the heat a bit in the summer.",
          "Very nice garden to walk around. Especially in the evening and mornings there are less tourists and you have a good chance to make nice pictures and actually enjoy the sight and sound of cicadas. During the day very crowded.",
          "Walk inside is better than outside, see an overview of the greatest Roman square is unique! Wherever you are is amazing \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Massive place and very interesting.  Unfortunately access routes are not in a loop so you need to walk back on yourself quite a lot.  Included with a Colosseum ticket option and valid over 2 days if you don't want to see them both in the same day.",
          "What can I say about the Roman forum. Impressive very much. A huge building that delights in its history, and architecture. Although we have been looking for the monument to Julia for a very long time, we seem to have been unable to find it among all the monuments",
          "Absolutely beautiful. Really nice to see the history. Be warned, there is A LOT to see so make sure you have enough time",
          "Was a lot beautiful historic center. Would definitely recommend getting a tour guide as they can explain so much about the history of the region. Our tour guide took us through the Forum and the Collesium!",
          "The place is incredible but it's not very well kept. Has been raining and it was muddy all over. The worst thing is that there were no indications whatsoever as how to do the tour. It looks that they expect everyone to pay for a guided tour \u2026",
          "It\u2019s the fora. You should go. Warnings about hot weather and bringing water/a hat should be heeded. It is exposed, and a bit of walking will get you very far from shade and refreshments, though bathrooms and water taps are spread \u2026",
          "Impressive!!! What a great civilization can build thousands years ago. Recommend a tour with guide for more details and interesting informations. Lakely at this time of year (November) not very crowded. All persons  very friendly and helpful.",
          "Palentine hill and the Forum are the less explored ruins compared to the Colosseum but seriously get a guide and check it out so much history. Highly recommended Christian from crown tours. He is the owner and his knowledge was phenomenal.",
          "A must see in Rome with a lot of history.  Don\u00b4t miss to visit the Palatin Hill.\nGreat view out there.",
          "If you use a guide you'll learn a lot more about the history of this place. If you've watched a lot of documentaries, tv shows, movies, or read about this place, it's awesome to see it in real life and imagine it all happening in front of you",
          "Better to take a guided tour of this place.. otherwise you won't be able to understand the beauty of the place",
          "Place was amazing but huge. Plan to spend at least 2-4 hours there to walk all of it. I suggest going when the weather is cooler in order to enjoy it. We went end of July and it was 95 degrees F outside and we had to rush through everything just because the children kept overheating. But it is an azing place to experience",
          "The staff was not helpful at all, they said we couldn\u2019t get tickets to the Colosseum because they were completely booked.. so they charged us \u20ac16 just to see the forum (with no tour). The next day we went to the Colosseum anyway just to see \u2026",
          "Great dip into Roman History...amazing place to wonder around and to understand  how and why Rome become empire...",
          "The Roman forum! If possible get a guide to make sense of it, or there in the warmer months go to one of the evening shows.",
          "Bring a water bottle there's plenty of places to get a refill. Lots to see be prepared to walk around for 2 or 3 hours. A guided tour of 6-12 would be ideal. In larger your groups you likely won't be able to hear your guide half the time.",
          "Amazing place with so much history on it\nA must do in Rome",
          "Hard work on a hot day but a fascinating experience in the style of Pompeii. In other words there are lots of ruined buildings but you do get the effect that you are wandering through the heart of ancient Rome. And some buildings, the arches and temples, are astonishing. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Great place to see how it looked like in the time that this place was a full of life.\nYou dont have to buy a ticket because it is possible to have a good look from above.\nDont worry if you cant make it during the day because it is also beautiful during the night.",
          "This is a Historical Place. I like it very muck.",
          "Very good. A place that remembers the ancient Rome",
          "Can't describe in words, this place takes you to Roman Era and with some imagination you can recreate and live the grandeur of Roman architecture.",
          "Amazing, the views and the culture during this tour are incredible, you dont have to pay for a tour but as a lot is included in the Roman Forum i think its worth it, there is quite a bit of walking involved but for the views and the history it is well worth it.",
          "What a pain getting tickets in the normal way. All the signs directing you to the ticket office are wrong as they have moved the office to the colosseum. Confused people everywhere. Especially at the forum where the old signs point you to. \u2026",
          "Lots to see, great experience walking around in historic ancient ruins",
          "You just realize how great Roman civilization would have been by walking thru these ruins.",
          "So much of history!. Must go with a well informed guide. There's lot of walking to do.\nDon't miss where the Roman emperor Caesar was killed and where Mark Antony gave his speech after Caesar's assassination. It's a pity that this great emperor got such a burial.",
          "I'm in Rome looking at ancient history... This can only be a 5 star review.",
          "So much to see here. You can spend hours walking the stone paths, gardens and various structures. There is a lower and upper section. Crowds can be overwhelming in high tourist seasons. I honestly suggest coming Sep-Dec when crowds are \u2026",
          "Lovely scenery of different Roman Empire history details. Well preserved, nice and pure. Pity that a lot of old buildings have ruined, but pays of to go right now and see when still a lot is left.",
          "If you have the time to see it, then dive in and buy a ticket. The waiting lines to get a ticket can be a killer. Still, once you are in, it\u2019s pretty cool to walk down the original streets from back then. But also here you need a good \u2026",
          "Put on a good pair of walking shoes because there is a lot to see.  Palatine Hill is worth walking around. Located on hill above the forum. There are numerous Roman buildings to see. We enjoyed the walk. No where the crowd of the coliseum, \u2026",
          "I liked the fact that there were still some stone columns lying around",
          "Amazing to see what old Rome would have been like in the glory days! Give Rick Stevens Italian audio tour a listen while strolling through this site, everything is better with context",
          "Do I even have to tell yo to go here? Because if I should you shouldn't be in Rome. The only. Things I can recommend you are  to get a good and if possible great guide. A passionate guide will make the trip a lot more interesting. For lost \u2026",
          "The forum is an impressive place. There is so much history (as 99% of all buildings in Rome) attached to this place! \nDifferently form other historical sites, the visit to this one is more a \"free roam\" than a guided path. Since the site is \u2026",
          "Fantastic place! So many relics and gardens",
          "An immersion into history. Of life-changing realizations.",
          "By far the best tour in Rome. Don't kid yourself, you will need a full day to visit this place, especially if you take the audioguide. My fiancee and I simply loved it. Grazie bene :)",
          "Great archeological park. One of the single most important to western societies descendants from the Roman tradition, even if it\u2019s not the best maintained. It\u2019s been at the heart of conflict for thousands of years. Worth a visit. If you\u2019re \u2026",
          "Impressive to be standing at the heart of ancient Rome, must visit place. At the same time I was amazed - like in so many archeological places in Italy, that there is hardly any signage and the information there is either too succinct or \u2026",
          "Another open air free museum! Lovely",
          "Great experience, well organised and worth it. Free some Sunday's, check website",
          "My son's favorite place in the entire Rome. If you know your Roman history, this is the place where most of it happened. For me, doing the coliseum and the forum on the same day ended up being too much. Would recommend maybe doing one in the.morning, have lunch and rest and seeing the second only in late afternoon.",

          "Fascinating historical area. It is crazy how the Roman lived in the past. There are ruins of very big houses and gardens. Unfortunately it is very crowded and you need to bring enough time to get inside like every sightseeing spot in Roma.",

          "Beautiful place, you can also learn a lot about the history of this place. Since we were here in May, everything was nice and green. I don't know how that will be later in the year. It appears to be well kept by the gardeners.\nThe only \u2026",

          "Come prepared for HOT and crowded but it's more than 2500 years of history at your fingertips, literally! Choose an early guided tour, get a S.U.P.E.R. ticket. Take a hat, sunscreen and water. Don't be in a hurry. Study the basic history of the Caesars before you go, and it will be magical.",

Use the water fountain near the entrance near the Colosseum for a free drink, and fresh as any you can buy.\n\nIf you like the Roman history and can use your imagination then it is worth the heat to do it, but would recommend a guide of some sort (Audio/Book/Human) to make most of it.",

          "A must see in Rome, Has been transformed in the 15 years since my last visit, more if the site has been opened up and the single ticket covering the Palatine, Forum and Colluseum is good value, gets quite busy on the afternoons though.",
          "It was gorgeous. It's really awesome to see all the ruins and stuff, however it is high key touristy. We wanted to avoid all that stuff but I think it's worth it for this. It was really incredible, I would definitely give it a look.",
          "Simply amazing tour.  It was included in the Coliseum tour.  I\u2019m happy we did it. PS they have the cleanest restroom in Rome!!!",
          "If you are visiting Rome this is something you have to see. This is one of the main reasons that make you want to visit Italy. The entrance isn't very expensive. Be prepared for a lot of walking. The place gets extremely busy. It is \u2026",
          "Amazing ancient locatuonwith rich history. 4 out of 5 stars because it generally is very hot and limited shade and water available.  It is a great place, where you can walk the streets and city of ancient Rome, but for Rome, there are a ton \u2026",
          "Beautiful and definitely a must see. I didn't have a guide but just explored by myself. Sometimes you catch a few tour guides stating a few facts but loved just moving at my own pace and taking it all in.",
          "Best historical site in Rome! I liked that you can walk around a lot inside and that there\u2019s a wide variety of buildings/ruins. It\u2019s right across the street from the Colosseum and is in the same plot of land as the Palatine Hill. It can get really busy, but isn\u2019t as crowded as the Colosseum.",
          "I would have prefered some more information on the buildings such as stories about the daily lifes or architectial information.",
          "Antique Rome, beautiful sight seeing area. Down town area of Rome in Italy",
          "So much history and architectural wonders, crown tours' guide Scott was very knowledgeable and made the tour fun with his knowledge and witty comparisons to modern times",
          "It's just amazing to see part of that history and imagine how it was grandiose to live in such a city, they build everything with such a beauty. I would love to go through that place with virtual reality glasses. :)",
          "This is simply amazing the scale of the buildings and monuments are truly breath taking. I had the privilege of experiencing this with my daughter and she enjoyed it as much as I did, I would advise everyone that takes a trip to Rome to \u2026",
          "Highly recommend to visit. You should book the entrance ticket in advance. If you do not have the ticket, do not queue the line. You must walk to office ticket which far from the Colloseum.",
          "This was my favorite place in rome, after Colosseum. Its magical.",
          "Amazing, didn't actually pay the entrance fee; just read the history from my Marco Polo guide and took in the views.",
          "Nice to have a stroll abound in the sun or dry weather but not in a torrent of rain which is a challenging experience..",
          "Nice place to sit and take it all in! Oh and you can plan your next move in peace",
          "Really the feel of the history starts here. You walk at the same pads as ceaser. How special is that.",
          "Site is very well laid out with excellent signage.   It is really nice to have a tour guide and I highly recommend take walks as my guide of choice.  However if you don't you can certainly manage on your own.   Do bring a water bottle in \u2026",
          "This is a very amazing place to visit. It is awesome to see such great large ruins.",
          "Such a beautiful piece of history. Would suggest going on a guided tour... It helps knowing what exactly you are looking at, and also, guided tours means skipping the long lines at the entrance!",
          "Loved it. Amazing what architecture there was back then.",
          "Loved visiting the Roman Forum. There is a lot to walk around and see. I didn't go with a tour group but still enjoyed looking at all the features.",
          "Definitely worth exploring. Largely overlooked thanks to the Colosseum but it could be as interesting or more. During peak summer time there was no line at all.",
          "Place filled with tons and tons of history, the true center of the Roman empire, where all politics and commerce were the strongest. Although it is all in ruins it provides layers of many, many years of an evolving empire; you can still \u2026",
          "The history is something.  This is another place that you have to walk a lot but it is so worth it. To see the places where the people walked and what they did is amazing.",
          "History to walk through and experience. Just incredible",
          "The place itself is beautiful and really worth seeing. However the queuing system and ticket shops could be a little clearer about how the visit is organised. We were given a time slot an hour away from when we purchased tickets to see the coliseum, so went to see the forum and skipped the arena.",
          "It would have been a truly amazing site in the history. Try to find a good guide who can help you imagine how it would have been thousands of years ago. It is true for almost all the sites in Rome. You need a great guide to truly appreciate this city. Wish you all the best for your adventures!!!",
          "This is a wonderful walk with a lot of history and great photos. Not overly crowded like Vatican Museums and Coliseum",
          "Loved it ,fantastic ,be prepared to queue a while ,but well worth it.mind people trying to sell things to you ,don't touch anything they take that as you've bought it .walk on .",
          "Amazing experience you would have by walking through this empire that is not comparing to anything else. Will be better to go for this after colosseum.",
          "Wow. Can't be described in words. Great tourist spot. Good food and wine all around it too.",
          "What can you say about the remains of the capital of the western world dating back to at least 750 BC and holding firm for the next 1200 years. Come see the Forum, you will never forget it.",
          "A confusing melange but absolutely a must... I'm giving it four stars because it's very confusing and messy.  You never really have enough time to see anything unless you spend at least half a day there.",
          "This ticket is good for 2 consecutive days from first use. Virtually all people that purchase this ticket visit the Colosseum, so I note my ticket-buying strategy in the Colosseum review. The Forum and Palatine Hill are in the same area adjacent to the Colosseum and Palatine Hill is where you get a birds eye view of the Forum.",
          "Incredible! Allow plenty of time, as there is so much to see. You could spend most of the day here if you wanted."

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Villa Borghese is a landscape garden in Rome, containing a number of buildings, museums (see Galleria Borghese) and attractions. It is the third largest public park in Rome (80 hectares or 197.7 acres) after the ones of the Villa Doria Pamphili and Villa Ada. The gardens were developed for the Villa Borghese Pinciana (\"Borghese villa on the Pincian Hill\"), built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by Scipione Borghese, who used it as a villa suburbana, a party villa, at the edge of Rome, and to house his art collection. The gardens as they are now were remade in the late 18th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1605, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew of Pope Paul V and patron of Bernini, began turning this former vineyard into the most extensive gardens built in Rome since Antiquity. The vineyard's site is identified with the gardens of Lucullus, the most famous in the late Roman republic. In the 19th century much of the garden's former formality was remade as a landscape garden in the English taste (illustration, right). The Villa Borghese gardens were long informally open, but were bought by the commune of Rome and given to the public in 1903. The large landscape park in the English taste contains several villas. The Spanish Steps lead up to this park, and there is another entrance at the Porte del Popolo by Piazza del Popolo. The Pincio (the Pincian Hill of ancient Rome), in the south part of the park, offers one of the greatest views over Rome.\nThe Piazza di Siena, located in the villa, hosted the equestrian dressage, individual jumping, and the jumping part of the eventing competition for the 1960 Summer Olympics. A balustrade (dating from the early seventeenth century) from the gardens, was taken to England in the late 19th century, and installed in the grounds of Cliveden House, a mansion in Buckinghamshire, in 1896.  In 2004, a species of Italian snail was discovered, still living on the balustrade after more than 100 years in England.\n\n\n== Villas in the gardens ==\n\nToday the Galleria Borghese is housed in the Villa Borghese itself.  The garden Casino Borghese, built on a rise above the Villa by the architect Giovanni Vasanzio, was set up by Camillo Borghese to contain sculptures by Bernini from the Borghese collection, including his David and his Daphne, and paintings by Titian, Raphael and Caravaggio\nThe Villa Giulia adjoining the Villa Borghese gardens was built in 1551 - 1555 as a summer residence for Pope Julius III; now it contains the Etruscan Museum (Museo Etrusco).\nThe Villa Medici houses the French Academy in Rome, and the Fortezzuola a Gothic garden structure that houses a collection memorializing the academic modern sculptor Pietro Canonica. In the 1650s, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez painted several depictions of this Villa's garden casino festively illuminated at night. Before electricity, such torchlit illuminations carried an excitement hard to conceive today.\nOther villas scattered through the Villa Borghese gardens are remains of a world exposition in Rome in 1911.\nThe Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna located in its grounds has a collection of 19th- and 20th-century paintings emphasizing Italian artists.\nArchitecturally the most notable of the 1911 exposition pavilions is the English pavilion designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens (who later designed New Delhi), now housing the British School at Rome.\n\n\n== Other points of interest ==\nThe villa's gardens feature in one of Respighi's Pini di Roma.\nThe garden contains a replica of the Shakespeare's Globe Theatre built in 2003.\nBeside the 1911 Exposition's villas, there is the Exposition's Zoo, recently redesigned, with minimal caging, as the Bioparco, and the Zoological Museum (Museo di Zoologia).\nIn 1873 a hydrochronometer on the 1867 design of Gian Battista Embriaco, O.P. inventor and professor of the Roman College of St. Thomas was built in the gardens in emulation of the one at the College of St. Thomas.  Another version stands in the gardens of the Pincian Hill.  Embriaco had presented two prototypes of his invention at the Paris Universal Exposition in 1867 where it won prizes and great acclaim.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of parks and gardens in Rome\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n1960 Summer Olympics official report.

          "We were looking for something to do on our final day and as it was sunny decided to go for a walk around the villa Borghese. Wow! So much to see and do just outside the city. We saw the sign for the animal park and thought there might be a couple of chickens or goats but headed",

          "We didn't venture into any of the buildings but the park itself is magnificent. We spent an hour wandering and didn't cover all of it; if we'd had more time we would have hired the pedal-carriage thingies and explored more. Everywhere you turn there are fountains or small",

          "It's well worth carefully planning your visit here - I cannot imagine how busy it must be in summer. The cafe was swamped when we were there, again giving a glimpse into the demand that has required this careful visitor management. This is mitigated by tickets being pre-sold",
          "This park is a delight to wander about. It\u2019s not a luscious garden with flower beds but more like a place to chill in on a day off. There are fountains, little temples, statues and, what I really like, very good street musicians! You can hire a bike to drive in the park. Or a",

          "We reached The Villa Borghese walking up from The Piazza del Popolo. The view over Rome from the top of the steps, was certainly worth the climb. At the top of the steps, we took an electric buggy ride up to the Villa. We visited its amazing zoo & loved the beautiful gardens",
          "After walking around Rome for a while, this is a nice diversion - a massive expanse of green. Large grounds with plenty to explore. Lakes, cafes, playgrounds, horse rides. A real escape from the cobblestone roads of Rome with the thousands of tourists.",
          "Villa Borghese has been rated one of the top five places to visit while in Rome, yet I had never been there in previous trips.. This is a museum with beautiful paintings of course and the ceilings are incredible as well. The gardens outside are nice as well although I didn\u2019t",

          "Loved this chilled place in the Northern part of Rome. Love the King bird pair of statues into the Villa Borghese. Lots of grass, Greenery and trees. Plenty of seating with opportunity to rent bikes. A couple of fountains and lots of nature including trees squirrels and",
          "Amazing sculptures and pictures. You must book in advance...only 360 tickets issued per two hour visit slot. Audio guide is essential....Really nice \"healthy\" cafe, appropriately stocked classy shop. We found prebooking tricky so asked hotel reception to do it for us.",
          "Probably my favourite place in Rome. Full of beautiful sculptures, structures and interestingly varied plantlife. Makes an excellent location for a walk.",
          "We enjoyed touring Villa Borghese. It is more focused on trees and greenery than on flowers. Nevertheless, it was wonderful relief from the heat on a hot day.",
          "It is really worth vising this amazing place. It has a huge garden to take a ride with bicycles with your partner in order to have a look on the sights. The museum has very refined exhibits. I will visit this place as soon as possible!",
          "We did not go into the Villa Borghese, but even the outside is so beautiful. We walked around and all over the park, which is obviously slightly dried out in August, but it was still well worth the visit. You can rent all kinds of bikes, e-bikes, etc, but we preferred walking",
          "We loved our time in Villa Borghese. Very family friendly park, pretty, big, and with lots of attractions. To see the zoo (Bioparco) is a must!",
          "Villa bourghese is the Gardens surrounding the many sites in Rome. It shouldn\u2019t be confused with Museum Borghese which is the main site within the park. If you don\u2019t want to walk around the park there are options to hire bikes rickshaw type bikes for groups, golf buggies,",
          "Due to showing a lot of trashy contemporary art no photos are allowed in the Museum. So no beautiful Bernini images can be taken. Guards very aggressive and threatening. We should crowd fund to get rid of the contemporary rubbish and leave all the wonderful original pieces to be",

          "Lovely big park to stroll around under the trees. We hired a battery assisted bike for an hour. Great fun! There are plenty of interesting statues of literary, musical & historic figures dotted about. The small boating lake on the NW end contains some quite large terrapins that",
          "The Villa Borghese is a must see. The Villa and art work is amazing. I could have spent hours there, but they have a time limit on your visit so that more people can pass through it. The grounds around the Villa are very interesting, beautiful and serene. Don't miss it when in",
          "Overall there is nothing special here. The views were nice, but that was about it. Not worth the energy of the steep and slippery step climb.",
          "Just image that you are a cardinal in renaissance Italy, free to amass every treasure of antiquity and of the modern, renaissance artist and then build a modest little vila in a nice park to show them all of. Worthwhile to bring an art historian to show you around, even if you",

          "When visiting Rome, a park might not be an attraction that usually comes to mind, but this one is for sure worth the visit. My favourite part is without a doubt the lake with all the turtles. It\u2019s definitely a nice pause from all the city attractions.",
          "We stumbled upon the park while exploring and spent awhile wandering around. Go up the stairs from the plaza for an amazing view- just beware of the scammers putting roses in your hands and asking for money. It is a nice and relaxing park with trails, artwork, a pond with ducks",
          "We didn't get to see much of the park, as we headed up to one of the terrace's above Piazza del Popolo to watch the sunset. It was one of the best views we saw in all of Italy. Unfortunately once the sun went down, the bugs came out and we didn't want to stick around the park.",
          "The best part for us was the small lake where you can row a boat around. Perfect for couples, friends and family. The park is very relaxing, but would've been nice to see a few more attractions.",

          "This is a must-see in Rome. Truly breath-taking! Be sure to book ahead if possible as a limited number of people are only allowed in at a time to the villa. If you have not managed to book, it is often worth queuing for a cancellation or for s ticket that becomes available if",
          "A big park with a good cultural offer both indoors (galleries) and outdoors (bicycles and other cycling vehicles ro rent), Villa Borghese is a great place to spend a morning or an afternoon enjoying some pure air in rome without having to go outside the city center.",

          "After time spent elbowing the other tourists to get up to the front of the Trevi Fountain and waiting on lines at all of the top attractions, it is just lovely to walk around these gardens. We were there on a Wednesday in September. I suspect that on weekends, and even weekdays",
          "This lovely mansion is full to the brim with Bernini sculptures, Caravaggio paintings, and other pricelss, entrancing art. It's hard to imagine what else was here before many things went to the Louvre! I took a guided tour with an Italian-speaking guide (English sells out",

          "Rome is a very busy and crowded place to visit so a break in the Villa Borghese is most welcome on a hot August day. It is a very large park, but there are lots of signposts around so it is not difficult to make one's way around. If you like Zoos there is one in the park, and",

          "It was big. Some nice fountains near the museum but the rest of it was just big with dead grass and the odd sculpture or fountain. If we weren't so hot and tired we might have rented one of those cool tandem bikes. We were already there for the museum so why am I trashing the",

          "I didn't expect to like this museum and grounds but I have to admit it was really very good and unique. Partly because of the sculptures, but a lot had to do with the outstanding guide we had, Federico. He knew his stuff and his enthusiasm \u2026",

          "The Villa Borghese is home to most precious sculptures by Bernini; Hades and Persephone, Apollo and Daphne, also valublue paintings by Raphael and Caravaggio. The park where the villa is located is also very refreshing. \nTo visit the gallery make reservation in advance.",
          "Nice place to stroll around. There are very few if any benches that are not rotten or broken, at least in area we visited, which made getting a rest in the heat of summer hard particularly with a small kid in tow. It's a good garden, but \u2026",

          "Beautiful place for 2-3 hours outing. Also good for jogging.",
          "Great free park in the middle of Rome with sporadic coffee shops and peaceful views/sights (including awesome panoramic views). Great place to get away from the city and into some nature. We saw a number of people renting \"group bikes\" and there was an option to rent go karts as well.",

          "VERY nice, almost no tourists. Nice atmosphere, very romantic. For 3\u20ac/pp you can take a trip on a boat here and row around asclepios' beautiful temple. I'd say this was one of the best things we've did in Rome, And I very much recommend this place.",
          "Villa Borghese is a beautiful garden located in the north of Rome that includes museums, buildings and other interesting attractions. The place is nice to take a walk and rent some bikes. \n\nIt is also good for reading a book in the shadow \u2026",

          "Very nice and clean.  It's worthwhile not to miss history at its best",
          "Lots of places to explore within the park. We particularly enjoyed the carts that you could cycle around on. The one we had seated four adults- all of the seats you were able to cycle from. A great way to get around the park.",

Also you can see (and hear) parrots on the palm trees. Too bad we didn't have time to walk through the whole park. But hopefully we'll visit this place again.",
          "Awesome gardens to walk around so many statues and sculptures to admire. It is the central park of Italy.",

          "Interesting building with beautiful decorated rooms and wonderful paintings and sculptures",
          "It's simple a must see location in Rome. Beautiful villa with great collection of paintings and sculptures from most famous artists from Renaissance. Been there 2 times and if i go to Rome again I'll visit it again for sure. Highly recomend \u2026",

          "Great art, fantastic gallery. Bit expensive at 22 euros unless you're under 25 and an EU citizen, then it's 11 euro. They take you in in two hour blocks, and I recommend prebooking online. All bags need to be left at a check-in and the \u2026",

          "A true diamond!\nGet your tickets online before you arrive. \nDon't miss the park outside.",

          "I went to Rome for the marble sculpture and to see as many Carravaggio paintings as possible.\nVilla Borghese did not disappoint. An amazing exhibition of Renaissance art. I was awestruck.\nDo book in advance to avoid disappointment and plan for a picnic in the gardens afterwards",

          "Really great venue. I loved it.",
          "If you enjoy and appreciate art this stop is a must in Rome.  The sculptures by Bernini are definitely worth the trip all by themselves.  While it is out of the way it is an easy taxi from wherever you are staying.  The park surrounding is lovely and there are many water stops.",
          "Great experience for our 2year old. Felt the 20 minutes u get on the boat was a bit restrictive and very strictly enforced by a man on a megaphone. Could get a bit cramped as well as the lake isn't that big. But overall good experience",
          "best park in rome ever with beatyfull views,good people,zoo,cycle renting,boating, best place to hangup",
          "This park has the potential to be world class. The trees, paths, statues, etc are wonderful. \n\nWhere the park fails is grounds maintenance. An immense lack of grass. It is a dustbowl. Where there is grass, it's covered in dead shrubs/leaves. You'll need a blanket to lay on",

          "Amazing experience and walking tour of the Borghese Gallery and park with storytelling Rome tours",
          "A green landmark in Rome, if you have the time  is worth visiting it. In summer the grass tends to be pretty yellow but still the trees offers a lovely shade and from there you get a unique view of Rome from the top. There are some \u2026",
          "Nice air, beautiful atmosphere.",
          "Beautiful area if you want to have a relaxed and more quiet day in the middle of Rome.

          "This park is highly recommended in my opinion if you visit Rome! It's huge, there are lots of beatiful trees and also shops. You can also rent bikes. If you are lucky enough you can bump into street musicians who can turn your visit into a fairy tale!",

          "Great park with lots of trees and spots to sit quietly.",
          "Good distraction from museums with the family visiting here and hiring a rickshaw. Downsides were the cost (20 euro an hour) and hassle in getting here and shabby appearance of some of the gardens. Upside - kids thought it was the best bit about Rome so would do it again for sure",
          "My absolute favorite place to escape to when I am in Rome is Villa Borghese. And not only for its timeless beauty, considered the hood of sultry weather that envelops the city over the summer. Whether it's to sit in the shade of its \u2026",

          "Is for me a very big emotion when I come back here and I have the chance to visit around. Even when the weather is so hot you can get fresh water through the fountains you'll find around, and then you can enjoy the great gardens and the \u2026",

          "Fantastic museum, definitely worth a visit, especially if you know what pieces you especially want to see.  They use allocated time slots in order to maintain numbers to a reasonable level.  One we tip I'd say is, our slot was on the hour, \u2026",
          "Great art, good history lesson about family and property. In terms of reviewing art a 1000 times better than the Vatican.",

          "Nice park. It\u2019s quite big but it can get quite crowded. They have a nice lake, but it\u2019s just too small.",

It is one of the seven famous hills in Rome.  The most popular place in Rome.  You can see the scenery at different times.  Worth a place to go",
          "A nice bit if nature after your time waking the streets",
          "Didn't get tickets in advance so I couldn't get in the villa. Do book it at least a few weeks prior your visit. The park around it is huge and really nice. It's not that close to the Spanish Steps but within walking distance.",
          "Amazing park you should visit!",
          "Get reservations by email them.  Then get the Roma pass and go. Be aware that they are quite strict on the size of the backpack or purse.  Bernini statues are good.  Take tram or bus to this location for easy walking.",

          "Great place to hang out and walk around. It's shaded I did see a few couples mid day just straight making out and didnt stop when people walked by. There was a group of artists around drawing different places. Overall a very nice area.",
          "Classic Roman park with excited dwellings",
          "Tawdry, weedy and not well maintained.\nWhich is a pity, as the park is a nice shaded expanse with plenty of interesting monuments. With some investment and upkeep this park could be a real draw for the city.",
          "Nice place, but being in Roma as a guest, it's just miserable to spend time in the park, looking like many others in the world;)",
          "Breathtaking view of Rome.. and it\u2019s not as crowded as all the other places in the city..",

          "Rent a bike and enjoy it!! Renting a boat is higly recommended. Prices were good for both!!!",
          "Apollo and Daphne by Berninni is incomparable. If this was the sole work the price of admission would be worth it,  but there is so much more. Two hours isn't enough.",
          "Best place to see the sunset and city view.",
          "It's hard to rate a park, but I would say it's a five star! \n\nYou can spend here the whole day: walking,  cycling, sunbathing,  reading a book or enjoying the views! There's so much and this place is so vast I would be surprised to hear \u2026",
          "Beautiful art work worth seeing.",
          "It's remarkable if you can get a reservation online. No tickets at the door. Look for a great collection of Caravaggio's paintings,  but the stars are Bernini' David and Daphne and Apollo.  They are two of his greatest sculptures. The Dying \u2026",
          "Gem of a place but don't buy water or uce cream from the vendors. Only place in Rome we felt ripped off. Lovely cafe bar in the grounds,go there",
          "Quaint park is a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of Rome. It was relaxing to rent a bicycle cart and ride it around on a sunny day. Thoroughly enjoyed our time here and great to mix it up between museums, ruin exploring and Vatican visits while in Rome!",
          "What a grand Homestead, located in a lovely green wedge of Rome. Magnificent gardens and monuments around including Museum of modern art which probably is more ornate.",
          "Has many highlights in the park. You can easily spend 1 or 2 hours roaming. Don't forget to do Galleria Borghese but make sure you have reservations (they no longer accept Roma Pass).",
          "Beautiful park. Big, but quiet. Not too crowded. Plenty of things to do there.",
          "It's a very beautiful park. If you want to visit a quit place in the center of Rome it is the perfect place to go. You can relax in the sun or visit the beautiful museum! Furthermore you have thru the whole park memorials and other this. You can eat here and enjoy nature inside the city.",
          "Great place to have a picnic and spend an afternoon, or go for a run. Lots of statues and great views around.",
          "Really nice place, quiet only on some places. On other places are Street artists... sadly. Many people ride a bike for four people.",
          "Beautiful park, I think it's the 3rd biggest in Rome or Italy. You'll get lost, it's that big. There are multiple ponds within. Its a fun place to rest or hangout. One of the entries is close from the Spanish steps. Toilet facilities are limited though.",
          "It's a simple area just to be able to sit outside surrounded by concrete",
          "We had a wonderful day at the park. Organized small picnic to rest and lay down in the park while waitimg for the sunset which magnificent from the park",
          "It was a very nice park in the middle of Rome to get away from the hustle  and bustle traffic. Unfortunately the heat and dry made it less inviting, no fault of the park.",

          "Had a really good time, rented a Segway for a hour",
          "Spacious grounds with many fountains, statues, lakes, a zoo, and the masterpieces in the Borghese Gallery. Not crowded, a nice place to pause from the crowds in the usual piazzas, duomos, and historic sites. Lots of shade to escape the mid summer heat.",
          "Fine collection of works in a pleasant setting. The crowd was thin, so you are not rushed. The audio guide is worth the money, so get it.",

          "Relaxing place to enjoy clean air, greens, soothing live harp and guitar music",
          "Nice park that could use some attention. The paths are falling apart and the amenities are pretty poor. So much potential but being ignored but the city.",

          "This Villa was arguably the best use of tourist money I've spent in Rome so far. I visited the Villa on a Tuesday and they were predicably out of tickets for hours up until Thursday night slot, so I purchased tickets on the spot for the \u2026",
          "A most amazing villa and galleria. The visits are timed for 2 hour, but you will find that is plenty of time to see everything. The number of persons allowed in at any one time is 360, so it rarely feels crowded. The most amazing thing is \u2026",
          "The gardens of the Villa Borghese up the hill from Piazza del Popolo are something that every tourist should make the effort to venture through.\nThe gardens are a nice place to go bike riding or just walking through.",

          "So pretty..",
          "This is the best experience in Rome or even in entire Italy. Don't miss this awesome place with one of the best gallery in the world, an interesting zoo, cinema and a very beautiful and pleasant park.",
          "A good place to relax and enjoy",
          "Very disappointing\nNot well kept or maintained\nJust an open space with nothing of interest\nOne of the worst I have ever visited\nUnable to get into cafe...\nLots of mosquitoes ..\nWould not recommend",

          "Beautiful scenery, nice for a cocktail or snack.",
          "Villa Borghese is a great park for a relaxing day in the shade. Accompanied nicely by a walk amongst the plentiful statues and fountains. If you find the right spot, the park has a very cosy atmosphere. However the cicadas are usually quite noicy.",

          "Really cool art  And even better sculptures",
          "Lovely park sadly crossed by some very busy roads so keep an eye on the kids if you're out rollerblading or cycling. However, there's plenty to do here as the park holds both an art gallery and a zoo as well as a temporary summer theatre \u2026",

          "nothing interesting ... two stars for a nice vantage point.",
          "Such a great place to spend an entire day in! Just enjoying the beautiful nature, drinking wine, wondering around and just being happy.

          "There are two things named Villa Borghese in Rome which you need to keep in mind 1) The Villa Borghese Museum with the priceless works of art and used to be the actual home of Italy's fabled Borghese family 2) The Villa Borghese park which was once the estate attached to the Villa Borghese home.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Colosseum or Coliseum ( KOL-\u0259-SEE-\u0259m), also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [a\u0271fite\u02c8a\u02d0tro \u02c8fla\u02d0vjo] or Colosseo [kolos\u02c8s\u025b\u02d0o]), is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete, it was the largest amphitheatre ever built at the time and held 50,000 to 80,000 spectators. The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81\u201396). These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius).\nThe Colosseum could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points of its history over the centuries, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles (for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities), animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.Although substantially ruined because of earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit \"Way of the Cross\" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum. In 2018, it was the most popular tourist attraction in the world, with 7.4 million visitors.The Colosseum is also depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe Colosseum's original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium, often anglicized as Flavian Amphitheatre. The building was constructed by emperors of the Flavian dynasty, following the reign of Nero. This name is still used in modern English, but generally the structure is better known as the Colosseum. In antiquity, Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum (with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title Caesar), but this name may have been strictly poetic as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also constructed an amphitheater of the same name in Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli).The name Colosseum is believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero that once stood nearby. This statue was later remodeled by Nero's successors into the likeness of Helios (Sol) or Apollo, the sun god, by adding the appropriate solar crown. It was then commonly referred to as the \"Colossus solis\". Nero's head was also replaced several times with the heads of succeeding emperors. Despite its pagan links, the statue remained standing well into the medieval era and was credited with magical powers. It came to be seen as an iconic symbol of the permanence of Rome.\nIn the 8th century, an epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted: Quamdiu stat Colis\u00e6us, stat et Roma; quando cadet colis\u00e6us, cadet et Roma; quando cadet Roma, cadet et mundus (\"as long as the Colossus stands, so shall Rome; when the Colossus falls, Rome shall fall; when Rome falls, so falls the world\"). This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus (as in, for instance, Byron's poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage). However, at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote, the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre.\nThe Colossus did eventually fall, possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze. By the year 1000 the name \"Colosseum\" had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre from the nearby \"Colossus Solis\". The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives, situated between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma.The name further evolved to Coliseum during the Middle Ages. In Italy, the amphitheatre is still known as il Colosseo, and other Romance languages have come to use similar forms such as Coloseumul (Romanian), le Colis\u00e9e (French), el Coliseo (Spanish) and o Coliseu (Portuguese).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction, inauguration, and Roman renovations ===\n\nThe site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran as well as an artificial lake/marsh. By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea.  Although the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were located on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre, in effect, placing it both symbolically and precisely at the heart of Rome.\nConstruction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the Great Jewish Revolt in 70 CE led to the Siege of Jerusalem. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, \"the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty.\" It is often assumed that Jewish prisoners of war were brought back to Rome and contributed to the massive workforce needed for the construction of the amphitheatre, but there is no ancient evidence for that; it would, nonetheless, be commensurate with Roman practice to add humiliation to the defeated population. Along with this free source of unskilled labor, teams of professional Roman builders, engineers, artists, painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum. The Colosseum was constructed with several different materials: wood, limestone, tuff, tiles, cement, and mortar.\nConstruction of the Colosseum began under the rule of Vespasian in around 70\u201372 AD (73\u201375 AD according to some sources). The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian's death in 79. The top level was finished by his son, Titus, in 80, and the inaugural games were held in 80 or 81 AD. Dio Cassius recounts that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the inaugural games of the amphitheatre. Commemorative coinage was issued celebrating the inauguration. The building was remodelled further under Vespasian's younger son, the newly designated Emperor Domitian, who constructed the hypogeum, a series of tunnels used to house animals and slaves. He also added a gallery to the top of the Colosseum to increase its seating capacity.In 217, the Colosseum was badly damaged by a major fire (caused by lightning, according to Dio Cassius) which destroyed the wooden upper levels of the amphitheatre's interior. It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320. Gladiatorial fights are last mentioned around 435. An inscription records the restoration of various parts of the Colosseum under Theodosius II and Valentinian III (reigned 425\u2013455), possibly to repair damage caused by a major earthquake in 443; more work followed in 484 and 508. The arena continued to be used for contests well into the 6th century. Animal hunts continued until at least 523, when Anicius Maximus celebrated his consulship with some venationes, criticised by King Theodoric the Great for their high cost.\n\n\n=== Medieval ===\n\nThe Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use. By the late 6th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, though this apparently did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole. The arena was converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century. Around 1200 the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and fortified it, apparently using it as a castle.\nSevere damage was inflicted on the Colosseum by the great earthquake in 1349, causing the outer south side, lying on a less stable alluvial terrain, to collapse. Much of the tumbled stone was reused to build palaces, churches, hospitals and other buildings elsewhere in Rome. A religious order moved into the northern third of the Colosseum in the mid-14th century and continued to inhabit it until as late as the early 19th century. The interior of the amphitheater was extensively stripped of stone, which was reused elsewhere, or (in the case of the marble fa\u00e7ade) was burned to make quicklime. The bronze clamps which held the stonework together were pried or hacked out of the walls, leaving numerous pockmarks which still scar the building today.\n\n\n=== Modern ===\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th century, Church officials sought a productive role for the Colosseum. Pope Sixtus V (1585\u20131590) planned to turn the building into a wool factory to provide employment for Rome's prostitutes, though this proposal fell through with his premature death. In 1671 Cardinal Altieri authorized its use for bullfights; a public outcry caused the idea to be hastily abandoned.\n\nIn 1749, Pope Benedict XIV endorsed the view that the Colosseum was a sacred site where early Christians had been martyred. He forbade the use of the Colosseum as a quarry and consecrated the building to the Passion of Christ and installed Stations of the Cross, declaring it sanctified by the blood of the Christian martyrs who perished there (see Significance in Christianity). However, there is no historical evidence to support Benedict's claim, nor is there even any evidence that anyone before the 16th century suggested this might be the case; the Catholic Encyclopedia concludes that there are no historical grounds for the supposition, other than the reasonably plausible conjecture that some of the many martyrs may well have been.\n\nLater popes initiated various stabilization and restoration projects, removing the extensive vegetation which had overgrown the structure and threatened to damage it further. The fa\u00e7ade was reinforced with triangular brick wedges in 1807 and 1827, and the interior was repaired in 1831, 1846 and in the 1930s. The arena substructure was partly excavated in 1810\u20131814 and 1874 and was fully exposed under Benito Mussolini in the 1930s.The Colosseum is today one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions, receiving millions of visitors annually. The effects of pollution and general deterioration over time prompted a major restoration programme carried out between 1993 and 2000, at a cost of 40 billion Italian lire ($19.3m / \u20ac20.6m at 2000 prices).\nIn recent years, the Colosseum has become a symbol of the international campaign against capital punishment, which was abolished in Italy in 1948. Several anti\u2013death penalty demonstrations took place in front of the Colosseum in 2000. Since that time, as a gesture against the death penalty, the local authorities of Rome change the color of the Colosseum's night time illumination from white to gold whenever a person condemned to the death penalty anywhere in the world gets their sentence commuted or is released, or if a jurisdiction abolishes the death penalty. Most recently, the Colosseum was illuminated in gold in November 2012 following the abolishment of capital punishment in the American state of Connecticut in April 2012.Because of the ruined state of the interior, it is impractical to use the Colosseum to host large events; only a few hundred spectators can be accommodated in temporary seating. However, much larger concerts have been held just outside, using the Colosseum as a backdrop. Performers who have played at the Colosseum in recent years have included Ray Charles (May 2002), Paul McCartney (May 2003), Elton John (September 2005), and Billy Joel (July 2006).\n\n\n== Physical description ==\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\n\nUnlike earlier Greek theatres that were built into hillsides, the Colosseum is an entirely free-standing structure. It derives its basic exterior and interior architecture from that of two Roman theatres back to back. It is elliptical in plan and is 189 meters (615 ft / 640 Roman feet) long, and 156 meters (510 ft / 528 Roman feet) wide, with a base area of 24,000 square metres (6 acres). The height of the outer wall is 48 meters (157 ft / 165 Roman feet). The perimeter originally measured 545 meters (1,788 ft / 1,835 Roman feet). The central arena is an oval 87 m (287 ft) long and 55 m (180 ft) wide, surrounded by a wall 5 m (15 ft) high, above which rose tiers of seating.\nThe outer wall is estimated to have required over 100,000 cubic metres (3,531,467 cubic feet) of travertine stone which were set without mortar; they were held together by 300 tons of iron clamps. However, it has suffered extensive damage over the centuries, with large segments having collapsed following earthquakes. The north side of the perimeter wall is still standing; the distinctive triangular brick wedges at each end are modern additions, having been constructed in the early 19th century to shore up the wall. The remainder of the present-day exterior of the Colosseum is in fact the original interior wall.\n\nThe surviving part of the outer wall's monumental fa\u00e7ade comprises three stories of superimposed arcades surmounted by a podium on which stands a tall attic, both of which are pierced by windows interspersed at regular intervals. The arcades are framed by half-columns of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, while the attic is decorated with Corinthian pilasters. Each of the arches in the second- and third-floor arcades framed statues, probably honoring divinities and other figures from Classical mythology.\nTwo hundred and forty mast corbels were positioned around the top of the attic. They originally supported a retractable awning, known as the velarium, that kept the sun and rain off spectators. This consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the center. It covered two-thirds of the arena, and sloped down towards the center to catch the wind and provide a breeze for the audience. Sailors, specially enlisted from the Roman naval headquarters at Misenum and housed in the nearby Castra Misenatium, were used to work the velarium.\n\nThe Colosseum's huge crowd capacity made it essential that the venue could be filled or evacuated quickly. Its architects adopted solutions very similar to those used in modern stadiums to deal with the same problem. The amphitheatre was ringed by eighty entrances at ground level, 76 of which were used by ordinary spectators. Each entrance and exit was numbered, as was each staircase. The northern main entrance was reserved for the Roman Emperor and his aides, whilst the other three axial entrances were most likely used by the elite. All four axial entrances were richly decorated with painted stucco reliefs, of which fragments survive. Many of the original outer entrances have disappeared with the collapse of the perimeter wall, but entrances XXIII (23) to LIIII (54) survive.Spectators were given tickets in the form of numbered pottery shards, which directed them to the appropriate section and row. They accessed their seats via vomitoria (singular vomitorium), passageways that opened into a tier of seats from below or behind. These quickly dispersed people into their seats and, upon conclusion of the event or in an emergency evacuation, could permit their exit within only a few minutes. The name vomitoria derived from the Latin word for a rapid discharge, from which English derives the word vomit.\n\n\n=== Interior seating ===\n\nAccording to the Codex-Calendar of 354, the Colosseum could accommodate 87,000 people, although modern estimates put the figure at around 50,000. They were seated in a tiered arrangement that reflected the rigidly stratified nature of Roman society. Special boxes were provided at the north and south ends respectively for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins, providing the best views of the arena. Flanking them at the same level was a broad platform or podium for the senatorial class, who were allowed to bring their own chairs. The names of some 5th century senators can still be seen carved into the stonework, presumably reserving areas for their use.\n\nThe tier above the senators, known as the maenianum primum, was occupied by the non-senatorial noble class or knights (equites). The next level up, the maenianum secundum, was originally reserved for ordinary Roman citizens (plebeians) and was divided into two sections. The lower part (the immum) was for wealthy citizens, while the upper part (the summum) was for poor citizens. Specific sectors were provided for other social groups: for instance, boys with their tutors, soldiers on leave, foreign dignitaries, scribes, heralds, priests and so on. Stone (and later marble) seating was provided for the citizens and nobles, who presumably would have brought their own cushions with them. Inscriptions identified the areas reserved for specific groups.\nAnother level, the maenianum secundum in legneis, was added at the very top of the building during the reign of Domitian. This comprised a gallery for the common poor, slaves and women. It would have been either standing room only, or would have had very steep wooden benches. Some groups were banned altogether from the Colosseum, notably gravediggers, actors and former gladiators.Each tier was divided into sections (maeniana) by curved passages and low walls (praecinctiones or baltei), and were subdivided into cunei, or wedges, by the steps and aisles from the vomitoria. Each row (gradus) of seats was numbered, permitting each individual seat to be exactly designated by its gradus, cuneus, and number.\n\n\n=== Arena and hypogeum ===\n\nThe arena itself was 83 meters by 48 meters (272 ft by 157 ft / 280 by 163 Roman feet). It comprised a wooden floor covered by sand (the Latin word for sand is harena or arena), covering an elaborate underground structure called the hypogeum (literally meaning \"underground\"). The hypogeum was not part of the original construction but was ordered to be built by Emperor Domitian. Little now remains of the original arena floor, but the hypogeum is still clearly visible. It consisted of a two-level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began. Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces concealed underneath; larger hinged platforms, called hegmata, provided access for elephants and the like. It was restructured on numerous occasions; at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen.\n\nThe hypogeum was connected by tunnels to a number of points outside the Colosseum. Animals and performers were brought through the tunnel from nearby stables, with the gladiators' barracks at the Ludus Magnus to the east also being connected by tunnels. Separate tunnels were provided for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins to permit them to enter and exit the Colosseum without needing to pass through the crowds.Substantial quantities of machinery also existed in the hypogeum. Elevators and pulleys raised and lowered scenery and props, as well as lifting caged animals to the surface for release. There is evidence for the existence of major hydraulic mechanisms and according to ancient accounts, it was possible to flood the arena rapidly, presumably via a connection to a nearby aqueduct. However, the construction of the hypogeum at Domitian's behest put an end to the practise of flooding, and thus also to naval battles, early in the Colosseum's existence.\n\n\n=== Supporting buildings ===\n\nThe Colosseum and its activities supported a substantial industry in the area. In addition to the amphitheatre itself, many other buildings nearby were linked to the games. Immediately to the east is the remains of the Ludus Magnus, a training school for gladiators. This was connected to the Colosseum by an underground passage, to allow easy access for the gladiators. The Ludus Magnus had its own miniature training arena, which was itself a popular attraction for Roman spectators. Other training schools were in the same area, including the Ludus Matutinus (Morning School), where fighters of animals were trained, plus the Dacian and Gallic Schools.\nAlso nearby were the Armamentarium, comprising an armory to store weapons; the Summum Choragium, where machinery was stored; the Sanitarium, which had facilities to treat wounded gladiators; and the Spoliarium, where bodies of dead gladiators were stripped of their armor and disposed of.\nAround the perimeter of the Colosseum, at a distance of 18 m (59 ft) from the perimeter, was a series of tall stone posts, with five remaining on the eastern side. Various explanations have been advanced for their presence; they may have been a religious boundary, or an outer boundary for ticket checks, or an anchor for the velarium or awning.Right next to the Colosseum is also the Arch of Constantine.\n\n\n== Use ==\n\nThe Colosseum was used to host gladiatorial shows as well as a variety of other events. The shows, called munera, were always given by private individuals rather than the state. They had a strong religious element but were also demonstrations of power and family prestige, and were immensely popular with the population. Another popular type of show was the animal hunt, or venatio. This utilized a great variety of wild beasts, mainly imported from Africa and the Middle East, and included creatures such as rhinoceros, hippopotamuses, elephants, giraffes, aurochs, wisents, Barbary lions, panthers, leopards, bears, Caspian tigers, crocodiles and ostriches. Battles and hunts were often staged amid elaborate sets with movable trees and buildings. Such events were occasionally on a huge scale; Trajan is said to have celebrated his victories in Dacia in 107 with contests involving 11,000 animals and 10,000 gladiators over the course of 123 days. During lunch intervals, executions ad bestias would be staged. Those condemned to death would be sent into the arena, naked and unarmed, to face the beasts of death which would literally tear them to pieces.  Other performances would also take place by acrobats and magicians, typically during the intervals.\nDuring the early days of the Colosseum, ancient writers recorded that the building was used for naumachiae (more properly known as navalia proelia) or simulated sea battles. Accounts of the inaugural games held by Titus in AD 80 describe it being filled with water for a display of specially trained swimming horses and bulls. There is also an account of a re-enactment of a famous sea battle between the Corcyrean (Corfiot) Greeks and the Corinthians. This has been the subject of some debate among historians; although providing the water would not have been a problem, it is unclear how the arena could have been waterproofed, nor would there have been enough space in the arena for the warships to move around. It has been suggested that the reports either have the location wrong, or that the Colosseum originally featured a wide floodable channel down its central axis (which would later have been replaced by the hypogeum).Sylvae or recreations of natural scenes were also held in the arena. Painters, technicians and architects would construct a simulation of a forest with real trees and bushes planted in the arena's floor, and animals would then be introduced. Such scenes might be used simply to display a natural environment for the urban population, or could otherwise be used as the backdrop for hunts or dramas depicting episodes from mythology. They were also occasionally used for executions in which the hero of the story \u2013 played by a condemned person \u2013 was killed in one of various gruesome but mythologically authentic ways, such as being mauled by beasts or burned to death.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe Colosseum today is now a major tourist attraction in Rome with thousands of tourists each year entering to view the interior arena. There is now a museum dedicated to Eros located in the upper floor of the outer wall of the building. Part of the arena floor has been re-floored. Beneath the Colosseum, a network of subterranean passageways once used to transport wild animals and gladiators to the arena opened to the public in summer 2010.The Colosseum is also the site of Roman Catholic ceremonies in the 20th and 21st centuries. For instance, Pope Benedict XVI led the Stations of the Cross called the Scriptural Way of the Cross (which calls for more meditation) at the Colosseum on Good Fridays.\n\n\n==== Restoration ====\nIn 2011 Diego Della Valle, head of the shoe firm Tod's, entered into an agreement with local officials to sponsor a \u20ac25 million restoration of the Colosseum. Work was planned to begin at the end of 2011, taking up to two and a half years. Due to the controversial nature of using a public\u2013private partnership to fund the restoration, work was delayed and began in 2013. The restoration is the first full cleaning and repair in the Colosseum's history. The first stage is to clean and restore the Colosseum's arcaded fa\u00e7ade and replace the metal enclosures that block the ground-level arches. Taking three years, the final product of this work was unveiled 1 July 2016, when the Italian minister of culture, Dario Franceschini, also announced that the funds have been committed to replace the floors by the end of 2018. These will provide a stage that Franceschini says will be used for \"cultural events of the highest level.\" The project also plans to create a services center and to restore the galleries and underground spaces inside the Colosseum. New to tours of the restored marvel beginning 1 November 2017, the top two levels have been opened for guided visits. The fourth level held the marketplace, and the top fifth tier is where the poorest citizens, the plebeians, gathered and watched the show, bringing picnics for the day-long event.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Significance in Christianity ==\n\nThe Colosseum is generally regarded by Christians as a site of the martyrdom of large numbers of believers during the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, as evidenced by Church history and tradition. On the other hand, other scholars believe that the majority of martyrdoms may have occurred at other venues within the city of Rome, rather than at the Colosseum, citing a lack of still-intact physical evidence or historical records. These scholars assert that \"some Christians were executed as common criminals in the Colosseum\u2014their crime being refusal to reverence the Roman gods\", but most Christian martyrs of the early Church were executed for their faith at the Circus Maximus. According to Iren\u00e6us (died about 202), Ignatius of Antioch was fed to the lions in Rome around 107 A.D and although Irenaeus says nothing about this happening at the Colosseum, tradition ascribes it to that place.In the Middle Ages, the Colosseum was not regarded as a monument, and was used as what some modern sources label a \"quarry,\" which is to say that stones from the Colosseum were taken for the building of other sacred sites. This fact is used to support the idea that, at a time when sites associated with martyrs were highly venerated the Colosseum was not being treated as a sacred site. It was not included in the itineraries compiled for the use of pilgrims nor in works such as the 12th century Mirabilia Urbis Romae (\"Marvels of the City of Rome\"), which claims the Circus Flaminius \u2013 but not the Colosseum \u2013 as the site of martyrdoms. Part of the structure was inhabited by a Christian religious order, but it is not known whether this was for any particular religious reason.\nPope Pius V (1566\u20131572) is said to have recommended that pilgrims gather sand from the arena of the Colosseum to serve as a relic, on the grounds that it was impregnated with the blood of martyrs, although some of his contemporaries did not share his conviction. A century later Fioravante Martinelli listed the Colosseum at the head of a list of places sacred to the martyrs in his 1653 book Roma ex ethnica sacra. Martinelli's book evidently had an effect on public opinion; in response to Cardinal Altieri's proposal some years later to turn the Colosseum into a bullring, Carlo Tomassi published a pamphlet in protest against what he regarded as an act of desecration. The ensuing controversy persuaded Pope Clement X to close the Colosseum's external arcades and declare it a sanctuary.\n\nAt the insistence of St. Leonard of Port Maurice, Pope Benedict XIV (1740\u20131758) forbade the quarrying of the Colosseum and erected Stations of the Cross around the arena, which remained until February 1874. Benedict Joseph Labre spent the later years of his life within the walls of the Colosseum, living on alms, before he died in 1783. Several 19th century popes funded repair and restoration work on the Colosseum, and it still retains its Christian connection today. A Christian cross stands in the Colosseum, with a plaque, stating:\n\nThe amphitheater, one consecrated to triumphs, entertainments, and the impious worship of pagan gods, is now dedicated to the sufferings of the martyrs purified from impious superstitions.\nOther Christian crosses stand in several points around the arena and every Good Friday the Pope leads a Via Crucis procession to the amphitheater.\n\n\n== Flora ==\n\nThe Colosseum has a wide and well-documented history of flora ever since Domenico Panaroli made the first catalogue of its plants in 1643. Since then, 684 species have been identified there. The peak was in 1855 (420 species). Attempts were made in 1871 to eradicate the vegetation, because of concerns over the damage that was being caused to the masonry, but much of it has returned. 242 species have been counted today and of the species first identified by Panaroli, 200 remain.\nThe variation of plants can be explained by the change of climate in Rome through the centuries. Additionally, bird migration, flower blooming, and the growth of Rome that caused the Colosseum to become embedded within the modern city centre rather than on the outskirts of the ancient city, as well as deliberate transport of species, are also contributing causes. Another reason often given is their seeds being unwittingly transported either on the fur or in the feces of animals brought there from all corners of the empire.\n\n\n== Works modeled on, or inspired by, the Colosseum ==\nThe Kongresshalle, or \"Congress Hall\", (1935, unfinished) at the Nazi Party Rally grounds, Nuremberg, Germany\nThe Summer Olympic Games medal from 1928 to 2000, designed by Giuseppe Cassioli, features a depiction of the Colosseum.

It was designed by Moshe Safdie.\nThe Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum entrance was inspired by the Colosseum.\nThe Palazzo della Civilta Italiana was very closely modelled on the Colosseum. It was built for Mussolini for the Universal Exhibition of 1942 but the exhibition never happened due to the outbreak of World War II. The architects were Giovanni Guerrini, Ernesto Bruno La Padula, and Mario Romano.\nMcCaig's Tower, overlooking Oban, Scotland.\n\n\n== Popular culture references ==\nThe iconic status of the Colosseum has led it to be featured in numerous films, such as Roman Holiday, Demetrius and the Gladiators, 20 Million Miles to Earth, Way of the Dragon, Gladiator (in which it was re-created via CGI), Megiddo: The Omega Code 2, The Core, The Lizzie McGuire Movie,  Jumper, and the animated movie Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted.\nIt was also featured in the 1998 The Rise of Rome expansion for the video game Age of Empires, and in the 2010 video game Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.\nThe finale of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Vento Aureo, in both the anime and manga, takes place in the Colosseum.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman amphitheatre \u2013 Ancient Roman open-air venues\nList of Roman amphitheatres\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nVirtual tour of the Colosseum\nA 3D model of Colosseum on Sketchfab\n \"Colosseum\" .

Construction of the Colosseum was begun sometime between 70 and 72 ce during the reign of Vespasian. It is located just east of the Palatine Hill, on the grounds of what was Nero\u2019s Golden House. The artificial lake that was the centrepiece of that palace complex was drained, and the Colosseum was sited there, a decision that was as much symbolic as it was practical. Vespasian, whose path to the throne had relatively humble beginnings, chose to replace the tyrannical emperor\u2019s private lake with a public amphitheatre that could host tens of thousands of Romans.ColosseumColosseum, Rome.\u00a9 fabiomax/FotoliaColosseumInterior of the Colosseum in Rome.\u00a9 2007 Index Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More on This Topic\nRome: The Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine\nBetween the Caelian and the Esquiline, the end of the Forum valley is filled by the \nColosseum and the Arch of Constantine,\u2026\n\n\n\nThe structure was officially dedicated in 80 ce by Titus in a ceremony that included 100 days of games. Later, in 82 ce, Domitian completed the work by adding the uppermost story. Unlike earlier amphitheatres, which were nearly all dug into convenient hillsides for extra support, the Colosseum is a freestanding structure of stone and concrete, using a complex system of barrel vaults and groin vaults and measuring 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 metres) overall. Three of the arena\u2019s stories are encircled by arcades framed on the exterior by engaged columns in the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders; the structure\u2019s rising arrangement of columns became the basis of the Renaissance codification known as the assemblage of orders. The main structural framework and facade are travertine, the secondary walls are volcanic tufa, and the inner bowl and the arcade vaults are concrete.ColosseumAerial view of the Colosseum, Rome, completed 82 ce.Artephot/Pubbli Aer FotoThe amphitheatre seated some 50,000 spectators, who were shielded from the sun by a massive retractable velarium (awning). Supporting masts extended from corbels built into the Colosseum\u2019s top, or attic, story, and hundreds of Roman sailors were required to manipulate the rigging that extended and retracted the velarium. The Colosseum was the scene of thousands of hand-to-hand combats between gladiators, of contests between men and animals, and of many larger combats, including mock naval engagements. However, it is uncertain whether the arena was the site of the martyrdom of early Christians.ColosseumInterior of the Colosseum, Rome.\u00a9 Shawn McCullarsColosseumStudying the effects of local construction on the Colosseum, Rome.Contunico \u00a9 ZDF Enterprises GmbH, MainzSee all videos for this articleThe Colosseum was damaged by lightning and earthquakes in medieval times and, even more severely, by vandalism.

Such history here and the guided tour was phenomenal. Plus, just look at the fantastic pics you get of this place! When in Rome, you must visit the colosseum!",

Our booking strictly told us to arrive 30 minutes before hand but the unfriendly 7ft tall security guard wouldn't let us in unless after our time which was unhelpful so save yourself half an hour and aim to just arrive on the dot. Regardless. Must be seen.",

It's great value as you can go to the Roman Forum as well. \nIf not a student, it's \u20ac16, and I would say not worth it. Save your money and admire the view from the outside",

          "I believe that the key to really enjoy the visit is to go early in the morning. Be part of the first group to get it! I see people complaining about the crowd but at 8:30 it was really empty... I visited it in winter, first week of February.",
          "Fabulous, well worth a visit. Book in advance or you will stand in line forever. Take a camera, loads to photograph, and take loads of water. Great day out. Only disappointment was all the plastic bottles that were strewn all around outside, very unsightly.",

We stopped over at the key of Aventine when we were done which is only a short walk away, oh and Circus Maximus, which is also a very short walk away. Start early, plan your day and enjoy!",
          "Most impressive sight. Steeped in history. This is the kind of historical site you need to have a guide to bring you around.

          "My advice: take a small group guide like from viator,and go too adventure about ancient Rome. 3 hours fly bee, and it was super interesting. By going alone you can't imagine everything. Strange feelings come when you're walking the same road as operator's used to walk.",
          "Seen better days. Specifically the 80s when it was less popular. Still, getting in was well managed despite huge numbers of people. But let's talk about the ticketing... How about you just sell your own tickets so we don't have to spend HOURS working out who sells what and how to get them.",
          "You must get a guided tour to fully appreciate this place.  Recommend touring underground which is eye opening.  Better than expected and a must visit in Rome.",
          "It's lovely to see in the day or night. There is a pedestrian bridge near by over the traffic, which is a nice raised lookout. If you're planning to go inside, it's best to book a tour to understand the fact and the fiction from the movies \u2026",
          ";) Tip, buy your ticket online and avoid the huge lines.\nFor some reason a website for ticket purchase is not clearly informed.\nAnd of course the coliseum is Beautiful, gigantic, you can not miss visiting!\nA wonder located in the heart of Rome.",
          "Surreal, I would highly recommend you find a tour that takes you under the Colosseum, so you can see where the animals and gladiators were kept, and get the full story of everything. Amazing experience.",
          "Absolutely stunning place. The most magnificent edifice you could ever be in! Book your tickets online and skip the queues.",
          "You don't even need to buy a ticket to enjoy this place! I didn't because I didn't have time to go, and I come back not feeling regret for not going in. It is that amazing building. There is a park near by where you can have food to go and have a meal with a view",
          "It's nicer on the outside. The audio guide is too short. We liked the expositions inside.",
          "The Colosseum had this time of the year no long cue. The normal ticket give entrance to the middle part and a lower part. If you want to the highest level and arena you have to be part of a group or buy a extra ticket. \nIt was a nice \u2026",
          "Historical place ..worth a visit when in Rome!! Make sure you know what is the background of the place before you visit it..Read about the gladiator fights..to understand why was this place so important..most of the part is under renovation now.. the queues are very long here..be prepared for that",
          "Amazing place to see huge monument and perfect for pictures. Be aware lots of touts selling tickets and items. Make sure you use reputable dealers for tickets if you want to see inside.",
          "We went near the end of the day so it was really quiet. They have amazing artefacts that are really old and interesting to look at and you feel like you have an insight into their lives. The Colosseum is really interesting for all ages. An amazing time spend.",
          "Amazing to see in person. Hard to imagine the life of romans at the time, I wish there were more guides/visuals for this beyond the gladiators. Would recommend to see but not the top of my list.",
          "An impressive and monumental construction. Impressing by its size a d preservation. Buy the entrance tickets in advance and get ready to wait a lot to get in. Definitely a must see in Rome",
          "Plan this on first day of your visit. There will be long queue,  waiting time 2-3 hrs. If you have time stands in line else another option is to skip the line and go with guided tour. \nOne tickets covers both Colosseum and Roman forum. If \u2026",
          "To be completely honest, it's more pretty outside than inside. It's nice to see once, but that's it. Skipping it would be fine.",
          "Wear comfy shoes because you are going to walk a lot and there are tons of stairs. Very beautiful place, you must must hire a tour guide otherwise you will not understand the meaning of this place and the history. Try to go in the morning to avoid rain. We had so much fun.",
          "Nice place... You can visit..",
          "You don\u2019t need my review for this, but I\u2019m going to add it anyway. The Colosseum is an amazing building that has withstood the test of time. There are other areas nearby to check out as well, and everything is picturesque. On the southern side there are some great spots for full-view pictures.",
          "This place is pretty amazing. I\u2018m currently visiting pretty late to see it alone. I saw this group of people there, probably some drug addicts fighting over some stupid things. I ignored them and went ahead to view this beauty. I then saw",
          "Better book the ticket and audio guide on Klook or KKday or online before you visit there!!! This\u2019s important!! \n\nOr you\u2019ll have to queue for minimum 1 hour!",
          "If you go to Rome you absolutely must visit the Colosseum. Don't go on the night tour. I did, very disappointed \ud83d\ude41 I couldn't see anything. No lights. I did visit during the day and it is spectacular!!!",
          "It is a m\u00f9st see attraction when visiting Rome.Beware of the touts wearing Gladiator costumes this is a time to put your cameras away..Your wallet will be considerably lighter if you want to be transported back in time to Neros reign for a split second.",
          "It\u2019s hard to rate, it\u2019s the Colosseum, it\u2019s amazing. But I wish there was some sort of regulations as far as being basically harassed by the Africans trying to sell their goods, they are extremely aggressive and ask you give them anything \u2026",
          "If you buy ticket online you will be able to walk straight into colosseum after secruity line. You can also buy your ticket at the palatine hill or forum entrance (less queues) to bypass the line. Colosseum had seating for more than 50,000 \u2026",
          "This was originally called the Flavian Amphitheatre and was mostly used as public entertainment arena. The Colosseum is one of the most famous attractions in Rome and is where most gladiatorial fights took place. Today, actors in gladiator \u2026",
          "Simply amazing - trust the hype . Must see",
          "What an experience! Did an underground tour with access to battle ground and level 3 tier. Well worth it!",
          "One of the best historical place in Rome. We joined a group tour with an authorised guide and visit both Colosseum and Palatin hill. Even though a little bit more expensive than normal ticket, we only had to wait half an hour to enter and got to learn a lot about the history of Rome.",
          "EVERYONE download Rick Steves FREE audio guide for the Colosseum! So good and free of charge! Go to the app store, dont pay the prices the many people try to sell you outside! Also does the Forums, the Pantheon, and many more! Highly recommend! Beautiful structure, worth the visit, one off the bucket list!",
          "The Colosseum is another of Rome\u2019s major tourist attractions. Its construction was started by emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty in 72 AD and was finished by his son Titus in 80 AD. If you plan to visit Rome head there early in the \u2026",
          "Such a beautiful place in Rome. We chose to not stand in the line to go into the Colosseum. It was two and a half hours long. There is no shade. It was something we would of loved to have seen. This area of Rome was beautiful. Rome was very nice. It was extremely hot.",
          "It's amazing. Not 5 stars because the standard of the facilities (toilets specifically) leave a lot to be desired. 1 public toilet on the other side of the main entrance, and it's closed. Inside the toilets are a minor improvement from a portaloo.  For a place that receives so many tourists I would expect a lot more",
          "Cool to see the history but even during \u201clow\u201d season there are WAY too many people. It ruins the experience. Seeing it from the inside really isn\u2019t worth the wait. I\u2019d recommend walking the outside during the day and night. Good enough. \u2026",
          "Oh, the Colosseum... what a masterpiece. \n\nIf you appreciate old-world history, you will be amazed by this location. It\u2019s impossible not to be charmed by the beauty of it.\n\nAlthough you can visit this monument from the outside and that may \u2026",
          "brilliant place. definitely worth visiting .what a place. we done the vip tour with the underground and 3rd floor. just the atmosphere is unreal definitely go at least once you will not be disappointed",
          "The Colosseum could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points of its history over the centuries, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea \u2026",
          "You must hire a tour guide to truly appreciate its history, its significance, and the incredible understanding of engineering ancient Romans had building this place. As beautiful as the exterior is, seeing the underbelly of the building and \u2026",
          "If you are visiting Rome it's a must, you will feel the history \u2764",
          "This monumental landmark is a must-see if you are visiting Rome. The history surrounding this landmark is astonishing and the sheer size of it too surprised me when seeing it up close. Unfortunately, I cannot rate my experience as 5* due to \u2026",
          "We had a great person sowing us around but a lot of cats",
          "When you go to the Colosseum, you feel like you are travelling back in time. Impressive place. The architecture is amazing. I suggest you go there when the sunlight is warm. Next time, I will pay for a guided tour, because I felt frustrated \u2026",
          "Obviously the biggest landmark of Rome. Have you visited Rome if you haven't checked out the coliseum? The biggest tip I have is to actually book with the tour guides while exploring the ruins. My own experience was a tour to check out the \u2026",
          "The place is magnificent, but there is just too much construction works. Also don't buy the full experience ticket as its nothing better, and there is no underground as stated.\nAlso they have bad organization, we were getting in and we were \u2026",
          "Magnificent. Absolutely worth going to. Best advice is to spend the extra to get on a tour and miss the queues.  You learn so much from the guides and they are passionate about what they do. Your footsteps will take you back to ancient times with a little imagination thrown in.",
          "Amazing piece of history. Would love to spend more time there however I only had two days in Rome. Best time to go without many crowds is from 8am - 10am.",
          "I loved our trip! Such a beautiful place in Rome. We chose to not stand in the line to go into the Colosseum. It was two and a half hours long. There is no shade. It was something we would of loved to have seen. This area of Rome was \u2026",
          "Masterpiece from Roman times. Was amazed at very first view of it.\nIf planning to go inside, it is a lot of history. And would recommend to take guided tour. \nQueue is quite.long for tickets so online ticket purchase is recommended. Visited it during daylight and night time both.\nA must go when in Rome.",
          "A historical monument.  Better to get a guided tour with visit to lover and top most levels. Booked an online tour with a very nice italian guide speaking good English.",
          "Colosseum one of the historical places in Roma.\nIt's so impressive from outside construction and inside.\nI advise you to buy tickets online to save time and money.\nAlso, if you can find a tour guide but they're expensive.\nAlso, they close at 7PM but tickets at 5PM.",
          "Colosseum! Always a great place to visit when in Rome. I have been to this place exactly 15 years ago, and I have noticed the difference to the structure. The government is trying everything to preserve the structure, but they made some renovations on some walls that somehow it looks very new.",
          "This is truly a must-see! Though there are many places online to get tickets to skip the lines, we found there are many people outside the Colosseum (wearing badges) who said they \"work there\" and they offer information on where to enter \u2026",
          "A splendid site, and a surprisingly interesting exhibition on the second floor of the corridors. Despite the crowds, there is organization and one can easily enjoy his stay in the Colloseum. Definitely a must-see!",
          "It is magnificent! Was only able to walk around the outside because it was late but was still able to get a wonderful view. Security is prevalent and week prepare so it is very safe. It is well lit and way too walk too. A Must see",
          "It was raining heavily when I visited, but even the rain couldn't dampen my awe and the incredible feeling of seeing such a historical treasure and architectural gem in real life. It is so steeped in history, complexity and wonder, that you \u2026",
          "Iconic place to visit while in Rome, to be sure, but PLAN AHEAD. There are tons of high pressure tour guides (and tour salesmen) outside looking to help you cut the line. They\u2019ll highly exaggerate how long it will take you to get inside. \u2026",
          "Colossus in name, colossus in nature. Vespasian's stunning amphitheatre has survived over 1900 years and continues to dominate Rome. I visited here 14 years ago and am very impressed by the improvements made to the experience since, \u2026",
          "It took me long time to visit this historical place. Wanted to visit since childhood. The structure of this building is amazing. Italians are very good to keep their historical monuments keep and running. There are still many bullet holes \u2026",
          "I love Rome and Italy in general but can never get enough of this place! Full of stories and interesting facts and history, make sure to get yourself a perfect tour guide!",
          "We visited Colosseum on New Year's day so we expected to be busy. Using \"skip the line tickets\" was probably the wisest option and the guides knew lots of details plus the queue was enormous. Needless to say that the Colosseum is a must see \u2026",
          "The history for this location and grandeur it has experienced is one of those things that people attempt to capture but cannot be fully expressed. Both day and evening tours are available and have their independent merits.  \n\nA day tour \u2026",
          "A must-see for everyone, not just history lovers. Amazing site, but go BEFORE 10am, otherwise it gets too busy with tourists and tour groups. \nOne of the great historical sites in the world.\n\nClose to many other amazing historical sites, including Constantine\u2019s Arch.",
          "How can I even review this place? It's like a wonder of the world. There's nothing like it on earth.",
          "A must see. Dont be fooled by the guys outside telling you the queue for tickets is an hour and a half, it's not. No need to pay extra to jump the queue, just head to the ticket queue, we waited 30 min tops and it was \u20ac16each. You can buy \u2026",
          "One of most famous plaece in the world",
          "We got the guided visit in spanish and it was a superb option. The guide brought us back to Ancient Rome times.\nThe place is itself very impressive but I recommend the guided visit.",
          "Love this landmark, have visited a few times now and still in love with it. Be wary of sellers trying to sell you stuff, many are nice but some are forceful.",
          "A must watch historical place if you are in Rome, Italy. Had visited this place in Dec, 2019. \n\nIf you are interested to know historical landmarks, you should visit this place. Its an ancient Roman stadium where Gladiators use to fight among themselves and animals as a part of sports activity of ancient Roman culture.",
          "Lovely to experience. Would of been much improved if we had booked a guided tour or audio guide.",
          "A MUST VISIT site in Rome. \n\nGo early. Best before 9am. Less people less queue. Can buy straight away there. Euro16 per person. \n\nOnce out from collosue metro stop. U will see it. Super easy to locate and find. \n\nDefinitely a master piece. Visit it before is too late",
          "Definitely one of the highlights of my trip! You can not miss going to the Colosseum. I highly recommend you getting a private tour. I had a tour for 8 people and got lots of inside that I wouldn\u2019t otherwise.",
          "Go here and you can still feel the echoes of crowds cheering and the tremors of the blood soaked sand. So much has happened here and it\u2019s amazing how much The Colosseum was way ahead of its time and paved the way for so much to come after. #colosseum #rome #gladiator #eternalcity #history #echos",
          "Worth the wait and the entrance fee. Really impressive and great to walk around, annoying amount of harassment outside the venue of people trying to sell tickets or queue jumps or even water. Queue really wasn't that bad at all.",
          "I get the historical significance but to visit in person wasn't as great as it seems. Perhaps they could improve on their tours as the info and presentation is rather boring",
          "If you visit, take one of the guided tours that takes you into the arena floor. The Colosseum is not even the name given to the arena. Take a guided tour to discover the full history of this magnificent structure.",
          "Nothing really new to tell about. Amazing building. For me it was better to see at night. Could not get in, amazing anyway.",
          "One of the greatest and certainly most iconic landmarks of ancient Rome.The Colosseum is the largest amphitheatre ever built. Construction began in 72 AD and was completed in 80 AD .It is listed as one of seven Wonders of World.",
          "Colosseum was good however bathrooms could use improvement. Also directions on where to pickup paid tickets would be helpful (booths by forum entrance). During checkout it would be nice if it told you that you could just show \"printed\" tickets on phone rather than finding a printer or waiting in pickup line.",
          "Historical landmark, not much to visit, but worth the view. Strolling through the complex takes ~30 minutes with pictures and all. Should definitely book the guided tour to find out more about it. The top floor was closed for renovation in November 2019.",
          "Must visit place when in Rome.  Its really a masterpiece from the past. Decades of weather has taken its toll on the structure yet what remains is awe inspiring in itself. \nYou can book tickets online to get a fast access to the inside of \u2026",
          "Have to give it a 5 star simply because it is such an incredible monument and so well preserved. It is one of the most visited monuments in the world so expect long queues and crowds at peak times. Highly recommend buying a skip the queue \u2026",
          "It is apparent that Italy takes great pride in and took great pains to restore and maintain as much of ancient history as possible. The colloseum, palladium palace and forum are really interesting. If you don't want to do your own homework, make sure to take in a tour so that history is brought to life with \"context\"",
          "Do yourself a favor and go on the night tour so the place isn't absolutely packed.  Honestly, it's not all that exciting on the inside.  To a degree if you've seen one ruin, you've seen them all.  The exterior of the building is still very \u2026",
          "There are many history about it. I love this place.",
          "It's a must when visiting Rome. It's best to buy tickets beforehand. The most convenient ticket must be the arena access + Roman Forum",
          "I hate losing a star but in my opinion the amount of people grabbing and overpowering trying to sell you products is such a turn off. 4 people in a row selling umbrella when clearly I had an umbrella up. Its making such a beautiful feature of Rome unappealing. But it is beautiful place and alot bigger than I imagined. Stunning.",
          "Great experience to walk and see the Colosseum in person. I knew it was big, but goodness gracious, it was still a lot bigger than I imagined. It's pretty neat to see the restoration work ongoing. Be sure to use the restroom as soon as you \u2026",
          "An iconic symbol of Imperial Rome, the Flavian Amphitheatre better known as the Colosseum is one of the 7 Wonders of the World.  In visiting the Colosseum I wanted to explore it from the gladiators perspective and @thetourguy made it \u2026",
          "Great place to spend half a day we did the self guide video tour. I would suggest getting the guided your or video tour. There is a lot of information to absorb. Be careful of locals that approach you wile standing in the line to get tickets. I had problems twice with cons one almost escalated into a fight NO was not understood",
          "Ao there are few tips, I visited on Sunday and luckily that Sunday was free of cost entry to Colosseum. Do check there are also free local guides.. check that as well. Overall it is a good site to see and feel history.",
          "We had a night tour and got to stand on the arena floor, plus go underneath to see where the gladiators would come in. Such amazing history here and thankful for what was preserved. It was a fabulous experience! I highly recommend visiting this landmark when you are in Rome!",
          "Cool site. Love the architecture and history but the wait time was absolutely atrocious. I had to wait 4 hrs to get in. Come to find out, they only have 2 security scanners and one ticket booth that were missing some of their employees for a crowd of thousand visitors which makes no sense to me. \ud83d\ude12",
          "Beautiful historical place. Very grateful to witness and able to observe this historic site. Come early in the morning, it tends to get very crowded in the  evening. If you haven\u2019t bought the ticket, you have to buy the tickets first at the \u2026",
          "We did the Underground tour which includes walking through the entrance the Gladiators walked through, going on the arena floor and underneath where they brought the ships in for navel battles.  If you are a history buff this is the tour for you. We went with TheRomanGuy company and really liked it.",
          "Impressive building but much of the information signs read the same information. Beware of being approached by 100's of \"official\" guides making expensive promises of better experience and quicker access.",
          "No words. So amazing. Keep in mind that even in winter, its still very crowded but still worth it. Be sure to go there early or later in the day to avoid huge crowds. Overall we were amazed by this structure. Just a tourist trap which is the thing..its hard to get in quick or even take a picture.",
          "Amazing piece of history, crazy to think how long ago it was built and that it's still standing. Take a tour if you want to know more history about it. Or watch Gladiator or Spartacus as well. Always wanted to see it and was not disappointed! Go during the off-season, November if when we went, it'll be less touristy",
          "Beautiful!! Definitely worth the vist whist in Rome! We went later in the day and there was no queue to get tickets. Plus if your a European student you get a very good discount!!!",
          "What a place to visit!! We added a guided tour with a very knowledgeable guide speaking through headphones. Her knowledge added to a visual splendour of ancient Rome. Plus get fast track as the queues looked long. The guide showed an \u2026",
          "Breathtaking architecture and the sad history behind this building should be a must to teach at schools around the world. Now, from a different  point of view, the construction still standing is incredible, the sub tunnels, 4 floors under \u2026",
          "Pre booked a tour with an outside company. Couldn\u2019t get one directly from the Coop even if I was prepared and tried. They all sold out within seconds of being put online which is truly a shame.\nEnjoyed the lower level and private views from the 3rd level. The guide was quite knowledgeable and made the visit interesting.",
          "Never been to Rome before. Was very much in awe of the building and its history. Will return one day to do guided tour. Fantastic",
          "Free to walk around outside any time of day/night. Plenty of photo opportunities. Arch of Constantine monument nearby celebrates his conversion to Christianity, and the Roman Forum is also nearby.",
          "Colosseum and Underground Night Tour.........We booked a private tour for the Colosseum.  Our guide was Anton, a colorful fellow chock full of useful and interesting information.  I particularly enjoyed his George Carlin-ish recitation of \u2026",

          "Great view on top, overlooking Vatican City & Rome! Just need an hour or two to cover the whole place. Worth the time to check out a splendid view on top!",
          "Amazing history and something everyone should see, I'd recommend the guided tour as you will get to hear about the history of the Colosseum, go early in the morning to avoid the queues.",
          "Perhaps I was too na\u00efve, but I truly wasn\u2019t expecting the Colosseum to be SO BUSY. Also, make sure to definitely buy tickets beforehand, if you wanna go inside (which you should because there isn\u2019t really anything to do from the outside). \u2026",
          "Need ticket to get inside the colosseum (obviously), but to get inside there were two the super long line: first to buy the ticket, second to enter the colosseum. If you got the whole day maybe it's worth it. Otherwise seeing from outside \u2026",
          "Timeless and haunting. You can feel inspiration and fear as you imagine the life and death battles that filled this arena.",
          "A trip through the time, magnificent architecture, undoubtedly one of the most interesting monuments in the world has a museum inside and many guides telling the whole story, if you want to visit the sub-soil you need to pay another ticket but I highly recommend it worth visiting!",
          "Amazing tourist spot. For first timers, lower your expectations. Lots of damage from earthquakes and being a resource for marble during low points of Roman history. You have to imagine what it looked like. Worth paying a little extra for the guide. Only about 40 minutes to an hour but does a good job of explaining.",
          "Great piece of history. Actually history was written at this place. An integral Piller in Roman history. This place has seen a lot of changes.\n\nYou will definitely like it if you watched Gladiators movie. A lot to see near by also.\nRoman \u2026",
          "Absolutely beautiful. Walking along what Romans walked across over 2000 years ago is so crazy.  Recommend doing the tours too",
          "The place needs no recommendation or review.\nLots of history to this place. Visit with time in your hand if you want to actually enjoy the place.\nStanding in the middle of arena agai is a different feeling.",
          "This place is always crowded.. but be ready to be in the queue for about at least 30mins during the summers to get to the ticket counter.\n\nSuggest you to buy the combo ticket for 3 places. Also covered in Roma pass I guess... this place is \u2026",
          "Very impressive. No need to pay excessive amounts to the people hanging around outside. You can join the normal queue which doesn't take that long.",
          "Beautiful historical place. Although, I wish it was less surrounded by vendors trying to sell you something constantly. Naturally,pickpocketing is something you need to look out for. Nevertheless, its a must see on your Roman holiday!",
          "A must see experience.  Highly recommend the private skip the line tours.  Breath taking historic experience.  Worth every euro.",
          "As the lines to get into the Colosseum were way too long for the amount of time we still had available to spend in Rome, there wasn't a chance for us to go inside. I would recommend buying your tickets online and head in early if you want \u2026",
          "Has to be seen as pictures do not do it justice. My only gripe would be that the signage was a little lacking and could be improved easily to make moving around easier.\nAs with other famous landmarks in Rome there seemed to be a lot of hawkers selling, or trying to sell rubbish. Without this the day would be a lot more enjoyable.",
          "Beautiful place, we did a tour with City wonder's and were glad that we got to skip the line to get in. Recommend going in the morning, it's cooler and less crowded. Our tour guide was Francesca and she was fun, energetic and informative. \u2026",

          "A life long dream came to fruition, when I visited Colosseum. The statute of this architectural marvel is imperial and massive. No picture I have ever seen before could prepare me for it. The sheer pleasure of being inside this 2000+ year \u2026",
          "The tour itself was great, as we're the surround structures, but they really need to get rid off all the con artists out front. You'ed think the guards armed with automatic weapons would be enough to Chase them off but nope!",
          "It is magnificent! Able to walk around the entire interior. Amazing views. \nHighly suggest taking a tour as I did.\nYou'll get a better understand of the structure and history.",
          "Really Beautiful Place. Full of fun and beautiful people.",
          "The tour of the Roman Colosseum is beyond incredible. You can see, smell, and feel the ancient history. It is well worth the international trip to experience something like this. It's a once in a lifetime experience. Do yourself a favor and \u2026",

          "How can you go to Rome without going to the Colosseum...spectacular! You can just feel the spirits of the past swirling around you! We went to the evening tour and it was everything and more. We stood on the Colosseum floor, saw underneath and the elevator that brought the animals up to battle.",
          "Amazing building. Advise buying tickets on line before going as ticket queues very long.",
          "Such an amazing place to visit! We did a tour with city wonders & it was superb! Such an experience that I\u2019ll never forget! Our tour guide was so educated on everything we saw. I want to definitely go back some day!",
          "Led by an archaeologist or historian, this coveted tour provides an in-depth look into the Colosseum and uses the ruins of the ancient city as a backdrop for discussing the rise of the Roman empire, the political intrigues of emperors, and \u2026",
          "Absolutely amazing place to come and visit..lots of choices you can pay for guided tours..bit of advice would be make sure you buy your tickets before hand and get a time slot to get you in..cause queing is bad when busy.. police and army \u2026",
          "Simply amazing. Highly recommend a tour guide as part of this tour. Just too much information to try and digest in your own.",

          "None for f the members of the Italian tour I signed up can speak Italian, including me, the tour lady tried her best to share with us the history of this great place.\nThe top floor was only reopened last year, so lucky we can go up there.",
          "So much history. Our guide was fantastic. I think that is the key, if you are interested in the sight and not just being there. Pay a little more and get a more private guide. It is worth it. If being able to say I was there is enough, then go the most economical way.",
          "What an experience, breathtaking to walk amongst such a historic structure! I recommend having a guide, they know the history and you're not walking around blind, guessing what things are or what they meant to the people who lived so long ago...our guide was extremely knowledgeable and funny. The Colosseum is a must do when in Rome!",
          "Smaller than I thought but still impressive. This is now a skeleton of what it was, and hard to imagine its glory. We went in December and the crowds were small, quick to get in.  Avoid in summer!",

          "The timing of my visit was perfect. A clear daylight, twilight and night shots. I missed the chance to enter.\n\nIf you wish to fully enjoy the place, spend few hours inside.",
          "Restrooms are a disaster. With certainly thousands of visitors per day -many of them waiting long time in the line and paying 16\u20ac per person - it should be possible to offer more than a small dirty cabin as a restroom.",
          "Lines were really long. They had so called 'skip the lines' tickets that you pay more and supposedly skip the lines. But you still had to wait for long time for all other members in the group. Outside view was magnificent. But inside was underwhelming because it was under construction.",

          "We just loved the Colosseum in Rome!  Our hotel was only 2 blocks from the Colosseum, so we were able to walk past it, many times. It\u2019s really something to see while in Rome!  Day or night, it\u2019s beautiful!  We booked our tour through Viator, which was excellent!!!!!",
          "Well everybody knows that this is a must-see in Rome. If you want to visit all the levels including the underground where they kept gladiators you'll need to book a ticket in advance, like 2 or 3 months earlier. Otherwise, you can just get \u2026",

          "It's difficult to describe the outburst of emotions seeing this miraculous place... But I'm definite that it is a must! One should visit the Sistine chapel at least once in a life time!",

          "Any amount of time spent at this place seems less. Awestruck by the amazing architecture",
          "Paid for the tour, and well worth the money! The archaeologists answered all questions and well worth the money",
          "Get your tickets ahead of time otherwise, you'll likely wait in line for at least 45 minutes. Lots of frauds outside claiming they work at the Colosseum, make sure to purchase your tickets legitimately. Once inside, its unbelievable learning about what happened inside and the general history of the Colosseum.",
          "ABSOLUTELY stunning.  I would highly suggest going with a good guide who can provide the necessary historical insight and details into this marvel.  Doing so well make the place come alive!",

          "2/21/20; One of the most amazing places in the world.  It was the site of so much torture, sacrifices, killings, & etc, but that was many years ago.  The site is ancient & awe inspiring.",
          "Bloody Roman history of the gladiators and Emperors. I visited with a tour guide and it was awesome. It is wonderful to see that the architecture has stood for quite so long. And it would probably have longer if not for all the looting that happened over the centuries (to make swords and all). \nOverall, very satisfied to have been there",
          "Excellent venue. Get there early, otherwise long wait for entry. Your entry fee gains access to Colosseum, Foro Romano and Palatine Hill. Book your tickets and collect from ticket office will cut down entry as there is a different queue to use.",

          "No fights were going on when I went and visited. Still pretty cool though, stands looked kinda empty :/",
          "This place is a must. It is everything that you read about in the books. They have elevators to take you up and down. Some of the views out over the city are some of the best IMO.",
          "I recommend to make an online reservation (you receive skip'the-line), the waiting time is very high. Lots of people inside too. It was a disappointment I could say. I was only on the upper floors and there is nothing special, just some \u2026",
          "Definitely a landmark to see when in Rome, we went to palatine hill first to get our tickets, very affordable!",
          "Worth visiting, even if you only have a day or two in Rome. I'd go here, the Pantheon, TheTrevi Fountain, and St. Peter's Basilica. Then you're good, and you can move on to better cities in Italy :)",
          "Did the audio tour which was good and very detailed bringing the place to life. Bit cold and wet on the top level this time of year. Best thing was it was free today which we only found out at the official reception !! (Free that is apart \u2026",

          "Quite an amazing experience. I went on a very hot Rome day, but fortunately there is water fountains inside to fill up your water bottles. Definitely a must see if you happen to visit Rome.",
          "As you'd expect it is very busy. Save time and skip the queue and invest in a full guided tour which takes to from the very bowels of the building up to the  highest point the public can reach, far higher than the regular admission allows! Be prepared to spend several hours to do the place justice.",
          "Beautiful piece of History. Do try and do a guided tour which will give you a good understanding behind the place as well as make you appreciate it more. \nIf possible, also try and get the night view from outside as it's beautiful with the lights. You can get good pics from the bridge above",
          "Spectacular architecture. Cant imagine how it was here before. Am I the only one who wants a time machine and go back in time? I haven't been inside though.",
          "I expected a little different atmosphere. Maybe more ancient, than it is. Perhaps too much Gladiator-like movies :)",

          "It\u2019s a must visit place in Rome, near to the main Metro station and accessible with feet but don\u2019t recommend it while it\u2019s very hot. The tickets are so overrated and you can\u2019t have so much time there if you don\u2019t go in the morning. It\u2019s so \u2026",
          "First of all would recommend to go there without  a tour guide with them you always feel pressed by time, they pushing to finish the tour sooner, I would recommend to buy tickets online and in time ,you  can find really good offers on price \u2026",

          "What more can be said about a 2000 year old architectural spectacle? Try to visit when it\u2019s at its least busy so you can more easily soak in the history without running the selfie stick gauntlet. Guided tour is a must...you will be able to \u2026",

          "Beautiful scenery, many paths for a nice walk, and many opportunities to take pictures. Although one must pay to view the inside, it is free, and just as good, to roam around the outside.",
          "High on the bucket list to visit while in \u201cRoma\u201d.\nBuy a pass from a vendor and do your own tour. Much quicker entry, avoid waiting and lines, wander freely.\nSo spectacular!",

          "Spectacular. This monument speaks for itself. A must see if you haven't been before. Recommend to buy the tickets at an entrance to the Forum Romanum, because of the significantly shorter queues. The ticket is 17 euro plus extra 5 euro for the guide. Tour lasts 45 min. Highly recommended.",
          "Crown Tours did an excellent job of leading our group tour of both the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. They are reasonably priced and the tour guides are friendly and knowledgable. I would use their services again.",
          "Stayed in Rome 4 days and everyday this place was very crowdy (should wait 1.5 hours to pay the ticket). Paid for guide and skip the line. Totally worth it.",
          "Obviously it is what they say it is. Great historic place full of culture and beauty.",
          "The coliseum is incredible. It is important to have a good guide. Have been there a few times. Highly recommend.",
          "Impressive building but much of the information signs read the same information. Beware of being approached by 100's of \"official\" guides making expensive promises of better experience and quicker access.",
          "On of the most interesting place of Roma city. Its It's always full with visitors it doesn't matter which time of year. I love this place !",
          "To read about the history of the Collesium is one thing but when you are able to actually go there and see and feel what is what like to be a Gladiator or a spectator watching the Gladiators battle in the arena it's like going back in history. This is truly a treasure that needs to be preserved for all of man and woman kind.",

          "Wowowoow. It's a wonderful place to visit. It was built in 1st century and first ever built the largest open amphitheatre of the era. Built in 70 A.D., Rome's Colosseum has been the site of celebrations, sporting events and bloodshed. The ticket price is 16 euro for Non Eu Citizen and every penny is worth to spend.",
          "Nice to see for history. But a bit overpriced and disappointed as it was ruined with scaffolding etc",
          "Of course its amazing, so much history and its beyond huge! They were strict about the no food and drinks inside but there are smoking pits everywhere , which doesn't make sense.  Should be no smoking inside the Colosseum itself. Also \u2026",

          "A strange mix of breath taking architecture & historical horror!\nYou can't not go as it's a genuine man made marvel, but the history of the place is very gory. \nHowever it does feel like being transported back in time, even with all the \u2026",
          "Stunning Colosseum. Amazing history. Can be a little tricky to find where to buy tickets with all the \u2018local\u2019 sellers distracting you. Queues were pretty reasonable for us in January. \nGave 4 instead of 5 stars because of a bad experience \u2026",

          "Definitely worth it! It is really hard to imagine that those arches are almost 2000 years old. Also, I would highly recommend a night tour if it is available as well as visiting the underground level as it has not been changed so much from the ancient time as it has been anearthed relatively recently.",

          "So this can take you to love it or hate it. It\u2019s your decision. For me, it was a \u201cwow\u201d moment when I finally saw it. It\u2019s been years of hearing and reading of it that when I finally saw it, I really enjoy it. Be aware to buy your tickets in advance so that you can enjoy your day the way you want to.",

        "wiki": "The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican (Italian: Basilica Papale di San Pietro in Vaticano), or simply Saint Peter's Basilica (Latin: Basilica Sancti Petri), is a church built in the Renaissance style located in Vatican City, the papal enclave which is within the city of Rome.\nDesigned principally by Donato Bramante, Michelangelo, Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter's is the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world. While it is neither the mother church of the Catholic Church nor the cathedral of the Diocese of Rome (these equivalent titles being held by the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome), St. Peter's is regarded as one of the holiest Catholic shrines. It has been described as \"holding a unique position in the Christian world\" and as \"the greatest of all churches of Christendom\".Catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial site of Saint Peter, chief among Jesus's apostles and also the first Bishop of Rome (Pope). Saint Peter's tomb is supposedly directly below the high altar of the basilica. For this reason, many popes have been interred at St. Peter's since the Early Christian period. A church has stood on this site since the time of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Old St. Peter's Basilica dates from the 4th century AD. Construction of the present basilica began on 18 April 1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626.St. Peter's is famous as a place of pilgrimage and for its liturgical functions. The pope presides at a number of liturgies throughout the year both within the basilica or the adjoining St. Peter's Square; these liturgies draw audiences numbering from 15,000 to over 80,000 people. St. Peter's has many historical associations, with the Early Christian Church, the Papacy, the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-reformation and numerous artists, especially Michelangelo. As a work of architecture, it is regarded as the greatest building of its age. St. Peter's is one of the four churches in the world that hold the rank of major basilica, all four of which are in Rome. Contrary to popular misconception, it is not a cathedral because it is not the seat of a bishop; the cathedra of the pope as Bishop of Rome is at Saint John Lateran.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nSt. Peter's is a church built in the Renaissance style located in the Vatican City west of the River Tiber and near the Janiculum Hill and Hadrian's Mausoleum. Its central dome dominates the skyline of Rome. The basilica is approached via St. Peter's Square, a forecourt in two sections, both surrounded by tall colonnades. The first space is oval and the second trapezoidal. The fa\u00e7ade of the basilica, with a giant order of columns, stretches across the end of the square and is approached by steps on which stand two 5.55 metres (18.2 ft) statues of the 1st-century apostles to Rome, Saints Peter and Paul.The basilica is cruciform in shape, with an elongated nave in the Latin cross form but the early designs were for a centrally planned structure and this is still in evidence in the architecture. The central space is dominated both externally and internally by one of the largest domes in the world. The entrance is through a narthex, or entrance hall, which stretches across the building. One of the decorated bronze doors leading from the narthex is the Holy Door, only opened during jubilees.The interior dimensions are vast when compared to other churches. One author wrote: \"Only gradually does it dawn upon us \u2013 as we watch people draw near to this or that monument, strangely they appear to shrink; they are, of course, dwarfed by the scale of everything in the building. This in its turn overwhelms us.\"The nave which leads to the central dome is in three bays, with piers supporting a barrel-vault, the highest of any church. The nave is framed by wide aisles which have a number of chapels off them. There are also chapels surrounding the dome. Moving around the basilica in a clockwise direction they are: The Baptistery, the Chapel of the Presentation of the Virgin, the larger Choir Chapel, the altar of the Transfiguration, the Clementine Chapel with the altar of Saint Gregory, the Sacristy Entrance, the Altar of the Lie, the left transept with altars to the Crucifixion of Saint Peter, Saint Joseph and Saint Thomas, the altar of the Sacred Heart, the Chapel of the Madonna of Column, the altar of Saint Peter and the Paralytic, the apse with the Chair of Saint Peter, the altar of Saint Peter raising Tabitha, the altar of St. Petronilla, the altar of the Archangel Michael, the altar of the Navicella, the right transept with altars of Saint Erasmus, Saints Processo and Martiniano, and Saint Wenceslas, the altar of St. Jerome, the altar of Saint Basil, the Gregorian Chapel with the altar of the Madonna of Succour, the larger Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, the Chapel of Saint Sebastian and the Chapel of the Piet\u00e0. The Monuments, in a clockwise direction, are to: Maria Clementina Sobieski, The Stuarts, Benedict XV, John XXIII, St. Pius X, Innocent VIII, Leo XI, Innocent XI, Pius VII, Pius VIII, Alexander VII, Alexander VIII, Paul III, Urban VIII, Clement X, Clement XIII, Benedict XIV, St Peter (Bronze Statue), Gregory XVI, Gregory XIV, Gregory XIII, Matilda of Canossa, Innocent XII, Pius XII, Pius XI, Christina of Sweden, Leo XII.  \nAt the heart of the basilica, beneath the high altar, is the Confessio or Chapel of the Confession, in reference to the confession of faith by St. Peter, which led to his martyrdom. Two curving marble staircases lead to this underground chapel at the level of the Constantinian church and immediately above the purported burial place of Saint Peter.\nThe entire interior of St. Peter's is lavishly decorated with marble, reliefs, architectural sculpture and gilding. The basilica contains a large number of tombs of popes and other notable people, many of which are considered outstanding artworks. There are also a number of sculptures in niches and chapels, including Michelangelo's Piet\u00e0. The central feature is a baldachin, or canopy over the Papal Altar, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The apse culminates in a sculptural ensemble, also by Bernini, and containing the symbolic Chair of Saint Peter.\nOne observer wrote: \"St Peter's Basilica is the reason why Rome is still the center of the civilized world. For religious, historical, and architectural reasons it by itself justifies a journey to Rome, and its interior offers a palimpsest of artistic styles at their best ...\"The American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson described St. Peter's as \"an ornament of the earth ... the sublime of the beautiful.\"\n\n\n== Status ==\n\nSt. Peter's Basilica is one of the papal basilicas (previously styled \"patriarchal basilicas\") and one of the four Major Basilicas of Rome, the other Major Basilicas (all of which are also Papal Basilicas) being the Basilicas of St. John Lateran, St. Mary Major, and St. Paul outside the Walls. The rank of major basilica confers on St. Peter's Basilica precedence before all minor basilicas worldwide. However, unlike all the other Papal Major Basilicas, it is wholly within the territory, and thus the sovereign jurisdiction, of the Vatican City State, and not that of Italy. This is in contrast to the other three Papal Major Basilicas, which are within Italian territory and not the territory of the Vatican City State. (Lateran Treaty of 1929, Article 15 (Ibidem)) However, the Holy See fully owns these three basilicas, and Italy is legally obligated to recognize its full ownership thereof (Lateran Treaty of 1929, Article 13 (Ibidem)) and to concede to all of them \"the immunity granted by International Law to the headquarters of the diplomatic agents of foreign States\" (Lateran Treaty of 1929, Article 15 (Ibidem)).\nIt is the most prominent building in the Vatican City. Its dome is a dominant feature of the skyline of Rome. Probably the largest church in Christendom, it covers an area of 2.3 hectares (5.7 acres). One of the holiest sites of Christianity and Catholic Tradition, it is traditionally the burial site of its titular, St. Peter, who was the head of the twelve Apostles of Jesus and, according to tradition, the first Bishop of Antioch and later the first Bishop of Rome, rendering him the first Pope. Although the New Testament does not mention St. Peter's martyrdom in Rome, tradition, based on the writings of the Fathers of the Church, holds that his tomb is below the baldachin and altar of the Basilica in the \"Confession\". For this reason, many Popes have, from the early years of the Church, been buried near Pope St. Peter in the necropolis beneath the Basilica. Construction of the current basilica, over the old Constantinian basilica, began on 18 April 1506 and finished in 1615. At length, on 18 November 1626 Pope Urban VIII solemnly dedicated the Basilica.St. Peter's Basilica is neither the Pope's official seat nor first in rank among the Major Basilicas of Rome. This honour is held by the Pope's cathedral, the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran which is the mother church of all churches in communion with the Catholic Church. However, St. Peter's is certainly the Pope's principal church in terms of use because most Papal liturgies and ceremonies take place there due to its size, proximity to the Papal residence, and location within the Vatican City proper. The \"Chair of Saint Peter\", or cathedra, an ancient chair sometimes presumed to have been used by St. Peter himself, but which was a gift from Charles the Bald and used by many popes, symbolizes the continuing line of apostolic succession from St. Peter to the reigning Pope. It occupies an elevated position in the apse of the Basilica, supported symbolically by the Doctors of the Church and enlightened symbolically by the Holy Spirit.As one of the constituent structures of the historically and architecturally significant Vatican City, St. Peter's Basilica was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984 under criteria (i), (ii), (iv), and (vi). With an exterior area of 21,095 square metres (227,060 sq ft), an interior area of 15,160 square metres (163,200 sq ft), St. Peter's Basilica is the largest Christian church building in the world by the two latter metrics and the second largest by the first as of 2016. The top of its dome, at 448.1 feet (136.6 m), also places it as the second tallest building in Rome as of 2016. The dome's soaring height placed it among the tallest buildings of the Old World, and it continues to hold the title of tallest dome in the world. Though the largest dome in the world by diameter at the time of its completion, it no longer holds this distinction.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Saint Peter's burial site ===\n\nAfter the crucifixion of Jesus, it is recorded in the Biblical book of the Acts of the Apostles that one of his twelve disciples, Simon known as Saint Peter, a fisherman from Galilee, took a leadership position among Jesus' followers and was of great importance in the founding of the Christian Church. The name Peter is \"Petrus\" in Latin and \"Petros\" in Greek, deriving from \"petra\" which means \"stone\" or \"rock\" in Greek, and is the literal translation of the Aramaic \"Kepa\", the name given to Simon by Jesus. (John 1:42, and see Matthew 16:18)\nCatholic tradition holds that Peter, after a ministry of thirty-four years, travelled to Rome and met his martyrdom there along with Paul on 13 October 64 AD during the reign of the Roman Emperor Nero. His execution was one of the many martyrdoms of Christians following the Great Fire of Rome. According to Origen, Peter was crucified head downwards, by his own request because he considered himself unworthy to die in the same manner as Jesus. The crucifixion took place near an ancient Egyptian obelisk in the Circus of Nero.  The obelisk now stands in St. Peter's Square and is revered as a \"witness\" to Peter's death. It is one of several ancient Obelisks of Rome.According to tradition, Peter's remains were buried just outside the Circus, on the Mons Vaticanus across the Via Cornelia from the Circus, less than 150 metres (490 ft) from his place of death. The Via Cornelia was a road which ran east-to-west along the north wall of the Circus on land now covered by the southern portions of the Basilica and St. Peter's Square. A shrine was built on this site some years later. Almost three hundred years later, Old St. Peter's Basilica was constructed over this site.The area now covered by the Vatican City had been a cemetery for some years before the Circus of Nero was built. It was a burial ground for the numerous executions in the Circus and contained many Christian burials, because for many years after the burial of Saint Peter many Christians chose to be buried near Peter.\nIn 1939, in the reign of Pope Pius XII, 10 years of archeological research began under the crypt of the basilica in an area inaccessible since the 9th century. The excavations revealed the remains of shrines of different periods at different levels, from Clement VIII (1594)  to Callixtus II (1123) and Gregory I (590\u2013604), built over an aedicula containing fragments of bones that were folded in a tissue with gold decorations, tinted with the precious murex purple. Although it could not be determined with certainty that the bones were those of Peter, the rare vestments suggested a burial of great importance. On 23 December 1950, in his pre-Christmas radio broadcast to the world, Pope Pius XII announced the discovery of Saint Peter's tomb.\n\n\n=== Old St. Peter's Basilica ===\n\nOld St. Peter's Basilica was the 4th-century church begun by the Emperor Constantine the Great between 319 and 333 AD. It was of typical basilical form, a wide nave and two aisles on each side and an apsidal end, with the addition of a transept or bema, giving the building the shape of a tau cross. It was over 103.6 metres (340 ft) long, and the entrance was preceded by a large colonnaded atrium. This church had been built over the small shrine believed to mark the burial place of St. Peter, though the tomb was \"smashed\" in 846 AD.  It contained a very large number of burials and memorials, including those of most of the popes from St. Peter to the 15th century. Like all of the earliest churches in Rome, both this church and its successor had the entrance to the east and the apse at the west end of the building. Since the construction of the current basilica, the name Old St. Peter's Basilica has been used for its predecessor to distinguish the two buildings.\n\n\n=== Plan to rebuild ===\nBy the end of the 15th century, having been neglected during the period of the Avignon Papacy, the old basilica had fallen into disrepair. It appears that the first pope to consider rebuilding, or at least making radical changes was Pope Nicholas V (1447\u201355). He commissioned work on the old building from Leone Battista Alberti and Bernardo Rossellino and also had Rossellino design a plan for an entirely new basilica, or an extreme modification of the old. His reign was frustrated by political problems and when he died, little had been achieved.  He had, however, ordered the demolition of the Colosseum and by the time of his death, 2,522 cartloads of stone had been transported for use in the new building. The foundations were completed for a new transept and choir to form a domed Latin cross with the preserved nave and side aisles of the old basilica. Some walls for the choir had also been built.Pope Julius II planned far more for St Peter's than Nicholas V's program of repair or modification. Julius was at that time planning his own tomb, which was to be designed and adorned with sculpture by Michelangelo and placed within St Peter's.  In 1505 Julius made a decision to demolish the ancient basilica and replace it with a monumental structure to house his enormous tomb and \"aggrandize himself in the popular imagination\".  A competition was held, and a number of the designs have survived at the Uffizi Gallery. A succession of popes and architects followed in the next 120 years, their combined efforts resulting in the present building. The scheme begun by Julius II continued through the reigns of Leo X (1513\u20131521), Hadrian VI (1522\u20131523). Clement VII (1523\u20131534), Paul III (1534\u20131549), Julius III (1550\u20131555), Marcellus II (1555), Paul IV (1555\u20131559), Pius IV (1559\u20131565), Pius V (saint) (1565\u20131572), Gregory XIII (1572\u20131585), Sixtus V (1585\u20131590), Urban VII (1590), Gregory XIV (1590\u20131591), Innocent IX (1591), Clement VIII (1592\u20131605), Leo XI (1605), Paul V (1605\u20131621), Gregory XV (1621\u20131623), Urban VIII (1623\u20131644) and Innocent X (1644\u20131655).\n\n\n=== Financing with indulgences ===\nOne method employed to finance the building of St. Peter's Basilica was the granting of indulgences in return for contributions. A major promoter of this method of fund-raising was Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg, who had to clear debts owed to the Roman Curia by contributing to the rebuilding program. To facilitate this, he appointed the German Dominican preacher Johann Tetzel, whose salesmanship provoked a scandal.A German Augustinian priest, Martin Luther, wrote to Archbishop Albrecht arguing against this \"selling of indulgences\". He also included his \"Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences\", which came to be known as The 95 Theses. This became a factor in starting the Reformation, the birth of Protestantism.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Successive plans ===\n\nPope Julius' scheme for the grandest building in Christendom was the subject of a competition for which a number of entries remain intact in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. It was the design of Donato Bramante that was selected, and for which the foundation stone was laid in 1506. This plan was in the form of an enormous Greek Cross with a dome inspired by that of the huge circular Roman temple, the Pantheon. The main difference between Bramante's design and that of the Pantheon is that where the dome of the Pantheon is supported by a continuous wall, that of the new basilica was to be supported only on four large piers. This feature was maintained in the ultimate design. Bramante's dome was to be surmounted by a lantern with its own small dome but otherwise very similar in form to the Early Renaissance lantern of Florence Cathedral designed for Brunelleschi's dome by Michelozzo.Bramante had envisioned that the central dome would be surrounded by four lower domes at the diagonal axes. The equal chancel, nave and transept arms were each to be of two bays ending in an apse. At each corner of the building was to stand a tower, so that the overall plan was square, with the apses projecting at the cardinal points. Each apse had two large radial buttresses, which squared off its semi-circular shape.When Pope Julius died in 1513, Bramante was replaced with Giuliano da Sangallo and Fra Giocondo, who both died in 1515 (Bramante himself having died the previous year). Raphael was confirmed as architect of St. Peter's on 1 August 1514. The main change in his plan is the nave of five bays, with a row of complex apsidal chapels off the aisles on either side. Raphael's plan for the chancel and transepts made the squareness of the exterior walls more definite by reducing the size of the towers, and the semi-circular apses more clearly defined by encircling each with an ambulatory.In 1520 Raphael also died, aged 37, and his successor Baldassare Peruzzi maintained changes that Raphael had proposed to the internal arrangement of the three main apses, but otherwise reverted to the Greek Cross plan and other features of Bramante. This plan did not go ahead because of various difficulties of both Church and state. In 1527 Rome was sacked and plundered by Emperor Charles V. Peruzzi died in 1536 without his plan being realized.At this point Antonio da Sangallo the Younger submitted a plan which combines features of Peruzzi, Raphael and Bramante in its design and extends the building into a short nave with a wide fa\u00e7ade and portico of dynamic projection. His proposal for the dome was much more elaborate of both structure and decoration than that of Bramante and included ribs on the exterior. Like Bramante, Sangallo proposed that the dome be surmounted by a lantern which he redesigned to a larger and much more elaborate form. Sangallo's main practical contribution was to strengthen Bramante's piers which had begun to crack.On 1 January 1547 in the reign of Pope Paul III, Michelangelo, then in his seventies, succeeded Sangallo the Younger as \"Capomaestro\", the superintendent of the building program at St Peter's. He is to be regarded as the principal designer of a large part of the building as it stands today, and as bringing the construction to a point where it could be carried through. He did not take on the job with pleasure; it was forced upon him by Pope Paul, frustrated at the death of his chosen candidate, Giulio Romano and the refusal of Jacopo Sansovino to leave Venice. Michelangelo wrote \"I undertake this only for the love of God and in honour of the Apostle.\" He insisted that he should be given a free hand to achieve the ultimate aim by whatever means he saw fit.\n\n\n=== Michelangelo's contribution ===\nMichelangelo took over a building site at which four piers, enormous beyond any constructed since ancient Roman times, were rising behind the remaining nave of the old basilica. He also inherited the numerous schemes designed and redesigned by some of the greatest architectural and engineering minds of the 16th century. There were certain common elements in these schemes. They all called for a dome to equal that engineered by Brunelleschi a century earlier and which has since dominated the skyline of Renaissance Florence, and they all called for a strongly symmetrical plan of either Greek Cross form, like the iconic St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, or of a Latin Cross with the transepts of identical form to the chancel, as at Florence Cathedral.\nEven though the work had progressed only a little in 40 years, Michelangelo did not simply dismiss the ideas of the previous architects. He drew on them in developing a grand vision. Above all, Michelangelo recognized the essential quality of Bramante's original design. He reverted to the Greek Cross and, as Helen Gardner expresses it: \"Without destroying the centralising features of Bramante's plan, Michelangelo, with a few strokes of the pen converted its snowflake complexity into massive, cohesive unity.\"As it stands today, St. Peter's has been extended with a nave by Carlo Maderno. It is the chancel end (the ecclesiastical \"Eastern end\") with its huge centrally placed dome that is the work of Michelangelo. Because of its location within the Vatican State and because the projection of the nave screens the dome from sight when the building is approached from the square in front of it, the work of Michelangelo is best appreciated from a distance. What becomes apparent is that the architect has greatly reduced the clearly defined geometric forms of Bramante's plan of a square with square projections, and also of Raphael's plan of a square with semi-circular projections. Michelangelo has blurred the definition of the geometry by making the external masonry of massive proportions and filling in every corner with a small vestry or stairwell. The effect created is of a continuous wall-surface that is folded or fractured at different angles, but lacks the right-angles which usually define change of direction at the corners of a building. This exterior is surrounded by a giant order of Corinthian pilasters all set at slightly different angles to each other, in keeping with the ever-changing angles of the wall's surface. Above them the huge cornice ripples in a continuous band, giving the appearance of keeping the whole building in a state of compression.\n\n\n=== Dome: successive and final designs ===\n\nThe dome of St. Peter's rises to a total height of 136.57 metres (448.1 ft) from the floor of the basilica to the top of the external cross. It is the tallest dome in the world. Its internal diameter is 41.47 metres (136.1 ft), slightly smaller than two of the three other huge domes that preceded it, those of the Pantheon of Ancient Rome, 43.3 metres (142 ft), and Florence Cathedral of the Early Renaissance, 44 metres (144 ft). It has a greater diameter by approximately 30 feet (9.1 m) than Constantinople's Hagia Sophia church, completed in 537. It was to the domes of the Pantheon and Florence duomo that the architects of St. Peter's looked for solutions as to how to go about building what was conceived, from the outset, as the greatest dome of Christendom.\n\n\n==== Bramante and Sangallo, 1506 and 1513 ====\n\nThe dome of the Pantheon stands on a circular wall with no entrances or windows except a single door. The whole building is as high as it is wide. Its dome is constructed in a single shell of concrete, made light by the inclusion of a large amount of the volcanic stones tuff and pumice. The inner surface of the dome is deeply coffered which has the effect of creating both vertical and horizontal ribs, while lightening the overall load. At the summit is an ocular opening 8 metres (26 ft) across which provides light to the interior.Bramante's plan for the dome of St. Peter's (1506) follows that of the Pantheon very closely, and like that of the Pantheon, was designed to be constructed in Tufa Concrete for which he had rediscovered a formula. With the exception of the lantern that surmounts it, the profile is very similar, except that in this case the supporting wall becomes a drum raised high above ground level on four massive piers. The solid wall, as used at the Pantheon, is lightened at St. Peter's by Bramante piercing it with windows and encircling it with a peristyle.\nIn the case of Florence Cathedral, the desired visual appearance of the pointed dome existed for many years before Brunelleschi made its construction feasible. Its double-shell construction of bricks locked together in herringbone pattern (re-introduced from Byzantine architecture), and the gentle upward slope of its eight stone ribs made it possible for the construction to take place without the massive wooden formwork necessary to construct hemispherical arches. While its appearance, with the exception of the details of the lantern, is entirely Gothic, its engineering was highly innovative, and the product of a mind that had studied the huge vaults and remaining dome of Ancient Rome.Sangallo's plan (1513), of which a large wooden model still exists, looks to both these predecessors. He realized the value of both the coffering at the Pantheon and the outer stone ribs at Florence Cathedral. He strengthened and extended the peristyle of Bramante into a series of arched and ordered openings around the base, with a second such arcade set back in a tier above the first. In his hands, the rather delicate form of the lantern, based closely on that in Florence, became a massive structure, surrounded by a projecting base, a peristyle and surmounted by a spire of conic form. According to James Lees-Milne the design was \"too eclectic, too pernickety and too tasteless to have been a success\".\n\n\n==== Michelangelo and Giacomo della Porta, 1547 and 1585 ====\n\nMichelangelo redesigned the dome in 1547, taking into account all that had gone before. His dome, like that of Florence, is constructed of two shells of brick, the outer one having 16 stone ribs, twice the number at Florence but far fewer than in Sangallo's design. As with the designs of Bramante and Sangallo, the dome is raised from the piers on a drum. The encircling peristyle of Bramante and the arcade of Sangallo are reduced to 16 pairs of Corinthian columns, each of 15 metres (49 ft) high which stand proud of the building, connected by an arch. Visually they appear to buttress each of the ribs, but structurally they are probably quite redundant. The reason for this is that the dome is ovoid in shape, rising steeply as does the dome of Florence Cathedral, and therefore exerting less outward thrust than does a hemispherical dome, such as that of the Pantheon, which, although it is not buttressed, is countered by the downward thrust of heavy masonry which extends above the circling wall.The ovoid profile of the dome has been the subject of much speculation and scholarship over the past century. Michelangelo died in 1564, leaving the drum of the dome complete, and Bramante's piers much bulkier than originally designed, each 18 metres (59 ft) across. Following his death, the work continued under his assistant Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola with Giorgio Vasari appointed by Pope Pius V as a watchdog to make sure that Michelangelo's plans were carried out exactly. Despite Vignola's knowledge of Michelangelo's intentions, little happened in this period. In 1585 the energetic Pope Sixtus appointed Giacomo della Porta who was to be assisted by Domenico Fontana. The five-year reign of Sixtus was to see the building advance at a great rate.\n\nMichelangelo left a few drawings, including an early drawing of the dome, and some details. There were also detailed engravings published in 1569 by Stefan du P\u00e9rac who claimed that they were the master's final solution. Michelangelo, like Sangallo before him, also left a large wooden model. Giacomo della Porta subsequently altered this model in several ways. The major change restored an earlier design, in which the outer dome appears to rise above, rather than rest directly on the base. Most of the other changes were of a cosmetic nature, such as the adding of lion's masks over the swags on the drum in honour of Pope Sixtus and adding a circlet of finials around the spire at the top of the lantern, as proposed by Sangallo.A drawing by Michelangelo indicates that his early intentions were towards an ovoid dome, rather than a hemispherical one.  In an engraving in Galasso Alghisi' treatise (1563), the dome may be represented as ovoid, but the perspective is ambiguous. Stefan du P\u00e9rac's engraving (1569) shows a hemispherical dome, but this was perhaps an inaccuracy of the engraver. The profile of the wooden model is more ovoid than that of the engravings, but less so than the finished product. It has been suggested that Michelangelo on his death bed reverted to the more pointed shape. However, Lees-Milne cites Giacomo della Porta as taking full responsibility for the change and as indicating to Pope Sixtus that Michelangelo was lacking in the scientific understanding of which he himself was capable.\n\nHelen Gardner suggests that Michelangelo made the change to the hemispherical dome of lower profile in order to establish a balance between the dynamic vertical elements of the encircling giant order of pilasters and a more static and reposeful dome. Gardner also comments, \"The sculpturing of architecture [by Michelangelo] ... here extends itself up from the ground through the attic stories and moves on into the drum and dome, the whole building being pulled together into a unity from base to summit.\"It is this sense of the building being sculptured, unified and \"pulled together\" by the encircling band of the deep cornice that led Eneide Mignacca to conclude that the ovoid profile, seen now in the end product, was an essential part of Michelangelo's first (and last) concept. The sculptor/architect has, figuratively speaking, taken all the previous designs in hand and compressed their contours as if the building were a lump of clay. The dome must appear to thrust upwards because of the apparent pressure created by flattening the building's angles and restraining its projections. If this explanation is the correct one, then the profile of the dome is not merely a structural solution, as perceived by Giacomo della Porta; it is part of the integrated design solution that is about visual tension and compression. In one sense, Michelangelo's dome may appear to look backward to the Gothic profile of Florence Cathedral and ignore the Classicism of the Renaissance, but on the other hand, perhaps more than any other building of the 16th century, it prefigures the architecture of the Baroque.\n\n\n==== Completion ====\n\nGiacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana brought the dome to completion in 1590, the last year of the reign of Sixtus V. His successor, Gregory XIV, saw Fontana complete the lantern and had an inscription to the honour of Sixtus V placed around its inner opening. The next pope, Clement VIII, had the cross raised into place, an event which took all day, and was accompanied by the ringing of the bells of all the city's churches. In the arms of the cross are set two lead caskets, one containing a fragment of the True Cross and a relic of St. Andrew and the other containing medallions of the Holy Lamb.In the mid-18th century, cracks appeared in the dome, so four iron chains were installed between the two shells to bind it, like the rings that keep a barrel from bursting. As many as ten chains have been installed at various times, the earliest possibly planned by Michelangelo himself as a precaution, as Brunelleschi did at Florence Cathedral.\nAround the inside of the dome is written, in letters 1.4 metres (4.6 ft) high:\n\nTV ES PETRVS ET SVPER HANC PETRAM AEDIFICABO ECCLESIAM MEAM. TIBI DABO CLAVES REGNI CAELORVM(\"... you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church. ... I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ...\" Vulgate, Matthew 16:18\u201319.)\nBeneath the lantern is the inscription:\n\nS. PETRI GLORIAE SIXTVS PP. V. A. M. D. XC. PONTIF. V.(To the glory of St Peter; Sixtus V, pope, in the year 1590, the fifth of his pontificate.)\n\n\n==== Discovery of Michelangelo draft ====\n\nOn 7 December 2007, a fragment of a red chalk drawing of a section of the dome of the basilica, almost certainly by the hand of Michelangelo, was discovered in the Vatican archives. The drawing shows a small precisely drafted section of the plan of the entablature above two of the radial columns of the cupola drum. Michelangelo is known to have destroyed thousands of his drawings before his death. The rare survival of this example is probably due to its fragmentary state and the fact that detailed mathematical calculations had been made over the top of the drawing.\n\n\n=== Changes of plan ===\nOn 18 February 1606, under Pope Paul V, the dismantling of the remaining parts of the Constantinian basilica began. The marble cross that had been set at the top of the pediment by Pope Sylvester and Constantine the Great was lowered to the ground. The timbers were salvaged for the roof of the Borghese Palace and two rare black marble columns, the largest of their kind, were carefully stored and later used in the narthex. The tombs of various popes were opened, treasures removed and plans made for re-interment in the new basilica.\n\nThe Pope had appointed Carlo Maderno in 1602. He was a nephew of Domenico Fontana and had demonstrated himself as a dynamic architect. Maderno's idea was to ring Michelangelo's building with chapels, but the Pope was hesitant about deviating from the master's plan, even though he had been dead for forty years. The Fabbrica or building committee, a group drawn from various nationalities and generally despised by the Curia who viewed the basilica as belonging to Rome rather than Christendom, were in a quandary as to how the building should proceed. One of the matters that influenced their thinking was the Counter-Reformation which increasingly associated a Greek Cross plan with paganism and saw the Latin Cross as truly symbolic of Christianity. The central plan also did not have a \"dominant orientation toward the east.\"Another influence on the thinking of both the Fabbrica and the Curia was a certain guilt at the demolition of the ancient building. The ground on which it and its various associated chapels, vestries and sacristies had stood for so long was hallowed. The only solution was to build a nave that encompassed the whole space. In 1607 a committee of ten architects was called together, and a decision was made to extend Michelangelo's building into a nave. Maderno's plans for both the nave and the facade were accepted. The building began on 7 May 1607, and proceeded at a great rate, with an army of 700 labourers being employed. The following year, the fa\u00e7ade was begun, in December 1614 the final touches were added to the stucco decoration of the vault and early in 1615 the partition wall between the two sections was pulled down. All the rubble was carted away, and the nave was ready for use by Palm Sunday.\n\n\n==== Maderno's facade ====\n\nThe facade designed by Maderno, is 114.69 metres (376.3 ft) wide and 45.55 metres (149.4 ft) high and is built of travertine stone, with a giant order of Corinthian columns and a central pediment rising in front of a tall attic surmounted by thirteen statues: Christ flanked by eleven of the Apostles (except Saint Peter, whose statue is left of the stairs) and John the Baptist.\n\nThe inscription below the cornice on the 1 metre (3.3 ft) tall frieze reads:\n\nIN HONOREM PRINCIPIS APOST PAVLVS V BVRGHESIVS ROMANVS PONT MAX AN MDCXII PONT VII(In honour of the Prince of Apostles, Paul V Borghese, a Roman, Supreme Pontiff, in the year 1612, the seventh of his pontificate)\n(Paul V (Camillo Borghese), born in Rome but of a Sienese family, liked to emphasize his \"Romanness.\")\nThe facade is often cited as the least satisfactory part of the design of St. Peter's. The reasons for this, according to James Lees-Milne, are that it was not given enough consideration by the Pope and committee because of the desire to get the building completed quickly, coupled with the fact that Maderno was hesitant to deviate from the pattern set by Michelangelo at the other end of the building. Lees-Milne describes the problems of the fa\u00e7ade as being too broad for its height, too cramped in its details and too heavy in the attic story. The breadth is caused by modifying the plan to have towers on either side. These towers were never executed above the line of the facade because it was discovered that the ground was not sufficiently stable to bear the weight. One effect of the facade and lengthened nave is to screen the view of the dome, so that the building, from the front, has no vertical feature, except from a distance.\n\n\n==== Narthex and portals ====\nBehind the fa\u00e7ade of St. Peter's stretches a long portico or \"narthex\" such as was occasionally found in Italian churches. This is the part of Maderno's design with which he was most satisfied. Its long barrel vault is decorated with ornate stucco and gilt, and successfully illuminated by small windows between pendentives, while the ornate marble floor is beamed with light reflected in from the piazza. At each end of the narthex is a theatrical space framed by ionic columns and within each is set a statue, an equestrian figure of Charlemagne (18th century) by Cornacchini in the south end and The Vision of Constantine (1670) by Bernini in the north end.\nFive portals, of which three are framed by huge salvaged antique columns, lead into the basilica. The central portal has a bronze door created by Antonio Averulino c. 1440 for the old basilica and somewhat enlarged to fit the new space.\n\n\n==== Maderno's nave ====\n\nTo the single bay of Michelangelo's Greek Cross, Maderno added a further three bays. He made the dimensions slightly different from Michelangelo's bay, thus defining where the two architectural works meet. Maderno also tilted the axis of the nave slightly. This was not by accident, as suggested by his critics. An ancient Egyptian obelisk had been erected in the square outside, but had not been quite aligned with Michelangelo's building, so Maderno compensated, in order that it should, at least, align with the Basilica's fa\u00e7ade.The nave has huge paired pilasters, in keeping with Michelangelo's work. The size of the interior is so \"stupendously large\" that it is hard to get a sense of scale within the building. The four cherubs who flutter against the first piers of the nave, carrying between them two holy water basins, appear of quite normal cherubic size, until approached. Then it becomes apparent that each one is over 2 metres high and that real children cannot reach the basins unless they scramble up the marble draperies. The aisles each have two smaller chapels and a larger rectangular chapel, the Chapel of the Sacrament and the Choir Chapel. These are lavishly decorated with marble, stucco, gilt, sculpture and mosaic. Remarkably, all of the large altarpieces, with the exception of the Holy Trinity by Pietro da Cortona in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, have been reproduced in mosaic.  Two precious paintings from the old basilica, Our Lady of Perpetual Help and Our Lady of the Column are still being used as altarpieces.\nMaderno's last work at St. Peter's was to design a crypt-like space or \"Confessio\" under the dome, where the cardinals and other privileged persons could descend in order to be nearer to the burial place of the apostle. Its marble steps are remnants of the old basilica and around its balustrade are 95 bronze lamps.\n\n\n=== Influence on church architecture ===\nThe design of St. Peter's Basilica, and in particular its dome, has greatly influenced church architecture in Western Christendom. Within Rome, the huge domed church of Sant'Andrea della Valle was designed by Giacomo della Porta before the completion of St Peter's Basilica, and subsequently worked on by Carlo Maderno. This was followed by the domes of San Carlo ai Catinari, Sant'Agnese in Agone, and many others. Christopher Wren's dome at St Paul's Cathedral (London, England), the domes of Karlskirche (Vienna, Austria), St. Nicholas Church (Prague, Czech Republic), and the Pantheon (Paris, France) all pay homage to St Peter's Basilica.\nThe 19th and early-20th-century architectural revivals brought about the building of a great number of churches that imitate elements of St Peter's to a greater or lesser degree, including St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago, St. Josaphat's Basilica in Milwaukee, Immaculate Heart of Mary in Pittsburgh and Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral in Montreal, which replicates many aspects of St Peter's on a smaller scale. Post-Modernism has seen free adaptations of St Peter's in the Basilica of Our Lady of Liche\u0144, and the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro.\n\n\n== Bernini's furnishings ==\n\n\n=== Pope Urban VIII and Bernini ===\nAs a young boy Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598\u20131680) visited St. Peter's with the painter Annibale Carracci and stated his wish to build \"a mighty throne for the apostle\". His wish came true. As a young man, in 1626, he received the patronage of Pope Urban VIII and worked on the embellishment of the Basilica for 50 years. Appointed as Maderno's successor in 1629, he was to become regarded as the greatest architect and sculptor of the Baroque period. Bernini's works at St. Peter's include the baldachin (baldaquin, from Italian: baldacchino), the Chapel of the Sacrament, the plan for the niches and loggias in the piers of the dome and the chair of St. Peter.\n\n\n==== Baldacchino and niches ====\n\nBernini's first work at St. Peter's was to design the baldacchino, a pavilion-like structure 28.74 metres (94.3 ft) tall and claimed to be the largest piece of bronze in the world, which stands beneath the dome and above the altar. Its design is based on the ciborium, of which there are many in the churches of Rome, serving to create a sort of holy space above and around the table on which the Sacrament is laid for the Eucharist and emphasizing the significance of this ritual. These ciboria are generally of white marble, with inlaid coloured stone. Bernini's concept was for something very different. He took his inspiration in part from the baldachin or canopy carried above the head of the pope in processions, and in part from eight ancient columns that had formed part of a screen in the old basilica. Their twisted barley-sugar shape had a special significance as they were modelled on those of the Temple of Jerusalem and donated by the Emperor Constantine. Based on these columns, Bernini created four huge columns of bronze, twisted and decorated with laurel leaves and bees, which were the emblem of Pope Urban.\n\nThe baldacchino is surmounted not with an architectural pediment, like most baldacchini, but with curved Baroque brackets supporting a draped canopy, like the brocade canopies carried in processions above precious iconic images. In this case, the draped canopy is of bronze, and all the details, including the olive leaves, bees, and the portrait heads of Urban's niece in childbirth and her newborn son, are picked out in gold leaf. The baldacchino stands as a vast free-standing sculptural object, central to and framed by the largest space within the building. It is so large that the visual effect is to create a link between the enormous dome which appears to float above it, and the congregation at floor level of the basilica. It is penetrated visually from every direction, and is visually linked to the Cathedra Petri in the apse behind it and to the four piers containing large statues that are at each diagonal.As part of the scheme for the central space of the church, Bernini had the huge piers, begun by Bramante and completed by Michelangelo, hollowed out into niches, and had staircases made inside them, leading to four balconies. There was much dismay from those who thought that the dome might fall, but it did not. On the balconies Bernini created showcases, framed by the eight ancient twisted columns, to display the four most precious relics of the basilica: the spear of Longinus, said to have pierced the side of Christ, the veil of Veronica, with the miraculous image of the face of Christ, a fragment of the True Cross discovered in Jerusalem by Constantine's mother, Helena, and a relic of Saint Andrew, the brother of Saint Peter. In each of the niches that surround the central space of the basilica was placed a huge statue of the saint associated with the relic above. Only Saint Longinus is the work of Bernini. (See below)\n\n\n==== Bernini's Towers ====\n\nUrban had long been a critic of Bernini's predecessor, Carlo Maderno. His disapproval of the architect's work stemmed largely from the Maderno's design for the longitudinal nave of St. Peters, which was widely condemned for obscuring Michelangelo's dome. When the Pope gave the commission to Bernini he therefore requested that a new design for the facade's bell towers to be submitted for consideration. Baldinucci describes Bernini's tower as consisting of \"two orders of columns and pilasters, the first order being Corinthian\" and \"a third or attic story formed of pilasters and two columns on either side of the open archway in the center\".\nUrban desired the towers to be completed by a very specific date: 29 June 1641, the feast day dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. To this end an order was issued which stated that \"all work should take a second seat to that of the campanile.\" The south tower was completed on time even in spite of these issues, but records show that in the wake of the unveiling the Pope was not content with what he saw and he ordered the top level of Bernini's tower removed so that the structure could be made even grander. The tower continued to grow, and as the construction began to settle the first cracks started to appear followed by Urban's infamous public admonishment of his architect.\nIn 1642 all work on both towers came to a halt. Bernini had to pay the cost for the demolition; eventually the idea of completing the bell towers was abandoned.\n\n\n==== Cathedra Petri and Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament ====\n\nBernini then turned his attention to another precious relic, the so-called Cathedra Petri or \"throne of St. Peter\" a chair which was often claimed to have been used by the apostle, but appears to date from the 12th century. As the chair itself was fast deteriorating and was no longer serviceable, Pope Alexander VII determined to enshrine it in suitable splendor as the object upon which the line of successors to Peter was based. Bernini created a large bronze throne in which it was housed, raised high on four looping supports held effortlessly by massive bronze statues of four Doctors of the Church, Saints Ambrose and Augustine representing the Latin Church and Athanasius and John Chrysostom, the Greek Church. The four figures are dynamic with sweeping robes and expressions of adoration and ecstasy. Behind and above the cathedra, a blaze of light comes in through a window of yellow alabaster, illuminating, at its centre, the Dove of the Holy Spirit. The elderly painter, Andrea Sacchi, had urged Bernini to make the figures large, so that they would be seen well from the central portal of the nave. The chair was enshrined in its new home with great celebration of 16 January 1666.Bernini's final work for St. Peter's, undertaken in 1676, was the decoration of the Chapel of the Sacrament. To hold the sacramental Host, he designed a miniature version in gilt bronze of Bramante's Tempietto, the little chapel that marks the place of the death of St. Peter. On either side is an angel, one gazing in rapt adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome. Bernini died in 1680 in his 82nd year.\n\n\n== St. Peter's Piazza ==\n\nTo the east of the basilica is the Piazza di San Pietro, (St. Peter's Square). The present arrangement, constructed between 1656 and 1667, is the Baroque inspiration of Bernini who inherited a location already occupied by an Egyptian obelisk which was centrally placed, (with some contrivance) to Maderno's facade. The obelisk, known as \"The Witness\", at 25.31 metres (83.0 ft) and a total height, including base and the cross on top, of 40 metres (130 ft), is the second largest standing obelisk, and the only one to remain standing since its removal from Egypt and re-erection at the Circus of Nero in 37 AD, where it is thought to have stood witness to the crucifixion of Saint Peter. Its removal to its present location by order of Pope Sixtus V and engineered by Domenico Fontana on 28 September 1586, was an operation fraught with difficulties and nearly ending in disaster when the ropes holding the obelisk began to smoke from the friction. Fortunately this problem was noticed by Benedetto Bresca, a sailor of Sanremo, and for his swift intervention, his town was granted the privilege of providing the palms that are used at the basilica each Palm Sunday.\n\nThe other object in the old square with which Bernini had to contend was a large fountain designed by Maderno in 1613 and set to one side of the obelisk, making a line parallel with the facade. Bernini's plan uses this horizontal axis as a major feature of his unique, spatially dynamic and highly symbolic design. The most obvious solutions were either a rectangular piazza of vast proportions so that the obelisk stood centrally and the fountain (and a matching companion) could be included, or a trapezoid piazza which fanned out from the facade of the basilica like that in front of the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena. The problems of the square plan are that the necessary width to include the fountain would entail the demolition of numerous buildings, including some of the Vatican, and would minimize the effect of the facade. The trapezoid plan, on the other hand, would maximize the apparent width of the facade, which was already perceived as a fault of the design.Bernini's ingenious solution was to create a piazza in two sections. That part which is nearest the basilica is trapezoid, but rather than fanning out from the facade, it narrows. This gives the effect of countering the visual perspective. It means that from the second part of the piazza, the building looks nearer than it is, the breadth of the facade is minimized and its height appears greater in proportion to its width. The second section of the piazza is a huge elliptical circus which gently slopes downwards to the obelisk at its centre. The two distinct areas are framed by a colonnade formed by doubled pairs of columns supporting an entablature of the simple Tuscan Order.\nThe part of the colonnade that is around the ellipse does not entirely encircle it, but reaches out in two arcs, symbolic of the arms of \"the Catholic Church reaching out to welcome its communicants\".  The obelisk and Maderno's fountain mark the widest axis of the ellipse. Bernini balanced the scheme with another fountain in 1675. The approach to the square used to be through a jumble of old buildings, which added an element of surprise to the vista that opened up upon passing through the colonnade. Nowadays a long wide street, the Via della Conciliazione, built by Mussolini after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaties, leads from the River Tiber to the piazza and gives distant views of St. Peter's as the visitor approaches, with the basilica acting as a terminating vista.Bernini's transformation of the site is entirely Baroque in concept. Where Bramante and Michelangelo conceived a building that stood in \"self-sufficient isolation\", Bernini made the whole complex \"expansively relate to its environment\". Banister Fletcher says \"No other city has afforded such a wide-swept approach to its cathedral church, no other architect could have conceived a design of greater nobility ... (it is) the greatest of all atriums before the greatest of all churches of Christendom.\"\n\n\n== Clock ==\nThe top of the facade of St. Peter's Basilica has two clocks and several sculptures. The clocks were created to replace Bernini's bell towers which had to be torn down due to insufficient support. The left clock shows Rome time, the one of the right shows European mean time. The statues are Christ the Redeemer, St. John the Baptist and 11 Apostles. From the left: St. Thadeus, St. Matthew, St. Philip, St. Thomas, St. James the Greater, St. John the Baptist, The Redeemer, St. Andrew, St. John the Evangelist, St. James the Lesser, St. Bartholomew, St. Simeon, and St. Matthias. Above the Roman clock is the coat of arms for the city-state of Vatican City since 1931 held by two angels. The European mean time clock only shows an hour hand and it is about half an hour behind the rome time. The European mean time also be an attempt to keep the Devil guessing about \"the day and the hour.\"\n\n\n== Bells ==\nThe Basilica has 6 bells, placed in the room under the Roman clock, only 3 of them are visible from ground level while the rest are hidden behind the bourdon. They range from the smallest which is 260 kg to the massive bourdon that approximately weighs 9 tonnes. From 1931, the bells are operated electrically, thus permitting even the largest bell to be tolled from a distance. The oldest bell Rota dates from 1288 and the bourdon called Campanone is rung at Christmas and Easter, on the Solemnity of Sts. Peter and Paul, and every time the Pope imparts the \"Urbi et Orbi\" blessing to the city and to the world. Campanone also announces the election of a new pope.\n\n\n== Treasures ==\n\n\n=== Tombs and relics ===\n\nThere are over 100 tombs within St. Peter's Basilica (extant to various extents), many located beneath the Basilica. These include 91 popes, Saint Ignatius of Antioch, Holy Roman Emperor Otto II, and the composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. Exiled Catholic British royalty James Francis Edward Stuart and his two sons, Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Benedict Stuart, Cardinal Bishop of Frascati, are buried here, having been granted asylum by Pope Clement XI. Also buried here are Maria Clementina Sobieska, wife of James Francis Edward Stuart, Queen Christina of Sweden, who abdicated her throne in order to convert to Catholicism, and Countess Matilda of Tuscany, supporter of the Papacy during the Investiture Controversy. The most recent interment was Pope John Paul II, on 8 April 2005. Beneath, near the crypt, is the recently discovered vaulted 4th-century \"Tomb of the Julii\". (See below for some descriptions of tombs).\n\n\n=== Artworks ===\n\n\n==== Towers and narthex ====\nIn the towers to either side of the facade are two clocks. The clock on the left has been operated electrically since 1931. Its oldest bell dates from 1288.\nOne of the most important treasures of the basilica is a mosaic set above the central external door. Called the \"Navicella\", it is based on a design by Giotto (early 14th century) and represents a ship symbolizing the Christian Church. The mosaic is mostly a 17th-century copy of Giotto's original.\nAt each end of the narthex is an equestrian figure, to the north Constantine the Great by Bernini (1670) and to the south Charlemagne by Cornacchini (18th century).\nOf the five portals from the narthex to the interior, three contain notable doors. The central portal has the Renaissance bronze door by Antonio Averulino (called Filarete) (1455), enlarged to fit the new space. The southern door, the Door of the Dead, was designed by 20th-century sculptor Giacomo Manz\u00f9 and includes a portrait of Pope John XXIII kneeling before the crucified figure of Saint Peter.\nThe northernmost door is the \"Holy Door\" which, by tradition, is walled-up with bricks, and opened only for holy years such as the Jubilee year by the Pope. The present door is bronze and was designed by Vico Consorti in 1950 and cast in Florence by the Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry. Above it are inscriptions commemorating the opening of the door: PAVLVS V PONT MAX ANNO XIII and GREGORIVS XIII PONT MAX.Recently installed commemorative plaques read above the door as follows:\n\nPAVLVS VI PONT MAX HVIVS PATRIARCALIS VATICANAE BASILICAE PORTAM SANCTAM APERVIT ET CLAVSIT ANNO IVBILAEI MCMLXXVPaul VI, Pontifex Maximus, opened and closed the holy door of this patriarchal Vatican basilica in the jubilee year of 1975.\nIOANNES PAVLVS II P.M.

PORTAM SANCTAM ANNO MAGNI IVB MM\u2013MMI A IOANNE PAVLO PP. II RESERVATAM ET CLAVSAM APERVIT ET CLAVSIT ANNO IVB MISERICORDIAE MMXV\u2013MMXVIPope Francis opened and closed again the holy door, closed and set apart by Pope John Paul II in the year of the great jubilee 2000\u20132001, in the jubilee year of Mercy 2015\u20132016.\nOlder commemorative plaques are removed to make way for the new plaque when the holy door is opened and sealed.\n\n\n==== Nave ====\nOn the first piers of the nave are two Holy Water basins held by pairs of cherubs each 2 metres high, commissioned by Pope Benedict XIII from designer Agostino Cornacchini and sculptor Francesco Moderati, (1720s).\nAlong the floor of the nave are markers showing the comparative lengths of other churches, starting from the entrance.\nOn the decorative pilasters of the piers of the nave are medallions with relief depicting 56 of the first popes.\nIn niches between the pilasters of the nave are statues depicting 39 founders of religious orders.\nSet against the north east pier of the dome is a statue of Saint Peter Enthroned, sometimes attributed to late 13th-century sculptor Arnolfo di Cambio, with some scholars dating it to the 5th century. One foot of the statue is largely worn away by pilgrims kissing it for centuries.\nThe sunken Confessio leading to the Vatican Grottoes (see above) contained a large kneeling statue by Canova of Pope Pius VI, who was captured and mistreated by Napoleon Bonaparte's army.  This has now been moved to the back (eastern) end of the grottoes.\nIn the Confessio is the Niche of the Pallium (\"Niche of Stoles\") which contains a bronze urn, donated by Pope Benedict XIV, to contain white stoles embroidered with black crosses and woven with the wool of lambs blessed on St. Agnes' day.\nThe High Altar is surmounted by Bernini's baldachin. (See above)\nSet in niches within the four piers supporting the dome are the larger-than-life statues associated with the basilica's primary holy relics: Saint Helena holding the True Cross and the Holy Nails, by Andrea Bolgi; Saint Longinus holding the spear that pierced the side of Jesus, by Bernini (1639); Saint Andrew with the St. Andrew's Cross, by Francois Duquesnoy and Saint Veronica holding her veil with the image of Jesus' face, by Francesco Mochi.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== North aisle ====\nIn the first chapel of the north aisle is Michelangelo's Piet\u00e0.\nOn the first pier in the right aisle is the monument of Queen Christina of Sweden, who abdicated in 1654 in order to convert to Catholicism.\nThe second chapel, dedicated to Saint Sebastian, contains the statues of popes Pius XI and Pius XII. The space below the altar used to be the resting place of Pope Innocent XI but his remains were moved to the Altar of the Transfiguration on 8 April 2011. This was done to make way for the body of Pope John Paul II. His remains were placed beneath the altar on 2 May 2011.\nThe large chapel on the right aisle is the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament which contains the tabernacle by Bernini (1664) resembling Bramante's Tempietto at San Pietro in Montorio supported by two kneeling angels and with behind it a painting of the Holy Trinity by Pietro da Cortona.\nNear the altar of Our Lady of Succour are the monuments of popes Gregory XIII by Camillo Rusconi (1723) and Gregory XIV.\nAt the end of the aisle is an altar containing the relics of Saint Petronilla and with an altarpiece The Burial of St Petronilla by Guercino (Giovanni Francesco Barbieri), 1623.\n\n\n==== South aisle ====\nThe first chapel in the south aisle is the baptistry, commissioned by Pope Innocent XII and designed by Carlo Fontana, (great nephew of Domenico Fontana). The font was carved from the lid of the purple porphyry sarcophagus which had once held the remains of the Emperor Hadrian, and is surmounted with a gilt-bronze figure of the \"Lamb of God\". Fontana's reworked porphyry sarcophagus lid font replaced an earlier font, which was re-purposed from the sarcophagus of Probus, the 4th-century Prefect of Rome, and which was used for baptisms from the 15th century until the late 17th century, when Fontana's work was completed.\nAgainst the first pier of the aisle is the Monument to the Royal Stuarts: James Stuart, known as the \"Old Pretender\" and his sons, Charles Edward, known as \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\", and Henry, a cardinal. The tomb is a Neo-Classical design by Canova unveiled in 1819. Opposite it is the memorial of James Francis Edward Stuart's wife, Maria Clementina Sobieska.\nThe second chapel is that of the Presentation of the Virgin and contains the memorials of Pope Benedict XV and Pope John XXIII.\nAgainst the piers are the tombs of Pope Pius X and Pope Innocent VIII.\nThe large chapel off the south aisle is the Choir Chapel which contains the altar of the Immaculate Conception.\nAt the entrance to the Sacristy is the tomb of Pope Pius VIII\nThe south transept contains the altars of Saint Thomas, Saint Joseph and the Crucifixion of Saint Peter.\nThe tomb of Fabio Chigi, Pope Alexander VII, towards the end of the aisle, is the work of Bernini and called by Lees-Milne \"one of the greatest tombs of the Baroque Age\". It occupies an awkward position, being set in a niche above a doorway into a small vestry, but Bernini has utilized the doorway in a symbolic manner. Pope Alexander kneels upon his tomb, facing outward. The tomb is supported on a large draped shroud in patterned red marble, and is supported by four female figures, of whom only the two at the front are fully visible. They represent Charity and Truth. The foot of Truth rests upon a globe of the world, her toe being pierced symbolically by the thorn of Protestant England. Coming forth, seemingly, from the doorway as if it were the entrance to a tomb, is the skeletal winged figure of Death, its head hidden beneath the shroud, but its right hand carrying an hourglass stretched upward towards the kneeling figure of the pope.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Archpriests since 1053 ==\n\nList of archpriests of the Vatican Basilica:\n\n\n== Specifications ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndex of Vatican City-related articles\nList of basilicas in Italy\nList of Roman Catholic basilicas\nArchitecture of cathedrals and great churches\nList of oldest church buildings\nList of tallest buildings in Rome\nArchitecture of Rome\nList of largest domes\nHistory of early modern period domes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVaticanstate.va \u2013 official website with images and information about the Basilica\n\"Virtual Reality Tour of the Basilica of Saint Peter\"\nSt Peter's Basilica.info \u2012 unofficial website on the basilica, with images and text from different books.\n360 Degree Photographs Inside Saint Peter's Basilica\nGoogle Maps: Vatican \u2012 Satellite image of the Basilica",

          "Well worth a visit lots to see and explore. The view from the top overlooking the city is definitely worth the climb, be warned it is a fair climb with quite a few steep ramps to negoiate. We indulged in coffee and cake on the terrace which was reasonably priced.",

          "The Sant'Angelo bridge spans the Tiber river right in front of the Castle Sant Angelo. With its angel statues and five arches, it's in my opinion the most beautiful bridge in Rome. During the day it's pretty busy with many tourists and street vendors on it, while at night it's",

          "Many teens and millennials taking selfies. This is not really my scene and so a decided lack of appreciation... maybe take a walk down by the Tiber. On a positive not, it does offer a direct path from the east side to the west and vice versa.",
          "I know, I know. This bridge is probably an architecture landmark and speciality and so on... But I just dont enjoy sculptures so much so for me the bridge was just not so memorable. A great view of st. Angel's castle behind the bridge though.",
          "I love this bridge, its pedestrianised so its great to just relax on and enjoy the view. This bridge is lovely late at night when there aren't many people around and the castle and statues on the bridge are lit up.",
          "Whether the view of the Castle or the Basilica of St. Peter`s this is the bridge to beat all bridges in Rome. The statues of the angels holding the instruments of Christ`s Passion make this a special route for all the religious pilgrims to the city on their way to the Vatican",

          "Rome's most beautiful bridge! Ponte Sant'Angelo (Bridge of the Holy Angel) is the approach to the Castel Sant'Angelo, but it is actually more beautiful than the castle itself! In fact, I think this bridge is what converts Castel Sant'Angelo from a gloomy (former) mausoleum to a",
          "This is by far my favorite bridge in Italy. Each angel holds a symbol of the crucifixion of Jesus. They are so beautiful and on this second visit the lighting was amazing. It is a must see as far as I am concerned. We were too late to tour the Castel Sant'Angelo but hope to",

          "Right in front of Castle Sant Angelo is this beautiful bridge. Reminds me of the Charles bridge of Prague. This bridge was build as an entrance to the tomb in the castle over the Tiber when this side of the river was only empty fields. The only negative I can think of are all",

          "For me the loveliest bridge in Rome. Richly decorated by statues and with Castle Sant'Angelo on one side and the city centre on the other it makes for a good viewpoint as well. One of it's highlights is of course the angel statues that Benini started to work on in 1688.",

          "I actually prefer the adjacent bridge. Although it has vehicular traffic, it has fewer people and, in my opinion, more interesting sculptures. It also has nice views of St. Angelo in the background. Both bridges are filled with beggars, which are mostly scammers. These two",
          "It is a narrow bridge that connects Piazza Navona and Castelo di Sant Angelo. There are few artists along it. You have a nice place to take pictures of the castle. Impressive statues of biblical meanings. Also is the bridge that takes you to Vatican.",

          "It's one of the few bridges that you can use to cross the river. Unlike other bridges, this one has a lot of sculptures and it's quite special. Maybe because the end of the bridge is Castel Sant'Angelo. It's quite crowded during daytime mainly because a lot of tourists are",
          "Crossing in either direction its marvellous with its approach to the Castel sant'Angelo. It's sculptures rival those of The Charles bridge in Prague. Great views and aspects of the bridge are worth while seeking from the Castel itself and also other bridges across the Tiber.",

          "The bridge was built by Emperor Hadrian and is one of the oldest bridges in Rome. From a tourist perspective, you may simply walk across it and not spare a second thought while you marvel at the surrounding statues and castle. The bridge is nearly 2000 years old and has a tonne",
          "Rome's oldest bridge is worth to be explored, for nice views of the river, the Angel Castle and San Pietro",
          "Beautiful bridge that takes you from the Vatican side to the Rome side. Wonderful examples of old statues and views up and down the Tiber",
          "Ponte Sant'Angelo (Saint Angel's Bridge) is truly one of the most beautiful bridges I have ever seen in my international travels. It is quite long and lined with beautiful statues on both sides. Ten of the statues are that of angels which were designed by Bernini. There are",
          "I usually enjoy bridge architecture and this one I just loved. We happen to come across this one without a plan, just wandered around to it and took some lovely pictures, enjoying the views of the castle and the River Tiber. The best part was after we got home and did a little",
          "10 huge sculptures of angels in different poses, 2 of them by Bernini. The best spot to shoot is near the south end of the bridge, from where the Bridge, the angels and the Castello could all be taken in.",
          "Very pretty bridge, loved the statues and it was a great spot to get photos of the castle in the background on the way to the Vatican.",
          "The sight of this lit up at night is truly one of the most beautiful in the city, the view from the bridge itself lovely, and it was always a great excuse to stay out late and force myself to walk home this way. I'm glad for every night in my 20s I missed sleep to do this, and",
          "Just the location is staggeringly nice enough, but Bernini's statues (OK he didn't make them but he planned them) make this the most lovely bridge in the world for me. If I was going to jump off a bridge it would be this one - not only is it beautiful.... it isn't very high....",
          "Wonderful place that leads to Castel Sant' Angelo. This well-known bridge designed by Bernini is one of the must-see places of Rome. The statues across the bridge also designed by Bernini are trully remarkable.",

          "A short but one of the most beautiful bridges you will see. From the Castello Sant'Angelo you can walk over the Tiber River to the other side which will be via del Banco di Santo Spirito. The short bridge is adored with 10 statutes of angels, each depicting a different theme.",
          "Beautiful bridge. Stunning sight to behold, even for me and I have a fear of statues. Pushing myself to get over it. Between Rome and Florence I've seen my fair share.",

          "A lazy walk along the river in the centre of Rome will throw up numerous bridges but this one is stunning. Well worth a detour if your are in the vicinity.",
          "Every time when we were cruising to Rome, the movie \u201cAngels and Demons\u201d was playing in our stateroom T.V. Each time I only watched bits and pieces and it gave me a spooky feeling about that bridge. So this time when we were in Rome, we made sure we walked on this old bridge",
          "A beautiful bridge with a very long history. The approach to the Castel Sant'Angelo, crossing the Tiber. The bridge is wonderfully decorated with 10 angels, designed by Bernini, each holding a symbol of Christ's passion (nails, lance, sponge, etc). Crowded during the day, in the",
          "I adore this bridge because of what I have heard described as Bernini's breezy angels. The fluidity of the robes on these statues is breathtaking and it is almost impossible to believe that they are made of marble and stone. The bridge crosses the Tiber, Rome's river and leads",
          "In a city filled with \"must see's\", add this to your list. Totally worth the minimal entry fee. Go!!",
          "This is one of the great monuments of Rome, a pedestrian bridge that connects the 15th-century quarters of Rome to the Castel Sant'Angelo. The \"Sant'Angelo\" is probably the St. Michael who wields his sword high above the castle. The angels themselves designed by Bernini carry",

          "Settled across the river Tiber and adorned by ten beautiful angels created by Bernini and his students the 'Bridge of Angels' leads tourists to the ancient Castel Sant'Angelo and the Vatican. A wonderful spot to people watch and for photo opportunities it is well worth visiting!",

          "One short stop before arriving to Vatican city, perfect place for a picture of the Sant'Angelo Castle right in front of it",
          "A beautiful bridge in a beautiful setting. So pleased that it is pedestrians only as it is quite crowded. No traffic means that photos are easier to take.The statues by Bernini are stunning angels!! The Castel Sant'Angelo is a wonderful backdrop. You can admire the river traffic",
          "The bridge itself is a bridge. An old bridge, but nothing really noteworthy. The real appeal is that it provides a great vantage point from which to photograph the Vatican and St. Peter's Basilica - especially shots that include the river. Unfortunately, I found it impossible",
          "This may have been our favorite spot in Rome. The Pont Sant'Angelo is a beautiful bridge crossing the Tiber River,from the center of Rome to the ancient Castel Sant'Angelo. On this bridge are 10 Bernini angel sculptures. One is more beautiful than the next. Every one is a",

          "I am a fan of Bernini sculptures so I was impressed with this bridge and the castle looming in the background. First time across we had to run the gauntlet of selfie stick sellers and \"blanket traders\" which did detract from the experience. Cross latter in the day and they",

          "Better than the Castel Sant'Angelo itself is the bridge under its name. From here you will be able to contemplate river Tiber on its best spot, the Vatican City and all the motion surrounding it and the castle (of course). Enjoy this moment while taking tons of unforgetable",

          "This bridge is a wonderful sight that leads up to the Castle Sant Angelo. There are statues either side of the bridge going all the way across and reminds me somewhat of a bridge in Prague. It gets very crowded during the day time with hoards of tourists heading towards the",

          "If you were in Prague, this bridge would remind you on Charle's bridge, but only in that way that it' full of artist, musician. It's crowded place, with a lot of people waiting to come accros amazing river - Tiber. From this place, you can take some outstanding pictures of",
          "A great place to look back at Santa Angelo Castle the river and Vatican City Fairly busy bridge but worth the walk",
          "Every time I visit Rome I spend some time on Ponte Sant'Angelo. The view from the bridge is awesome - especially at night, when it's not crowded. History and art, calm river, view of roof of Saint Peter's Cathedral, Castel Sant Angelo. It's magic!",
          "We used the bridge on our way to and from Vatican City. Loved the angels, the views of the Tiber and Castel Sant'Angelo!",

          "I had to pinch myself as I walked over the bridge. I couldn't believe that I was finally there. It is a stunningly beautiful bridge. It is even more amazing to walk over it at night when it seems to glow.",
          "You can reach here easily from the Vatican City. It's recommended that visit here in the evening after the Vatican City. You can see the bridge with sunset and see the St. Pietro Basilica as the background.",
          "Such a privilege to walk across this ancient bridge spanning the Tiber. If you are visiting the Vatican area of Rome don't miss the opportunity to see this bridge for yourself. Simply beautiful",
          "excellent bridge with breathtaking statues. I would like once more to walk along it.More or less it looks like Charles bridge in Prague,but I think it is more attractive ant fascinated ,than that one.",

          "we didnt notice the bridge at first for our hurry (to visit castle) as we walked beside it,but when went into the castle's upper floors,wow!!!! then we saw the ABSOLUTELY AMAZING view of the tiber river and the bridge. perhaps one can see the best panoramic view of the river and",
          "This bridge is picturesque from every angle. I enjoyed walking along and finding the symbol of Christ's crucifixion in each angel. My kids just liked running in the open space and looking out over the water. :) Would be lovely at sunset but even at midday when we were there",
          "This beautiful bridge is so special we visited it several times during our stay in order to take pictures during the day and at night. The angels adoring the bridge all so spectacular and the view leading up to Castel Sant'Angelo is iconic.",
          "We didn't have long in Rome, so we didn't get to visit Castel Sant' Angelo. I was determined to at least see the bridge though (after watching Angels and Demons), and thought it was great. The sun was setting and the angel sculptures looked great. The only off putting thing was",
          "Gorgeous statues and beautiful bridge. This is a great place to walk to get to the Vatican or Castle Sant' Angelo.",

          "This beautiful bridge is right in front of Castel Sant'angelo (also a must-see), and it features statues of 10 angels holding instruments of the Passion. It's right on your way back from the Vatican to the city's centre (or the other way), so one should definitely plan their",
          "This bridge is located in front of the Saint Angelo castle. It has some nice statues in the side of the bridge. Good place to walk through returning or going to the Vatican",
          "Beautiful Bridge, day and night. Just be mindful at night as there are vendors that sell counterfeit goods on the bridge.",
          "As I was heading to the vatican and I passed the castello I \"almost\" missed this marvelous bridge. The history of this bridge is so rich that you ought to spend some time and appreciate the details. From the sculptures to the details in the architecture are all the highlights",
          "It's amazing that it stands almost intact for thousands of years. As I read later, the only time a part of the bridge was destroyed was by intention when reconstructing the river banks. The parts of the bridge connecting it with the banks had to be re-built because of that. I",
          "The most beautiful bridge in Rome, for sure. My favorite one no doubt. It is near Piazza Navona, just 3,4 minutes which many seem to do not know. On your way to Vatican, you should stop and walk over the bridge and then continue to Vatican",

          "It is a must to cross the bridge with direction either the Castel St Angelo or the Vatican city or both. From this pedestrian bridge the view is really beautiful and you will not be dissapointed.",
          "This is just a beautiful and iconic bridge with lots of lovely sculptures along the way. Also, many days there are vendors sitting along the bridge selling drinks, snacks and handicrafts.",
          "Nothing special about the bridge, but a good vantage point to take photo's, mainly of the Castle and the river.",
          "For non-artist, it is just a nice looking bridge. But like a lot of attractions in Rome- need a renovation. It's looking best from the Rome side, with a castle on horizon :)",
          "Recommend walking across the bridge to snap photos of the angel statutes and the fascade of Castel Sant'Angelo. Readers of Dan Brown books will recall the Castle had a secret passage that leads directly to Vatican City. The passage was used by the Swiss Guards to save Pope",
          "I'm a great lover of Bernini's vision and talent and this did not disappoint. It was equally impressive during the day or night. It was worth the visit to see in different lighting and less crowded at night. IT is more enjoyable if you read the history behind it first. If you",
          "Just a bridge, not much more. You kinda have to go by it if you are headed to Vatican City from Rome. The river is dirty dirty too, not much to see here.",
          "The most gorgeous and magnificent of Rome's angels. Beautiful vistas of Rome. We visited whilst riding the hop on/hop off bus. Well worth the visit.",
          "Favourite bridge in Rome. Ornate and beautiful. Lovely spot for photos. Joins Campo d'Fiori and Navonna area to Vatican area We always walk across, past the Castello and then on to St Peters. Never do a trip to Rome without visiting.",
          "This is one of my most favorite 'attractions' in Rome. I love this pedestrian bridge and all of the angels over the Tiber River. It is at the base of Castel Sant'Angelo and a must see between Vatican City and Piazza Navona. I will always make sure I walk across this bridge",
          "We chose to walk across this bridge on our way to the Vatican City. It's a beautiful old bridge, with lovely views out over the river, and an impressive walk up the the Castle and then on to St. Peter's.",
          "On our walk back to town after visiting the Vatican, my husband and I came upon the Castel Sant' Angelo as well as the beautiful Ponte Sant' Angelo, adorned with fantastic sculptures. As you navigate your way through an incredible amount of vendors/hawkers, you arrive at this",
          "One of the bridges across the River Tiber, with a lovely view of St Peter's Basilica and Castel Sant' Angelo, which is exactly opposite it.The bridge is decorated with truly magnificent sculptures of different angels.For some reason the bridge is overrun with hawkers selling all",
          "The Sant'Angelo bridge is undoubtedly the most beautiful bridge in Rome, with its many statues of angels along both sides it is located right in front of Castel Sant'Angelo and is the main access to go to the basilica of St. Peter and Vatican City. Of course, as in most of the",
          "It's one of the many bridges in the Tiber river, but maybe the most wonderful, since it is decorated with statues of angels. It is in front of Sant'Angelo's Castle",
          "If you ignore the pesky pedlars (which is standard all through the country), you can really soak in the beauty of the statues along this bridge. We didn't feel the need to tour the castle, we just wanted to see the bridge - it's lovely and worth the stop.",
          "This is a very beautiful bridge that is lined with sculptures. There are vendors here and some street performers. Take your time crossing this bridge--it is gorgeous. Once you are on the other side, don't miss Castel Sant'Angelo. If you have the time, take the full tour",
          "This bridge is worth a side walk from Castle Sant'Angelo, the Vatican, Piazza Navonne or maybe even the Pantheon. I'm not a bridge historian or an art expert, although either would both rave about the significance of the bridge, but as a tourist who wants to get a feel of the",
          "We walked accross the Ponte Sant'Angelo heading from the Vatican to the Pantheon. It's such a beautiful bridge...however, it was totally full of vendors selling junk. Took a bit away from the history and peacefullness.",
          "Day or night this is an iconic and atmospheric bridge in the shadow of the Castel Sant Angelo, stunning views of the river and St Peters and knowing you are standing on a 200o year old bridge build by Hadrian. Too many vendors around the bridge and on it and they do detract from",
          "During 4 days staying in Rome, I & my wife visited this icon twice, once in early morning & once sunset to get different decent images and we didn't regret...",
          "The bridge was originally built by Hadrian for easy access from town across the river to his tomb. It later became important as the best way for people to get to the Vatican. The angel statues on the bridge were designed by Bernini and very baroque in style. The only negative",
          "A short walk from the Vatican and worth it! The Ponte Sant'Agnelo allowed the pilgrims to cross the river to the Vatican in a majestic way. The details are incredible, but watch your bags and pockets while looking around. There are lots of vendors and slick guys walking around.",
          "We love this part of Rome, connects the view of St Peter Sq and the river, the night lights are great, there is a great market nearby and full of games for the family and couples , there was an outdoor cinema as well.",
          "The details of this bridge is just breathtaking! The sculptures of the Angels are so beautiful and mesmerizing! Take the time to really look and appreciate at all the details, so worth it.",
          "This is a fascinating ancient Roman bridge that carries passage to Castel Sant'Angelo. The bridge is solely pedestrian, and provides a photogenic view of the Castle. Apparently, I was said to be built by an ancient Roman Emperor to cross the river Tiber from the city centre to",
          "it is a very nice ponte facing Castello Sant'Angelo and on your left side the Vatican!!! the status and sculptors are amazing like everything in Rome... You will find a lot of people selling small gudgets, playing music...",
          "Take the time when you are in Rome to walk this bridge at least once and with your camera at the ready. You can not take a bad photo of this location with the Castel Sant Angelo in one direction, St Peter's Dome in another. History just flows around you as you cross the bridge",
          "The sculptures are all stunning but together as a walkway over to the Vatican it is quite a collection. It is in walking distance of Piazza Navona, which I consider the core of a Roman holiday. We walked it several times and the state of preservation is super, I wondered how",
          "A lovely bridge to walk across and take beautiful photos.Lovely ornamental statues line the bridge with the Castel Sant Angelo looking down on it.From the bridge you can photograph the Basilica and get a lovely view of the River Tiber.There were several living statues on the",
          "Perhaps the best way to cross the Tiber on foot, this pedestrian bridge is lined with Beautiful Sculptures and view of Castel Sant'Angelo - street vendors, notwithstanding.",
          "Walk the entire length of this picturesque span filled with Bernini-designed angels. Take in the view of Castel Sant'Angelo, St. Peter's Basilica and the Tiber River. After you've viewed each of the ten angels, rest on the steps on the south side of the bridge, then don't",
          "Beautiful architecture with sculptures ruined by 30scums selling chinese stuff. If you forgot the behind you will enjoy the Angel castle view.",
          "Take some time to walk on this truly beautiful bridge. Take no notice of the hawkers and street vendors, just take in the scenery and the imposing Hadrian's Mausoleum as a backdrop. To think that we've walked across a bridge that was built by the emperor Hadrian in the year 136",
          "Whilst not strictly correct, this bridge seems to metaphorically connect the Vatican to Ancient Rome in terms of tourist sites. Most roads lead here as well so easy to find. It would be great if you could spend more time here without being bothered by all of the street-sellers",
          "Just the most beautiful bridge in the world. The most amazing statues line this bridge, and the beautiful and historic Castel Sant'Angelo sits at the top. What more could you want? It doesn't surprise me in the slightest that a young couple were having their wedding photos taken",

          "It is the most beautiful bridge in Rome; it is also one of the oldest, dating back to the Emperor Hadrian. Its parapets are lined with gyrating Baroque angels and it has the mighty Castel Sant'Angelo (originally, Hadrian's mausoleum) for a backdrop. What could be more perfect!",
          "My wife and I visited Rome last July. What an amazing city. If you're patient with this city, you'll find it has more to see and showcase than any of the other Italian cities. It really does everything in a colossal fashion. Having said that, the Ponte Sant'Angel is merely a",

          "Leading to the imposing Castel Sant'Angelo, this is one of the most elaborately-decorated bridges in Rome, with a series of statues not unlike those found on the famous Charles Bridge in Prague. Street vendors lining up the sides of the bridge diminish its visual effect, but",

          "This pedestrian bridge is the nicest way to cross the Tiber in Rome, by far. The bridge structure itself is Imperial Roman, but it's had some facelifts in the last couple centuries. The statues on the bridge of angels have some personality. Walking toward Castel Sant'Angelo is",
          "When you cross the bridge (once called the Ponte Elio) you have a splendid view of the Castle St Angelo. The bridge was built by Emperor Hadrian (130 AD), the Castle was his mausoleum. The bridge is together with a double row of angels in the style of Bernini. The Castle is",

          "Hey, don't ask me! I'm so fond of Rome, what can I say of this fantastic bridge? Only one thing: go and look at the beautiful faces (one of a kind) of this masterpiece of italian baroque (some of the original angels are by Bernini, who designed some parts of the bridge itself).",
          "The Ponte Sant'Angelo is famous for the Bernini's Angels, which represents the passions of Christ. The sculptures are brilliant and the view to Castel Sant'Angelo is speechless. The only negative things are the beggars that are there.",
          "Located in front of Castel Sant'Angelo, the bridge is a must see. From here, we could see St Peter's Basilica in the distance and sunset was beautiful. The angels' statues were a sight and this is a really nice photo-taking spot. Street peddlers lined both sides of the bridge so",

          "Love, love, love this beautiful bridge decorated with angels and ironically leads to Castel Sant'Angelo which was once a prison! Very old world and romantic especially when lit up at night. Reminds me a bit of Paris. Most Italian bridges are not so ornate, but Rome is all about",
          "the angel on the castle. st. Michael, is holding a sword upright. the meaning is that he was seen in vision by the pope, in this pose. The pope interpreted the fact that the plague which was raging in the city would be stopped, and had the statue placed on top. This however is",
          "The most beautiful bridge in Rome. The statues are amazing and the view of the castle (st. Angelo) is great.",
          "As the only pedestrian only crossing this is a wonderfull place. The angels - each portraying a Passion of the Christ - gives this bridge a real charm. It is just a pity about all the informal unregistered street vendors selling their stuff on and just across the bridge.",

        "wiki": "Adrian van Kaam, C.S.Sp. (April 19, 1920 \u2013 November 17, 2007) was a Dutch Catholic priest in the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, a college professor, existentialist psychologist, writer on formative spirituality, and founder of the Institute of Formative Spirituality at Duquesne University and its successor, the Epiphany Association of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.\n\n\n== Life ==\nVan Kaam was born in The Hague, Netherlands in 1920. He joined the minor seminary of the Holy Ghost Fathers in Weert at the age of 12, professing his vows on August 29, 1940. He was at major seminary in Gemert in 1940, during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. While on retreat in the western Netherlands in 1944, Van Kaam was trapped behind Nazi front lines following Operation Market Garden. He hid in a barn while enduring the \"hunger winter\" of 1944, during which the Dutch were forced to subsist on turnips, potatoes and toxic tulip bulbs, an experience that had a permanent deleterious effect on his health. Although starving himself, Van Kaam made efforts to find food to take to Jews and others in hiding. After his ordination as a priest on July 21, 1946, in Gemert, Van Kaam became a seminary professor, his health being too frail to allow him a life as a missionary. He led a series of classes on faith for young adults with the assistance of a Belgian mentor, Maria Schouwenaars. Eventually, at the behest of Msgr. Giovanni Battista Montini, later Pope Paul VI, Van Kaam was invited to teach these classes full-time.In 1954, Van Kaam was sent to teach faith formation at Duquesne University, a Spiritan university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Upon arrival, however, he discovered that he was being asked to replace a deceased psychology professor. He had no background in psychology, so he was sent to obtain a degree in the subject. Travelling throughout the United States, he would study the subject under both Carl Rogers and Erik Erikson. Van Kaam earned a doctorate in philosophy from Case Western Reserve University, writing his dissertation on \"The Experience of Really Feeling Understood by a Person.\" He became an American citizen shortly afterward. He then began his teaching career at Duquesne. After an accrediting agency objected to his courses, which combined psychology and religion with a \"phenomenological air\", Van Kaam returned to his background in spiritual direction in 1963. The university created the \"Institute of Man,\" later renamed the Institute of Formative Spirituality, as a venue for Van Kaam's unique approach. The institute would have a role in the post-Vatican II \"reshaping\" of Catholic spirituality.In 1980, he suffered a near fatal heart attack but continued writing and working. He founded the Epiphany Association in 1988 in an effort to bring Catholic spirituality to lay people. The Institute of Formative Spirituality was closed in 1995 due to financial reasons, and Van Kaam, with the assistance of a colleague, Dr. Susan Muto, continued his work with the Epiphany Association in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Beechview. He received an honorary Doctorate of Christian Letters from the Franciscan University of Steubenville in 1994. Van Kaam retired to the Spiritan priests' retirement home in Bethel Park in 2004. He died on November 17, 2007, in the nursing home of the Little Sisters of the Poor in Pittsburgh's North Side, and was buried in Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Peters Township, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Works ==\nVan Kaam is the author of about thirty books and hundreds of articles. His early works were aimed specifically towards Catholics and psychologists and focused on typically Catholic subjects and a critique of contemporary psychological theories. In the 1970s and 80s, however, Van Kaam began to explore a \"science of spirituality,\" which led to a voluminous series entitled Formative Spirituality.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEpiphany Association\nMemories of Adrian van Kaam, C.S.Sp.\nVan Kaam the Psychologist, an article by Jeremiah D.

      "name": "Piazza del Popolo",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Piazza del Popolo is a large urban square in Rome. The name in modern Italian literally means \"People's Square\", but historically it derives from the poplars (populus in Latin, pioppo in Italian) after which the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, in the northeast corner of the piazza, takes its name.\nThe piazza lies inside the northern gate in the Aurelian Walls, once the Porta Flaminia of ancient Rome, and now called the Porta del Popolo. This was the starting point of the Via Flaminia, the road to Ariminum (modern-day Rimini) and the most important route to the north. At the same time, before the age of railroads, it was the traveller's first view of Rome upon arrival. For centuries, the Piazza del Popolo was a place for public executions, the last of which took place in 1826.\n\n\n== Valadier's design ==\n\nThe layout of the piazza today was designed in neoclassical style between 1811 and 1822 by the architect Giuseppe Valadier, He removed a modest fountain by Giacomo Della Porta, erected in 1572, and demolished some insignificant buildings and haphazard high screening walls to form two semicircles, reminiscent of Bernini's plan for St. Peter's Square, replacing the original cramped trapezoidal square centred on the Via Flaminia.\nValadier's Piazza del Popolo, however, incorporated the verdure of trees as an essential element; he conceived his space in a third dimension, expressed in the building of the viale that leads up to the balustraded overlook from the Pincio (above, right).\nAn Egyptian obelisk of Sety I (later erected by Rameses II) from Heliopolis stands in the centre of the Piazza.  Three sides of the obelisk were carved during the reign of Sety I and the fourth side, under Rameses II. The obelisk, known as the Flaminio Obelisk or the Popolo Obelisk, is the second oldest and one of the tallest obelisks in Rome (some 24 m high, or 36 m including its plinth). The obelisk was brought to Rome in 10 BC by order of Augustus and originally set up in the Circus Maximus. It was re-erected here in the piazza by the architect-engineer Domenico Fontana in 1589 as part of the urban plan of Sixtus V. The piazza also formerly contained a central fountain, which was moved to the Piazza Nicosia in 1818, when fountains, in the form of Egyptian-style lions, were added around the base of the obelisk.Looking from the north (illustration, right), three streets branch out from the piazza into the city, forming the so-called \"trident\" (il Tridente): the Via del Corso in the centre; the Via del Babuino to the left (opened in 1525 as the Via Paolina) and the Via di Ripetta (opened by Leo X in 1518 as the Via Leonina) to the right. The twin churches (the chiese gemelle) of Santa Maria dei Miracoli (1681) and Santa Maria in Montesanto (1679), begun by Carlo Rainaldi and completed by Bernini and Carlo Fontana, define the junctions of the roads. Close scrutiny of the twin churches reveals that they are not mere copies of one another, as they would have been in a Neoclassical project, but vary in their details, offering variety within their symmetrical balance in Baroque fashion.\nThe central street, now known as the Via del Corso, was the ancient Via Lata, and to the north it links with the ancient Roman road, the Via Flaminia, beyond the city gate and southwards, to the Piazza Venezia (formerly the Piazza San Marco), the Capitol and the forum. The Via di Ripetta leads past the Mausoleum of Augustus to the River Tiber, where the Baroque riverside landing called the Porto di Ripetta was located until it was destroyed in the late 19th century. The Via del Babuino (\"Baboon\"), linking to Piazza di Spagna, takes its name from a grotesque sculpture of Silenus that gained the popular name of \"the Baboon\".\nTo the north of the piazza stands the Porta del Popolo, beyond which lies the Piazzale Flaminio and the start of the Via Flaminia. The gateway was reworked to give its current appearance by Bernini for Pope Alexander VII in 1655, to welcome Queen Christina of Sweden to Rome following her conversion to Roman Catholicism and her abdication.   Opposite Santa Maria del Popolo stands a Carabinieri station, with a dome reflecting that of the church.\n\nIn his urbanistic project, Valadier constructed the matching palazzi that provide a frame for the scenography of the twin churches and hold down two corners of his composition. He positioned a third palazzo to face these and matched a low structure screening the flank of Santa Maria del Popolo, with its fine Early Renaissance fa\u00e7ade, together holding down the two northern corners. Valadier outlined this newly defined oval forecourt to the city of Rome with identical sweeps of wall, forming curving exedra-like spaces. Behind the western one, a screen of trees masks the unassorted fronts of buildings beyond.\n\n\n=== Fountains ===\n\nThe aqueduct carrying the Acqua Vergine Nuovo was completed in the 1820s, and its water provided the opportunity for fountains and their basins that offered the usual public water supply for the rioneor urban district. Ever since the Renaissance such terminal fountains also provided an occasion for the grand terminal water show called in Rome a mostra or a show. \"What makes a fountain a mostra is not essentially its size or splendor, but its specific designation as the fountain that is a public memorial to the whole achievement of the aqueduct.\" Valadier had planned  fountains in the upper tier of the Pincio slope, but these were not carried out, in part for lack of water.Fountains by Giovanni Ceccarini (1822\u201323), with matching compositions of a central figure flanked by two attendant figures, stand on each side of the piazza to the east and west, flanked by neoclassical statues of The Seasons (1828).  The Fontana del Nettuno (Fountain of Neptune)  stands on the west side, Neptune with his trident is accompanied by two tritons. Rome between the Tiber and the Aniene on the east side, against the steep slope of the Pincio, represents the terminal  mostra of the aqueduct. Dea Roma armed with lance and helmet, and in front is the she-wolf feeding Romulus and Remus.At the center of the piazza is the Fontana dell' Obelisco: a  group of four mini fountains, each comprising a lion on a stepped plinth,  surround the obelisk.\n\n\n== Urbanisation in three dimensions ==\n\nValadier's masterstroke was in linking the piazza with the heights of the Pincio, the Pincian Hill of ancient Rome, which overlooked the space from the east. He swept away informally terraced gardens that belonged to the Augustinian monastery connected with Santa Maria del Popolo. In its place he created a carriage drive that doubled back upon itself and pedestrian steps leading up beside a waterfall to the Pincio park, where a balustraded lookout, supported by a triple-arched nymphaeum is backed by a wide gravelled opening set on axis with the piazza below; formally planted bosquets of trees flank the open space. The planted Pincio in turn provides a link to the Villa Borghese gardens.\nUntil quite recently, the Piazza del Popolo was choked with traffic in a sea of car parking. Today, it is a pedestrian zone.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nVia Margutta\n\n\n== References ==\nGiedion, Siegfried, Space, Time and Architecture pp. 151\u201354\nThais-Rome: Fountains\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoberto Piperno \"Piazza del Popolo\"\nRiccardo Cigola, \"Piazza del Popolo\"\nPiazza del Popolo\nRome and Piazza del Popolo\nHigh-resolution 360\u00b0 Panoramas and Images of Piazza del Popolo | Art Atlas",

        "wiki": "The Victor Emmanuel II National Monument (Italian: Monumento Nazionale a Vittorio Emanuele II) or (mole del) Vittoriano, called Altare della Patria (English: Altar of the Fatherland), is a national monument built in honour of Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of a unified Italy, located in Rome, Italy. It occupies a site between the Piazza Venezia and the Capitoline Hill. It is currently managed by the Polo Museale del Lazio and is owned by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities.\nFrom an architectural perspective, it was conceived as a modern forum, an agora on three levels connected by stairways and dominated by a portico characterized by a colonnade. The complex process of national unity and liberation from foreign domination carried out by King Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy, to whom the monument is dedicated, has a great symbolic and representative value, being architecturally and artistically centred on the Italian unification\u2014for this reason the Vittoriano is considered one of the national symbols of Italy.\nIt also preserves the Altar of the Fatherland (Italian: Altare della Patria), first an altar of the goddess Rome, then also a shrine of the Italian Unknown Soldier, thus adopting the function of a lay temple consecrated to Italy. Because of its great representative value, the entire Vittoriano is often called the Altare della Patria, although the latter constitutes only a part of the monument.\nLocated in the centre of ancient Rome, and connected to the modern one by the streets that radiate from Piazza Venezia, it has been consecrated to a wide symbolic value representing a lay temple metaphorically dedicated to a free and united Italy\u2014celebrating by virtue the burial of the Unknown Soldier (the sacrifice for the homeland and for the connected ideals).\n\n\n== General description ==\n\nThe Vittoriano is located on the hill of the Capitoline Hill, in the symbolic centre of ancient Rome, and is connected to the modern one thanks to roads that radiate from Piazza Venezia.Its design is a neoclassical interpretation of the Roman Forum. It features stairways, Corinthian columns, fountains, an equestrian sculpture of Victor Emmanuel II, and two statues of the goddess Victoria riding on quadrigas. On its summit there would have been a majestic portico characterized by a long colonnade and two imposing propylaea, one dedicated to the \"unity of the homeland\", and the other to the \"freedom of the citizens\", concepts metaphorically linked to the figure of Victor Emmanuel II.The base houses the museum of Italian Unification, and in 2007, a lift was added to the structure, allowing visitors to ride up to the roof for 360-degree views of Rome. This terrace, which is the highest of the monument, can also be reached via 196 steps that start from the portico.The structure is 135 m (443 ft) wide, 130 m (427 ft) deep, and 70 m (230 ft) high. If the quadrigae and Winged Victorys are included, the height reaches 81 m (266 ft). It has a total area of 17,550 m2 (188,907 sq ft) and possesses, due to the conspicuous development of the interior spaces, a floor area of 717,000 m2 (7,717,724 sq ft).One of the architecturally predominant elements of the Vittoriano are the external staircases, which are constituted in the complex by 243 steps, and the portico situated on the top of the monument, which is inserted between two lateral propylaea. The entrance stairway is 41 m (135 ft) wide and 34 m (112 ft) long, the terrace where the Altar of the Fatherland is located is 66 m (217 ft) wide. The maximum depth of the Vittoriano underground reaches 17 m (56 ft) below street level. The colonnade is formed by columns 15 m (49 ft) high and the length of the porch is 72 m (236 ft).\n\nThe allegories of the monument mostly represent the virtues and feelings, very often rendered as personifications, also according to the canons of the neoclassical style, which animate the Italians during the Italian unification, or from the revolutions of 1820 to the capture of Rome (1870), through which national unity was achieved. Due to the complex process of unification undertaken by Victor Emmanuel II throughout the second half of the 19th Century, the Italians gave him the epithet of Father of the Fatherland (Italian: Padre della Patria). The only non-allegorical work is the equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II, which is the architectural centre of the Vittoriano.\n\nThe monument, as a whole, appears as a sort of marble covering on the northern slope of the Capitoline Hill: it was therefore thought of as a place where it is possible to make an uninterrupted patriotic walk (the path does not in fact have an architectural end, given that the entrances to the highest part are two, one for each propylaeus) among the works present, which almost all have allegorical meanings linked to the history of Italy. Different are the vegetal symbols present, among which the palm, which recalls the \"victory\", the oak (the \"strength\"), the laurel (the \"victorious peace\"), the myrtle (the \"sacrifice\") and the olive tree (the \"concord\").From a stylistic perspective, the architecture and works of art that embellish the Vittoriano have been conceived with the aim of creating a \"national style\" to be replicated in other areas. It was designed to communicate the imperial splendours of ancient Rome. Above all, for the realization of the Vittoriano, Giuseppe Sacconi took inspiration from the Neoclassical architecture\u2014the reborn heir of the classical Greek and Roman architecture, on which Italic elements were grafted and eclectic influences added.The Vittoriano is regarded as a national symbol of Italy and every year it hosts important national celebrations. The largest annual celebrations are Liberation Day (April 25), Republic Day (June 2), and Armed Forces Day (November 4). During these celebrations, the President of Italy and the highest government officials pay tribute to the Italian Unknown Soldier and those who died in the line of duty by laying a laurel wreath.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter the death of Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy on January 9, 1878, many initiatives were destined to raise a permanent monument that celebrated the first king of a united Italy, creator of the process of unification and liberation from foreign domination, which is indicated by historiography as \"Father of the Fatherland\" also due to the political work of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of Sardinia Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour and to the military contribution of Giuseppe Garibaldi. The goal was therefore to commemorate the entire Italian unification season (\"Risorgimento\") through one of its protagonists.For this purpose, the Italian government approved the construction of a monumental complex on the Northern side of Rome's Capitoline Hill. The monument would celebrate the legacy of the first king of a united Italy and would become a symbol of national patriotism. The project was realized by Giuseppe Sacconi in 1885, in an eclectic style.The project by Giuseppe Sacconi was inspired by the Hellenistic sanctuaries, such as the Pergamon Altar and the Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia in Palestrina. The Vittoriano was conceived as a vast and modern forum open to citizens, situated on a sort of elevated square in the historic centre of Rome organized as an agora on three levels connected by tiers, with conspicuous spaces reserved for strolling visitors.\n\nTo erect the Vittoriano it was necessary, between the last months of 1884 and 1899, to proceed with numerous expropriations and extensive demolitions of the buildings that were located in the construction area. The place chosen was in the heart of the historic centre of Rome and was therefore occupied by ancient buildings arranged according to urban planning that dated back to the Middle Ages. This was considered necessary because the Vittoriano should have been built in the heart of the historic centre of Rome, in a modern urban context, in front of a new large square (the future Piazza Venezia), which at the time was just a narrow open space in front of Palazzo Venezia.The general objective was also to make Rome a modern European capital that rivaled Berlin, Vienna, London and Paris overcoming the centuries-old pontifical town planning. In this context, the Vittoriano would have been the equivalent of the Brandenburg Gate of Berlin, the Admiralty Arch of London and the Op\u00e9ra Garnier of Paris; these buildings are all united by a monumental and classical aspect that metaphorically communicates pride and the power of the nation that erected them.It would then become one of the symbols of the new Italy, joining the monuments of ancient Rome and those of the popes' Rome. Having then been conceived as a large public square, the Vittoriano, in addition to representing a memorial dedicated to Victor Emmanuel II, was invested with another role\u2014a modern forum dedicated to the new free and united Italy.\n\nEstablished Italian sculptors, such as Leonardo Bistolfi, Manfredo Manfredi, Giulio Monteverde, Francesco Jerace, Augusto Rivalta, Lodovico Pogliaghi, Pietro Canonica, Ettore Ximenes, Adolfo Apolloni, Mario Rutelli and Angelo Zanelli, made its sculptures nationwide. It was inaugurated on June 4, 1911, and completed in 1935. The partly completed monument was inaugurated on June 4, 1911, on the occasion of the Turin International world's fair and the 50th anniversary of Italian unification. Construction continued throughout the first half of the 20th Century; in 1921 the body of the Italian Unknown Soldier was placed in the crypt under the statue of goddess Roma, and in 1935, the monument was fully completed amidst the inauguration of the Museo Centrale del Risorgimento Italiano.The decision to include an altar dedicated to the homeland in the Vittoriano was taken by Giuseppe Sacconi only after the planning phase, during the construction of the monument. The place and the dominant subject were immediately chosen, being a large statue of the goddess Rome that would have been placed on the first terrace after the entrance to the monument, just below the equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II. Thus, the Altar of the Fatherland, at least initially and before the burial of the body of the Unknown Soldier, was thought of as a chapel of the deity. In this way, the greatness and majesty of Rome was celebrated, elected to the role of legitimate capital of Italy. Within the Vittoriano are numerous artistic works that recall the history of ancient Rome.\n\nAfter the First World War the Vittoriano was chosen to house the tomb of the Unknown Soldier, or the burial of an Italian soldier who died during the First World War whose identity remains unknown due to the serious injuries that made the body unrecognizable, which represents all the Italian soldiers who died during the wars. The reason for his strong symbolism lies in the metaphorical transition from the figure of the soldier to that of the people and finally to that of the nation. This transition between increasingly broader and generic concepts is due to the indistinct traits of the non-identification of the soldier.The Vittoriano was thus consecrated to a wide symbolic value representing a lay temple metaphorically dedicated to a free and united Italy\u2014celebrating by virtue the burial of the Unknown Soldier (the sacrifice for the homeland and for the connected ideals).With the rise of Fascism in 1922, the Vittoriano became the setting for the military parades of the authoritarian regime of Benito Mussolini. After World War II, with the institution of the Italian Republic in 1946, the monument was stripped of all its Fascist symbols and reassumed its original function as a secular temple dedicated to the Italian nation and its people. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, however, its significance as a symbol of national identity started to decline as the public opinion started to perceive it as a cumbersome relic representing a nation superseded by its own history. At the turn of the 21st century, Italy's President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi pushed for a revaluation of national symbols of Italy, including the Vittoriano.\n\n\n== Tomb of Unknown Soldier ==\n\nThe monument holds the Tomb of the Italian Unknown Soldier with an eternal flame, built under the statue of goddess Roma after World War I following an idea of General Giulio Douhet. The body of the unknown soldier was chosen on 28 October 1921 from among 11 unknown remains by Maria Bergamas, a woman from Gradisca d'Isonzo whose only child was killed during World War I. Her son's body was never recovered. The selected unknown was transferred from Aquileia, where the ceremony with Bergamas had taken place, to Rome and buried in a state funeral on 4 November 1921.His tomb is a symbolic shrine that represents all the fallen and missing of the war. The side of the tomb of the Unknown Soldier that gives outward at the Altar of the Fatherland is always guarded by a guard of honour and two flames that burn perpetually in braziers. The guard is provided with military personnel of the various weapons of the Italian Armed Forces, which alternate every ten years.The allegorical meaning of the perpetually burning flames is linked to their symbolism, which is centuries old, since it has its origins in classical antiquity, especially in the cult of the dead. A fire that burns eternally symbolizes the memory, in this case of the sacrifice of the Unknown Soldier moved by patriotic love, and his everlasting memory of the Italians, even in those who are far from their country. The two perennial braziers next to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is placed a plaque whose text reads \"Italians Abroad to the Motherland\" in memory of donations made by Italian emigrants between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century for the construction of the Vittoriano.\n\n\n== The names by which the Vittoriano is known ==\n\nThe Victor Emmanuel II National Monument is indicated with two other names: \"(Mole del) Vittoriano\" and \"Altare della Patria\", which are now the most used names to call the monument.From 1921, when the Unknown Soldier was buried under the statue of the goddess Rome in the part of the Vittoriano that is called \"Altare della Patria\", the expression began to indicate not only the place of burial of the soldier, or the personification of all the fallen and lost in war, but the whole structure due to the strong popular sentiment for the symbolic Unknown Soldier.\n\n\n== Vittoriano plan ==\n\n\n== Architectural and artistic works ==\n\n\n=== The fountains of the two seas ===\n\nSet against the external base of the Vittoriano, on the sides of the entrance to Piazza Venezia, are the \"fountains of the two seas\" which are dedicated to the Adriatic sea and the Tyrrhenian Sea. Both are inserted in a flower bed and possess, from the beginning, a hydraulic system that recycles the water avoiding waste. Historically, a 500,000 litres (130,000 US gal) water cistern was also active, then abandoned, located in the basement of the monument. The two fountains therefore represent the two major Italian seas and, therefore, in this perspective the Vittoriano is assimilated to the Italian Peninsula. This way the whole country is represented, even geographically.\n\n\n=== External staircases and terraces ===\nThe exterior staircases of the Vittoriano adapt to the ascending sides of the northern slope of the Capitoline Hill and lead, starting from the entrance of Piazza Venezia, to the terrace of the Altar of the Fatherland, then to the terrace of the redeemed cities (the one immediately below the colonnade of the portico), and finally to the terraces of the two propylaea flanked by the portico constituting the two entrances.\n\nAt the entrance, is an imposing staircase leading to the terrace of the Altar of the Fatherland and of the Italian Unknown Soldier, which represent the first raised platform of the Vittoriano, as well as its symbolic centre. The path along the staircase continues even beyond the tomb of the Unknown Soldier to symbolically represent a continuous and uninterrupted procession of Italians that continues its walk up to the highest point of the construction\u2014the portico and the propylaea.The artistic gate of access to the Vittoriano, which is the work of Manfredo Manfredi, has the particularity of being \"hidden\", that is, of being able to slide vertically underground due to tracks. The plant that allows the lowering of the railing, originally hydraulic, was considered at the time of its construction among the most technologically advanced in the world. The entrance gate has a length of 40 m (131 ft) and a weight of 10,500 tons.On both sides of the entrance stairway, are a series of sculptures that accompany the visitor towards the Altar of the Fatherland. The first sculptures that meet are two sculptured groups in gilded bronze, with subjects inspired by the thought of Giuseppe Mazzini, The Thought and The Action (respectively, to the left and right of the staircase for those coming from Piazza Venezia), followed by two sculptural groups (also in this case one on each side) depicting as many Winged Lions and finally, on the top of the staircase, before the beginning of the terrace of the Altar of the Fatherland, two Winged Victorys.The Thought and The Action have been fundamental in the Italian unification process, as they are necessary to change the course of history and to transform a society. The overall shape of the two sculptural groups recalls the intrinsic characteristics of the two concepts: The Action has a triangular and angular profile, while The Thought has a circular shape.\n\nThe two Winged Lions represent the initiation of the patriots who decide to join the Italian unification enterprise motivated by ardor and strength, which also control their instinctive side\u2014otherwise the patriots would slide towards the obfuscation of their abilities if the instinct were left completely free. The Winged Victories, in addition to recalling the military and cultural successes of the Roman era, symbolize allegorically the good luck of national unity.At the end of the entrance stairway, immediately after the statues of the Winged Victories, opens the terrace of the Altar of the Fatherland, the first raised platform of the Vittoriano, which is dominated centrally by the statue of the goddess Rome and the shrine of the Unknown Soldier. On the terrace of the Altar of the Fatherland are also the Botticino marble sculptural groups that symbolize the moral values of the Italians, or the ideal principles that make the nation firm. The four groups have a height of 6 m (20 ft) and are located to the right and left of the entrance to the terrace of the Altar of the Fatherland (two on each side), sideways to the statues of The Thought and of The Action and in correspondence of the fountains of two seas, along the parapets that overlook Piazza Venezia. The concepts expressed by these four sculptural groups, The Force, The Concord, The Sacrifice and The Right, are the tangible emanation of The Thought and The Action.\n\nAt the sides of the Altar of the Fatherland, the staircase resumes dividing into two symmetrical ramps parallel to the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Both reach a pronaos where two large doors open (one on each side, both positioned symmetrically and laterally to the Unknown Soldier, and each in correspondence with one of the two propylaea) that lead to the interior spaces of the Vittoriano. Above each door are two statues; on the left door are The Politics and The Philosophy, while on the right door are two statues depicting The War and The Revolution.From the two shelves where the doors open to give access to the interior spaces, two further flights of stairs start that converge, directly behind the Altar of the Fatherland, towards the base of the equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II\u2014the latter is located on the second large elevated platform, in order of height, of the Vittoriano. Behind it, the stairway resumes its ascent in the direction of the portico, reaching a small shelf, from which two staircases start laterally leading to the entrance of a propylaeum. Before reaching the entrances of the propylaea, each of the two staircases is interrupted, creating a small intermediate shelf, which allows access to the terrace of the redeemed cities\u2014the third large and last elevated platform of the Vittoriano\u2014directly behind the equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II and immediately below the colonnade of the portico.The redeemed cities are those united to Italy following the Treaty of Rapallo (1920) and the Treaty of Rome (1924), peace agreements at the end of the First World War. These municipalities are Trieste, Trento, Gorizia, Pola, Fiume and Zara. Following the Paris treaties of 1947, Pola, Fiume and Zara moved on to Yugoslavia and, after the dissolution of the latter, to Croatia. After the conflict, Gorizia was divided into two parts\u2014one part remained in Italy while the other, which was renamed \"Nova Gorica\", passed first to Yugoslavia and then to Slovenia. Each redeemed city is represented by an altar against the back wall, which bears the corresponding municipal coat of arms. The six altars were placed on the terrace between 1929 and 1930.\n\nAt the centre of the row of altars of the redeemed cities, engraved on the stylobate, is a monumental inscription carved on the occasion of the solemn ceremony of the Unknown Soldier (4 November 1921) which contains the text of the Victory Bulletin, an official document written after the Armistice of Villa Giusti with which the general Armando Diaz, supreme commander of the Royal Army, announced, on 4 November 1918, the surrender of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the victory of Italy in the First World War.At the base of the text of the Victory Bulletin are two other altars similar to those of the redeemed cities but which have, instead of the municipal coat of arms of the municipalities, a helmet\u2014these two altars bear the inscription \"Et Facere Fortia\" on the left alter and \"Et Pati Fortia\" on the right alter. They echo the Latin phrase et facere et pati fortia Romanum est (\"It is the attribute of a Roman to perform as well as to suffer mighty things\") written by Livy in the History of Rome, book 11; in the work the phrase is pronounced by Scaevola towards Lars Porsena.\n\n\n=== The Altar of the Fatherland ===\n\nThe Altar of the Fatherland is the most famous part of the Vittoriano and is the one with which it is often identified. Located on the top of the entrance stairway, it was designed by the Brescian sculptor Angelo Zanelli, who won a competition specially held in 1906. It is formed from the side of the Tomb of Italian Unknown Soldier that faces the outside of the building (the other side, which faces inside the Vittoriano, is located in a crypt), from the sacellum of the statue of the goddess Rome (which is exactly above the tomb of the Unknown Soldier) and two vertical marble reliefs that descend from the edges of the aedicula containing the statue of the goddess Rome and which run downwards laterally to the tomb of the Unknown Soldier.The statue of the goddess Roma present at the Vittoriano interrupted a custom in vogue until the 19th century, by which the representation of this subject was with exclusively warlike traits. Angelo Zanelli, in his work, decided to further characterize the statue by also providing the reference to Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and the arts, as well as of war. The great statue of the deity emerges from a golden background. The presence of the goddess Roma in the Vittoriano underlines the irremissible will of the Unification of Italy patriots to have the Rome as the capital of Italy, an essential concept, according to the common feeling, from the history of the peninsula and the islands of Italian culture.The general conception of the bas-reliefs located laterally to the statue of the goddess Rome, one to his left and the other to his right, recalls Virgil's Bucolics and Georgics, which complete the triptych of the Altar of the Fatherland with the statue of the Roman divinity.The allegorical meaning of the bas-reliefs that are inspired by the works of Virgil is linked to the desire to conceptually render the Italian soul. In the Georgics, the reference to the Aeneid is in fact present, and in both the works the industriousness in the work of the Italians is recalled.The bas-relief on the left of the Altar of the Fatherland represents the Triumph of Labour and the one on the right symbolizes the Triumph of the Patriotic Love where both converge scenically towards the statue of the goddess Rome.\n\n\n=== The equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II ===\n\nAfter the Altar of the Fatherland is the equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II, a bronze work by Enrico Chiaradia and architectural centre of the Vittoriano. The personifications of the noble Italian cities are carved on the marble base of the statue. The statue is bronze, 12 m (39 ft) high, 10 m (33 ft) long, and weighs 50 tons. Including the marble base, the entire sculptural group is 24.80 m (81 ft) high.The equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II is the only non-symbolic representation of the Vittoriano, given that it is the representation of the homonymous monarch. In classical antiquity the equestrian statues were aimed at the exaltation of the portrayed subject, whose warlike virtues were emphasized. Furthermore, riding and controlling a steed, the character's ability to control primordial instincts was communicated\u2014in this way, the subject was also recognized as civic virtues.Also the placement of the statue at the architectural centre of the Vittoriano, above the Altar of the Fatherland and in front of the colonnade of the portico, is not fortuitous\u2014in classical antiquity the equestrian statues were often situated in front of colonnades, public squares, temples or along the triumphal streets; in places, therefore, fundamental for their centrality. Finally, the presence of the basement on which the personifications of the noble cities are carved is linked to the same archaic traditions.\n\n\n=== Statues of noble cities ===\nOn the base of the equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II are sculptural depictions of 14 Italian noble cities, or rather the capitals of Italian states founded before the Savoy monarchy.They aren't the statues of the most important cities in Italy, but of those that were once capitals of ancient Italian pre-unification monarchies, all of which are precedent and therefore historically converging towards the Savoy monarchy\u2014for this reason they are considered \"mothers noble\"s of Unification of Italy.The 14 sculptural representations of the noble cities are deliberately placed at the base of the equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II, which metaphorically symbolizes the nature of historical foundations of Italy. In a broader sense, they also represent the concept that the unity of the homeland, as a whole, rests on a basis constituted by the municipalities. Unlike those dedicated to the regions of Italy, the statues depicting the 14 cities are all the work of the same sculptor, Eugenio Maccagnani.\n\n\n=== The portico and the propylaea ===\n\nContinuing to climb the stairway beyond the equestrian statue of Victor Emmnauel II, is the most imposing and striking architectonic element\u2014the large portico with Corinthian-style columns, slightly curved, located on the top of the monument, and inserted between two temple propylaea called \"sommoportico\" due to its elevated position. The propylaea are the two small porticos projecting with respect to the portico which are located at its lateral ends that constitute the entrances.The portico is 72 m (236 ft) long and is centrally supported by 16 15 m (49 ft) tall columns surmounted by Corinthian capitals, embellished by the face of the Italia turrita (located in the centre) and acanthus leaves. The cornice above the colonnade is instead decorated with statues representing the 16 allegorical personifications of the Italian regions where each statue corresponds to a column. Giuseppe Sacconi was inspired by the Temple of Castor and Pollux located in the Roman Forum near the Vittoriano.\n\nEach propylaeum has a bronze statue depicting quadrigae, each one hosting a Winged Victory. The architectural and expressive synergies of the triumphal arches are thus re-proposed\u2014the allegorical meaning of the \"quadriga\", since ancient times, is in fact that of success. This concept is reinforced by the presence of the Winged Victories, messengers descended from heaven by the divinities who flank the winner of a military battle as their favourite.The two quadrigae, as the Latin inscriptions placed on the pediments of the underlying propylaea expressly declare, symbolize the freedom of the citizens (\"Civium Libertati\", right) and the unity of the homeland (\"Patriae Unitati\", left), the two concepts pivots that inform the entire monument and are attributed to the sovereign Victor Emmmanuel II. The implicit message is that Italy, once again a single political group and gained independence, leaving behind the glories of Rome and the pomp of the papal court, is ready to spread a new Italian Renaissance articulated on the moral virtues represented allegorically in the Vittoriano.\n\nThe concepts \"freedom of citizens\" and \"unity of the homeland\" also summarize the fundamental themes that characterized the beginning and the end of the contribution given by Victor Emmanuel II to the Unification of Italy. Having ascended the throne for a few months, he published the proclamation of Moncalieri (20 November 1849) which confirmed the survival of the liberal regime even in the repressive period following the wave of revolutions of 1848. His political work had ended with the capture of Rome (20 September 1870), which became the capital, although the unification of Trentino-Alto Adige and Julian March (annexed only in 1919 after the First World War) were still missing. The quadrigas, already planned in the original project, were built and positioned in 1927. Inside the pediments of the two propylaea are sculptural groups that have the same theme as the respective quadrigas above.The interior spaces of the portico and the propylaea can be accessed through two triumphal entrance stairways located at each propylaeum. The two entrance staircases are located on a small shelf that can be reached via a short staircase that joins the terrace of the redeemed cities. At the base of the entrance stairway of the propylaea are located four statues of Winged Victories on triumphal columns, made in 1911\u2014two are at the entrance to the right propylea, and two at the entrance to the left propylea.\n\nEach entrance leads to a large quadrangular vestibule, in dialogue with the outside due to a colonnade, and from the vestibules one enters the interior spaces of the portico. These rooms are decorated with mosaics, important works of floral Liberty and pictorial symbolism, which cover the lunettes and the two domes of the propylaea. Even the mosaics have as their subject the metaphorical representation of virtues and feelings, very often rendered as allegorical personifications, which animated Italians during the unification of Italy. The interiors of the portico are decorated with the allegories of the sciences, while the doors that connect the propylaea and the portico are embellished with depictions on the arts.The decoration of the ceiling of the left propylaeum was entrusted to Giulio Bargellini; in these mosaics he adopted innovative technical devices, such as the use of materials of various kinds and tiles of different sizes and inclined so as to create studied reflections of light, and where the lines of the mosaic representations continue towards those of the columns below. The mosaics of Bargellini, along the highest part of the walls, represent figuratively The Faith, The Force, The Work and The Wisdom. The decoration of the ceiling of the right propylaeum was instead entrusted to Antonio Rizzi. Rizzi dedicated himself, along the highest part of the vertical walls, to The Law, The Value, The Peace, The Union and The Poetry.\nThe internal doors leading from the two propylaea to the portico are decorated with allegorical sculptures representing The Architecture and The Music, which are found in the vestibule on the left and which are the work of Antonio Garella, and The Painting and The Sculpture, which are located in the vestibule on the right and which were made by Lio Gangeri. The interior of the portico has a polychrome marble floor and a coffered ceiling\u2014the latter of which was designed by Gaetano Koch, is called the \"ceiling of the sciences\".The ceiling owes its name to the bronze sculptures of Giuseppe Tonnini placed inside the portico, collectively known as The Allegories of The Sciences. They are all made up of female personifications: The Geometry, The Chemistry, The Physics, The Mineralogy, The Mechanics, The Astronomy and The Geography. The vertical wall opposite the columns is decorated at the top with mosaics at gilded backgrounds, after 1925. Other sculptures present inside the portico are the trophy of arms\u2014a vast set of shields, cuirasses, halberds, spears, flags, arrows and quivers in a trophy the crown of Italy is shown, along with the eagle with the crusader shield and the collar of the Annunciation (emblems of the House of Savoy).\n\n\n=== The statues of the regions ===\nThe staircase leading to the terrace of the redeemed cities is the best point of observation of the statues of the Italian regions, since the latter are found on the cornice of the portico, each in correspondence of a column. The presence of metaphorically depicting statues of the Italian regions is inspired by the allegorical personifications of the Roman provinces, often placed on commemorative monuments during the imperial era. The number of statues placed on the top of the portico is equal to 16, given that at the time of the drafting of the construction project, 16 Italian regions were identified. Each statue is 5 m (16 ft) high and was entrusted to a different sculptor who were almost always native to the region of which he would have carved the image. The cornice is also embellished with friezes consisting of eagles and lion heads.\n\n\n=== The internal crypt of the Unknown Soldier ===\n\nThe crypt of the Italian Unknown Soldier is located under the equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II which can be accessed from the Shrine of the Flags museum, from where it is possible to see the side of the shrine of the Unknown Soldier that faces towards the interior spaces of the Vittoriano. It is therefore located at the Altar of the Fatherland, from which the side of the tomb that faces towards the outside of the building is seen instead.The crypt of the Unknown Soldier is the work of the architect Armando Brasini. It is a room in the shape of a Greek cross with a domed vault which is accessed via two flights of stairs. A short tunnel starts from the crypt and reaches the niche of the chapel of the Unknown Soldier. The niche is inserted in an arcosolium inspired by the style of early Christian buildings, especially the catacombs. The ceiling of the crypt instead recalls the Roman architecture, alternating cross vaults and barrel vaults. The room, built using bricks, is characterized by the presence of round arches and niches. There is also a small altar for religious services.The walls of the crypt are decorated with a mosaic of Byzantine style, by Giulio Bargellini, of a religious nature. The crucifixion of Jesus is located above the tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where, on the walls, stand the patron saints of the Italian Armed Forces: Saint Martin patron of the infantry, Saint George of the cavalry, Saint Sebastian of the local police and Saint Barbara of the Italian Navy, bomb squad and military engineers. Finally, in the dome, is the Madonna of Loreto, patron saint of the Italian Air Force.Parts of the crypt and sepulcher were made with stone materials from the mountains that were the scene of battles of the First World War, with the floor made of Karst marble, and the small altar made from a single block of stone from Monte Grappa.\n\n\n== Museums ==\n\nInside the Vittoriano are some museums dedicated to the history of Italy, especially the Unification of Italy (\"Risorgimento\"): the Central Museum of the Risorgimento (Italian: Museo Centrale del Risorgimento) with an adjoining study institute, the Flag of Italy Memorial (Italian: Sacrario delle bandiere) and an area that hosts temporary exhibitions of artistic interest, historical, sociological and cultural called \"ala Brasini\".Access to the Central Museum of the Risorgimento is on the left side of the monument, at the back of the Santa Maria in Ara Coeli along via di San Pietro in Carcere. The period of Italian history between the end of the 18th century and the First World War is displayed by memorabilia, paintings, sculptures, documents (letters, diaries and manuscripts), drawings, engravings, weapons and prints.\n\nOn the entrance stairway of the Central Museum of the Risorgimento are visible engravings related to some significant episodes for the birth of the Risorgimento movement, from the seed thrown by the French Revolution to the Napoleonic Wars, in order to better frame and remember the national history included between the reform of the ancient Italian states and the end of the First World War. Along the walls, other marble engravings show some pieces of texts enunciated by prominent personalities, which better testify and describe this part of Italian history.The Central Museum of the Risorgimento also includes the Shrine of the Flags, a museum where the war flags of dissolved military units and decommissioned ships from the Italian Army, Italian Air Force, Italian Navy, Carabinieri, Polizia di Stato, Penitentiary Police and Guardia di Finanza are collected and temporarily stored. In case a unit is reformed, the flags are retrieved by the unit. Access to the shrine is located along Via dei Fori Imperiali, where memorabilia, relating mainly to the Risorgimento wars, in which the Italian Armed Forces took part, are also kept.The \"ala Brasini\", reserved for temporary exhibitions, is dedicated to Armando Brasini, the main promoter of the Central Museum. The wing has three exhibition rooms: the \"large exhibition hall\", with a surface area of 700 m2 (7,535 sq ft), generally hosts art exhibitions, and those that require more space, the \"central hall\" of 400 m2 (4,306 sq ft) and the \"jubilee hall\" of 150 m2 (1,615 sq ft), are used.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMaps and aerial photos - Google Maps\nI Simboli della Repubblica - Il Vittoriano",

          "You can't really begin to believe how big this monument is... You can see it from pretty much anywhere (sort of speak) - maybe too big. We didn't go up, but considering the location and height, the view must be incredible. You can then go the Colosseum taking the left street,",

          "This monument is amazing! You must visit when in Rome. Make sure to go in panoramic lift on the way out. You have to pay extra but definitely worth it for the ultimate view of ROMA",

          "It is so amazing! We could see it from our balcony blocks away. Even more impressive when the outside is lit up at night. But we did not have an opportunity to explore inside because of a lack of time and they apparently do not have early morning or evening hours.",
          "Despite not being 2,000 years old, this monument is impressive. It can be seen from almost anywhere in Rome, much to chagrin many locals and tourists alike. It is free to enter, but there is not inexpensive cost to ride the elevator to the top for a panoramic view of the city.",

          "This was our last site to visit during our 6-day trip and I'm glad we we went. Beautiful building, free entrance and stunning views from the top. Unfortunately, the elevator to the very top was under maintenance however, access to the 5th floors is also free and prvoide awesome",
          "The imposing monument to the first King of unified Italy sits at the foot of the Capitoline Hill next to Piazza Venetia. A grand staircase leads to an oval platform bearing an equestrian statue of the King on a pedestal. Behind it and further up is a marble colonnade which would",
          "This monument has a real presence in the centre of Rome. Admittedly I missed this entirely on my first visit to the city, being sidetracked by the bigger historical attractions. Visiting it gives you unique view point of the rest of the sights. It is easily accessible located",
          "This is one of my absolute favourite monuments in Rome and I was very pleasantly surprised to find out that the section that contains the tomb of the unknown soldier is free to visit, with a video from the time of construction of the building and explanatory board to go with it.",

          "Of all the buildings in Rome, this one stands out as the most impressive. It is huge. It is white marble. It is not old, constructed in the late 1800s. But it is done in a style of Ancient Rome. If Ancient Rome had builds like this, which they did, you can fully appreciate the",
          "Impressive monument and you cannot miss it as it is very close to the Colosseum. We liked it. Pass by after dark to see the eternal flames burning",
          "Very impressive building from a distance and up close. Worth the visit to get a view from the steps. Lots of crowds but you can find the space to take pictures of the architecture. Free to enter the grounds. Definite recommend.",
          "This site is free to access and is basically a monument to Italy's armed forces. Views from the roof terrace are great.",
          "You won\u2019t miss it! It\u2019s large, grandiose, imposing, and makes an impression. Minus one star for the throngs of obnoxious tourists CONSTANTLY posing for selfies in front of it.",
          "My favourite thing we went to see in Rome. It really is amazing and a beautiful site to see. The view from the top across Rome is one of a kind. Well worth a visit.",
          "The day we visited there was a mass demonstration outside (in front of the alter) for combating the effects of climate change. The motley ensemble of youth with placards in front of the massive war memorial made for jarring yet enticing composition.",
          "We never realized there is a sky lift which brings you too the top with great 360c views of the city! To make it even better it was free the day we visited and the que took only about 5mins. The building while modern in Roman terms is very impressive. We would highly",
          "Located within walking distance of the Colosseum is the equally grand Altare Della Patria otherwise known as Vittoriano. Building commenced in 1885 and the end product is glazed in fine marble. The views are stunning and you can take a lift to the top.",
          "We went in the first Sunday of the month which in Rome means a lot of museums, sites are free. This \u201cwedding cake\u201d was recommended to us for the views. Take the glass elevator to the top, we waited around 25 minutes and see the whole of Rome before your eyes. We did not go into",
          "Like the greatness of the building as well as the purpose. Didn\u2019t have a chance to go inside but could recommend it",
          "This is a nice monument to visit when you are in Rome. The stairs may get crowded but it was OK in the late afternoon.",
          "This monument is stunning. While we were admiring it someone told us that it was actually built to look like a birthday cake once given to the Italian king. This wasn't in our guidebook but I think it's facts like this that make a place truly interesting. So now you know too!",
          "In my opinion it\u2019s one of the most beautiful monuments in Rome. It is located in a strategic point near other monuments, shops (like Tiger) and restaurants.",

          "From what I hear this is a bit of a marmite building, it's loved by some, hated by others. I am most definitely in the former, this is a grand and impressive structure, you can walk the lower levels for free and sit on the steps taking the place in. Also there is a small",
          "We visited Altare della Patria on January 6 at sunset. It was perfect for photographs of the city still decked out from the holidays. I don\u2019t know why exactly but the final elevator to the top that cost 10 euros in July was free on that day. Also, because it was a little",

          "A monument built in honor of Victor Emmanuel II (first king of an unified Italy). It\u2019s a short walk from the Colosseum and is really magnificent. You can go to the top for more fantastic views. It doesn\u2019t come particularly high on \u2018to do\u2019 lists in Rome which is surprising as it",

          "You cannot miss this huge monument which I am told is not very popular with the people of Rome who see it as being far too big. You can go up to the first floor to look at the views without paying an entrance fee, or you can get a lift to the top which you can pay for. There is",

          "When in the area of Piazza Venezia or Capitoline Hill you really can't miss visiting the Altare della Patria. Huge crowds in the area, lots of traffic but still worth it! Truly impressive when seeing it in person. We spent well over an hour walking around the structure. We",

          "This is a good place to go and get a real view of Rome. We went and looked around the outside. Climbed the steps and went inside. You can also pay a small price ( cant remember how much) to take the lift to the roof for some good views",

          "This is a great monument in Rome, you see it from any point and when standing in front of it you can appreciate the impressive dimensions. Although some Italians do not love it because it was built on important vestiges of the Roman forum we can not deny its huge architecture",

          "There is no better view for sure. You are able to see all the major landmarks from a bird perspective. Incredible, and much less crowded than the dome of Saint Peters church. The museum inside is worth checking out too.",

Go to every balcony and you\u2019ll notice little holes on the floor witch is I guess used for draining. Also, you will notice Altar from lots of angles and streets of Rome, it is enormous.",
          "Woderfull place a lot of steps but a must to see from the top",
          "A beautiful and interesting place to visit. There are a lot of stairs, and a long line for the panoramic elevator. I would highly suggest a stop here, but not for people who are less able to handle the stairs. For those who can't handle stairs, you can still get some great photos.",
          "Stunning building, amazing views. There is an elevator that goes higher (for a price maybe?), but there are great views from the two tiers you climb the stairs to.\nPeaceful place, the story of the bronze horse is cool, look out for the story on the wall beside the glass outside elevator.",

However for wheelchair users, a little more challenging area if Rome due to all cobblestones, stairs and hills.  If you are on a hop on hop off bus this is very close to one of their stops so worth a look.",

You can have view of all rome from up but if you want a great and grand panaromic view you can take life and go up you have to pay for that. Its very well mainted.

          "An uncommon piece of architecture in the middle of the historical centre. Huge and impressive. Not loved by everyone. It finds its very own beauty enlightened by the sun. Do not hesitate to visit it and take some time to walk or rest on the commensurate terrasse. Take the time to go on the roof to enjoy the best panoramic view of Roma",
          "Very beautiful landmark, again watch out for shoplifters.",
          "Empty on the inside! All looks and no substance. Ostentatious but at least it houses the monument for the fallen soldier, so it's tolerable.",

      "name": "Spanish Steps",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Spanish Steps (Italian: Scalinata di Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti) are a set of steps in Rome, Italy, climbing a steep slope between the Piazza di Spagna at the base and Piazza Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti, dominated by the Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti church at the top.\nThe monumental stairway of 135 steps (the slightly elevated drainage system is often mistaken for the first step) was built with French diplomat \u00c9tienne Gueffier's bequeathed funds of 20,000 scudi, in 1723\u20131725, linking the Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti church that was under the patronage of the Bourbon kings of France \u2013 located above \u2013 and the Bourbon Spanish Embassy to the Holy See \u2013 located below \u2013 in Palazzo Monaldeschi. The stairway was designed by architects Francesco de Sanctis and Alessandro Specchi.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFollowing a competition in 1717, the steps were designed by the obsure Francesco de Sanctis, though Alessandro Specchi was long thought to have produced the winning entry. Generations of heated debate over how the steep slope to the church on a shoulder of the Pincio should be urbanized preceded the final execution. Archival drawings from the 1580s show that Pope Gregory XIII was interested in constructing a stair to the recently completed fa\u00e7ade of the French church. Gaspar van Wittel's view of the wooded slope in 1683, before the Scalinata was built, is conserved in the Galleria Nazionale, Rome. The Roman-educated Cardinal Mazarin took a personal interest in the project that had been stipulated in Gueffier's will and entrusted it to his agent in Rome, whose plan included an equestrian monument of Louis XIV, an ambitious intrusion that created a furore in papal Rome. Mazarin died in 1661, the pope in 1667, and Gueffier's will was successfully contested by a nephew who claimed half; so the project lay dormant until Pope Clement XI Albani renewed interest in it. The Bourbon fleur-de-lys and Innocent XIII's eagle and crown are carefully balanced in the sculptural details. The solution is a gigantic inflation of some conventions of terraced garden stairs. The Spanish Steps, which Joseph de Lalande and Charles de Brosses noted were already in poor condition, have been restored several times, most recently in 1995.  A new renovation commenced on October 8, 2015 and the steps reopened on September 21, 2016.\n\n\n== Piazza di Spagna ==\nIn the Piazza di Spagna at the base is the Early Baroque fountain called Fontana della Barcaccia (\"Fountain of the longboat\"), built in 1627\u201329 and often credited to Pietro Bernini, father of a more famous son, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who is recently said to have collaborated on the decoration. The elder Bernini had been the pope's architect for the Acqua Vergine, since 1623. According to a legend, Pope Urban VIII had the fountain installed after he had been impressed by a boat brought here by a flood of the Tiber.\nIn the piazza, at the corner on the right as one begins to climb the steps, is the house where English poet John Keats lived and died in 1821; it is now a museum dedicated to his memory, full of memorabilia of the English Romantic generation. On the same right side stands the 15th-century former cardinal Lorenzo Cybo de Mari's palace, now Ferrari di Valbona, a building altered in 1936 to designs by Marcello Piacentini, the main city planner during Fascism,  with modern terraces perfectly in harmony with the surrounding baroque context.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nAt the top, the stairway ramp up the Pincio which is the Pincian Hill. From the top of the steps the Villa Medici can be reached.\nDuring Christmas time a 19th-century criba manger is displayed on the first landing of the staircase. During Springtime, just before the anniversary of the foundation of Rome, April 21, part of the steps are covered by pots of azaleas, up until early May. In modern times the Spanish Steps have included a small cut-flower market. The steps are not a place for eating lunch, being forbidden by Roman urban regulations, but they are usually crowded with people.\n\n\n== In literature ==\nThe Steps are featured in numerous scenes in Alfred Bester's novel The Stars My Destination (1956).\nThe Steps are featured in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, Tender Is the Night (1933).\nThe Steps are featured in Anthony Burgess' novel, Abba Abba (1977).\nThe Steps are featured in Tom Clancy's novel, \"The Teeth of the Tiger\" (2003).\n\n\n== In media ==\n\n\n=== In film and TV ===\nThe film Roman Holiday (1953), starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, made the Spanish Steps famous to an American audience.\nThe apartment that was the setting for The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1961) is halfway up on the right. Bernardo Bertolucci's Besieged (1998) is also set in a house next to the Steps. The Steps were featured prominently in the film version of The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), starring Matt Damon in the title role.\nIn an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond which aired on October 2, 2000, Ray, Debra, Frank, and Marie climb the Spanish Steps during a family vacation in Rome.\nAn episode of the anime series Gunslinger Girl, entitled \"Gelato (Ice Cream),\" which first aired in 2003, features the protagonist by the Spanish Steps having her \"reward\" of ice cream after having completed a successful raid.\nIn the film To Rome with Love (2012), Hayley (Alison Pill) and Michelangelo Santoli (Flavio Parenti) met on the Spanish Steps.\nThe Spanish Steps were the setting of a 'Roadblock' task during The Amazing Race 24 (2014) in which contestants had to count the steps.The Spanish Steps are featured in a scene in the film The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015), in which Ilya (Armie Hammer), posing as a Russian architect, attempts to explain to Gabby (Alicia Vikander) that the Steps were actually made by a Russian architect.\nMidway through the animated film Love Live! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow (2019), the Steps were featured prominently as the site where the main idol group Aqours performed the main musical number of the film, \"Hop? Stop? Nonstop!,\" during their overseas trip from Numazu, Japan to Rome.\n\n\n=== In music ===\nThe progressive rock group Refugee recorded the song \"Credo\" in 1974, which contains the lyric: \"I believe in constant pauses / Like a Roman holiday / And I often stop for air / As I climb the Spanish stairs\".\nThe Bob Dylan song \"When I Paint My Masterpiece,\" first recorded in 1971 by The Band and later appearing on the album Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II, mentions both the \"Spanish Stairs\" and the Colosseum. Norwegian singer/songwriter Morten Harket, from A-ha, released a song called \"Spanish Steps\" on his album Wild Seed in 1995.\nMarc Cohn's song \"Walk Through the World\", released in 1993 on the album The Rainy Season, includes the lyric \"From the Spanish Steps to the Liberty Bell, I know the angels have seen us.\"\nThe opening track of Van Morrison's 1986 album Poetic Champions Compose is an instrumental titled \"Spanish Steps\" that features a haunting, evocative saxophone throughout.\nSinger/songwriter Eric Andersen's album Ghosts Upon the Road (1989) includes his song \"Spanish Steps\", which begins with an invitation to his old love to  \"Meet me on the Spanish Steps / Oh you will not wait long\". He goes on to recall their first meeting on the streets of Rome years ago: \"You were young and your eyes were bright / Your cheeks were flush and fair / We were high, too high on the Spanish Steps / I can see you standing there\".\nThe title song from Guy Clark's Dublin Blues album (1995) contains the lyric: \"I loved you on the Spanish Steps / The day you said goodbye\".\nNorth American and Japanese versions of the Mindfields album, released in 1999 by the American rock band Toto, include the song \"Spanish Steps of Rome\" as a bonus track.  The song describes a femme fatale romance that takes place on and around the Spanish Steps.\nIn 2005, the American rock band Of A Revolution released \"One Shot\" from their album Stories of a Stranger, which contains the lyrics \"Rome is burning, you can taste the embers / I am walking hard on Spanish Steps\".\nIn 2007, John Tesh of Entertainment Tonight fame recorded an instrumental tune called \"Spanish Steps\" on his A Passionate Life album.\n\n\n=== In art ===\nOn 16 January 2008, the Italian artist Graziano Cecchini covered the Spanish Steps with hundreds of thousands of multicolored plastic balls. He claimed it was done to raise international awareness of the situation of the Karen people in Myanmar, and as a protest against the living conditions of artists in Italy.On 9 November 2009, a multimedia event was held on the Steps to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989; the event included the erection of replicas of parts of the wall.\n\n\n== Local landmarks ==\nBabington's tea room\nGiorgio De Chirico House\nKeats-Shelley Memorial House\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nFerrari di Valbona, Carlo Alberto (1965).

          "Yes!! I know this holds a special place in history and special to the people or Rome. I was expecting some special experience when I got there. However, on arriving I felt it was nothing special but just stepd and everyone taking photos on the steps. From what I read before",
          "The Spanish Steps is a must see when you are in Rome. It is a beautiful staircase at the end of one of the city's great streets. At the top of the steps, there is a great view of the city. We were there before the pandemic, they were not allowing anyone to sit on the steps.",
          "Definitely a must visit, located not far from the Trevi Fountain, I recommend you climb up the stairs for a nicer view. The stairs are a few hundred years old and made from the same material as the nice fountan at the bottom. Also there is a nice church and an interestinga",
          "Not particularly interesting, not particularly beautiful, and absolutely overrun with people. No idea why you would bother going here, unless as we did, for the tickbox exercise. If you can steel your courage, give it a miss.",
          "I can't say that it is something spectacular but it is a place and you need to tick off from your list when visiting Rome.",
          "Top-tip: The Spanish Steps are not that far away from the Trevi Fountain, therefore you can plan to see them both in a morning/afternoon. There are some great photo opportunities and views to be seen the higher you climb. It was not that busy during out visit so we could wander",
          "It's a nice monument .Go high for better perspective of the view from above. I am sorry but this is not an asstray to put your cigarettes out I tottaly disrespectful to the monument...",
          "We loved visiting these steps. We had seen so many photos and couldn\u2019t wait to visit. The steps are 18th century made from marble just like the fountain at the bottom. It takes a lovely photo. Don\u2019t forget to visit the church at the top which is anorher typical Italian",
          "Built in 1723-1725 to link the Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti church with the Piazza di Spagna (Spanish Square) below, the steps are beautifully structured. It's fascinating to stand on the steps and see the treads that are worn smooth and dipped by centuries of visitors.",
          "This is one of the must visit place in Rome. The stairs connecting Piazza di Spagna at below and Piazza Trinita dei Monti at above. The place was very crowded with people who only sitting and talking with friends. Count the stairs and it should be 135 stairs. Repeat if you find",
          "There are steps here from the 18th century. Similar the the fountain at the bottom, I'm not sure of the big draw. I guess it's cool to see something everyone says you should see. If you don't, don't beat yourself up over it. When I was there, everyone was still allowed to sit",
          "A tradition to see/visit in Rome and definitely makes you feel the atmosphere also of Rome! Visited in the middle of the day so is quite busy at this point and makes photo opportunities very difficult and crowded!",
          "But checked it off the list. Most people seem to be doing the same thing: stop, stare at the stairs, watch the stair police blow their whistle at people who try to sit down on the stairs, then take a selfie and move on. Seriously though...dont sit on the stairs.",
          "One of the most popular attractions in Rome. Plenty of steps from Piazza di Spagna up to Piazza della Trinita dei Monti. During springtime from mid-March there is also really nice flowers. Today police officer are monitoring step all the time and sitting on the steps isn't",
          "The Spanish Steps are 135 a steep climbing slope of steps set between the Piazza di Spagna at the base and Piazza Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti and dominated by the beautiful Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti church at the top. Often extremely busy, but worth it for the views over Rome. We walked down from",
          "The Spanish Steps were more than I expected! Beautiful architecture and view - but lots of people. We were able to get a gelato and sit for a bit but there were just to many people to stay for long. Nice stopping place along the way through the city.",
          "Walked up and down several times in several trips. Beautiful Bernini fountain at the street below. Poppolo Piazza and Villa Borghese short walks to the left once you reach the top of the stairs, both destinations to visit. Authorities periodically discourage and even outlaw",
          "Found in the heart of Rome this is a must see before / after the Trevi Fountain which is a short walk away. You must walk up the steps to get some great pics but don\u2019t sit on them, the Police will whistle you to get up and not block people walking. If you have time afterwards,",
          "Beautiful setting for pics but you cant sit on the steps, nice places for coffee around the steps but expensive",
          "The Spanish steps were not really worth a visit. If you walk to the top the view is ok and at the bottom you have all of the designer stores, but to be honest there are far more interesting places to go in Rome.",
          "Spanish steps is just what it says, steps down to a fountain. You need to read the information board at the bottom to get the history of why they were built. Better fountains in other locations.",
          "Fantastic place to visit. I have no idea what they are or why they are there, but they are really cool.",
          "If you are on the metro and come off at Spagna station you will walk past these steps on your way to exploring the city. Not really sure what the fuss is about, but they're there if you want to have a look. Wouldn't go out if my way though",
          "Considering all there is to see in Rome I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to visit this. They\u2019re steps...lot of expensive shops at the bottom. Not as impressive as much of the rest of Rome.",
          "There are many sellers in the neighbourhood. For me its not very special. When you climb the steps you have a nice few over Rome. I like other views in Rome more.",
          "A beautiful walk,but if you're not up to walking up to the top just sit and admire,although the view from the top is out of the world.The roads aren't flat and most are cobbled not the place to take a wheel chair or pram. There are some looki looki men selling Rose's and flowers",
          "In the Piazza di Spagna at the base is the Early Baroque fountain called Fontana della Barcaccia (\"Fountain of the longboat\"), built in 1627\u201329 and often credited to Pietro Bernini, father of a more famous son, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who is recently said to have collaborated on",
          "Not over impressive, but part of Medici history, for which reason it should be part of the Rome cultural tour by walk. No entrance fee.",
          "I was dreaming of a visit to Rome for years, and I\u2019m happy and thankful that I saw the iconic Spanish Steps with my own eyes... but if you have little time, please skip this. Heck, if you have loads of time, skip it as well. It\u2019s just not interesting, certainly not in comparison",
          "We ended up here after a Taxi driver told us about the 'English Yobs' smashing these historic steps. Expensive shopping and food in this area is ok.",
          "Another place with a lovely fountain and all the most sophisticated shops around it. These are the free attractions from Rome. The Spanish steps are a gathering point for local and tourists. Besides that, the fountain is one of Bernini's masterpieces.",
          "The kids loved the Spanish steps we went twice and the boys went up and down them. 139 steps and we checked \u2705 Really busy great atmosphere and fab views of the city from the top.",
          "This was a nice area, lots of stores around. It was pretty to look at but unfortunately I wasn\u2019t able to walk up the steps due to being pregnant. There\u2019s a little fountain at the bottom of the steps that we were able to sit at which was nice.",
          "The Spanish Steps are more than just an impressive set of steps for a good photoshoot- they are located in the heart of Rome next to all the shopping and wonderful stores as well! By walking up the steps, you will reach a historical church and have wonderful views of Rome, but",
          "Spanish Steps is scenographic stairs in Rome, rococo style , erected in 1723\u20131725 according to the design of Francesco De Sanctis and Alessander Specchi. The stairs lead from Piazza di Spagna to the church of Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti. At the top of the stairs is the sixteenth-century",
          "So, these are the famous steps. I didn\u2019t walk up the steps, instead I walked down as I was coming from the church up top. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t crowded to say the least (likely due to the recent coronavirus scare) which made it nice. The fountain at the bottom of the steps is",
          "I ran up, didn't take much effort, the steps aren't steep, just long and lots of them. Nice view from the top but there's better views and more impressive architecture elsewhere",
          "We can sometimes walk up and down steps without thinking about the work that went into them, these steps took a lot of work and perform a great function to connect these two areas on different levels. While the steps themselves are magnificent and the point of the review, the",
          "My wife and I were revisiting Rome for the Valentines Weekend. We walked from our hotel t the steps and then did our own walking tour around the area. When you reach the top and get your breath back the view down is amazing. At the top is an interesting church worth a visit as",
          "A set of steps between Piazza si Spagna at the base and Piazza Trinitia del Monti at the top. There is a fountain ,Fontana Della Baraccia at the base and the Trinity del Monti church at the top . To get to the top, we had to climb 135 steps on a steep slope. These steps was",
          "Fun to walk the steps and reach the top and look down over the plaza. The architecture around here is amazing and worth simply stopping and admiring. As with most of Rome, it is best to wear good, solid walking shoes. There were horse drawn carriages in the plaza below",
          "I visited and climbed the steps. Compared to everything else in Rome I thought this was underwhelming and seemed to be more of a gathering space. I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to see it again.",
          "Climbed the Steps and snapped the obligatory pictures alike everybody else. It\u2019s crowded and everyone clamours to get the best photo angle, but it is worth paying a visit that\u2019s for sure.",
          "Went to see it as it's one of the things to do when in Rome but genuinely was disappointed! Just a set of steps surrounded by designers shops",
          "Nice fountain, very expensive designer shops, the iconic steps themselves leading up to a rather understated church. Worth a quick visit, the view from the church is good.",
          "Definitely worth a visit and a climb to the top, even just to say I've been to the Spanish Steps :). I climbed them both day and night for pictures, I preferred the evening pictures.",
          "Really cool to see the Spanish steps. It's a shame it's let down by people constantly trying to sell you things.",
          "Not as impressive as other monuments but worth seeing. Although we were disappointed at the fountain at the foot which we thought was the Trevi",
          "never sit there...you will be chased off. too many people to fully appreciate its architecture anyways. just some beautiful steps. overrated",
          "Spoiler alert - they're steps. Good for going up, and going down works too if that's your thing. Nice enough, but it baffles me why there are so many people here to look at them. There are separate entries for the piazza, the fountain in the piazza, and the steps? What gives TA?",
          "To begin, I will admit that I did not read about the significance of these steps before or since my visit so maybe there is more to know. But, while in Rome I figured I better go here because everyone speaks of them. It\u2019s a bunch of steps with a ton of people standing on them.",
          "Emerged from the metro after our flight, train and metro journey - all of which were (thank you!) straight forward - and there they were!!! What an amazing start to our few days in Rome. Transported immediately to Romantic Holiday - minus Gregory Peck \ud83d\ude22. Our boys were equally",
          "Think we visited on a bad day.....Demonstrations were going on on all over the city so everywhere was much busier than usual.",
          "This place is so busy and you can see why you can imagine all the movies that have been filmed here the place is stunning and a must visit while in Rome",
          "Spanish Steps are just ok. It\u2019s a bunch of steps. That\u2019s it. Rome makes it sound big. It\u2019s nothing. The fountain there is nice. If you have 5 minutes to spar see this area. If you miss it. No big deal.",
          "During the summer time, if rain doesn't catch you off guard, this is another free activity after Pantheon to do. You will see many sitting down on the stairs, when it rains, the police will ask you to move and not sit. My recommendation is not sitting on the stairs, rather, go",
          "Visited several occasions and now much better managed by the authorities to prevent sitting on the steps.",
          "Ok, nice steps, they go on for ever, some of which look over used and slant downwards but im not sure what the fuss is about. There is even an old cop, blowing his whistle if you dare to sit down. Go, take a quick pic and leave.",
          "We visited here in the day when it\u2019s very crowded. It\u2019s better to enjoy at night, grab some gelato and watch the world go by while enjoying the view.",
          "With so many things to see in Rome I\u2019ve never understood the attraction. Nice square at the bottom and a church at the top. Nothing too spectacular",
          "We went to the Spanish steps because it was on our to do list. Is was very beautiful and a great experience. It is very big with a great history. I recommend everyone to do a hop on hop off tour. Try to get on top and go downstairs.",
          "The Spanish Steps are unsurprisingly a set of steps which date back from the 18th century in which link the base of the Piazza Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti and Trinita dei Monti Church. Even though the staircase was designed by Francesco De Sanctis, an Italian architect, it was originally",
          "This is a beautiful location been ruined by people staying long periods to just get the right picture to use on social media. The people are rude if you get in their shot and take over the full place. Your not allowed sit on the steps, but you should also not be allowed to stay",
          "Tourist hotspot, nice views to be had, watch-out for pickpockets. Great place for photo and you might even catch the odd wedding. It\u2019s not far to walk to Trevi Fountain from here.",
          "It was OK, if I had limited time in Rome I would skip this one. The view up is nice, but down is not as marvelous. It is usually very crowded.",
          "End October 2019: This place is so overhyped! It wasn't the easiest to find but once we found it, it was jam packed with tourists. It was crazy. There is a fountain at the base of the steps and plenty of people were sitting along it and taking photos or having a break. Then",
          "Relaxing fountain spoiled with a lot of folks around. The steps themselves are worth climbing, as the church and view down is great. Too bad it's a nest of scammers, so prepare to be bothered there, too. Free \"entry\" is definitely a bonus, though!",
          "We walked from the Trevi Fountain to the steps, they are magical. There are several cafe at the top and bottom to enjoy a glass of wine or a coffee.",
          "Walking around Rome, we weren't too fussed about seeing the Spanish steps but ended up coming across them. They are good too see, however it is overcrowded. The staff are looking after the steps by not allowing you to sit down on them for long as there are alot of people.",
          "Nice enough area, busy. Unfortunately they don't let you sit on the steps at all as it would be nice to sit and enjoy the sun and atmosphere. Views at the top are not great and obscured by a lot of the surrounding buildings.",
          "Nice steps and good to see the staff asking people politely to follow the rules of not sitting on the steps",
          "Be here during the spring or summer. No flowers during winter was expected and missed. Walk the stairs, enjoy the view.",
          "We saw the steps but didnt think they were anything amazing and everyone dont even leave you alone to enjoy the experience just keep trying to sell you things.",
          "A visit would not be complete to Rome without a visit to the Spanish Steps be it at the bottom or the top, you could tie you visit in with taking advantage of the Steps location being close to a couple of viewing points to see an amazing sunset over the Rome skyline",
          "We came on a rainy day, still full of people and scammers. Anyhow, a must see in Rome and a must climb. Anyhow it was dirty, full of people and police just posing instead of keeping up law and order. Come a sunny day if you could.",
          "What a site to see!! History buffs delight but modern day touts and con artists spoil this beautiful place literally every 10 paces somebody trying to scam you!! It detracts from the sights as you feel in guard constantly, it\u2019s a serious problem here that the local police do not",
          "This spot is quite busy but is nice if you\u2019re just looking for a quick rest spot. The area is also pretty busy but a good spot for shopping.",
          "We stopped to see the Spanish Steps on our way to visit the Trevi Fountain, it was nice to tick off our list of things that we had visited but if you are pushed for time you aren't missing much. I would say the Trevi Fountain is a must, it's so beautiful. The Spanish steps",
          "Disappointed in the new rule of no sitting on spanish steps, did not go up any of the stairs , because I would have needed a bit of a rest 1/2 was or so going up.Just a place to take a picture then and go! You can still get air flifh. Fill your water bottle from the water",
          "An easy place to get to & shouldn\u2019t be missed i my opinion. We really liked the steps & the view from the top..",
          "While I didn't actually climb the steps, once again, I was just amazed at the beauty and history associated with this artifact.",
          "Very close to the Spanish embassy. It is a very scenic place and should be part of a visit to Rome. Not far from Trevi fountain",
          "Another iconic event in Rome to see and climb at least once. Not at all a strenuous trip up the steps, even though you can\u2019t stop and sit. There was a huge crowd. So we only lingered at the top of the steps to take a few pictures and enjoy the view. Not something we would",
          "Even though its no longer allowed to sit in the steps, the crowd is still crazy. I actually liked it better when you could sit and relax here, than just walk in chaos",
          "well the Spanish Steps Italy was one long stretch up good exercise and we had fun it was very nice when we reached the top of the steps and looked down the one thing we both liked was seeing the Sweeping Rooftop's what a view we did it in time for the Sunset it was worth it.",
          "Wonderful in January! No people, ideal temperature and beautiful - so avoid the tourist lines and travel in winter",
          "Slightly disappointed with numbers. Was expecting huge in numbers, but very large in size. Great view from the top as there is fountain at the bottom to relax.",
          "You get to see the sweeping rooftop views from the top of the steps. The joy of people watching! But the best part, we arrived there just in time for sunset. Amazing view to see!",
          "The Spanish Steps were high on my list of must see sites mainly due to them being featured in the movie Roman Holiday. They lead up to a gorgeous church and another lovely view of the city. Just across the road are the streets of big brands such as Gucci, Tiffany, Dolce and",
          "Lovely view from the top. Glad our bus dropped us off at the top, so we walked down....as wouldnt fancy walking up all those steps!",
          "Lovely place to visit.. surrounded with many high end designer shops Weather was gorgeous when we visited in January",
          "A walkway from the square to the church. Fortunately they forbade sitting on the steps, so you have better access. Too many people in the square, though, they should go home or eat some pasta or something.",
          "There's history behind these steps. The imagine the locals know it, but the historians and tour guides know it. Take some time to research the places you will see. There's history that you can appreciate. Research the fountain at the foot of the steps too. A famous sculptor's",
          "Seemed less people now that the new laws came into affect on no sitting on historical architectures. Much nicer to photograph and climbing up the stairs.",
          "We went to see the spanish steps and were they are located is a busy place and full of life, the steps are very nice when you get to the top you've a great view up the streets. Do not sit down on the steps as you will be landed with a fine.",
          "Went in the evening and the view of the Vatican was beautiful had an amazing photo session. It's so peaceful",
          "Lovely touristy location for pictures and to admire the impressive roman architecture. Lots of history around as well.",
          "This is a beautiful but busy place also a few mins from trevi fountain which is handy.... Spanish steps is a must see also located around here are lots of designer shops pretty much everything u could think of.... Dior Gucci monclear Tiffany&co Prada dg are but to name a few",
          "Not something interested to see.and police don't leave the people to seat in the step's for a second and a take a photo.unexeptable!!",
          "Good to see not sure I'd go out of my way to go back very busy all round here. Lots of police around which makes me wonder why probably pickpockets .",
          "Great historical site. Walking up them is a must. Lovely views over the city from the top. Take a walk down to the Borghese gardens after.",
          "Very nice view of the city from the top but nothing else. During the day there are 3-4 policemen preventing people from sitting on the steps. Not even for 10 seconds just to take a picture. There is a fountain at the bottom and a lot of expressive stores around. If you are sort",
          "Nice coffee shops, view and shops around to spend a lovely evening! Love the view and place . Stay around as its super well located",
          "A definite must see, one of the main attractions. I would recommend climbing to the top for some amazing views across Rome. I would recommend going both during the day and night to see the views.",
          "Spanish Steps it's ok visit I guess. I wouldn't say it's a must see. If you've got limited time in Rome, I'd say skip it.",
          "Very pleasant to visit. Especially late evening. The vibe at that time is amazing. Quite busy too. Everyone's just chilled out having ice cream with fantastic surroundings",
          "If you get here VERY early, then I\u2019m sure this is amazing. However, any other time, it\u2019s a heaving mass of people, all trying to take selfies and jostling for positions to take pictures. It\u2019s a steep walk up the stairs, but the views from the top, especially at night are",
          "By now, you've all heard the news- no more sitting on the steps. It's a lot less fun now, but I understand. Do the walk down Via Condotti.",
          "One of the must see sights but to be honest, we didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Nice square with shops, eateries and a small fountain. Large Church at top of the stairs and having climbed all the way up I'd hesitate to recommend the view from the top. As the title says,",
          "Just beautiful, and they are iconic. I guess many actually miss taking in the surroundings, the graceful flow of stone because they are so busy taking a selfie... but, I was k me of them, you can\u2019t not do it!",
          "Was told prior to visit that this place would be too busy but it was quiet enough to enjoy it all. Only negative are the people who stop you from sitting on the steps. I don't mind this but rather than just blow a whistle at anyone who sits down, they could be on the steps",
          "The Spanish Steeps are a must see when in Rome. a.ways very busy but worth it. Walk to the top and meander to Villa Bourgese. Again more walking will give rewards insurmountable. Many super places to duck into if raining. Enjoy!!",
          "One hundred and twenty steps and thousands of tourists doing their thing. Good view babe careful of the hustlers.",
          "I would not recommend anyone to visit rome. I am writing this after bad pick pocking experience near the spanish steps. My wife's credit cards money and insurance cards in the purse was stolen here. The purse was kept inside the backpack and she was wearing it. The police in",
          "Despite being just a flight of steps leading to a church, very popular among tourists, nice place to sit and enjoy the views.",
          "We went at night and it was brilliant, all lit up and a great place to visit, the stairs were hard work but part of the experience.",
          "The spanish steps were of great view from Bottom. Though we did not climb up as this too much of steps ..",
          "It\u2019s really nice place in Rome. Worth to see. Unfortunately the crowd was overwhelming and it took all joy away. I expected some nice view from the top but nope.",
          "If you like stairs, this is the place for you. Very confusing though - are they French , or Italian? Where did the Spanish come in? Beware of selfie sticks!",
          "After visiting St Peters and the Vatican Museums the Spanish Steps are a short walk away and the view from the top is impressive. The fountain at the bottom can be crowded but once across the piazza window shopping the high fashion on offer along via Condotti is a nice change of",
          "The spanish stairs are very romantic. There are good shops around there. There are always many people there. But it is a must see place.",
          "I went in December, it was very chilli. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a must watch place. It basically has stairs connecting the church. I believe it has beautiful flowers in summers. It was very crowded though and I suggest that it is visited early in the morning for pictures without",
          "This church at the top of these steps is lovely and worth the views. Very peaceful even when busy. . Do not sit on the steps - you will be moved along.",
          "We were lucky our hotel was close to The Colosseum. I would advise everyone to use their public transport, their train system is very good. Don't be swindled at the airport. Take the train and go to the nearest M (metra) station near your hotel or destination. You can use the",
          "Honestly like other reviews say, it\u2019s just steps. The area around this is quite nice and enjoyable as well but wouldn\u2019t say this is a \u201cmust-see\u201d in Rome.",
          "It\u2019s an impressive architectural achievement, but for the most part it\u2019s a tourist magnet. There are some good restaurants around, but because of the location they are all above average price and some outright gouge. Check the menu before taking a table.",
          "This is basically just steps, best to read up the background before checking it out so it can be appreciated. The night of the friday before Christmas 2019, the police musical group was there to play for the crowd. They were wonderful and added so much to the festive atmosphere.",
          "A bit disappointed... nothing special honestly. Maybe because of the crowd or the weather. Being close to centre it's worth a visit.",
          "Depending on whether you go up or down the steps they will lead you to interesting places. Usually plenty of people are there so hard to get a really good photo of the steps. The view from the top is wonderful. Located close to the Spagna Metro station on the orange line.",
          "A tourist stop. The Spanish Steps is a crowded area with 135 steps leading up to a church on top. A nice fountain at the bottom.",
          "Well worth the taxi ride to see this beautiful scene. Mobbed with tourists. Very nice area for shopping. Around the corner from even MORE crowded Trevi Fountain. Also worth the hassle of the mob.",
          "The Spanish steps are a must see while in Rome, Italy. While visiting, you must climb to the top and stop in the Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti church at the top. Your reward upon descent will be the exclusive shopping.",
          "Loved the steps the views, the surroundings... however hard to find a space to sit, recoup and take it all in.... you can\u2019t sit on the steps (I understand why) worth a visit x",
          "Very near to Trevi fountain. This place has a fountain where you can place coins. It is said that if it falls you will visit roma again.",
          "Well worth a visit just to see the views from the top. The church is beautiful inside. Very ornate and a nice place to sit for a little while for some reflection",
          "It is one of the best known \"buildings\" of Rome - everybody must have a picture who gets to Rome. It is 139 steps (or similar) to get to the top. On the top of it there is an obelisk in front of a church. It is a very popular meeting point for tourist groups and many walking",
          "Dont really get the hype of the steps at all. There was a beautiful fountain at the bottom which I thought was more interesting than the step.",
          "An ok piazza to have a look at but overrated for what it is. Steps where people could rest but no longer can. Shops and even more shops. One tea house but with no view outside.",
          "We asked several people how to get to the Spanish Steps and finally found them! So glad we did! Again I felt like I was in the movie \"Roman Holiday\" with Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn!!! This is a lovely area with a gorgeous Church of Trinita dei Monti at the top!!! Well",
          "The Spanish steps we're well worth the time we spend looking for them. We arrived in the early evening when the Christmas lights in surrounding areas had been turned on, so it was a beautiful sight.",
          "We visited the Spanish steps on the last day of or trip. The steps are absolutely breath taking. Marble built and huge. They go up layers and layers and take a long time to walk up. We stopped on each level to look at the views from that level. Once at the top you are on a",
          "Thus area used to be pickpocket central but since the city implemented the non sitting and eating rule as well as patrol the area, the undesirable peddlers and people have vanished . This area is best visited during the day where the sights are rather striking with the great",
          "When in Rome they say go to the Spanish Steps. It was okay. Nothing great. They won\u2019t even let you sit on the steps. Stayed there for about 15 minutes. So much more to do in Rome.",
          "We visited Spanish steps at night so was very quiet & just round the corner from The Trevi fountain.",
          "The nearest metro stop is Spagna. Historic steps in marble. The Piazza is really full of tourists. The steps lead to the high ends shops and lots of places to eat. Great people watching.",
          "One time st a truck stop in Texas I saw a sign that read that on some random date in history nothing happened there. Welcome to the Spanish Steps. Apparently this is the Spanish quarter in Rome. There is maybe an embassy across the street as indicated by a a flag of Spain.",
          "We came across the Spanish steps from the top by the Basilica but once you have descended they really are a stairway to Heaven. The basilica sits at the top the the steps heading up towards it. Not too busy when we visited so manged to get some great pictures. No access from top",
          "Easily accessible by subway and lovely views from the top of the staircase. Gets really crowded but definitely worth the visit",
          "Probably the most unimpressive of the popular attractions in Rome. I'm not really shirt and why people get so Gaga over this place except that it's a big set of stairs that are mildly impressive. Maybe it's the history I don't know. But, I found much better way to spend my time",
          "Nice marble steps but nothing stellar about them. The boat fountain is more interesting since it marks the site of where an actual boat was found after the Tiber flooded. Higher end fashion district for shopping.",
          "Don\u2019t whatever you do sit on the side bits, you will be told off! Lots of steps up and of course lots of steps down again. Nice fountain at the bottom & some very expensive designer shops. Wasn\u2019t too busy in November but would imagine it gets very busy in the summer.",
          "The Spanish Steps should definitely be on your list of places to visit while in Rome, but just be aware that it does get very crowded. I would recommend visiting earlier in the day if you are looking for less people. But there are a lot of popular shops and restaurants in the",
          "As above, a very famous iconic landmark which everybody has heard of and must see. Beautiful design and architecture. well worth a visit as part of a days walkabout.",
          "A cute area, better than we had expected-very crowded during the day though, so go in the morning. Plenty of high-end shops surrounding it, but also lots of scams, in fact the main things I remember other than the steps was people selling roses and saying 'cold water, cool",
          "It s great, beautifil, walk there, see it, but walk upstairs? I didn't! If you go during the summer the weather is really hot, have water with you, wear sneakers.",
          "Overcrowded and expensive for food and drink nearby ,watch out for pickpockets and sellers trying to sell you rubbish also you can\u2019t sit or eat on the Spanish steps",
          "That\u2019s basically what it\u2019s all about - taking lots of pictures. Just don\u2019t sit down on the steps or on the sides because it\u2019s not allowed.",
          "I found sites like the Spanish steps better in the evening, the views from the top are probably better during the day but the history of the steps is very interesting and as previously said on other reviews you must read the plaques as it gives you a better understanding of the",
          "Nice to see but there are so much more interesting places to visit in Rome. A lot of people slowly moving around, some still try to sit and police is yelling at them... Maybe it was just grey November day and a lack of flowers as on the pictures. Thoguh I was surprised that",
          "A short walk from the Trevi Fountain, the Steps are quite a sight. A must for any visitor. Great view from the top and beautiful fountain. The Romans sure knew how to build these! Lots of high end famous name shops nearby, if that's your kind of thing.",
          "A wonderful place for walking, sightseeing and enjoying Rome and her citizens. The view from the top of the stairs is not paralleled and worth the hike!",
          "The Spanish Steps is a large and wide staircase with 174 steps dating to 1725. At its base is the Fontana della Barcaccia\u2014a fountain in the shape of a half-sunken boat. The source of the water comes from the Acqua Vergine, an aqueduct from 19 BCE. Bernini built this fountain",
          "The steps an the buildings are quite impressive. The plaza de espa\u00f1a has a special atmosphere and from there you can go directly shopping in the more exclusive shops....don't forget your gold card",
          "We came here in the early evening and stayed late because the area is very fashionable with wonderful shops and designer stores. At night, the area sparkles and has an energy of it's own. This is a must visit while in Rome. The view at the top of the steps is beautiful.",
          "Don\u2019t miss these. Did a walking tour and this was our first stop. They are breathtaking. Learned that they are actually French. Not Spanish. Take the tour. You learn so much about Rome.",
          "Stopped here on our way to Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon, and a 3 hour aqueduct bike tour. Looking back on the day, not a highlight .... but worth a quick stop. For some reason, the area wasn't crowded when we were there early October. We were able to get several photos that made",
          "a busy square with imposing steps but is well worth the climb for the outstanding views from the top, and the incredible church at the top where we spent a quiet 15 minutes in contemplation",
          "One of the \u201cmust do\u2019s\u201d when in Rome, we complied. This was our second visit to Rome, and my beloved put this on our list of things to revisit. We were there in the middle of the day in November. It was not nearly as crowded as when we were there in July 2012. We had heard there",
          "This is a famous location and offers some good photo opps, but it is crowded always. Our hotel was located near by so we simply walked to see the steps from the top, then later on a different walk we saw them from the bottom. The street on the bottom is an ancient pathway from",
          "The Spanish Steps is worth a visit as this staircase is massive. Just a short walk from the Steps to the Trevi Fountain!",
          "OK, so there's a few steps... actually, quite a few but if you take it easy they're quite accessible for most people with reasonable mobility. We (both in our 60's) ambled up to the top and back down again. A couple days later we found ourseleves at the top again having come in",
          "Like so many of the famous tourist traps oin Rome they are thick with people, selfie sticks etc. The steps themselves aren't anything much, and there are sure plenty of them. There's only a very mediocre church at the top when you get there, but, the view back across to St",
          "Fabulous! At the end of Via Condotti the most exclusive shopping area of Rome. A must visit site when in Rome",
          "If you are looking to find designer shops and touristy restaurants this is the place to come. The steps are there to be climbed with a good view from the top, but beware of the touts selling umbrellas and ponchos as soon as it rains. If you are prepared to walk a little",
          "Yes, nice architectural steps, although quite dirty. Just don\u2019t get the fascination that the multitude of young people taken selfies have for this specific place. The piazza in front of the steps is large and relatively accessible in the off season. But to me nothing of beauty",
          "It's hard to miss this stunning part of the city. I would recommend taking some time out of all the walking you are going to do and perch somewhere at the foot of the steps or climb to the top where the views are rather spectacular. We chilled at the top with our tiramisu from",
          "Watch out for the guys with lasers and flowers. They ruin so many sites in this wonderful city, and you run into whole groups of them on the way up the steps during dinner time. Keep hands in your pockets and don\u2019t linger in one place for too long. Wish their hounding would be",
          "Lovely to see lots of climbing not far from the trevi fountains Don't sit or lay on the steps it's not permitted you hear the whistle when someone sits. I don't know what the reason is but if you walk to the top then go right it takes you to the mausoleum",
          "Lots to do in this area, although every pic you see people are sitting on the steps. When we were there police with whistles were blowing them constantly making people move, not sure what changed but they were loud :-) Pretty area.",
          "I wouldn't rate going to the Spanish steps on your stay to Rome. There is much more fascinating things to see than steps.",
          "It was so very busy, due to the crowds we decided not to walk to the top! The views are amazing though and the small fountain at the bottom is very cute. In the square there was an Elvis impersonator, thought this only happened in London but it was entertaining.",
          "When in Rome you have to go to the Spanish steps,take some awesome pics and soak up the atmosphere, had a great time",
          "The Spanish Steps is one of \"the\" attactions to visit in Rome. Whilst it is nice and located in the centre of Rome's main shopping district, unless you go early in the morning, crowds tends to somewhat spoil the experience and there really is not much to see.",
          "No sitting, it is now against the law to sit on the steps. They actually have \u201cpolice\u201d patrolling the steps to assure, that no one sits. A great job is you ask me! But regardless of the new law, they have no problem if you stand. So again this is a must see while in Rome",
          "Very popular with tourists not much to see but climbed the steps to the church at the top very commercial with lots of designer shops fab for window shopping",
          "One of the most visited square in Rome. This place is full of tourists. All the upscale and high-end brands are there. A nice place for window shopping or if you have cash you can buy some shoes or bags from Chanel or Dior. The area is safe as the police are available all over",
          "Beautiful place in wonderful Rome but a lot of people. If you want the best picture or you don\u2019t wish to be harassed by men selling roses/selfiesticks etc pay the Spanish steps a visit early mornings",
          "Not much to see all it is is steps with a fountain I front but I suppose you need to tick it off if you visit Rome, expect to be hassled with people trying to sell you scarfs, toys, and roses",
          "The Spanish steps are easy to find and are a free attraction for the enthusiastic tourist! Grab a photo on the steps which were originally built for ease of access to the church above them. There are 135 steps and they've been restored many,any times since they were first built",
          "They were just steps with tons of people on them. Maybe with a tour guide you would get more out of them, but they were just pretty steps and nothing fancy or worth going out of your way for. We did do the obligatory picture though and made sure not to sit down.",
          "The Steps called Spanish steps, like the square before, here is located the Spanish embassy, and could in fact called easily as \"French steps\", because lead at her ends to the wonderful French Church \"Trinita dei Monti\". Now the Steps from the nineteenth century form one of",
          "I guess we would be the only couple that would think this but.When we finally walked over there we said this is it? Not sure what the big deal of this is. Even without the crazy crowds it just didn't do anything for us. We went on to the Pantheon after taking a few pics.",
          "We visited on a very busy Saturday morning and therefore the steps were very crowded. There were too many steps for my knees to cope with, so I can only imagine how amazing the view at the top would be! Don\u2019t try to sit on the steps as the police will move you on with a sharp",
          "Visited the Spanish steps a few times during our trip. The first time was around mid day and it was so busy! You couldn't get a good photo. The next day we woke up and got there for 7.30 in the morning and it was stunning. So quiet and peaceful you could really take it in and",
          "Another monument I checked out late evening to avoid the crowds, also great to see it lit up at night time.",
          "I think if everyone visit rome should not miss this romantic palace.the best place to take photoes specially for new couples .staires are the best place to show love to each other and take photoes",
          "The steps are cool with the church at the top with a nice view looking down at the crowds. There is a huge piazza at the foot of the steps that is very crowded with people , pick pockets , street artists , horse drawn carriages , upscale shopping, and plenty of tourist",
          "This is a cool place to see. It is just a a stairway but it is pretty interesting. Watch out for the flower guys - the usual scam. Times wise you only need 30 minutes.",
          "If you are passing by, then the Spanish Steps are worth a look but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit. If you do visit, be prepared for lots of people - the Spanish Steps were by far the most crowded site I visited while in Rome.",
          "The photo depicted must've been quite a feat to have no one there because this place was so crowded and full of aggressive vendors trying to sell you flowers for \"good luck\". At least I can say I was there....",
          "The Spanish Steps is a lovely attraction. There is a beautiful church at the top with amazing views too. Well worth a visit.",
          "Lovely to see for a quick 5 minutes but was very disappointed. There may be history behind them however not worth a long visit and they are very overcrowded",
          "This is a must see in Rome. Located in Piazza di Spagna these steps lead to a beautiful church at the top and a Bernini fountain at the bottom. You can also see Via Condotti all the luxury shops with famous brands. You aren\u2019t allowed to sit on the steps anymore which is",
          "Great view walking up to the top of the stairs. Becarfeul not to sit and eat on the stairs. It's forbidden. We saw police officers gaurding the stairs.",
          "The story of these area may be so historical but very crowded during the visit. This is my second visit and never come here again.",
          "Aaarrghhh! Too many steps to climb.. about 136/140 I think but the story behind it and the link between the boat at the bottom and the church on top is interesting..",
          "We took the hop on hop off bus to Spagna and walked down the steps. Obviously you can't 'do' Rome without going but even in November the steps were packed with people. The street sellers of selfie sticks and roses were also very annoying.",
          "We did this the only way that makes sense to me (keep in mind, my interest in high fashion is minimal), it was one of several short stops on a golf cart tour of the city. When we got there, my first thought was, \"huh, what's the deal?\" I was educated that it is a popular spot",
          "We went here on a Saturday morning early to beat the crowd. We arrived at the top of the Spanish steps and it was very pleasant. We saw a few modelling shoots happening there and it wasn\u2019t too busy at 8am. Pleasant place to see early in the morning",
          "We visited the steps from the bottom and also at the end of our trip again from the top. Nice to see and stroll up and down ... not allowed to sit on the steps and sip a coffee... just get whistled at with a big shake of the head. NO!! There\u2019s a nice clean drinking water",
          "Rome is a beautiful city, easy to get around and lots of historic and interesting sites to visit. The Spanish Steps are one of the tourist traps, impossible to enjoy and take pictures due to high volume crowds. At least, the tourists are mostly accommodating and beautiful shops",
          "We went later in the evening about 9pm. It was not quite so busy. A walk to the top and the views are spectacular of Rome at night. This area around here has designer shopping. Thank goodness they shops were shut.",
          "Wasn\u2019t sure what to expect but we had to go and see the Spanish steps little bit underwhelmed it literally is just steps and once we had taken a photo in between all the crowds we left it\u2019s worth a look but that\u2019s about it",
          "After our break at Babbingtons we had a look at the famous Spanish steps with at the top a beautiful church. It is amazing to see.",
          "Lots and lots of walking! Lots of people to merge or probably bump into you but everyone was friendly. Weather was wonderful, only rained our last day there. Lots of places to stop and eat. Tons of great photo options. Beautiful churches. Did I mention lots of walking.",
          "Crowded and really not that interesting compared to the rest of rome. Just stroll past it and admire the obelisk",
          "Well the Spanish Steps themselves are not that spectacular but the surrounding area is. The Steps are at the end of the Piazza Espana, the location of the Spanish embassy. The piazza is very nice. The views from the top of the Steps is also worthwhile. While in Rome visit the",
          "A must see in Rome of course! Very busy and you aren\u2019t allowed any food or drink on the steps even if you are just walking through and not standing around. You are not permitted to sit anywhere on the Spanish steps and you will be told to move and to stop eating. Great",
          "The steps were well worth the trip going there. Their we're a ton of people all over the area with a partying atmosphere . The steps were close to a lot of high-end stores . At the bottom of the steps was a great huge water fountain. A great place to visit day or night.",
          "Yes, the Spanish steps are very old and I felt it was important that we went to see them, however with so much other amazing architecture and sights to see, the Spanish steps felt a little underwhelming and \u2018normal\u2019 in comparison.",
          "This wasn\u2019t as exciting as other parts of Rome and was just some steps in my opinion. However, i can see why people might like it as the view from the top is nice. TIP: if with people who will struggle to walk up steps then there is a lift on the left hand side of the steps, in",
          "Lovely architecture but very crowded, not somewhere to stay for long periods.Watch out for security as they will fine you for sitting on the steps or eating/ drinking on the steps.",
          "Euhhmm.. yes it's Nice. But is this it? This atracks so much tourists?? Okay.... looked at it for A minute .. And.. that was it.",
          "The Spanish Steps are beautiful but too crowded to fully enjoy. Be aware of the flower sellers and cons that are around, too. We didn't stay long.",
          "Very busy.... Go early. Read up on the history. Before you go as there isn't much there about it at the site.",
          "It seems to be a hot spot for meeting friends, chilling on the steps, and lots and lots of people walking up to get a nice photo. There's more steps than you think, and you can stop at each level to look down and get a different view. Love the feel of the steps - they were",
          "After our visit to the Vatican, we took the Big Bus and stopped by this historical site for a late lunch. We took some photos and had late lunch at one of many restaurants in the area, wife did a little shopping at one of the high end store. It was okay, watching sunset from top",
          "After exploring Piazza del Popolo (we started from here only), three roads span out into the city, and exploring these on foot is always a highlight of our trips to Rome. If you take the left-most road looking south, the Via del Babuino, it will lead you to the Spanish Steps,",
          "I don't understand the fuss made about this. It's just a set of white steps for goodness sake. So many better things to see.",
          "The best visit is before sunrise after 5 am the place will be very busy, perfect for picture not too many people.",
          "This is a very cool attractions and boy are there a lot of steps. If you take a guided tour they will give you all the history regarding these steps and how they came to be.",
          "Beautiful at night, great for photos. Climb the steps, totally worth it! Dont let the guy with Rose's fool you. They are NOT free!",
          "Crowded but beautiful. Lovely weather. Great photo opportunity. Hop on hop off tours are a wonderful way to see everything on your bucket list.",
          "We stopped here with the thousands of other tourists but I failed to see why people go here? I may need to get the guide book out to find out why! But we went and we seen along with loads others. There are loads of more interesting places not full of people on Rome. The place",
          "The steps & statues etc are nice but certainly not overwhelming. Very busy & lots of guys trying to sell you selfie sticks etc. Watch your wallet!",
          "Very crowded later in the day. Best to go in the morning...and approach the steps from the bottom up.",
          "Don\u2019t expect too much, it\u2019s just an overcrowded space of a load of steps that you can\u2019t sit on. It\u2019s kind of on the tourist route of things to see but not worth a special visit",
          "This was our first day in Rome and we went in the evening. The place was buzzing with people and looked even better (than pictures) with all the lights. A brilliant sight surrounded by beautiful cobbled streets.",
          "We walked by after visiting Vatican City. The area looks amazing. There were tons of people walking around. Every time someone sat on the steps to take pictures, there was a guard making them get up. We did not go upstairs because we were tired from doing Vatican City.",
          "As we had just visited the Trevi Fountain it made sense to see the Spanish Steps which were a short walk away. They are in a good area surrounded with designer shops and lots of places to eat. Had to be done!",
          "You get there and there's some steps up to a church. There's a view of Rome from the top and its nice enough. But there's a lot of other pretty great places so I'd skip this if I was pushed for time.",
          "Beautiful area with top shops and beautiful architecture and statues. Just watch your step going up and down these steps. Steep and don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to go up and down multiple times.",
          "Loved this area. We took the metro back here several times to shop/eat.You can get great photos here.",
          "A gorgeous area of Rome! You need to visit Piazza di Spagna and climb the steps for a spectacular view of the city. The shopping around the Piazza is fabulous... all the posh and luxury brands you think of when you think of Italian fashion have shops in and around the Piazza.",
          "During the week we spent in Rome, I visited the Spanish Steps on several occasions, and the best time to visit is early in the morning before the tourists begin to wander about with their potentially dangerous selfie-sticks. The steps begin at the Piazza di Spagna and ascend to",
          "These steps are magnificent.....alas you can't see them because of all the people and if you stand still for just a moment to try and take it all in, you will be mobbed by very pushy street vendors. If you're one of those tourists who try to sit down for that much loved selfie,",
          "The steps themselves are underwhelming, with lots of stewards making sure you didn't dally too long, or sit down. The church at the top looked excellent and the view was good, but make no mistake, this is a big set of stairs and that's it.",
          "We were probably unlucky in that the area was so crowded on a Sunday morning and we couldn't really appreciate the fountain and the steps",
          "Beautiful location but a bit underwhelming. Crowded of course and glad we went, however not sure I'd go back again. Been there, done that.",
          "Stayed in boutique hotel by Spanish steps. Just beautiful! There\u2019s a restaurant at the top that is outside-drinks or dinner overlooking the steps. When you walk down the steps, the hustle and bustle of city is right there!",
          "Maybe I am too sentimental but this is definetly one of my favourite places in Rome. You can really feel the atmosphere of Italian grande bellezza.",
          "Lovely atmospheric spot but the city has now decided they are not for sitting one- shame on you as one of the joys of the city used to be sitting on the side people watching- always seemed to be more people going down than up ( there is a free lift just next the Metropolitana",
          "We walked down the stairs rather than up and I suffer from vertigo so I was pleased I had a wall and/or a rail to hold on to and very pleased nobody was able to sit in my pathway. Worth a visit if you have time but the Vatican and St Peter's and the Colliseum are more important",
          "These 135 steps were built in 1726 to connect Piazza di Spagna with Pincio hill and the church Trinita dei Monti. Since constructed these steps have become a movie star, starring in many films shot in Rome. Take a climb to the top for a nice view of the stairway and Piazza di",
          "Beautiful site to visit with increasingly better views the higher you climb! Don\u2019t worry, there are sets of 12 steps then a platform step...then 12 more, repeat! Free exercise, as is much of Rome!",
          "You need to read up on the history or have a guide. Part of an evening walking our, (which I highly recommend) but without some history, just another set of sets in Rome.",
          "Whatever you may think of it, you must see it and maybe also walk up and down the steps. Crowded of course and a place to catch the sunset. A nice view and plenty of good restaurants nearby. Well worth a visit.",
          "This is an amazing experience, the only thing is that there are pickpockets everywhere and it is very busy! I recommend to go later in the evening where they have the lights! This is a better way to enjoy it. P.S don\u2019t buy any water sold from random people! It\u2019s not healthy.",
          "Really don\u2019t see what the fuss is all about here, it was by far the busiest site yet there is nothing to see, yes the steps are historic but at the end of the day it\u2019s a flight of steps!",
          "A must see of Rome. Was pretty busy so don't expect to be able to get a photo by yourself and don't sit down. The tourist police are a real thing",
          "They go up. Maybe it's because this is a \"modern\" attraction compared to the rest of Rome, but it didn't do much for me. A nice view from the top, but the steps themselves aren't much to look at. Watching people try to sit on them on the other hand, that's fun.",
          "...because you\u2019re tired of your day(s) of visiting Rome. And you\u2019ll see what will happen. Quite funny ;)",
          "This is such a pretty part of Rome. Be sure to climb to the steps for an amazing view and remember not to sit on the steps or you will be asked to stand by local officials.",
          "Very cool to see but only for a few minutes to take a photo. It does get very crowded so need to go early",
          "Just famous because of their location next to the fountain, they\u2019re nothing special in themselves. Major tourist trap area with loads of hawkers and overpriced restaurants etc. Snap the obligatory photo and move on rapidly.",
          "Very disappointed in these. Pictures make them look bigger and more spectacular than they are. Absolutely mobbed when we were there.",
          "We approached the steps on foot walking from our hoteluhu. We entered them from the top. Going this was they aren\u2019t nearly as dramatic as going up them, from the bottom. Nice but not spectacular",
          "It is great here and I've spent weeks in Rome but if you are only here for a short time it's not on my must see list. It used to be a place to sit, people watch and regroup but now it's whistle blowing and crowded. You can no longer sit!! 2018 yes people sitting all over",
          "We went here to see the locals hanging out and playing the guitar. It was lovely and not as touristic as we thought.",
          "Beautiful location in centre Rome. Great view from top of stairway so remember to climb up. No cost unless you buy a bottle of water or a souvenir at the shops or many salesmen.",
          "Wow...and to think these steps were built centuries ago. So much history throughout Rome. Definitely one must see the Spanish Steps when in Rome.",
          "The Spanish Steps are a large marble staircase that leads up to a church. They are one of those popular spots that is overwhelmed with people during the day. So popular, that now sitting is not permitted on the steps is enforced by city workers in yellow vests. The white marble",
          "Lots of steps that take you up to knowhere in particular from somehere else a bit lower down. Nice to say you've been, but not sure why you would want to go as Rome has lots of more interesting things to do with your time.",
          "Its not as many steps as it looks like. You know you can do it. With that said, its a bit overrated and just several flights of marble stairs and another opportunity for some illegal vendor to self something worthless to you.",
          "It's nice to see, but all the guide books tell you you can sit here & watch the world go by, you can't or if you do you get told to move by people with whistles & florescent jackets!",
          "We stayed at The Hassler at the top of the Spanish Steps so we were up and down about three times a day. Great exercise to walk off all the great food we ate. You look at the Spanish Steps from the bottom and they are a beautiful sight. People come from all around the world to",
          "A splendid atmosphere Thousands of visitors from all over the world. Tens of languages Great restaurants A lot of security forces. People are singing others are selling toys for the little ones A big party\u2019s atmosphere",
          "Iconic steps built by the French in the Spanish district. Tiring walking up them after a long day walking around Rome. You got to do it though when in Rome.",
          "Way too many tourists and then pne can't even sit on the stairs - which would be the fun thing to do. So now you can walk up and walk down...",
          "Beautiful plaza just off the Subway (Metro). Theres are great Bubble Tea and Gelato places just as you exit the subway station before you turn the corner to see the steps.",
          "The canonic site that even bob dilan mentioned in one of his songs...very romantic. Dont miss climing to the top of the stairs to see a wonderfull site!",
          "A beautiful set of stairs made from travertine that joins 2 piazzas. Despite no longer being allowed to sit on the steps there are still crowds of people standing on them so it is really hard to actually see their beauty.",
          "So basically it's just a big flight of stairs, packed with people and you cant sit on them. It's a must to check off your list of things to see in Rome, but we spent maybe 10mins there, took some pics and left.",
          "A beautiful set of steps, but it is just that, stairs. If pressed for time in Rome, you might want to give the Spanish Steps a miss.",
          "If you thought you might stop by and sit on the steps with a glass of wine or a gelato, forget about that. None of these things are aloud any more. You can sit around the lovely fountain at the bottom if a place becomes available. Well policed, no restaurants, many people.",
          "Although the Spanish Steps are crowded and touristy, they are definitely worth a visit. Good picture taking site and good gelato nearby. Climb them as the sun is going down and the view over Rome is beautiful!",
          "Lots of steps! Wear comfy shoes and wear sunblock because the steps reflect a lot of light. Also sunglasses would help. It would be more enjoyable if they eliminated street vendors.",
          "People visit this place during the day as well as night to spend time together. Though a bit tiring to climb up the stairs, it is worth gping over and over again",
          "In my opinion, the Spanish Steps is one of those \u201cok, what\u2019s next\u201d kind of things. Its pretty and very crowded. If you are on your first trip to Rome, I would say go check it out. It\u2019s not something I would go back to a second time to see it again though.",
          "On the list, Vatican, colosseum, Trevi, etc... We started at the borghese gardens where the views are amazing and it is peaceful before walking down to the very busy Steps, fountain and square. Lots of people, it\u2019s free so they all go. They are lovely, make a nice photo and then",
          "The Spanish steps are heaving with people trying to sell you you things. Be aware of pick pocketing. It\u2019s a good place to walk around when you\u2019re visiting Rome",
          "It is a nice piece of architecture, but the crowds around make it one of most overadvertised location.",
          "I loved Spanish steos more than any other Piazza in Rome. During day and also night it has a wonderful view, beautiful lights, and a lot of friendly people.In this area are located brands like Kenzo and others the same type.",
          "Must visit when in Rome, sited close to upmarket shopping area, lots of nearby restaurants and bars, recommended",
          "Loved it here - lovely little church at the top and the view from there is magnificent and although there were lots of tourists there was room to stop and take in the atmosphere and spend some time just relaxing. Lovely fountain at the bottom",
          "It\u2019s been a few years since we ventured the Spanish Steps and since the last time we were there you can actually walk the steps with out walking over someone. The have stair police who make sure you done sit. The have no issue with you standing for photos but don\u2019t sit or you",
          "Again, very busy attraction but a must visit when in Rome. Be careful of your valuables. The location is well signposted and, when walking there, be careful of the volume of traffic.",
          "Yes, it is just a set of steps leading up from a fountain. No, you can't sit down on them (you will be encouraged to get up by the team on patrol) and when we were there a couple were using this for their wedding photographs. That said, it is worth a quick stop and photo",
          "We got off the hop on hop off bus and had to walk several blocks to get there. Disappointed, the stairs and plaza were nice but nothing special. Not worth the time and effort.",
          "Had been warned that this was an area where you get hassle from people begging and trying to sell you things, yes they are there, but if you are firm but polite they leave you alone. Very busy tourist attraction but well worth the climb to the top to appreciate the view. Wanted",
          "A busy part of the city again, went on the bus tour and got of at stop 7, not the easiest places to find and down some steep hills. Finally got to it by walking towards the large crowd at the bottom of it don\u2019t look for the fountain at the bottom as the majority of the time",
          "Not only do the steps attract crowds but the area. Lots of shops and eateries surround these iconic Roman steps. You really should walk up or down them. How many are there? A must see on any Roman holiday",
          "No visit to Rome is complete without visiting and climbing the Spanish Steps. The church at the top is beautiful, the views lovely and it\u2019s a gathering place for many. Alas, you can no longer sit on the steps without being asked to get up and move.",
          "The Spanish Steps are magical, particularly late in the afternoon as the sun illuminates them in a warm Roman light. I lived nearby for some months and never stopped enjoying walking up and down and sometimes sitting on the steps. Alas you no longer can sit without a public \u201cno",
          "It's a beautiful scene to watch once... Loses its glamor though after your first visit. Not like the other squares in Rome where you can go daily to enjoy.",
          "Despite the huge crowd, it was definitely worthwhile to climb the stairs and look over the city, and then to visit the Borghese Gallery, which is within walking distance. P.S. it is forbidden to sit on the steps, the security guards will whistle.",
          "Our hotel is located nearby Spanish steps, This place is quiete interesting and great view on the very top, just be aware those whose giving roses \ud83c\udf39 just ignore and stay away, they will ask you a money in return ( be safe and stay away ), and theres also churches nearby.. all",
          "Thought it was absolutely beautiful. I had gone as a child and going this time made me appreciate the historic and architecture of the area. Went in early September and it was very busy! Beautiful!",
          "You have to do the Spanish steps! The church at the top is lovely too. Make sure to follow the rules at the stairs or security will blow their whistle at you! No sitting on stairs, no standing on ledge.",
          "Located in a nice neighborhood. A gathering place. No tickets or lines. Our hotel was very close to the Spanish steps. If you go up the stairs, you are only 10 minutes ( walk) from Borghese park and museum.",
          "A great place. You have to climb around 135 steps.The climb is not difficult.We took photo shoot and watched people.A great piece of architecture with impressive palaces and other buildings around it.Lovely architecture.",
          "At 72 and even with three stairways in my home to keep me in shape, I was worried about the climb until I got to the Spanish steps. They are lovely with a deep tread and a shallow rise. Best to go with a friend and only a short walk away from Trevi Fountain. Rome is a city of",
          "Very beautiful to experience and be there and take it all in. Lovely photographs to be taken as memories",
          "Visited the Spanish steps after seeing all of Rome's other amazing sites, so it did not give the 'whow' that we were expecting. Having said that, it is a great place for meeting others, to spend a moment in thought sitting by the Old Boat Waterfall at the bottom of the steps, in",
          "All of Rome was amazing! A walk-able city and everywhere you turn your head the views, the buildings, the people are all wonderful. The sunset at the top of the Spanish Steps is well-worth the climb.",
          "By the time we reached Spanish step, it was dark and less crowded. So we rested, did photo shoot and watched people. The shops around were all high brands and good to watch. There is a sephora nearby.",
          "Bustling place with eateries and lovely shops. Great meeting place and good view from the top of the steps.",
          "A great piece of architecture with impressive palaces and other buildings around it. There is also a great buzz and vibe about this place and there are throngs of people",
          "OK, I have never seen so many people in one place. The steps look easy enough to climb when you start but by the time you climb the 138 steps you are exhausted. So if you have any issues with health don't try it as you are not allowed to sit on the Steps. . Maybe just take in",
          "A really crowded place. It is a place nice to have in your to do for Rome but for siee not one of my favorites.",
          "Spent a lovely time at the Spanish steps the view from the top is very nice to see very glad I visited hete",
          "There is nothing extraordinary about the Spanish Steps. They are famous due to their inclusion in Hollywood masterpieces but at the end of the day they are just steps leading up to the Spanish embassy. Of more interest is the Bernini fountain at the foot of the stairs. The Steps",
          "The steps themselves are wide and separated into three sections. The climb is not difficult. The view at the top is good, even better from the church steps. This was easy to find by taking the Metro Linea A to Spagna station. It\u2019s a busy area and sitting on the steps is",
          "Good meeting place at the base of the steps. Famous spot. But just really steps that lead to the top! Not sure i understand the hype. Good photo op from the top, however.",
          "We couldn\u2019t quite figure out what all of the fuss was about to be honest. There\u2019s no information available at the site so we spent some time researching online to understand the historic significance of them. Overall, quite underwhelming.",
          "The Spanish steps are iconic to Rome! They are smaller than I expected, but still beautiful, and they are what they are! It is a great photo spot with the cathedral in the background. It is lovely to climb the steps and look at everything from a bit higher. The surrounding area",
          "Below are several shops from high ends to just souvenir items. The steps are so wonderful grear for all social media. It is strictly guarded one is not allowed sit there for long",
          "At almost all hours of the day and night, you will likely encounter a crush of tourists gaping at the exquisite artistry of the Spanish steps, which take their name from the nearby Spanish embassy. Watch your wallet/purse and join in the fun! It\u2019s a great place for people",
          "Definitely worth spending atleast 30 minutes at this place. It is legally banned to sit on the steps now. The place is very lively and beautiful.",
          "Of course you have to seem them. Everybody does. I mean... everybody is here! Pretty but crowded. Probably better to visit them off season in order to enjoy them.",
          "Beautiful steps leading from a beautiful square, great views, and great photo opportunity for the instagrammers out there !",
          "Rome wouldn\u2019t be Rome without a visit to the Spanish Steps. However, there is currently an obsession with stopping people sitting down on them so expect your visit to be marred by incessant whistle blowing by the police as they try to get some poor unsuspecting tourist to stand",
          "Lovely architecture, a nice spot to catch the sunset and some beautiful views. For me, the Column of the Immaculate Conception was the highlight of the area.",
          "Worth a stroll to visit! It is a nice spot for photos, and the top of the steps has a great view of the city.",
          "We visited The Spanish Steps on our first afternoon in Rome and we enjoyed it. The view up to the church at the top of the steps is impressive and the view from the top of the steps across the city is even better. You\u2019re not allowed to sit on the steps anymore (if you do the",
          "After too many years away from Rome, I reconnected with an opportunity to visit with my wife. The Spanish Steps are quiet high up in Rome, so expect some walking at elevation. Like the Trevi Fountain, lots of tourists but worth the visit.",
          "My wife told me of the history of lovers on these steps. Although it is no longer possible to sit and eat gelato on the steps; it is still possible to eat gelato while in this piazza and recall the movies of the 50's. The actual history of the steps? Visit and find out! Also",
          "Not sure what we expected but the Spanish Steps are a little disappointing- better at night than day. Would visit all other sites in Rome before this one.",
          "Big climb up the steps for photo opportunities but other than the marvel of architecture I wouldn't have been disappointed if I didn't see it.",
          "Always a great Rome landmark, but now that you are not allowed to sit on the steps...it is less crowded and cleaner.",
          "Hard to get excited about a few stone steps. Beautiful and a lovely setting nestled amid some stunning buildings... but still. They\u2019re steps. Made of stone. No surprises here.",
          "Nice place near to the Borghese gardens. If you seek to have a nice view and a shopping aswell thats a place for you. Better to visit in earlier hours or at latest hours of afternoon.",
          "Our most memorable experience in Rome was a late afternoon spent at the Spanish Steps. Illuminated by the soft golden light of sunset, this place is magical. There was a huge crowd, but we were never hassled. Not a pick-pocket in sight. Our visit was topped off by a meal at",
          "When we visited in 2016 there was a fence in front of the steps, they were being restored, this time they were beautiful. Very busy, many tourists, still a must see. When I was there in 2000, we sat on the steps and ate gelato, now the carbonara will blow a whistle and make",
          "It is a beautiful sight from down the stairs. You can take wonderful pictures from there. Is a must to visit",
          "If you dont do some historical review of this place, when you come you will have no idea why these steps are so famous. To you, they will be like any other steps...nothing special, with a nice view of a church in the background. However, if you do some research and look up the",
          "This attraction was a five minute walk from our hotel Fontanella Borghese.There were a lot of people round here and we visited twice and had a nice Pizza in one of the restaurants nearby.",
          "Be prepared to share another beautiful Roman site with crowds of tourists, no matter what time of the year you visit. This time however they disallow people to sit on the steps,including the sides (which are like benches) so the steps are full of people standing but not",
          "You have to see this but it is generally underwhelming when compared against the many other art relics and architecture in Rome",
          "...and not as impressing as I hoped... For sure, if you are architecture freak, you will appreciate the little details and the way the stairs were built...if not, well, you will say \u201cbeen there, here is my selfie\u201d",
          "Busy busy busy! But worth a visit, the atmosphere in the surrounding area was great! People sightseeing, shopping (oh the designer shopping!!), street performers and friends meeting. The steps themselves are crowded and constantly flowing with people all good naturedly trying",
          "We used the Spanish Steps a lot to orient ourselves in a Rome. Great views from the top but keep walking north from the top of the steps along tree lined street to look down on Piazza Poppolo . From here you can climb up and enter the Gardens. Great buskers and the Villa",
          "The only time to see this place is before most are awake. With so many tourists, the steps could not be appreciated. It was nothing to speak of!",
          "Actually we were not looking for Them, however thy appear facing during early in the night inviting you for visit ing it.. real and Beaty images from the city up on the hill, only opposed by many of salwsmwn at streets",
          "Personally I didn\u2019t massively see the Wow factor here... we\u2019d walked up lots of steps in Rome and just seemed full of people trying to get that perfect Instagram photo so frankly a bit irritating! If tight for time in Rome then don\u2019t bother.",
          "I visited the Spanish Steps many times during our visit to Rome in August 2019. Our hotel was located near there. On this trip I did not climb the Spanish Steps like I have done in the past but that is definitely worth doing. The Spanish Steps are especially busy during the",
          "Lobed the steps didnt love the random man that came up to my husband and started talking about weird things while wrapping strings around his finger and making a stupid bracelet that he forced us into paying for he asked for 15 euros and the thing is he had a another man with",
          "High end shopping are, all the designers are there, prices are good, loved the horse carriage ride a bit expensive but worth it. Quit organised and well kept. Many good restaurants nearby",
          "Really good site and free to boot. Great photo opportunities but you cannot sit on the stairs or walls, authorities constantly keeping crowds on their feet. I thought this was good as you get better pictures with the steps comparatively clear.",
          "Lots of stairs walk up in sections or you will be very tired great view once your at the top vendors are also be the church",
          "Busy area. Steps are Nice the view is great. There is park Up Top which had a great view. Hold onto bags it\u2019s busy and you can easily lose things.",
          "The Spanish steps and Spanish square are a really good place to visit when in Rome. At the beginning of the stairs there is a beautiful church that is worth visiting. Also great view from up-stairs.",
          "Good views from the top of the steps and lots of fancy shops around them. However, they are steps so I couldn't get that excited by them. You are not allowed to stop or sit on them. As most places in Rome, always worth a quick look. The little streets around them are worth a",
          "The top of the stairs gives a good view of area, but many steps up. The fountain at the base is very nice. Have attendants there so no one sits on steps.",
          "we walked here from our hotel . lots of people on these steps and a nice fountain at the bottom. Nice view from the top.",
          "Maybe I was numbed by all the other sites in Rome but I have to admit I was underwhelmed at The Spanish Steps. Perhaps I thought steps in another language were somehow different than the steps I grew up with. There are a lot of steps leading up to a nice little church - which",
          "Beautiful steps but very crowded. Lots and lots of street sellers who are persistent just tell them to get lost. Security moving people on all the time. You couldn\u2019t stop and sit on the steps. This is where we saw beggars for the first time. Expensive tourist area. It\u2019s a \u201cbeen",
          "This is such an iconic sight following Audrey Hepburn\u2019s legacy! In reality it\u2019s so crowded and compromised by dodgy Indians shoving roses in your face - the only time in 7 weeks travelling I felt my personal space invaded. Also had the most expensive beer ever at the top!!!",
          "a lot of people spend great time here. I think his place would be more peacefull in silent time of the year.",
          "One of the \u2018to do\u2019 things in Rome, was not impressed with the guys persistently trying to flog Roses! If time is limited in Rome, would rather go to the Trevi fountain or coliseum.",
          "It\u2019s just some very crowded marble steps, built by the French ironically. Not really an attraction in itself. You are surrounded by the sound of whistles as the city police stop anyone sitting on them.",
          "This was high on the list to walk the Spanish Steps. When in Rome , walk the Steps ! Just BEWARE ! NO sitting down or eating there. The police are very strict lately because of tourists not having respect for ancient treasures like this. Great view from the top overlooking the",
          "Each time we have visited Rome the steps have been having work done on them. This time the sun was shining and the place is full of excited happy people. A really lovely spot to sit and enjoy watching the world go round.",
          "We found this on our own. After one tour by WALKAWAYS we got our bearings and used the METRO. Cheap and easy....12.50\u20ac per person for three days, unlimited trips on all transport excluding high speed trains an those going to the Airports. Spanish steps and Chapel above a",
          "This is always on the list of things to see while in Rome. They are beautiful but with crowds it\u2019s hard to see the steps. I would advise an early morning visit.",
          "Nice to see, but I don't know why it is so popular. You just walk through... Mi\u0142o zobaczy\u0107, ale czemu to jest takie popularne? Mo\u017cna przej\u015b\u0107 i wystarczy.",
          "The steps are okay but there are way nicer things to see in Rome. Lots of people and in comparison to other Roman must sees these are okay but didn\u2019t wow us like some of the other things we have seen in beautiful Rome.",
          "It is worth to stop there for a while and take some pictures. Unfortunately there are always so many tourists that even taking a nice picture can take a moment.",
          "A lovely place to visit, but beaware donot sit on any parts of the steps the police will blow a whistle at you to stand. You can take photos but only if you are standing. There is a church on the top and a foundation at the bottom where you can sit and fill your bottle up.",
          "We really packed a lot into less than 21 hours in Rome on our way to Cephalonia, Greece. Lunch, The Vatican, Museum, Sistine Chapel, St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, dinner, Trevi Fountain, and the Spanish Stairs is an ambitious (and exhausting) 20 hours. I\u2019m so glad we did it! Rome is",
          "A lot of hype Yes but still a magnificent feature of Rome well worth a visit a must for proposals two while we were there It\u2019s part of the culture of Rome",
          "Since the stairs have been cleaned, there is no sitting on them. Pictures can be taken while standing. Police force is there to keep stairs clear. It\u2019s my understanding that the cost was over one million dollars. Still worth seeing.",
          "We went before the Police started to stop people sitting on the steps. So didn't really see the steps as there were hundreds of people sat on them! The whole area was swarming with people and I didn't really get why it was so special. With all the amazing historical spots in",
          "We were there in one afternoon. Full of people took photos left, right and center. simply I did not see the beauty of it apart from people watching from the top. May be the place would be very attractive at night?!",
          "Well worth a visit and it\u2019s recommended to climb to the top as there are excellent views across Rome and theres a beautiful church which is free to enter",
          "In the evening, with beautiful lights, this place is really romantic. Unfortunately you cannot sit on the stairs, view from the top is very good. There are some nice restaurant near. From the steps you can easily go to the park where Galeria Borghese is locsted, or to the",
          "There are 136 steps to get to near the top then a further 36 steps takes you to the top and what a view. Well worth a visit and look at the architecture. I loved the obelisks that have Egyptian hieroglyphics.",
          "Wonderful Rome, the eternal city, with many monuments, one of my favorite is without doubts Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti.",
          "I have heard all about the Spanish Steps but did actually know the history, I climbed and got views of Rome, easier than queuing for hours at the dome at St.Peters, my partner tried to sit but got whistled by police to move on. Worth a look, to say you have been there,",
          "The top of the Spanish Steps are a great spot to catch the sunset and beautiful city views. You are not allowed to sit on the fountain or steps anymore but I saw a few people do it and get whistled by the police. It\u2019s a weird situation that Rome no allows this and have",
          "The Spanish Steps are three flights of quite steep steps - 174 in total -representing the Trinity - Father, Son and Holy Spirit - sited at the top is a quite large church the Trinita dei Monti. At the bottom is Fontana della Barcaccia - a fountain that people were wading in to",
          "I don't get the hype. They are just normal stairs and everybody's taking pictures only because they are famous. But that wasn't the bad part. We were harassed by police who won't let you sit even 1 minute on them, as if you would distory them. And I was staying because my legs",
          "These stairs are in the middle of the very busy area. The views from the top are awesome and shopping in this area is superb. When you go to the top of Spainish steps you will a painter with large beautiful painting and they are absolutely worth buying. Loved it",
          "Skip it if you have limited time. It\u2019s a pretty staircase, but that\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s a little further than everything else in Rome. It is in a nice shopping district, so if you are a fan of high end fashion, it might be worth it.",
          "The Spanish Steps as an attraction are very simple and from the bottom they don\u2019t really seem that interesting or impressive. Instead, I recommend going to the top of the stairs where there is a beautiful view over Rome, especially in the evening.",
          "The steps are interesting, but well down on the must-do list of Rome's attractions. We climbed the steps in August's heat, hoping to find cool respite at a restaurant at the top, and access to the Trinita dei Monti church. We were disappointed in both - nothing was open. There",

          "The place consists of four attractions. 1) a small French chapel sitting on the top of a low hill. It has an eye-catching twin tower, overlooking the piazza at below. 2) connecting this chapel to the piazza is the famous Spanish Steps - twelve flights, with a total of 137",
          "We had to visit the steps because of their historical value. We walked up and down the steps. Great view from the top. Small fountain at the base of the steps. You can't sit on the steps any longer. Very touristy.",

          "Take a walk up or down the Spanish steps, good views either way. Police now stop you from sitting anywhere on the steps. Small fountain at the bottom in the piazza. Lovely church to see at top.",
          "Climbed the steps just to say I did. Don\u2019t you dare sit on the steps, you will get a talking to by the step police. Nice exercise climbing to the top with a pretty church at the top.",
          "Very busy tourist area. Stairs are well patina\u2019d / worn. Be carful when crowded and a bit wet. Also, a lot of pan handlers trying to sell everything including roses..... yet another marvel of Rome.",
          "Spanish steps are one of the must see places in Rome, not much to do. Do not sit on the steps as the police will whistle at you to stand up",
          "While the Spanish Steps are beautiful I\u2019m not sure what the fuss is all about. It was very crowded when we came in the afternoon & there were many tour groups about as well as individual tourists. Other than the lovely church at the top I think I would\u2019ve just skipped this if",
          "Definitely worth a visit, but hard to compare it to the so many other sites to see. Great place for a photo.",
          "Not too far from the Tevi fountain depending on how accurate your guide book is. Mine wasn't! An impressive view at the bottom looking up and an even more impressive one looking down those 294 steps into the piazza below. Has a certain style about it.",
          "Visited this spot twice. Once from the top and second from bottom. Unfortunately both times were on very hot September days and very crowded.",
          "The Spanish Steps are located in an exciting part of Rome. You will get good exercising walking the full flight. The steps are wide and easy to walk either up or down. Beware of the flower vendors who give your wife or girlfriend flowers, then come to you for some money - they",
          "Went on a very hot September day. The place is very busy all day long, but it doesn't feel too busy because the steps are very wide and there are about 130 of them",
          "Beautiful but do not sit on the steps or you will be whistled at by the poliza!! Nice area for upscale shopping",
          "High end shops at the foot of the Spanish Steps. Gucci, Prada, the list goes on. Not affordable to the average person I would think but interesting to see and many beautiful items to pick from. The steps are impressive and gives you a great view of the city.",
          "One of the most beautiful places in Rome.Here you can feel the real Italy,people sing and dance.Also this is the best shopping place in Rome,a number of well-known brand shops are here.",
          "We loved that the local police keep people from sitting down on the steps It means you can see and photograph them as you are meant to see them. We walked up and down, the steps are very slippery so take your time. Also very close to a Metro station which is very handy to see",
          "Best to visit st night when there are no tourists and everything is under the lights. Beautiful fountain at the base and church at the top. Walk the steps to see the view from the top. Won\u2019t take you long at this stop.",
          "Go for the spectacular view, stay for the many sites. Shopping, eating and of course people watching. The Spanish Steps is quite a climb but grab a gelato and take the journey up. You won't be disappointed. It is a place to gather - I think every tourist and local alike was",
          "One of Rome best tourist attraction A must see. Dont forget to climb the steps and see the panoramic view of Rome from the upstairs...",
          "The Spanish Steps were lovely, there were a couple of vendors there who were weary but not near as bad as it might be at the major attractions",
          "God help someone with a disability or the elderly or pregnant women that happens to need a few mins breather on the Spanish Steps, whatever you do don't sit down don't slouch on the walls of you Will get a whistle blown at you!!! Total over reaction.",
          "The steps are obviously iconic and a must see if in Rome but it was incredibly busy and what was more annoying was the hoards of gentlemen attempting to palm roses off on us, they were persistent to say the least. The architecture is impressive and it has featured in such iconic",
          "Over crowded, you can\u2019t seat or relax on it. Police officers all over and watch you like a hawks. Best time to go is sunset.",
          "Here\u2019s why. You cannot sit on the steps, not that you should anyway. The view from the top looking down is an anticlimax...The fountain at the bottom is small by comparison to the Trevi and Navona fountains. The hoards of tourists that get in the way make this a not photographic",
          "We walked up and down the Spanish steps as it was located close to our hotel in Rome. Best to go early in the morning to avoid the crowds. There is a new law now that you can\u2019t sit on the steps but we did see people sitting on them. If in Rome it\u2019s worth a visit. There is",
          "The Spanish Steps have huge history behind built in the early 1720-30s the steps have weathered 2 world wars. Anything less than a 5 is crazy. Bad meal at a restaurant, I can understand a 4,3. But a landmark.",
          "Spanish steps are in a central road of Rome with great surroundings. It is near to the shops and these steps offer a nice place for resting after walking around the town.",
          "Honestly thought there would be more color in the Spanish steps. Ofcourse, you have to see the steps if you\u2019re in Rome, but I\u2019ve seen prettier steps. Just a FYI, don\u2019t sit on the steps. They recently made it illegal for people to sit on the steps.",
          "It's free to enter and there is a museum inside. You can take am elevator to the top for \u20ac10 and the views are incredible. Would definitely recommend it. Don't go up the side steps and we did because its closed off and you will only realise that after climbing 96 steps and",
          "We visited Rome in August 2019 and only had one day before our cruise began, so it was decided to go to the Spanish Steps. We selected a hotel in the area where a walk to the steps would be manageable. The weather was quite hot but that did not diminish the size of the crowds.",
          "This is a beautiful spot to get a wonderful view of the area. We went on a Sunday so it was great to visit the Church as well.",
          "I am glad that I was able to walk a short distance from our hotel to see the Spanish Steps. For years I've heard about them and maybe I was just a bit let down. I'm please that people are not able to sit and linger/eat on the steps but the whistles got to be a bit much in the",
          "It's so overcrowded day and night that you can't even have a good look at the whole thing. Not mention having a photo without hundreds of people around you! You can't sit on the steps anymore and it's funny and entertaining to watch the wardens with the whistles telling people",
          "A sight to see while in Rome of course! They no longer allow people to sit on the steps, which is great for better photos :)",
          "Somewhat interesting attraction right off the Spagna Metro station. We walked all the way up and visited the nice church at the top of the hill. Gave us something to do for free.",
          "You can drink out of the fountain spouts of the fountain at the base of the steps. Be smart! Do NOT leave your valuables available to pick-pocketers. Pick Pocketing is a problem if you leave yourself vulnerable.",
          "Just a short walk from our hotel. We visited the Spanish steps just as the sun was going down. Very Rome and a site.",
          "To be honest- we expected something absolut outstanding. Was not the case. It\u2019s a nice overcrowded stairs. The policia has been very rude as it seems not to be allowed to sit down or lean anywhere.",
          "Beautiful landmark, especially during sunset. It almost always gets crowded but is worth a visit in the evening.",
          "New local laws mean no sitting on the steps infractions will draw the attention of local law enforcement and you don't want a fine spoiling your visit",
          "We made the most of the tour bus which dropped us 10mons from here, great view from the top of the steps. Very busy with people but still worth a visit. Bellisimo",
          "Our Hotel was near the Spanish Steps so had to go & see them I was amazed at how beautiful the setting was I\u2019m glad we were at the top it was a shame there were so many touts who wanted money for plastic flowers, I believe your not allowed to sit on the Steps any more , they are",
          "Take a stroll in the evening to the Spanish Steps, but realize the police no longer allow sitting in the steps.",
          "The Spanish Steps are 138 irregularly-shaped steps. They connect the lower Piazza di Spagna with the upper piazza Trinita dei Monti, overlooked by the Trinita dei Monti Church. At the bottom of the steps you can see the Fontana della Barcaccia, Fountain of the Old Boat.It is a",

          "Spanish Steps on Piazza di Spagna is one the \"must see\" spot for visitors. The area looks more tidy during our visit there by end Aug because people are not allowed to sit and eat on the steps. Come and see the difference.",
          "Steps were beautiful to see, wonderful piece of architecture, just a shame the experience gets spoilt by crowds of pushy street sellers, trying to force flowers into your hands a demand you pay for them.",
          "Spanish steps were beautiful and once at the top you have amazing views . It wasn\u2019t overly crowded you can hear people playing music along the way .",
          "It is a bit crowded during busy season. You can just relax and watch the surroundings or enjoy a cup of fresh roasted chestnuts.",
          "If you don\u2019t like crowds then you best to avoid this spot during busy seasons. Rude local restaurant staff and far too many panhanlders. Once is enough here. Sunset was spectacular but we felt unwelcome so we opted to spend our money elsewhere. High end shops in this district",
          "Spanish step is a place where the tourists and local hang out on. You can go there to people watch or eat gelato. You have people out listening to music or reading a book.",
          "Loved the steps, you can actually enjoy them now with no one sitting everywhere You get there by metro from Colosseum or walking",
          "Very nice but crowded place. Attractive to take a picture, although you need to prepare for a BIG crowd of people. The carabinieri are very disappointing, as soon as someone sat on the stairs for a photo, they immediately chased away and whistled.",
          "It was quite pretty I give you that but it is a little overhyped and I was a little underwhelmed. It's smaller than I thought too",
          "As most of other roma's attractions its in the center , you may end up there from any direction, worth a visit",
          "It looks good and is a great place to just sit and chill in the evenings. But other than that, there is nothing special about the Spanish steps. Since we were staying in an airbnb that was just a stone throw away from the steps, we spent our evening listening to live",
          "It's a stairway...or is it just a white oven. I will say the view from up top is quite nice but it's crowded here and nothing special as a structure. There are 20 better sites in Rome. Do St Angelo's castle instead. If you like high end shopping this area is a must but the",
          "One of the must-see sights of a visit to Rome but apart from that not really much to write. An over-crowded set of steps with a pretty fountain at the bottom.",
          "While yes the Spanish steps are worth a visit to say you have been I would say they were a little underwhelming. Unsure what I expected. Stated to my partner when are we at the steps to which he replied I think we are here. Very busy during day, best to visit early morning.",
          "Great place to visit and have your picture taken. Note you can not sit on the steps otherwise you will have a whistle blown at you to remove you. A bit unnerving to start with but you get used to it.",
          "Must go and visit whilst in Rome. Be prepared for crowds and don't sit down, you will be moved! Stunning steps",
          "Straight off the metro and your right on top of them dont no what I was expecting but it was busy and very hot if you sat on the steps police blew a whistle and you were moved on",
          "Another popular location for tourists, perfect location for pictures with the views from below and above due to the number of steps one will have to climb. Be aware of the slightly aggressive street touts but they are everywhere in Rome. The area is clean, you will often hear",
          "Nice place to visit. Kids loved it. Visit in the morning it was quiet. No where to sit and take it all in was the only bad thing. Would go again.",
          "Would suggest you visit here whilst travelling to or from another attraction (On foot) esp if short if time. Don't sit on the steps otherwise you will be whistled off.",
          "Have to admit l was a bit underwhelmed, it's just steps. We saw a guy propose right in front of us so that was nice. Very crowded and hard to get a decent photo but worth a visit.",
          "Had to see the Spanish Steps mentioned in the Bob Dylan song, When I Paint my Masterpiece. This isn't a must-see, high priority, but I really enjoyed it. There are fantastic photo opportunities at the top of the stairs, across the street from the church..you can see several",
          "While our first trip to Rome, Italy, we had to climb the amazing Spanish Steps. We used the Hop on Hop off bus to get to this location, which was perfect. Beautiful site, awesome experience and a nice exhausting workout! The views are priceless from here as you ascend upward",
          "A nice area, a lot of tourists everywhere. Recommend to visit in the morning, when there is fewer people.",
          "This very crowded area is less crowded in the evening, and even more beautiful when all lit up. Nice spot for photos and an evening stroll after dinner.",
          "The Spanish Steps are a means to get to the church on top and to other streets. We enjoyed sitting on the sides to people watch and watch the musicians play at the base of the stairs. We were lucky enough to visit before the ban on sitting on the steps happened. Not sure why",
          "Another spectacular gem with a view from the top the exhibits the beautiful spires and Steeples lining the sky of Rome. Inspirational.",
          "Impressive structure but a distinct lack of information to explain why, Google again came into use and helped with the reason why they are here. A must see if in Rome on a stroll around town but do not make a specific journey here as not a great deal around other than designer",
          "Very beautiful, but difficult to enjoy in peace due to the abundance of very aggressive street merchants. They are everywhere in Rome, but ive not felt quite so harassed anywhere else. The steps themselves are cool, but the basilica at the top is comaratively unimpressive.",
          "We missed out on our last visit because they were being repaired. But now all good. Beautiful landmark in my opinion!",
          "It's a really nice place to take pictures. Really crowded but beautiful and good shops are really close. I recommend seeing it.",
          "Lovely and clean, one of the only cleanest areas we visited then we saw the shops and realised why! We only had a flying visit after a long day out already so we didn\u2019t stay long but it was very pretty.",
          "You hear a lot of police blowing their whistles at anyone sitting down. They focussed on the lower stairs - once you go up, they weren't to be seen so you could sit for a photo if you wanted to.",
          "Spanish Steps are located below the Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti Church. Created in the 18th Century to link the Church to the Spanish square below. Would recommend.",
          "As you are in Rome then this is a must see, another very busy place as all tourists head here! It is just a set of steps, albeit marble ones! You are no longer able to \u2018loiter\u2019 on the steps, so no sitting and definitely no eating or drinking on them, security blew whistles",
          "Spanish steps is famous for site of movie film in Rome. Therefore, tourist will flock to Spanish steps with its famous church and fountain at the base of the steps. Even during our visit in hot summer month of June, people still keep coming tilo enjoy the romantic steps. Spanish",
          "The Spanish steps are an iconic part of Rome, however they are unfortunately ruined by the crowds of tourists and the street sellers, who lay out all their merchandise on the Spanish steps. This is actually illegal in Rome as you cannot legally sit on these steps. Overall,",
          "Honestly the luxury shops in the area were more pleasing than the Spanish steps. Kind of underwhelming",
          "It is definitely a more private experience when you can contemplate the historical significance basically on your own.. Be there before 7am! It is wonderful!",
          "I enjoyed the Spanish Steps (if you can forgive the constant whistles being blown by the police everytime someone sits down \ud83d\ude02) We walked every step taking in the view on every level. This is a must!",

          "The spanish steps is in my opinion the most beautiful place in rome , it has something i cant explain . The only new and odd thing is the \"cop\" that keeps blowing her wistle every time someone sits on the steps. I',ve been there 2 times before (a few years ago) and i dont",
          "These stairs provide a beautiful view from the top and bottom of the stairs. The area around the Spanish steps is also worth going through as there a lot of cute shops and restaurants.",
          "Are they beautiful? Yes. Can you enjoy them? No, because several thousand other people are also trying to enjoy them. So, all you see are people milling about on a long flight of stairs. Probably best to go at a really odd time of night, such as 1AM or 2AM, and get some good",
          "Came here on our trip to Rome and It did not disappoint. They have cleaned up and made it more enjoyable. At night this place comes alive with vendors and camera flashes. An amazing piece of history is also close by and you can enjoy it all from this spot.",
          "A busy square flanked by huge steps. La Dolce Vita was filmed here. A glorious church stands proud at the top. The square has side streets with high fashion brand shops. Police stop you from stiing on the steps - beware the loud whistle!",
          "Last time we were there in 2016 or so. The steps - although beautiful and a must see and do back then as well - were not as clean as they are now. The city did a beautiful restauration job and have really cleaned it up Not as many sellers of \u2018junk\u2019 and no more graffiti or cans",
          "We walked all the way to the top and saw a gorgeous view of Rome! The downside there were vendors selling water and were very pesky. We were able to sit on the steps and relax for awhile, from reviews, I see that you are not allowed to sit anymore. Glad we were able to sit and",
          "Lovely to visit as always but strict laws take experience away ( ie not allowed to sit anywhere on steps or expect police to move you on). In saying that steps have been kept litter free.",
          "Don't be out of shape climbing up or going down the many many steps! I was taught to be polite to strangers, but the street vendors are so annoying and hardly take no for an answer. They almost came close to putting a damper on the experience...",
          "When I was 25, I visited Rome and the Spanish Steps. The steps were lined with flowers, there were sellers of coffee, gelati, etc... People would sit at the steps, enjoy their refreshment, and soak up the Roman culture while watching life stroll by the fountain. Those days are",
          "Be careful when climbing the steps, the marble gets slippery! Once at the top, take in the great city view that you\u2019ll appreciate from here. Also, take a moment to visit the church at the top, beautiful. The piazza offers some high-end shopping if you\u2019re interested.",
          "Tourists can no longer sit on the Spanish steps but can only take a picture while walking. Police keep on whistling to ensure people don't sit on the steps. Huge crowd is a hindrance for a clear picture of overall steps."

          "One of the most visited squares in Rome. This place is full of tourists. All the upscale and high-end brands are there. A nice place for window shopping or if you have cash you can buy some shoes or bags from Chanel or Dior. The area is safe as the police are available all over the area.",
          "Nice stairs... It's prohibited to sit on the stairs, there is a lot of policemen who'll remind you this \ud83d\ude09 a lot of people there even it's dark outside. Beautiful fountain downstairs and beautiful church upstairs. It's one of the \"must see\" places but there are more interesting places to visit in Rome \ud83d\ude09",
          "How does one review a flight of stairs? It's the famous Spanish steps in Rome, popular among tourist. So popular that it's now forbidden to sit down. There are guards in yellow vests whistling at people who dare to sit. However, you can still take photos while standing. Great view over the rooftops of Rome from the top of the stairs.",
          "Beautiful historical landmark with breathtaking views in the heart of the eternal city",
          "Very pretty part of The city with all the designer's shops. Nice view of the City from The top. Also it has a metro station nearby.",
          "The Spanish Steps are another lovely place you need to tick off your Rome To-Do list. Built in 1723-1725 to link the Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti church with the Piazza di Spagna (Spanish Square) below, the steps are beautifully structured. It's \u2026",
          "Highly recommend visiting in winter if you can as their a fewer tourists and the weather is still generally good. \n\nThe steps are stunning, as is the unique fountain at it\u2019s base (Though it does not have the grandeur of some of Rome\u2019s other \u2026",
          "Way smaller than expected and I was largely dissapointed by the fact thats its not allowed to sit on the stairs. I mean its a stair?? Its SUPPOSED that u can sit on it! \nIn my opinion a complete joke !",
          "The Spanish Steps are a set of steps dating from 1723, climbing a steep slope between the Piazza di Spagna at the base and Piazza Trinita dei Monti at the top dominated by Trinita dei Monti Church.\n\nThe steps are at the eastern end of the \u2026",
          "This place is not worth the hype. It\u2019s a marble staircase with a ton of people.  Spend your time at Trevi! Or the Pantheon! You\u2019re wasting your time here more than the five minutes to walk up and back down.  Check out some amazing churches instead.  Photos as of February 2020.",
          "One of the places in Rome you have too see. Climb the stairs, look around and leave. Better don't sit down, since you will be yelled at. Apparently there is also a hefty fine for sitting on the stairs.\nBe sure to read the signs about the history, as you will learn that it has zero to do with Spain :-)",
          "Just some steps. Rome has many fantastic places. This is not one of them.",
          "It's cool, because they make a big deal about them on tv.  They are just steps.  They are right next to an excellent posh shopping district.",
          "Wonderful, must visit place in Rome. Though they dont allow to sit on the steps anymore. Famous branded garments stores nearby.",
          "Beautiful architecture. Hard to actually see them however as so many people are on them! Try going early or very late to appreciate it in full splendour and calm.",
          "Beautiful place. You can feel you are actually in Rome.",
          "The famous Spanish Steps in the heart of Rome!! Amazing iconic church on the top of a hill with the beautiful skyline of Rome from the top!!  A must visit place and unique for its beautiness!! \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83d\udc4d",
          "I would say this was one of the least attractive and uninteresting monuments on my to do list in Rome. If you happen to be by the area, sure, pay a visit. But if you're going out of your way to see them, I'd highly suggest visiting any \u2026",
          "One of Rome's many amazing historical sites which are mostly free to visit. Tourist crowded (hey I was one of them) but OK.  Great restaurants and shopping nearby too; and its just a short walk to the Trevi Fountain.",
          "You're not allowed to sit on these any more. They were built by the French so the Spanish ambassador could reach the French church. Worth a visit.",
          "One of the biggest tourist magnets of Rome. We went there in the evening, during the winter and it was full of people. I guess going there is one of those must do things when in Rome. Remember not to sit and easy on the stairs. The police is there shooing people from doing just that. Also they can fine you.",
          "Always an interesting crowd.  Watch out for the rose peddlers!  They dont give you a rose for free!  Otherwise a must see.",
          "Vibrant atmosphere. How do you review a flight of stairs? Sitting down is no longer allowed, there are guards enforcing the ordinance. You can however still take pictures.",
          "Was a lovely spot to visit, advise do not sit on the steps as the police will move you off them as I found out.",
          "Beautiful view and just a shot walk to the Medici gardens.  The gardens are slightly elevated and give an even more astounding view from above.  NOTE:  It appears a new rule is in place banning sitting on the steps, Policia  were blowing \u2026",
          "The steps are a piece of art, walking up them gives you a great view of the city and a perfect photo opportunity. Would love to return back someday.",
          "The Spanish steps were a nice stop on out walk around Rome. They were quite romantic, especially near sun set.\n\nHowever the annoying scam artists completely killed a lot of the vibe. \n\nMy wife told the guy she didn't want the flowers he was \u2026",
          "The stairway was always full of sitting tourists, but now it is forbidden to sit there because many other tourists weren't able to climb the stairs anymore. This is a new rule released some weeks ago, but please respect the hard work of the \u2026",
          "Sitting is no longer allowed on the Spanish Steps.  Seems a shame it was such a wonderful tradition. Tourists have no concept of leaving a place as you found it. Please take your garbage with you. \nMeanwhile at the top of the Spanish steps is a beautiful view of Via Condotti. So just walk on down those steps and step right into Prada",
          "This is a must see.  The architecture is very beautiful. It can get quite busy so I recommend getting here early.",
          "Beautiful, nice view from the top, especially at sunset. But nothing to worry about if you missed it.",
          "Simply magical! Just simply sit and people watch while eating gelato. Night time was when we visited but it was a lamp lit staircase that won my heart",
          "Very beautiful, very romantic. There's usually live music up the steps and people gather around the beautiful fountain down the steps. You can have an exclusive view of the sunset over the city if you manage to be here in the evening. It's \u2026",
          "Great architecture and monuments. Very touristy and crowded at times. Nice spot to take memorable photos.",
          "Very nice views.  A little too crowded.    High end shopping area",
          "Nice steps. Many people ofc. Nice view \ud83c\udf05 from above. Good place to hang out with friends.",
          "Loved seeing everyone enjoying them for rest photos and of course learning about them.  So happy we were able to enjoy them also",
          "Beautiful photo opp! Gorgeous at sunset and a stunning view of the city",
          "Quite nice, but didn't appreciate it as much as  other beautiful places in Rome. Go somewhere else :)",
          "Stairs, literally. Yes it must be dramatic and cool looking up from the bottom of it, but it's too busy to enjoy it I think. Extremely busy area full of luxury shops.",
          "Nice building in the middle of a busy shopping area. At the top a nice cosy church...nothing breathtaking but still cosy and beautiful enough for you to stop there for 15 min. Just sit there and enjoy some peaceful silence. Nice view on the \u2026",
          "Romantic place and great for taking pictures..we just saw a couple propose.. Many luxury store brands close to it. Also a great place to burn calories from all the pasta and pizza you've been eating.",
          "Beautiful, romantic, busy & steep!\nWorth seeing at night as well as the day. You won't spend too long here, as there's not much to do.\nFortunately they were on our way from the hotel to the centre, so a good reason to see them anyway.",
          "This used to be a cool place to hang out \u2014 but it now it is so crowded with tourists that it is a mess. Police officers keep you from sitting on the steps, and there are so many people that you cannot see anything.",
          "Busy and lots of police blowing their whistles at everyone who sits to take a photo. Unless you need to get some cardio in for the day, I would have been content looking at my hotel stairs. View from the top was nice, but the journey to the top (and down again) was completely uneventful.",
          "It is a good walk up those stairs and down The entire area is beautiful",
          "The Spanish Steps (Italian: Scalinata di Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti) are a set of steps in Rome, Italy, climbing a steep slope between the Piazza di Spagna at the base and Piazza Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti, dominated by the Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti church at the \u2026",
          "To be quite frank. Every part of Rome is amazing but I always feel a little underwhelmed by the Spanish steps in each visit to Rome and I find the crowds coming to these steps overwhelming. Unless you are seeing them with all their flowers, \u2026",
          "Loved the whistle blowers. They kept the traffic regulated and everyone managed to take a quick picture. Well organized. Beautiful place. Watch out for peddlers offering you flowers and taking pics with your phones. Do NOT give them your phones. They ask for 20\u20ac for taking a picture!!! Big scam.",
          "One of many historic spots in the city. Cool to walk around or just sit around admire the city rooftops. Great spot to go at night time, to just sit and enjoy the city lights.",
          "So pretty! Such a special set of stairs to climb! A very special part of our trip to Italy. \n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9",
          "Full of stairs on the middle of two churches,  great views above but no sitting allowed.",
          "Very pretty. Can get very busy. Steps pretty steep so be careful if unsteady.",
          "Beautiful steps. It was very busy but the atmosphere was so calm and relaxed. We sat for ages on the steps to enjoy the relaxed atmosphere.",
          "Needs an escalator.  But seriously, very attractive locale with the only detractor being the selfie stick vendor population out in force.",
          "Nice place but very busy.  Surrounded by designer shops so good for shopaholics.  There is a water fountain at the bottom of the steps that has an access point to fill up water bottles or simply splash yourself with water.  At the top of the steps is a very ornate church that is with having a quick look in.",
          "Very nice place, but from all the amazing things you can see, eat or do around Rome, this seems to be a little over hyped.\nIt's free and if your close worth a look. But I wouldnt make any special effort to see them.",
          "Too much hyped..... More of fame, but its like any other Square in ROME. In fact the other squares are more open, one can sit and eat, mingle and chit chat. But sitting NOT allowed on these steps, nor there is any alternate sitting place \u2026",
          "Beautiful place in a really nice part of Rome. \nIt was extremely hot and there was very limited places to sit. There was a water fountain that you can fill up your water bottles was really helped. Stunning views and architecture.",
          "Love the Spanish stairs, walk up and also make the walk left towards the view terrace overlooking piazza de popolo",
          "The astonishing view looking up from the bottom. And then looking down from the top, you kinda see what all the emperors must have felt. It was fascinating. A must see while in Rome",
          "Very pretty. Good photo place. The cops don't let you sit down on the steps. Make sure not to take a rose from the illigal street vendor's. They say it's free and are super pushy and will demand money once you take it. You get good at saying no after the 3rd time they ask",
          "A nice set of steps. A bit overshadowed by the rest of Rome's attractions but worth taking a look at. There is a fountain at the base of the steps that has fresh water to fill your drink bottle with. On a hot day, you will definitely need to fill up before trekking up to the top of the stairs!",
          "Really not that impressive. Just a staircase, not worth lining up in your holiday if you're trying to squeeze it in. Plus it was heaving with people, it was dirty. Yeah, my least favourite tourist site while I was there!",
          "Near to spagna metro station. Walking distance less than 10 mins.\n\nNice view n great master piece. \n\nDo not sit on the steps. As this is a holy place.",
          "It's a beautiful place..well Maintained..must go if you are in Rome",
          "Beautiful artistic walking area, great shopping location for brand goods, or just having a cafe.",
          "An exquisite experience. The steps, the church and the shops nearby are an essential part of a visit to Rome",
          "Great place to eat pizza, until the guards tell you to stop :))",
          "Truly a breathtaking view, lots of shopping around the area as well!",
          "Clean well maintained and well respected landmark. Forget about the people and zone in on the architectural beauty. A visit is a must when in Rome....",
          "It was worthwhile visiting the steps and standing down at the bottom. Could easily spend time here watching people, especially those told off for sitting on the steps!! Was worth the walk up to see the church at the top and to turn around and see back over the city.",
          "Beautiful butterfly shaped spanish steps. A very historical place that is very known in Rome. Very crowded during the day. A must visit.",
          "What can you say, it is a tremendous flight of stairs. The view from the top is breathe taking and the view up from the bottom is jaw dropping. If the stairs are intimidating, then to the left around a couple of shops, there is a metro station. It had a lift that gets you to the top. Good to know if you are physically challenged.",
          "Nice place for roaming around. Lots of tourists came in this place to see and take a picture. Don\u2019t sit on the step . Security over there come and make you stand why I don\u2019t have any idea, but don\u2019t try to sit on the step.",
          "Beautiful but definitely watch out for thieves.  Had our bookbag stolen . Luckily nothing valuable other than my sunglasses were in there .",
          "Beautiful area to hang out and take it all in.  Lots of tourists snapping photos.  A good time to go is around sunset which is little bit cooler and you obviously get a great view of the sunset.  All of the high-end stores are there too (Gucci, Prada, etc...) but they close a bit early around 7pm.",
          "The architecture is amazing and its definitely really nice. Issue is that the cops don't let you eat or sit on the steps (I guess to keep things pristine and clean.) Once you take a few photos and walk up, thats about it and you kinda get over them.",
          "It should be on your list to visit whilst in Rome. Its a great place to get a photo. Go early if you want your photo have less people photo bombing you.",
          "Don't know why it supposed to be such a big attraction. Unless you like to have your pockets picked.",
          "Nice view, nonstop police checking and whistling you not sit on the staira...",
          "It was beautiful there, but there are many men (Indians I think) who try tomake you buy their flowers.",
          "I went there in the evening, it was full of people. A nice man playing guitar and other were dancing. It was a lovely night in a lovely place",
          "Right at the start of shopping land in Rome. Easy to get to from Spagna Metro station",
          "Nice place \nNothing is special in this place \nBut the are is nice \nThe shops are very nice as well",
          "Iconic place to visit.. But crowded! Lovely view from the top of the steps, across the skyline. Nice walk down to a fountain at the bottom. Lots of high-end stores in the surrounding area, and lovely cafes and restaurants. Be warned - it's \u2026",
          "Amazing place with its own unique atmosphere. Don't wear new (and slippery) shoes with hard base :D you will see these stars really FAST then :D. Only a pity that there is too much ppl so you can not take some \"beautiful and unseen\" photos which will probably rot many many years on your hard drive :D",
          "A very beautiful sight to see in the city. Do not sit on the steps. You will be whistled at by security and even removed and taken to a nearby police station (which we did see) of you push your luck and refuse to get up. The fountain at the base of the steps is a very convenient place for drinking water too.",
          "An amazing area of Rome highly recommend for a visit in such a beautiful city. Friendly people everywhere beautiful people too amazing eateries great views amazing water features strewn throughout the city and restaurants that look out on \u2026",
          "Nice view. Nice shopping (high end) near by.",
          "Everything was great, but you couldn't seat on the stairs",
          "Well personally it\u2019s an overhyped place. There are a number of other places that I would recommend in Rome before it. But yeah it\u2019s famous and is very crowded no matter the day of the hour. You can get some really nice photos. So really a matter of choice if you wish to visit this place.",
          "Loved this place, and surrounding areas great local coffee shops",
          "Good view from top of the steps, but nothing special.",
          "Not sure if I missed the point but this didn't blow me away. The steps are relatively impressive but there doesn't appear to be anything obviously special about them considering the surrounding area and landmarks. \n\nPeople with whistles \u2026",
          "Since it's forbidden to sit on the stairs, this place lost its charm and is not more special than any other stairs in Rome.",
          "Lots of great shopping here, a lot of high end brands. Beware of a few tourists traps. Some street vendors tried to force sell flowers and selfie sticks to tourists.",
          "Nice place to spend an evening but it's really a hype and too crowded!! I won't count it as a must visit. There are many other places more beautiful and historically important in Rome if you are on a tight schedule. This place is more for Instagram show off.",
          "It\u2019s a magical place to visit in Rome. Very nice view.",
          "I was so excited to visit the place but after the visit I felt a bit disappointed because there was only a church and a few steps to the church though the city view from the church was good. There is also a boat statue in front which is \u2026",
          "We went in the middle of summer with 10000 other tourists... Will go again in between seasons still a great place to visit.  Don't bother sitting on the steps you'll be told to move along quickly with the help of the local police and his whistle",
          "Nice spot but You can not chill out there :)",
          "I missed there. \u0130 spent great times in this place.",
          "It's just a set of steps, but go to the top and the view is fantastic.\n\nFull of history and a very popular tourist destination, but it's on the list of things to see when in Rome.",
          "Our family visited the Spanish steps on a hot Aug afternoon. It wasn't over crowded, many opportunities for photo ops. Security is always after tourists for sitting on the steps. Various shops and restaurants locally to visit while you are here as well. Overall it was a good visit.",
          "God bless Italy this one of the amazing place in roma",
          "Quite nice location for taking a bunch of photos or just simply for sitting down and enjoying your ice cream! Gets quite crowded tho.",
          "Grab yourself a bottle of wine and find a spot at the top of the steps. Get their quick though or you'll have to wait for a spot.",
          "Nice evening weather in November..amazing lights and Christmas decor everywhere.",
          "Beautiful place. Crowded all day long but still worth visiting for the sights around there as well",
          "Very interesting. Crowded but worth it. I like the history.",
          "Beautiful place in the sun, tons of people around, still worth seeing.",
          "A beautiful series of steps. Easily accessible and in close proximity to other attractions. A lot of shops nearby for spending time and chilling. Preferably go in the afternoon to best spend time at the place",
          "We went to the area of above the Spanish steps to see a nice sunset.  We then walked down the many steps to the very busy area below.  The area is quite active with many people to watch and many shops to look in.  The area is somewhere we enjoyed when out walking through Rom.",
          "Here I find out that in Italy it's legal to drink alcohol on the street! I was so happy! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udf7b",
          "Nice steps with a good view, worth the walk over here.  If you're not wanting a ton of tourists in your pictures, you'll have to get here at sunrise before everyone wakes up.  It does get packed mid-morning and then all day.",
          "The Steps are neat, but I enjoyed the Piazza more. Just how much the area livens up on see evenings. Do understand, we arrived early some days and stayed late on another day and it was packed with visitors at all times. Still very enjoyable \u2026",
          "Often a place where people will meet or possibly start tours of Rome from. We came here after seeing the Trevi fountain. \nIt's a busy place but there is a nice little fountain and some seats around it at the bottom of the Spanish steps. \nWe \u2026",
          "Over crowded and over rated. There is little to no historical significance. The only interesting thing is the marble of the stairs, that is if you can see them under all the feet.",
          "Amazing place. Very lively. BUT beware of peddlers and flower pushers!!!!",
          "Now not like before, 15-20 years ago lot flours , rose, now only the steps, without nothing!\ud83d\ude14",
          "Lots of people, even though you can't sit on the steps anymore. It's not that great... I suggest you skip this and hit up some of the other sites in the city.\n\nIf you do head here, go up the steps and make a left. There are some nice views. \u2026",
          "Amazing views of Rome's high end fashion shops w lots of lights and people on weekends and during Christmas or Easter.",
          "Nothing spectacular about the place. It is a simple church with steps leading up to it. Probably made famous thanks the iconic movie Roman Holiday. Other than that this is just one of those places that is avoidable if you don't have the time.",
          "This famous landmark is basically filled with tourists all day round, plus a few dozen vendors. The steps are very photogenic especially on a fine day. Worth a visit but must be careful of pick pockets.",
          "The steps are of course beautiful and a centerpiece of the city of Rome for obvious reasons. However, I will now associate the steps forever in my mind with the sound of whistles. I understand the reasoning for it, but it is difficult to have a nice experience with it. On top of this, it is very very busy like most areas in Rome.",
          "Amazing monument. I went in the evening and it was still so busy. The very from the top is gorgeous and surrounded by designer shops so great chance to get some shopping done too. \nWatch out for the street vendors trying to sell Rose's etc. You need to be polite but quite firm and they'll leave you alone.",
          "The Spanish Steps have a cool history however, in my opinion, it's not a must see. It's a popular and crowded place. There are too many street vendors and there is nothing really to do other than climb the steps. I found the history to be interesting but expect to only spend around 10-15 minutes at the Steps.",
          "The stairs are beautiful and close to the shopping street (via del corso). Some stairs are worn down during the years.",
          "An amazing and elegant architectural monument, very well preserved. There are 136 steps to climb to reach the top, where you have a beautiful, panoramic view of Rome. Sitting or smoking (also eating I think) on the Spanish Stairs is forbidden and enforced by local police officers.",
          "The Spanish steps are a gorgeous  work of architecture that should be high on your list to visit.  The best part about it is you can see how the marble has been mourn over the years from so many people passing through its steps. There are \u2026",
          "Beautiful one. Be energetic to climb the stairs during summer. Cause you are not allowed to sit on the stairs to take rest, you can keep standing, that's not the problem. Don't forget to have some cold water from the fountain to get recharged!!!!",
          "One of the most beautiful places in Barcelona! Must visit",
          "It's a super touristy place. It's very common to see couples taking pictures for their wedding book. It is forbidden to sit on the stairs, support your backpack. If they find you eating or drinking, they can fine you. Don't buy drinks from street vendors",
          "I don't know why this is so famous. You will find normal steps and a normal fountain.",
          "Great place to vist even when its dark outside",
          "130+ steps. Clime them if you feel you\u2019re fit; great exercise though.",
          "Must visit place in Rome! Though, not allowed to sit, don't forget or you will have a fine.",
          "A place suffering from its popularity. It's become so crowded that a local police has prohibited to sit on the steps.",
          "Many stairs to heaven. To the beautiful church at the top of stairs.",
          "Not sure why but you can't really sit down on the stairs anymore. You have got guards watching the steps, prohibiting from sitting down. The surrounding area is beautiful.",
          "Must visit square when you are in Rome. Beautiful fountain in front of the steps and nice view of the city from the top.",
          "It's popular. Loads of people. It's world famous, what else could you possibly learn from a Google review? \n\nWatch out for the whistle police. No idea what they're whistling about but don't do it.",
          "Extremely crowded even in the off season but still incredibly impressive.",
          "Lovely place but really crowded after 9am.",
          "Good place to visit loved the shops close by as well",
          "The steps were completed in 1725 and are quite an attraction with visitors.  We went to the top and looked down the steps off the street way that passes by.  We talked about the drunk driver who drove his vehicle down the steps part way in \u2026",
          "Lovely view but unfortunately police stop you from sitting on the steps or near the fountain anymore :/  not a lot of other options for sitting if you intend to bring your lunch or drinks",
          "The Spanish Steps are cool to visit but I would not place this on my priority list of must-see activities. Please know that you will not be able to sit on the steps. They have dedicated monitors on site reminding you of this this \u2026",
          "Don\u2019t take food or drinks and sit near the boat (where it\u2019s okay to sit), security will ask you to eat somewhere else. No sitting on the Spanish Steps either. Other than that, the view was beautiful. It\u2019s by a metro station so lots of \u2026",
          "Very lovely area. It can get packed.  No shade in this area FYI. But there is an elevator at the bottom left of the steps if you need them. Very close to metro!",
          "The most beautiful sunset I\u2019ve ever seen! Definitely go there, climb the stairs and wait for the colourful beauty!",
          "It changed  policy for the better. Sitting on the stairs are no longer permitted. I didn't saw tourist eating and drinking.. the place is clean... i enjoyed the fresh drinking water that flows on the fountain...",
          "I had a big expectation that Spanish stairs are amazing. It is good to visit this square, but it is quite normal place . 20 years ago, there were a lot od flowers , spanish stairs was looking amazing, but now it's nothing more than stairs.But worth to visit (even of you didn't feel wow)",
          "I would go ahead and say that this spot is overrated. It has a very similar vibe with the steps in the front of Sacre-coeur in Paris, minus the fact that the police don't allow people to sit anymore. The view from above is sure different, \u2026",
          "Yeah, it's nice but in my humble opinion a bit overrated.",
          "It\u2019s beautiful spot. But there are more attractions that I recommend to see in Rome if you\u2019d trip is short.",
          "In the hustle and bustle of beautiful Rome. Lots of opportunities to take pictures and walk to the top of the steps if you want. Ensure that you do not sit down on the steps as there are wardens (that have the power to give out hefty fines) who monitor the area to make sure that people do not sit on the famous steps.",
          "After watching Roman Holiday from years ago I always want to see these steps, it didn't meet my over hyped expectations. My own fault.\n\nToo crowed and touristy. Go visit some small side streets and neighborhood instead.",
          "Beautiful historic stairs. Great design. Nice view from the top. Usually packed with tourists.",
          "This was a bucket list thing for me, thank you Roman Holiday with Audrey Hepburn. Was bust but not packed. Had heard a lot of comments about how disappointing it was. I enjoyed it. Be warned you may no longer sit on the steps. There are carbinieri there to keep you off.",
          "Beautiful place and very nice view from the top! We visited this place when it was still allowed to sit on it, so we were lucky. I guess now it's not that charming as it was because of all restrictions.",
          "Band playing on the steps, bright sunny day and the best cappuccino in the adjacent cafe \u2615\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "I find the place beautiful, but too many people (which is expected) and also too many guys \"gifting\" you with roses that they expect to get paid for!!!",
          "Very effective steps for getting from a lower area to a higher one and back. In all seriousness it's beautiful",
          "The view from the top is so beautiful!  Definitely walk up to the top!",
          "One of my favorite places here in Rome. Nothing super special like other monuments but it just has such a romantic atmosphere. The shops, buildings, surroundings are so fun!",
          "Nice one time visit to these historical steps made famous in the movie: A Roman Holiday. Cops wouldn't let anyone sit on the steps! Walking distance to the Trevi Fountain.",
          "A stroll to the Spanish Steps is a must on any trip to Rome. Walk through the streets which house all the main world renowned brands such as Rolex, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and many others. Before arriving at the foot of the steps. Join with \u2026",
          "An iconic Rome stop.",
          "Gorgeous! Doesn\u2019t seem like much but is worth visiting... especially at sunset!",
          "Very busy 20 hours a day.\n\nBeautiful and historical.\n\nBe warned there is a new law in place which means police can fine you for sitting on the steps",
          "Go there around 8 am or earlier to get a nice photo op\ud83d\ude00",
          "Very busy the day we were there but great atmosphere, you have to go to say you were there.",
          "It was such a meaningful experience. Always crowded with touring people even at night, but valuable. Great place to take photos.",
          "Overcrowded stairs, with huge and visible police presence.",
          "Almost magical to toss a coin and embrace with your beloved! A selfie is a must, plus it's another box ticked while in Rome!\ud83c\udfdb",
          "We were there just before ban for sitting on the steps was implemented. Go there after 8pm, you can see Rome panorama with sunset and won't be overcrowded. Recommended.",
          "Amazing place to visit and relax with great photo opportunities",
          "Always crowded. Bot enjoyable at all",
          "A great point to observe the panaromic view of the city with an ancient architecture. Mostly full of visitors in summer time. Best time to visit at afternoon, you will enjoy the effect of faint sunlight.",
          "Beautiful, especially at night. The vendors pushing garbage selfie sticks and chargers ruin the ambiance a bit. However, I would still certainly recommend a visit.",
          "Get here early if you want to avoid the crowds. Be sure not to sit as the regulations don't allow it. Nice but not critical to the experience of Rome.",
          "One of the most known places in Rome. A lot of tourists is there always but I think everyone should see this place. When you walk upstairs turn left and go straight ahed - you will have A great view of Rome ;)",
          "Crowds of people great shops very pretty. Views across the city at sunset beautiful.",
          "Amazing place. Great bar at top watch world go by but it's not cheap. Fountain at the bottom is very busy.",
          "Amazing place, great views...just make sure not to sit on the steps as there is a lot of police and you might get the ticket for sitting on steps...",
          "Tourists attraction- very evident but a fantastic location with plenty of history.",
          "Beautiful place. Must visit for movie enthusiasts! I'd recommend to check this place in the early mornings as there aren't many people there that time of the day.",
          "U can no longer sit down there because of a new law so the police is watching all the time and whistle if someone sits. They say the stairs is renewed but they look dirty. But the place 8s absolutely worth to see",
          "Nice view on the domes of San Peter and a few other churches.",
          "The steps are very beautiful and wonderfully made. However I have to say I enjoy the shopping street more as there is not much to do on the steps apart from walk them and sit.\n\nKind Regards,\nJack'sGoogleReviews\n\nLOCAL GUIDE LEVEL SIX \u2713 \u2026",
          "The steps are beautiful and very much worth the walk!\n Most places say the Spanish Steps are 300(some say more), but my group counted and none of us even counted to 200, so dont let the number scare you!\nThe many rooftop gardens are \u2026",
          "Great view of the city from the balcony at the Trinity Church. You can see almost all of Rome! I'd recommend hiking straight up, seeing the church, then working your way down for photo ops...Opposite of what most people do",
          "The Spanish steps. Everyone knows it, everyone loves it, everyone needs to visit it while in rome. Also worth waiting the church on top. Oh. An no sitting or eating on the steps !",
          "Not much to it really.  Crowded as well.  Many better places close by to hang out",
          "On the top, there is a church, calm and quiet for prayer",
          "I honestly have no idea why these steps are famous other than Roman Holiday, but they ARE pretty!\n\nDo not sit or eat on the steps though! This is strictly enforced.",
          "The actual location is beautiful...the crazy amount of people will test your patience...we prefer going at night...less people and we'll lit up",
          "Overrated. Police dont let you to sit down on stairs. Very close to babington tea house, pastificio and pompi tiramisu place.",
          "Really loved visiting this place in Rome there is a lovely tea room right next to the spanish steps which my partner and I enjoyed a lovely tea for two...",
          "Very nice to visit and know history behind these steps",
          "Spanish steps with no photos of the steps lol \ud83d\ude02 but definitely check out my instagram for the actual Spanish steps pics @samroquet",
          "Nice to visit however so much more in Rome would take presidency",
          "Not a particular good place to visit given that you have so many great artworks in the town",
          "Great place to walk around and soak it all in. At the top of the steps turn left for a great overall vista of Rome.",
          "Famous steps which has appeared in many Hollywood movie",
          "Beatiful place but very crowded in the daytime.  I went about 07:00 and it was fairly empty but still a nice sight.  Only gave it 4 stars as not sure what all the fuss is about.  There are so many beautiful places in Rome to see it's hard to say this is better than others but still a good place to visit.",
          "Beautiful place, well-known for the high-class shopping, but if you are tired and you just want to sit and look around it will be impossible, no benches around and this is wrong, because tired pensioners and kids will be under risk to \u2026",
          "Beautiful place!  There are always a ton of people out having fun or people watching.  Also there are a lot of shops and restaurants in the area, so you're not too far from other things if you aren't really into the history/architecture stuff.",
          "very busy place.Go to the top off the stairs & take in the views. Very nice place to go in the summer",
          "Strictly okay. Fail to see the attraction here. Much better places in the vicinity than this.",
          "Easier to take good pictures if you come early.",
          "I love this place \u2764",
          "Top visited place in Rome and enjoy the view on top after climbing the steps. Best to visit during sunset. The Spanish Steps are a set of steps in Rome, Italy, climbing a steep slope between the Piazza di Spagna at the base and Piazza Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti, dominated by the Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti church at the top.",
          "Famous landmark. A good place to see the sun set over the city if you go high up to the church level. Very crowded. If you are a photographer you have to arrive at least 1 hour before sunset to find a good place to shoot from.",
          "Super cool place. Of course in the afternoon on a nice June day it\u2019s going to be crowded, but it wasn\u2019t terrible. We sat for a while and watched the sunset. Really nice place to experience Rome and rest a little bit",
          "Looks quite nice, and the view from the top is great. It's a bit busy around it, but that's to be expected, as it's a popular monument \ud83d\ude0a. Near a few shops and restaurants, so there's definitely other stuff to do around it after you go visit.",
          "It's a busy place, don't try and sit on the steps.\nThe local police will warn you and usher you away. Lovely view from the top",
          "So many steps that your feet won't forget this place. No sitting on the steps. Seriously, that's why the police are whistling. You can sit by the wishing well, though this one's tiny compared to Trevi.\n\nWalking distance from Spagna station. \u2026",
          "Nice place to eat an ice and have a little break",
          "It\u2019s pretty and I\u2019m still impressed a set of stairs can get this famous. To be honest I wasn\u2019t super impressed and it was a crowded, but eh, what more can I expect.",
          "Romantic and nice place to chili out there specially at night time",
          "It is very beautiful. You can see great roma streets from up here.\nBut night is best.",
          "Beautiful place especially fountain at the bottom. Better in the morning and mad at lunch time onwards. Loads of designer shops and posh eateries, go a bit further to find cheaper eateries.",
          "Great atmosphere. Amazing architect the famous steps of rome.. Forbidden to sit but still u can go go up stairs and can have panaromic view from there.",
          "PROS: universally known place  | master piece of art | perfect for selfies\nCONS: constantly crowded  |  stressful",
          "Realy nice place to come and hangout for a little bit. I would really recommend visiting during the evening through the sunset! Sometimes you can catch some street performances right on the steps.",
          "Awesome place, great views and you can feel the history.",
          "I have been here three times in my life. First time in the 80's second time in the 90's and the last visit was this year July 2019. Its one of the most famous landmarks in Rome that you shouldn't miss during your visit to Rome.",
          "A very know spot for tourists, this year the City passed an ordinance to prohibit the public to sit on the Spanish steps. I believe this was a very good  decision of the City Council, I was in Rome few years ago and the Spanish steps was a \u2026",
          "Quite nice, but not that special. Many scammers lurking around.",
          "The steps are absolutely beautiful. They're great for people watching. It can be hard to climb all take your time and enjoy the views all the way up. Sit down and take a breather too.",
          "This is a lovely place for meeting people - it is quite full of tourists. You can make a ride in a driven by horses carriage. You can even pet a horse if you ask the carriage drivers.",
          "Great place to relax and take pictures..",
          "One of my favorite spots in Rome!",
          "A very well maintained area that is very impressive in its grandeur - the area is lovely to walk around and explore the historical buildings and walkways. Beware it is really busy so make take some time to walk up/down but the views from the top are fantastic so worth it!",
          "Nice and pretty but only do it if you are passing through the district. \nMind you if you love shopping and designer brands this is the definitive Rome district. \nThe biggest hassle is all the hawkers trying to sell/ give you a rose, \u2026",
          "Not much to see here.  But good history surrounding the steps.  Beautiful scenery. Beware of the street salesman peddling not so nice goods in the area.",
          "Very busy but a beautiful sight. No sitting on the steps anymore. The church is really pretty too.",
          "Refreshing view from the top, there is a beautiful church at the summit as well. We came across the steps from the road leading to the top, so didn't have to climb them, but we did step down a bit to enjoy the view. It's superb during \u2026",
          "As others have said this is basically a long flight of stairs that is is quite aggressively policed in terms of what you can and cannot do. it's most notable feature is probably people watching more than googling at this basically large \u2026",
          "Beautiful architectural project completed to join two levels of the city.  Great meeting place with a Metro stop nearby.  Affords great views of the surrounding city from the top.",
          "\u0130t is such a beautiful place.  You have to visit it just befre sundown.. Amazing view",
          "Fantastic tourist spot for a bit of people watching and for soaking up the Italian atmosphere. Always buzzing with crowds of people just sitting on the steps and watching the world go by. Highly recommend spending an hour here but watch out \u2026",
          "Beware the people supposedly handing out 'free' roses. If you accept one, they then threaten your partner to give them money. The police seem to turn a blind eye to this disgraceful behaviour on one of Rome's most famous landmarks. Ruined our visit.",
          "The steps themselves are a lot more beautiful in reality than in pictures. The area around the piazza beside is really fun and filled with many dessert shops and top class fashion stores like Gucci, Max Mara, Valentino, Dior...any many more.",
          "Ah, the Spanish Steps, prepare for a hike. When the sun is out, expect this spot to be overrun with tourists and also very few places to hide from the sun. There are police which prevent people from sitting on the steps so, keep moving. The \u2026",
          "Beautiful plaza. Come in early there will be less people, sit in the shade if it is too sunny and enjoy while reading a book. Quick note no food allowed on the steps. Plus be mindful of those flowers seller, they will do anything (take picture of you etc) to get some cash!",
          "What a beautiful place to visit and enjoy the views.",
          "We visited mainly as starting point of walking tour. There are no places surrounding the steps to sit down and experience the atmosphere. Police will whistle away anyone trying to sit on steps, just annoying. Take a quick snap and move to next stop!",

          "Met the football first team of \"Rome\" there having a celebration \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Great place to gather with people. Go upstairs and turn left. There is great park terrace with the view on Rome. Amazing!",

          "best place gor couples peacefull agmosphere",
          "Ok, so this is one of the popular attractions in Rome and it's nice but really there are spots that are way more interesting and less crowded, if you have time check it out, but I wouldn't strain my time to see it.",
          "Very busy place surrounded by posh shops. Beautifully scenery at the top of the stairs overlooking the Vatican.",
          "Just be ready for the crowds that are mixed with cars and trucks. Patience is the key to enjoying the visit. Lots of small stores and restaurants in the area. Please do not sit on the fountains. Police will whistle and get you to move if you sit.",

          "Very very busy but beautiful.",

          "Soo many steps but it was nice to walk up and get pictures and information about the monuments.",

          "Amazing place! We listened some nice music there. A lot of ppl seating and having nice time. Great place to visit.",
          "Nice experience. Enjoy the atmosphere. Scale the steps to the top, there are some truly Roman views and sceneries of the red rooftops. Ideally, if you can, time it for the evening, as the sun sets. Frankly though, there is not much else to do. At best, you may want to peak into the church.",
          "Beautiful place to visit. Vibrant place. Great atmosphere",
          "you're not allowed to eat or sit there",
          "Very crowded. Annoying people trying to sell you roses and selfie sticks. Maybe best to go 6am before the crowds to enjoy the spectacle??!",
          "Amazing monument. Whether during the day or at night it is still so busy. The view from the top is gorgeous and surrounded by designer shops so great chance to get some shopping done too. Very pricey so plan accordingly.\nWatch out for the \u2026",
          "In my opinion, it was nothing special. You can get better views of the city elsewhere and it is way to crowded.",
          "You can no longer sit and enjoy the steps.  Horrible decision by the local government.",
          "This Res. Is one of the best. All foods are really yummy! I went here 2 times already during 2 days.",
          "Always a spot that is alive with people, lots of energy. Lots of vendors also, Don't take the roses, umbrella's, bracelets or allow them to take pictures. If they harass you for money just walk away.",
          "A very touristy place and for many, a must when in Rome. Very enjoyable on a sunny day! Remember that no food is allowed on the steps - seen some people being asked to go back down and finish their snacks. I found the narrow streets close to the steps really charming and would recommend spending some time there when visiting the steps.",
          "Much nicer not seeing all sorts and sundry having picnics, munching and sitting around..",
          "The Spanish Steps are quite impressive, we went in the evening so not as busy as during the day. Visited mid October.",
          "These steps are just beautiful! Amazing they've lasted all this time (carefully taking care of \ud83d\ude09). Like all tourist traps, stay clear of the scammers (a strong but polite no does the trick) and go in the early morning or late evening to avoid the crowds.",
          "Interesting place. I am not actually sure what is it all about and why are they so popular, since they are pretty much like any other stairs, but let it be. When in Rome, do as the all tourists do.",
          "It s a nice place, spanish like, but it s nothing spectacular. From there you access the fancy streets with famous brands.",
          "Lovely spot to say you have seen.  However over the years this area has become like many places in Rome and it is full of garbage and whatever has been left there.  A one quick stop to say you went is all you need",

          "It is a set of steps. It was far too busy. The square etc it very nice though",

          "Good place to sit down with your loved and click loads of pictures",
          "Maybe I don't fully appreciate the cultural significance.  I heard the history behind them, and I suppose they are nice as far as stairs go.... perhaps they are just 'meh' in a town with so much to see?  I mean if you go all the way to Europe you may as well see them. It was crowded and hot.",
          "Great place to visit, beautiful carvings and fountain, very picturesque, would visit again, highly recommended!",
          "What a great square to visit. Lots of people, shops, food....amd just hope you don't have to walk up the Spanish Stairs!",

          "The views from the top of the Spanish steps were awesome, grab a drink (porta via) and a spot along the wall at the very if the steps about 45 mins before sun sets and snap away.   The colors of the setting sun change dramatically so stay put for the entire \"show\".",
          "Whats the deal? Good place to people watch, if thats what you are looking for.",
          "The must seen in Rome. But it\u2019s a little bit crowded, better to come early. FYI do not sit on the steps\ud83d\ude09",
          "The Spanish steps unique design and elegance has made it a popular place for artists, painters and poets who were attracted to the place which inspired them in return. Nice place to visit!",
          "Honestly. They are just steps. Wouldn't bother unless you particularly enjoy the films that made them famous.",
          "Why do people insist on coming here? They are a well made set of stairs, yes. But yeh, don't go out of your way...",
          "Great place to visit, just dont sit anywhere near if you don't want to get a fine",
          "Nice place to start your city tour from. Many stores around the area. Be careful, most restaurants don\u2019t actually cook their food - they heat up frozen meals. You need to look inside kitchen before sitting down to eat.",
          "Very crowded set of steps with tons of street vendors shoving their wares in your face. View is nice, but it's quite a journey so be prepared.   Lots of older, less able people trying to do it and having difficulty.  Be aware if you might fall into this category.  Lots of history here though.",
          "A beautiful and very popular venue right in the heart f romantic Rome! Surrounded by excellent restaurants and all the designer labels you can imagine! Truly excellent experience...if you're lucky steel musicians enhance the overall ambiance. ..highly recommended....",

          "Nice but a to much people .. anyway you must have seen it",
          "Lovely place near to spagna metro stop. Picturesque.",
          "Beautiful, but on a beautiful Friday, packed with people. \nRomantic, yes. Must see,  yes. Memorable... for the amount of people,  yes. Big plus was area shopping and atmosphere. Imagine a picturesque spot on rodeo drive... and you have the Spanish steps.",
          "funny thing that the french build it and it holds their coat still :) last year you can not bring ice-creams there now not even sit - that\u2019s good in my opinion we can see stairs itself finally and walk with ease on them!",
          "This was a great place for kids to play! We he steps themselves were very nice.",
          "Especially having been to Rome before, we didn't purposely go to the Spanish Steps, but didn't try to avoid it either. \n\nWandering around, we found ourselves there. It was super crowded, but we found a good place to sit in the warm sun for \u2026",
          "They are serious about not sitting on the lower steps. Cops all over. They didn't seem to care what was going on above the first level. There was a guy laid out about to take a nap on the upper stairs and nobody cared",
          "Beautiful building and arrived at the perfect time for sunlit photos, but spoilt by the huge crowds.",
          "Good place to see, can't sit down though. All the best high end shops are here. Dior, Gucci etc...",
          "Amazing place, the streets and surrounded area was great. They have a lot of high end retailers and some great cafes and restaurants in the area too. Would definitely go back next time we go to Rome.",
          "Wonderful steps.\nSuggested time to spend: 1-2 hours although it has been prohibited by police to seat and eat/drink there.",
          "I liked the experience. Also enjoyed the local police whistling to all the people who was not behaving. It\u2019s funny to see \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Good workout taking the steps. Next to a beautiful church.",
          "Why the people just wanna try sit down all the time is annoying. Look take your pics and move on. Alot more seating areas at the bottom could be more helpful.?",
          "This place is cool, I'm glad I went, but honestly I don't understand why it's so famous and popular. It was a bit underwhelming to me. Make sure you don't sit down on the steps you could get a hefty fine.",
          "It's steps. Overcrowded for no reason. Only plus is at the top is a decent view at night. Not worth it in my opinion",
          "It one of place to visit in Rome. But remember it's always many people in here, you can feel like little ant :) you go up and look to panoramic view.\nYou can also go to the night, the view of Rome is more beautiful.",
          "This is an amazing place especially if you're with your loved one it's very romantic",
          "The best part of the Spanish steps is.... people watching!. Spanish steps are simply steps knows as Spanish steps- that's as interesting as it gets. But the flowers,  which are amiss in most of Rome,  together with the great weather and unusual selection  of tourists made it a place well worth a visit!",
          "You can sit on the steps and enjoy the view. There's a music bar at the top and beautiful fountain at the bottom. The place is very lively and often crowded. Great place to recover from walking around :)",
          "If in Rome you need to visit this place. Incredible to see but just remember, it is just stairs!\nIt's extremely busy too.",
          "Eventually got round to seeing the Spanish Steps . It was mobbed so you can't really take it in. My hotel room had a picture of it on the wall but it was in the old days and it was stunning back then",
          "A mite crowded, but fun people-watching",
          "Very beautiful place in central Rome. Very crowded but a total must see for great photos. Or to ask your girlfriend to marry you. Very romantic place. Take a look in the church on top of the stairs. Or have some drinks on the nice little cafes below the stairs.\nWatch out for pick pockets all around the stairs also.",
          "They are huge and crowded. There are loads of ppl but they all smiling laughing singing. The atmosphere is brilliant and it's worthy to get to the top because of the view and beautiful church of the Santissima Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti, on the very \u2026",
          "I probably need to understand this place more.",
          "Of course it is must visit place. Better to go after sunset,  perfect lighting and illumination.",
          "Hordes of people taking selfies, even in the dead of winter. Oh how far we've progressed...",
          "It's very, very strange new rules - you have not right to seat on the stairs, to put your bag on the stairs even for moment to make picture, you even have not right to eat ice cream while you are going upstairs! Seriously?! If they think \u2026",
          "A must see. Bring a water bottle. Trying the refreshing fountain water is also a must, it's absolutely safe to drink and no need to buy water from street vendors",
          "Impressive but you need plenty of stamina to walk up the 136 steps.",
          "Although a lot of people there was a calmer atmosphere with order. People sitting down o  the stairs taking a break and enjoying the moment. Beautiful with the flower arrangements which were well taken care of.",
          "Great views from the top... stairway to heaven! Turn left once  you reach the top.",
          "Very big and nice.",
          "Crowded but impressive! Maybe better to come early in the morning?",
          "Nice to see and you should be aware do not sit on the steps.",
          "Nice place for walking , eating, taking pictures and shopping in high brands stores.. I wish to stay here more days to cover all the beautiful area, I will come back later inshallah to Rome to continue exploring the neighborhoods and visiting landmarks \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc90",
          "You will be puffing by the time you get to the top but the view is lovely.",
          "Remember, you can not sit on the stairs!",
          "These are just normal steps. There is nothing great about it. However you always see people around here sitting and chatting. The energy level is good. If you enjoy good place to sit and relax, may be having a good book to read, this is a place to be.",
          "Didn't know what the fuss is about. It's stairs, just stairs. Beside the boat in the middle of plaza there is nothing there to see. You can't even sit to eat. It's French stairs with Spanish name in Rome....",
          "Stairs...just normal stairs. No idea what is so amazing about them, aside of some religious BS. There are so many interesting places in Rome, don't waste your time with this one.",
          "A beautiful area to explore, especially with the surrounding shops. An excellent place to stop by and relax in the shade of the buildings",
          "Beautiful view from the top. Very close to the main shopping streets/Medici Villa and other places to visit.\n\nA great place to people watch or have a drink and a rest. Restaurants are near by. Steps made famous from Roman Holiday so you can \u2026",
          "Amazing place, a must when you visiting Rome",
          "Iconic fountain place. Probably best at dusk. Plenty of nice ice-cream around.",
          "The atmosphere and the view, both from the bottom and especially form top of the stairs are brilliant. Definitely not on a top with places when in Rome but I'm glad I had the chance to see it.",
          "It's a nice place to visit, but you can't really enjoy it with so many tourists around (me being one of them). You can use the Spanish steps as a gathering point, as most Streets from there lead you to nice little shops",
          "Rome has an incredible amount of beautiful sites, which makes the Spanish steps a bit of a let down. If it were in any other city, I would probably give it a much higher rating, but given all there is to see in Rome, I would skip this one unless you happen to be in the area already.",
          "It is a nice view from top of stairs. Very very busy so do not get upset with people constantly bumping into you. But getting there takes you through beautiful streets and small little shops",
          "A must-see in Rome, especially as the impressive 17c Fontana della Barcaccia Is at the bottom of the steps and a great view of Rome can be had from the top.",
          "Very amazing architecture and piece of Rome's history.  Pleasant discovery.",
          "Remember you cannot sit anymore or face a fine",
          "The Italian police are in force to ensure you do not \"SIT\" on the Spanish steps.",
          "I was expecting more, just a bunch steps really. The step police made me laugh as they were solely there to refrain people from sitting on the first set of steps. There were also a couple of guys trying to sell lasers shining them on the beautiful panarama ruining it with green laser dots,those guys should be policed.",
          "Very crowded, tight security with no eating or drinking. After 5 minutes you'll love on.",
          "Perfect for shopping and coffee break.",
          "The place is very beautiful and close to a place to shop from brands and at night it was crowded.",
          "It is so incredibly full of people. If you are a photographer and are looking to get some good pictures I recommend very early morning. Nice views of the crowds from the top. Very close to all the stores you can shop at.",
          "Historic Spanish steps. Nice view form the top.",
          "Does what it says on the tin. Impressive view from the top. Lovely view from the bottom. Busy area, as you'd expect.",
          "Really theyre only steps. I recommend the Vittorio Emmanuel palace and its steps! Theyre much more breathtaking, a better view and not so many people.",
          "Very crowded place because of all the tourist, though its a beautiful architecture, recommended to visit once if you are in Rome.",
          "A must see when in Rome. This place is always packed so be ready. If you make it before 9 am you might be able to get a good photo with no one in the background..key work \u2018MAYBE\u2019. We went again the day we were leaving, it must of been \u2026",
          "It's nice place to visit. But now a days, no body can sit there due to municipality restriction.",
          "Honestly not sure what all the fuss is about them. Very, very busy OK for a quick check but don't worry if you miss them. We found it better to go around and up to the big park area behind them.",
          "One of the best attractive places in Rome",
          "Tons of tourists but you still need to see it at least once in your life.",
          "Cool steps, gets you from A to B",
          "Fun place to visit while in Rome. You\u2019ve see it before in the movies and it\u2019s fun to see it in person.",
          "Cool for history.  Fountain is pretty.  Church at the top with Egyptian obelisk.  Steps are steps though.  Pretty steps.",
          "We went in night, so there were lots of pickpockets. The steps were very nice, and the lights were very pretty. However, there were lots of \"Pickpocket Gangs.\" There were people kissing trying to get attention, while the other members stole the money. Thank god we weren't on of them, and we managed to leave safely.",
          "Lovely place and the day we went it was so busy and gorgeous weather it made for ace photos",
          "beautiful, well curated location. easy to accessbreakfast food and coffee nearby",
          "The usual tourist spot! Take a deep breath before climbing",
          "Great atmosphere and energy with lots of tourists around, a great place to \"hang out\" Sadly sitting on the steps is now forbidden (summer 2019)",
          "Usually crowded and is more beautiful at night. Good to be there.",
          "Really pretty location, but if youre limited on time it may not be your first choice.",
          "Worth visiting. Good vibe. Carry on shopping from here. Good location",
          "Beautiful place! Saw this at night and it was lovely. Definitely climb the stairs, nice view from the top.",
          "Beautiful area but so busy!",
          "Always busy but a must see free attraction with high end designer stores lining the streets nearby",
          "The place you definitely need to visit. It is often crowded because young people and tourists gather there. It is also a great time to sit back and relax. The look from above and below simply looks incredible.",
          "Nice early in the morning.....beware of new law where you are not allowed to sit on steps.... fines are high.. one of the worst decisions of Rome incompetent mayor\ud83e\udd14",
          "Always love staying near the Spanish Steps you are very centrally located and in the fashion district.",
          "Get the early to avoid crowds . climb the stairs and be reward with magnificent view of rome",
          "A colloquial gathering of humanity on a beautiful Italian October evening.",
          "Love this place anytime of day, but it was stunning in red on this particular occasion.",
          "It was very nice but tainted by the people physically trying to push roses in your hand. You can't just enjoy the view which is a shame.",
          "Great but lots of rules, no seating!",
          "Beautiful square with scenic stairs surrounded by high-end fashion apparel stores.",
          "Very beautiful sight, not a tough hike to the top. They seem like they'd be slick if wet though. Nice view from the top.",
          "It draws folks bent on seeing this famous piazza.  Tour flags are bobbing around in all seasons, but the fashion houses, hotels and restaurants flourish all around the area.",
          "Very pretty, not too busy. The fountain was surrounded but the steps are kept relatively clear by staff. Usually they are covered in flowers, we missed that (july 2018)",
          "Underwhelmed with steps! Seen and walked up more impressive rises while in Rome, but another one ticked off list.",
          "I don\u2019t know what\u2019s so special about this place. It didn\u2019t look any different from others. For me it looked normal and nothing special.",
          "Go to the top and watch out on the small fountain and Street, great view for dope Photos.",
          "A great atmosphere for a beautiful place. If not very mobile then make sure you aim for the bottom of the steps. There are many!!!",
          "Interesting. Great view from the top.",
          "beautiful memories it was so worth the walk to get there",
          "Another great visit in Rome.",
          "One of the popular attractions in Rome. You climb the steps to a road on the other side of which there is a Church. You can walk to other nearby places like Trevi Fountain, Venezia and Pantheon if you manage to find parking near Spanish Steps",
          "Not the wow factor I was thinking but worth a look",
          "Meh, take it or leave it. Bunch of steps going up a hill. Good for people watching but i don't really understand the attraction myself. Very busy when i visited but adds to the people watching angle. Apparently the boat at the bottom was \u2026",
          "Historical location with great views from the top of the steps",
          "many high class boutiques here such as hermes, LV, Dolce, Rolex, etc. also people can take photos at fountain and climb stairs to church",
          "It is a good place to get a good view of the city but you can't sit on the steps or linger. The cops will blow you right along with their whistles.",
          "Crowded but the entire area is fabulous. Brilliant food and high fashion shopping. Beautiful scenery. Beautiful views. Feels safe and very fun.",
          "Skip it and go to a different famous site, also DO NOT BUY GELATO IN THIS AREA, WAY TOO EXPENSIVE, there are better cheaper shops away from the steps.",
          "Beautiful location. I went at night when it was less crowded. Climbed the steps. Took pics. Sat and took it all in.",
          "Very beautiful, but difficult to enjoy in peace due to the abundance of very aggressive street merchants. They are everywhere in Rome, but ive not felt quite so harassed anywhere else. The steps themselves are cool, but the basilica at the top is comaratively unimpressive.",
          "The only downside is the men on the street being so pushy with roses and asking you for money after. But other than that it is absolutely beautiful.",
          "Overrun with people and Street hawkers, don't go mid-day. I was here start of June NOT yet the busy summer season and it is already very busy. \nThe steps themselves are nothing amazing but the view from the top is great, I'm sure a tour guide would give more meaning to the location.",
          "Busy inevitably but great to see",
          "Very nice. Go early or all you will see is people and hardly see the steps. The metro station is right next to them which is helpful.",
          "Good place unwind after a long walk, have some wine and people watch. And you get free WiFi from the stores nearby.",
          "Pretty but too busy.",
          "Awesome, especially early in the morning",
          "They along with the piazza are undoubtedly beautiful, However in the height of the summer it is actually difficult to enjoy or indeed see the steps from the masses of tourists ploughing in to see them. Visit them on a nice sunny day in winter or at sunrise to fully enjoy this experience.",
          "nice tourist location. it's not allowed to sit in the steps area, there are controllers everywhere",
          "Fun landmark, but WAY too many good trying to sell roses, and very crowded",
          "Very interesting area\nCrowd with lovely atmosphere",
          "If you go there, please do not forget to pray at the church. Very peaceful",
          "It's a fun place to people watch or to sit and enjoy some gelato.",
          "As expected :) lovely views from above! Doesn't take too long to get up at the top as the steps are not as big.\n\nBe careful of the men selling roses etc.  They give it to you, flatter you and ask your partner for money \ud83d\ude02 They do get cheeky. Ended up paying more than \u20ac3 for 2 roses.",
          "A meeting place for all nationalities from all age groups. Great eating places and lovely friendly atmosphere. Looks very pretty at night.",
          "It is a beautiful staircase near Spanish embassy. It is couple hundred of steps to the top but well worth it. The fountain and the pool in front are also very beautiful. The area is very crowded and you will struggle to take a decent shot. People take a rest on stairs and take advantage of surrounding.",
          "A vibrant square for people watching amidst the branded fashion stores",
          "It's just stairs people...\nBut very nice looking. Shame the police is present scrutinizing every step you take as to make sure your butt does not touch any steps.",
          "These steps overlook the Piazza di Spagna and Via Borgognono which has highend shops. At the top, you are welcomed by lovely views of Rome and the Trinita dei Monti which is a large Renaissance Church. The plaza and the steps do get busy at certain times. People and large groups gather here for photos.",
          "What a beautiful place!  There were many people out in the evening time around sunset and definitely made me feel alive.  The view from the bottom looking up is fantastic.\n\nThere is also a nice cafe at the top overlooking the steps.",
          "Why so famous? Prices arround are ridiculous",
          "It's ok. A bit empty, I was expecting flowers on the sides. That would give it an extra charm. Otherwise, it's just stairs. Bernini's fountain is amazing, as all his works.",
          "Good place to hang out in the evening. Lots of people in the street. Nice view from the top of the stairs.",
          "Extremely busy, no where to sit down nearby. The best part was watching the stair police blow the whistle and people who sat down on the steps.",
          "I came here one afternoon, the road leading me from pathenon temple on both sides of the road are shops with famous brands. Sitdown in the coffee and enjoy sunshine here. The Spanish steps are located in Rome, Italy, leading from the Pizza \u2026",
          "It's a set of stone steps. Just like stone steps you might find anywhere else. Very solid though, no unwanted movement at all when you walk on it.",
          "What's up with all the whistling?? If you're not allowed to seat at the steps anymore at least put the sign before yelling and whistling at people. So annoying.",
          "Free. Good view from the top. Very crowded. Fancy fountain on the bottom that people were drinking out of. Nice church on the very top.",
          "If you like police whistling at you if you eat or take a seat on the steps, go here.",
          "Wonderful views - get there early to avoid the crowds.",
          "We enjoyed the challenge of climbing the steps and then savoring the view from atop the Spanish steps. We went at night... not too crowded at that time which made it all the more enjoyable. This place is close to Trevi fountain so our \u2026",
          "I'm not sure what the huge fuss is about honestly. But pleasant enough place to see, and the staircase is very grand",
          "Pleasurable evening, Shopping, etc. You name it and you can find everything in a single place. There is a fountain in front of it. Live shows, live music by local musicians, etc. make up for a perfect evening. Since it is at a height so the view of the nightlife is awesome from Spanish steps.",
          "Incredible atmosphere. If you love steps you will love these Spanish ones. Only downside no food allowed, including party foods such as nibbles and ice creams. Also nearly got pickpocketed. Love it. 3/5.",
          "Our tour started in this Spanish Steps. It is one of the must see places when you are in Rome. Below is a water fountain and everywhere are whistle blowers and guards. So you feel safe walking around. Be sure to ask their permission before \u2026",
          "Well worth seeing but don\u2019t accept flowers from the touts there or anything else they selling it\u2019s a con ! Apart from that don\u2019t be put off",
          "It seems to be located in the fashion district, the high end stores are across the street. I wasn't as crowded as expected.",
          "Lovely part of the city! Walk up the steps to a great park that overlooks the city.",
          "Great I guess but nothing to go wow over",
          "After prohibiting the seatting on stairs it is not the same... it feels bad so much limitations and control",
          "Nice atmosphere. Quite busy during midday. Make sure you don't sit on the steps or you get shouted at!",
          "Went in the summer\nVery nice place\nNice place to sit and chill",
          "Crowded and practically assaulted with men shoving long stemmed roses upon me looking for $. The steps, landmark and fountain were beautiful, but it was chaotic with no place to sit and relax and no shade. A nice to do if you have time but not a must see.",
          "Nice place to hang out 5 mins from fontana Trevi make sure you go right before sunset to enjoy both views.",
          "After exploring Piazza del Popolo (we started from here only), three roads span out into the city, and exploring these on foot is always a highlight of our trips to Rome. If you take the left-most road looking south, the Via del Babuino, it \u2026",
          "Amazing place, ful of life & great atmosphere.",
          "The chapel at the top plays very relaxing religious tunes which makes for a great place of rest, reflection and prayer.",
          "Amazing Italian tourist hot spot. Beautiful old work"

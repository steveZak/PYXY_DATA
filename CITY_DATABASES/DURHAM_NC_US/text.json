        "wiki": "The Sarah P. Duke Gardens consist of approximately 55 acres (22 ha) of landscaped and wooded areas at Duke University located in Durham, North Carolina.  There are 5 miles (8 km) of all\u00e9es, walks, and pathways throughout the gardens.  The gardens are divided into four areas, the Historic Core and Terraces, the H.L Blomquist Garden of Native Plants, the William Louis Culberson Asiatic Arboretum and the Doris Duke Center Gardens (including the Page-Rollins White Garden).  The gardens are a memorial to Sarah Pearson Angier Duke, mother of Mary Duke Biddle and wife of Benjamin N. Duke, one of Duke University's benefactors.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 1920s, Duke University's planners intended to turn the area where the Sarah P. Duke Gardens are currently located into a lake. Funds for this project ran short and the idea was subsequently abandoned.  The gardens then officially began in 1934, when Dr. Frederic Moir Hanes, a faculty member at the Duke Medical School, persuaded Sarah P. Duke to give $20,000 to finance the planting of flowers in the debris-filled ravine.  By 1935, over 100 flower beds consisting of 40,000 irises, 25,000 daffodils, 10,000 small bulbs and assorted annuals graced the lawns.  Unfortunately, the heavy rains of that summer and the flooding stream completely washed away the original gardens.  By the time Sarah. P. Duke died in 1936, the gardens were completely destroyed.  Dr. Hanes was able to convince Sarah P.Duke's daughter, Mary Duke Biddle, to finance a new garden on higher ground as a memorial to her mother.  Ellen Biddle Shipman, a pioneer in American landscape design, was chosen to create the new garden, known as the Terraces, in the Italianate style.  They are considered by many to be her greatest work.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe 36th line of latitude goes directly through the Duke Gardens; there is a plaque designating a spot through which the parallel runs.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in the United States\nList of botanical gardens in the United Kingdom\n\n\n== External links ==\nSarah P.

And if you have a little one, you can use a stroller, but some areas do have stairs throughout the trail.",

          "Beautiful! So many spots to sit and be..",
          "Kind of overhyped based on these reviews, it's a nice walk but not a crazy amount of stuff compared to other botanical gardens.  The childrens area is honestly the coolest part of it.  It's not bad, I just think the reviews create a false ideal",
          "Great gardens, plenty of places to sit, and even had concessions if it got too hot.",

Public fountain just in case you are dehydrated. Plenty of parking spots.",
          "Do not recommend this place in Fall/Winter. It looked like a deadly, eeriest place with dried up ponds, loud construction going on. No flora or fauna to be seen. I am not sure why I am giving 4 stars, only because of Japanese garden with \u2026",

          "A wonderful (free) spot in Durham for a great walk. A few tips: duck food is $1 a bag and can be found at the garden center. It's worth it if you have young children! Also, Duke Chapel is a short walk from the garden and is beautiful!",

        "wiki": "Stagville Plantation is located in Durham County, North Carolina.  With buildings constructed from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, Stagville was part of one of the largest plantation complexes in the American South.  The entire complex was owned by the Bennehan, Mantack and Cameron families; it comprised roughly 30,000 acres (120 km2) and was home to almost 900 enslaved African-Americans in 1860.The remains of Historic Stagville consist of 71 acres (290,000 m2), in three tracts, and provide a unique look at North Carolina's history and general infrastructure in the antebellum South. Among structures on the Stagville site are several historic houses and barns, including the original Bennehan House and some of the original slave quarters, which were in an area known as Horton Grove.The Bennehan House, built 1787 with a large addition in 1799, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973; Horton Grove, an area of two-story slave residences built in 1850, was listed in 1978.  The slave residences are well preserved and are the only two-story slave quarters remaining in North Carolina.  Significant archaeological finds around the quarters have given archaeologists and historians a glimpse into the lives of the many enslaved people who lived and worked at Stagville and throughout the Bennehan-Cameron holdings.\nIn 1976, Liggett and Meyers Tobacco Company, which had owned and worked the land for decades, donated some of the acreage to the state of North Carolina, which now operates the property as Historic Stagville State Historic Site, a historic house museum, which belongs to the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistoric Stagville - official site\nNorth Carolina Historic Site: Historic Stagville\nThe Plantation Letters Project: Selections from Cameron Family Letters\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nAnderson, Jean Bradley.

          "We went to this site with some out of town guest. We live very close and sometimes these venues are overlooked. This has a very interesting history and the guide that we had was excellent. ( a retired teacher) Take your time and enjoy. Best not on a hot day...",
          "This was a nice hidden gem for anyone wanting to learn more about Southern history. The staff is very pleasant, and you can tour the property, main house and old slave houses. The staff and tour are very informative. It was very quiet when we were there, not many people at all",

          "Great for the entire family. We went on a guided tour which was very informative! The guide was knowledgeable, sharing the history of the area, plantation life and of slavery. We visited slave quarters, the main house and the stables. Well worth the nominal suggested",
          "Visiting Stagville Plantation gives you a look into the window of slavery. At one point the Plantation had 900 slaves and 30,000 acres. It was considered the biggest plantation in the south. Walking through the slave quarters is very chilling, only if walls could talk.",

          "It was a nice and interesting tour of the main house and the slave housing, stables etc. The plantation property used to be enormous but the house was not very luxurious. The tour guide was well informed and managed to transfer us to that time. It was a nice day trip, very",

          "The tour was very informative. The tour guide was a straight shooter he cleared up a lot of misconceptions a lot of people have about slavery and how intelligent and resourceful the people were. It was overwhelming to be inside the actual living quarters where slaves lived",
          "I've been here many years ago and decide to rate it now. It was a great learning experience. I've always passed the sign but had the opportunity to go with a church group. I've learned and experience something new. History is knowledge.",
          "Can't believe I've lived nearby for many years but had not visited until today. Tour guide was very knowledgable about the history and culture. Enjoyable and educational. This should be a \"must see\" for those who want to know about the history of this area.",

          "The visit deepened my understanding of what life was like in the 1800's. When you're actually on the site and reading the history it's easier to relate to the families that lived there.",

          "It was a memorable visit of an extraordinary historical location. The docent was thoroughly knowledgable of family genealogy, architecture, social issues, and agriculture. He made it possible to envision what the enslaved workers of the plantation experienced within the walls",
          "This park is wonderful. Many old buildings and antiques. Trails that are challenging and run along the river and others that are more flat. My two dogs thoroughly enjoy a romp ion this park. We have seen deer in the morning and a rushing waterfall after a rain.",
          "This is an hour and half tour. The guide was very knowledgeable. She missed though to point out some objects. Some details are not explained unless you ask. Maybe because she may have been tired of touring 3 hours already. The place, the trip is REALLY WORTH IT. Thumbs up to",
          "We found this place only when an out of town visitor saw it written up in the AAA guidebook. We were all glad we came! In a 1.5 hour tour, we heard history of a large, slave-owning plantation. The tour included a colonial-era main house (now air-conditioned!), slave quarters,",
          "Lived in the area for many years and just got around to visiting Stagville. The tour guide did an excellent job in telling the history of the plantation. The buildings and barn that are included in the tour are in amazing shape for their age.",

          "Amazing historical sight. Some of the structures still standing give an authentic view into the times of slavery in our country. Recommend doing the guided tour so you can see inside the house and slave quarters. On you own, it is hard to read the outside information as it",
          "Certainly worth the drive to make a visit to Stagville. We timed our visit for the 3 pm tour which was well presented and fully explained by Jade. Top marks to her. We were able to visit the family home, the servants quartets and also the old barn and there was time to also",
          "While I wasn't able to catch the full tour (as I arrive 30 mins after a tour had started), I was able to catch the second half and tour the old slave quarters. On the particular day I visited, a major thunderstorm came through while we were in the slave quarters. It only added",
          "I found this to be a typical plantation. The only remarkable thing I noticed was the well kept records for the plantation. Some of the buildings are open for touring. Guides were knowledgeable",
          "If you are looking for a place with some history come to Stagville. The slaves homes are pretty much as they were yesteryear. Great place to bring your family.",
          "Their web site says they have a guided tour or you can do a self-guided tour. Other places we've been the self guided tour is open to everything the guided tour is. The only difference is you don't get to hear the stories the guide will tell. We were in a hurry so we decided",
          "The barn across the street, near the slave quarters is unbelievable in both size and scope. The house is modest but completely authentic. Down to the discovered African JuJu or Mojo stick dolls found in the walls. The house is period furnished with authentic area pieces. This is",
          "Stagville is a grand look into history. I have visited with my daughters when one of the authors of the American Girl doll collection was reading from her book. There are special events and ongoing interpretations of a plantation which had slaves. Highly enlightening!",

          "The Stagville Historic site was a great place to visit and to take my daughter and niece to learn about their African-American history that is so often not taught in the school curriculum. As an educator, I feel it is important to learn about our history in order to move",
          "I have been here several times. The people who maintain the site dont seem to care. The dont care if you are there, if you are not, they just dont seem to care period. Any association with them takes all the joy and wonder out of the place. I thought it was just an off day",
          "During my civil war tour I had some time and visited this excellent place. I am surprised by how few reviews it has - a real shame. Although it was cold and raining, my guide Beverly provided an excellent tour of the house, the barn and the slave quarters - well described in",

          "I have lived within 30 miles of this place for over 25 years and never visited till now. Its a small but very well maintained and staffed historical site. There is a main house that the staff gives tours of on a schedule. It is very interesting and its completely free. Make sure",
          "Even though many in our group have lived in the area for sometime, no one had ever toured Stagville. Easy walking tour or you can just watch the video in the welcome center. A very good gift shop. Admission is free but donations are welcomed. It is centered around one of the",

        "wiki": "The Museum of Life and Science\u2014previously known as the North Carolina Museum of Life and Science and the NC Children's Museum\u2014is an 84-acre (340,000 m2) science museum located in Durham, North Carolina, United States, featuring an array of largely hands-on exhibits intended to spark curiosity and wonder. With a focus on STEM learning, the Museum's mission is to create a place of lifelong learning where people of all ages embrace science as a way of knowing about themselves, their community, and their world.\nThe museum exists in the midst the Northgate Park neighborhood, bisected by Murray Avenue. The main building is located on the north tract, along with the Butterfly House, Hideaway Woods, Farmyard, Sprout Cafe, Explore the Wild nature park, Catch the Wind, Dinosaur Trail, and the 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge Ellerbe Creek C.P. Huntington train ride. The Museum features both indoor and outdoor learning environments. The southern tract is now largely devoted to parking and administrative buildings, including a parking deck completed in early 2018. Prior to the construction of the new main building in the early 1990s, the structures on the southern tract contained the bulk of the museum's exhibit space.\n\n\n== History ==\nRichard (Dick) Wescott, played a major role in the development and growth of the MLS during his tenure as director of the MLS. He began there as a volunteer, soon became the curator, and by 1970 had become Executive Director, although he continued to fill the role of curator as well. Over the years, both he and the Museum flourished. By the early 70's, when the name was changed to the NC Museum of Life and Science, the little green hut on Murray Avenue had grown into a complex with several buildings housing a wide range of collections, artifacts, models, and murals, highlighted through a number of permanent exhibits. With the support of local friends and board members like Carolyn London and the late Dr. Kenneth Hall and the building of new relationships with others, such as the late Louis Purnell, at the National Air & Space Museum and Michael Collins, an Apollo 11 crew member, the museum continued to grow, building one of the finest collections of space memorabilia in the country. This exhibit featured a representation of the Apollo 11 flight and the first human step onto the moon and included one of only four, extant Lunar Landing Modules(LEM), as well as a one-of-a- kind walk through the entire process of launching a rocket, designed specifically for blind visitors. The museum also grew a significant collection of live animals and Dick began to collaborate with Jim Fowler and others, as they planned for the creation of an exhibit in and around the abandoned rock quarry across the street from the original complex. The narrow gauge railroad, which remains operative, was the first step in building a unique exhibit of native species living in a natural habitat.  Dinosaur Trail - more than twenty life-size models have resided along the banks of Ellerbee Creek, for some thirty years now - designed and constructed by Dick, with the help of a handful of volunteers and his ever-present \"right hand, \" the late Willie Holloway, after a visit to the museum by the late Dr. Louis Leakey. In the late 70's, he and Margie relocated to Augusta, GA. where he was Director of the Augusta-Richmond County Museum for the next fifteen years.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\n\n=== Main Museum Building ===\nThe 2-story main building of the museum houses exhibits about weather, sound, math, health, building and engineering, and native North Carolina wildlife. The building also includes a 6 years and younger play area and a hands-on lab that does frequently rotating topics and activities.\n\n\n=== The Farmyard ===\nThe farmyard is home to a variety of farm animals including a donkey, goats, chickens, bulls, and pigs. The more recent additions to the farmyard are several alpacas. The farmyard offers guests the chance to see how zoos provide enrichment for animals as well as weekly up-close experiences guided by animal keepers. There are several other hands-on activities within the farmyard.\n\n\n=== Hideaway Woods ===\nIn 2015, the Museum opened Hideaway Woods, a two-acre, nature discovery environment featuring eight tree houses, a flowing stream bed, and fanciful nature sculptures. The space also includes hammocks and an enclosed area for younger explorers. The play zones throughout this exhibit emphasize the importance of nature play.\n\n\n=== Aerospace ===\n\nThe MLS has historically been most notable for its Aerospace exhibit, which focuses on the early NASA space program. Most of the artifacts on display are on long-term loan from the National Air and Space Museum. Many of these are significant Project Apollo-related artifacts, such as a Moon rock, Neil Armstrong's dosimeter, an Apollo Command Module test vehicle, a portion of an Apollo Lunar Rover, and a full-sized mock-up of a Lunar Module. The MLS came into possession of these artifacts through the influence of James E. Webb, the second NASA administrator and a native of North Carolina. Instrumental in the acquisition of the NASA artifacts was Richard Wescott, the executive director of the museum at the time.\nAerospace includes a hands-on aerodynamics space, Launch Lab, that features paper airplane launchers and wind tunnels.\n\n\n=== BioQuest ===\nIn the mid-1990s, the Museum announced a 4 phase expansion to their outdoor exhibits they called BioQuest. BioQuest included the construction of new exhibit spaces: Magic Wings Butterfly House, Explore the Wild, Catch the Wind, and the Dinosaur Trail and Dig.\n\n\n=== Magic Wings Butterfly House ===\nA major attraction at MLS is the three-story glass Magic Wings Butterfly House, which opened April 17, 1999, a butterfly zoo and tropical conservatory featuring a community of several hundred tropical butterflies representing dozens of species, as well as an array of tropical plants.  The Bayer CropScience Insectarium, located in the Magic Wings Butterfly House, features exotic insects from around the world. This exhibit was the first of the BioQuest expansion to be completed.\n\n\n=== Explore the Wild ===\nExplore the Wild is home to American black bears, red wolves, lemurs, and radiated tortoises.\nIt features a 900-foot (270 m) boardwalk over a preserved 6-acre (24,000 m2) natural space, plus many multimedia exhibits. The exhibit opened in May 2006. The museum is part of preservation efforts for the red wolves and radiated tortoises. In spring 2017 the red wolf pair housed at the museum had a litter of 4 pups. These pups accounted for 2% of the entire red wolf population at the time. As part of the red wolf Specific Survival Plan the museum participates in, the family of wolves was moved to another facility in New York and a new pair of wolves came to the museum. Spring 2018 brought a litter of 2 pups to the new red wolf pair. The four wolves remain at the museum for the time being. \nIn 2018 the museum joined efforts for radiated tortoise conservation after the April 20, 2018 discovery of 10,000 housed illegally in Madagascar. The museum hosted a fundraiser to raise money for the tortoises at the museum and a conservation group in August 2018.\n\n\n=== Catch the Wind ===\nCatch the Wind opened in the Summer of 2007 and features seven exhibits showing how the wind influences our environment.   A 30-foot (9 m) interactive tower elevates oversized representations of seed pods of trees native to North Carolina and drops them demonstrating how wind affects their travel. The centerpiece of the area is a 5,000-square-foot (500 m2) elliptical sailboat pond where visitors can sail remote controlled sailboats.Kiosks throughout the area allow visitors to listen to audio tracks of narratives, poems, and stories about the wind.\nCatch the Wind also houses the Into the Mist exhibit that features artificial turf areas that fill with mist at the press of a button. This area is popular during the hot North Carolina summers as children can run through the cool mist. Many guests choose to come dressed in bathing suits or waterproof shoes.\n\n\n=== Dinosaur Trail ===\nLong a local favorite, the original Prehistoric Trail featured a number of life-size plaster amphibians, reptiles and dinosaurs set along a woodland path. The Brontosaurus is visible from Murray Avenue. According to a 1965 pamphlet, the trail's original lineup featured a Seymouria, an Eryops, a Dimetrodon, an Araeoscelis, a Saltoposuchus, a Yaleosaurus, a Plateosaurus, and a Camptosaurus. Later additions included a T-Rex and a Triceratops. The trail also provided models of a mammoth and a rhinoceros for scale. The creatures were built by Richard Wescott over a four-year period, culminating with the exhibit's completion in 1967. It was renamed the Dinosaur Trail in 1986. While most of the models still exist, the trail was rendered largely impassable by Hurricane Fran in 1996 and has since fallen into disrepair.  Between 2006 and 2009, local residents worked with the museum to remove some of the debris from the trail.\nThe brontosaurus model was vandalized during the early morning hours of June 1, 2009, when vandals removed a large portion of the neck and the entire head. At a later date, the head was found, and the Brontosaurus was repaired and improved through a partnership with the local Northgate Park neighborhood.The final phase in the BioQuest expansion project, a new dinosaur trail opened in July 2009. The new trail is house within the northern tract of the museum, separate from the original trail located near Ellerbe Creek. It features life size models of Albertosaurus, Styracosaurus, Troodon, Maiasaura, Stygimoloch, Alamosaurus, Leptoceratops, and Edmontonia.  The dinosaur trail also features a full-sized reclining juvenile Parasaurolophus built for visitors to climb, making it especially popular. An interactive fossil dig area is also available where shovels and screens are available for children to search for, and take home, sharks teeth, coral, other fossils brought up from an abandoned mine in Eastern North Carolina which was once part of the ocean floor.\n\n\n=== Earth Moves ===\nExplore a cave made from sandstone, change the flow of a 20-foot waterfall, and discover interactive experiences with sand, stones, and rolling water. \n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "While visiting my Brother and his family they recommended a visit to this nature park. It was a beautiful day and the park was really fun. There was more then enough to see and do for the day, and my son enjoyed it. The food was okay and some of the exhibits were outdated, but",
          "So we planned to stay a couple of hours but stayed six! Kids loved it. Literally spent an hour on the sailing boats. They have some really novel stuff there like the flying seed machine. Loved the mix of animals and activities. Also, got a massive 50% discount because we",

          "This was our one and only activity in the Durham area. My children and husband enjoyed themselves. My daughters\u2019 s favorite area was the tree houses. My husband\u2019s favorite area were the musical instruments made out of garage items. My favorite was the butterfly area and my",

          "Years ago, our son and his fianc\u00e9 had their pre-wedding reception there, amongst the giant cockroaches and other live bug displays (and it was her idea!). It lightened up the conversations, and was great fun. In later years, we have gone there several times with our grandson",
          "My 1 and a half year old loves this place. Lots to see and do inside and outside. Great for kids up to 8 or so. The 1x price of $20 a person is a bit much but we got memberships for a year. Pays for itself after 3 visits and you don\u2019t have to feel bad leaving after 2 hours.",
          "I\u2019ve visit the Durham Science Center many times over the years with children and always been pleased with how much there is for them to do and see - inside and out. Lots and lots of interactive activities and experiences. Plus, I love to see the animals and spend some time",

          "This is a terrific place to take the children. As an adult my favorite spots are the outdoor percussion station (really loud but fun) and the barn yard. Petting the animals and just watching them, even the smells make me happy.",
          "Best place to have fun in Durham NC! Fun for all ages. I have been taking our children and now grandchildren and my classes for years and years. The Museum of Life and Science gets better all the time and I have always enjoyed going.",

          "We took our 4 and 6-year-old and they loved it. There are two distinct areas, an outside and inside. Outside has animals, farmyard, butterfly house, dinosaur trek, and the treehouses! The kids loved the treehouses as they were big enough for adults to play as well. There are",
          "My daughter and I toured the Museum and grounds all day long (October 7, 2017). Everywhere you turn, this 84-acre playground of the body and mind is entertaining as well as educational! It does not matter how old you are, there is something that will capture your attention",

          "This place is such a jewel in Durham! We seldom spend less than 2 hours there. It\u2019s like a zoo, science projects, playground and museum all rolled into one. Add in your kid\u2019s first little train ride and a walk with the butterflies, and you\u2019ve got everyone happy!",
          "We took our grandkids to the museum and they thoroughly enjoyed it. The really liked the farm animals and the big playgrounds. The thing theu enjoyed most was the water spray part of the park. They got soaked and had a great time. The indoor butterfly house and the the",
          "Less a traditional museum than a garden of life, it contains birds, small animals of various kinds, and most of all, butterflies! Big ones, little ones, and all of them nature's wonders. If you are lucky, they will land on you. There is nothing cuter than your granddaughter",
          "We spent a total of 4 1/2 hours here. Three hours were spent outside. We didn\u2019t even have time to ride the train. It is an extra cost. Our 2 &4 year olds really enjoyed everything outside. The treetops area and creek were their favorites. We didn\u2019t see the bears probably because",
          "I learned about bugs and butterfly\u2019s and dinosaurs! The train ride was fun! Oh yes, my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loved every minute too! It was hot but...... She was tired out by the return to the car!",

          "I took my niece to this museum for her 1st time. I had taken my teenage kids there years ago when they were younger. The museum has really changed a lot over the years and added more exhibits. The outdoor exhibit is by far the best. This museum is for people of all ages,",
          "We visited the museum on a Saturday (kinda busy). This is a very informative museum. Lots of different labs to do hands on things. Has real live animals to see and many exhibits with dinosaur bones. We spent about 2 hours there. We didn't do anything in the labs since they",
          "I have taken elementary and middle school classes on field trips to the MoLS and my own son loved coming here as a child. It's a great way to spend time enjoying nature and participating in fun learning activities, both inside and outside.",
          "Liked our visit so much during a birthday party that we signed up for a membership. We go about once a month, take visitors, and just a quick whim for our kids to enjoy. Even adults, myself, enjoy the treehouse and outdoor stream. So many options for the children to explore,",
          "Great museum to take the children! Museum has offer community days which are free to Durham residents! Great things for children to do indoors and outdoors!",
          "Probably not their fault but this was not age appropriate for my 3 year old granddaughter. We shortened the visit so 76 dollars for two hours. Maybe when she is older",
          "If you are anywhere close, you must visit this impressive and educational science and nature park. This is a fabulous attraction designed for the entire family; plan to spend at least four and possibly six hours and you still won\u2019t see everything. The TA introduction provides an",

          "We\u2019ve been to this museum twice now in less than 4 months and my kids are already talking about the \u201cnext time we go\u201d. Not only does it have a great indoor museum with earth, animal and human science exhibits (a lot of which are hands on), but they have the best outdoor",
          "Four adults went to this attraction not knowing what to expect. The butterfly house was cute but certainly not one of the largest in the world as stated. There was only one person to give information on butterflies. The new wolf pups were hiding but the person who was",
          "We took 3 two year olds and a baby, the two year olds are a little young to understand what they're doing, but they sure had a ton of fun! If it wasn't so hot, we would have explored outside a lot more, but there was enough to do inside for almost 3 hours.",
          "We were visiting family in Chapel Hill and they suggested we visit this location and we were very surprised about how well done it was. First let me say it is pricey. Two adults and two kids was almost $75.00. So that was a big kick. If I had thought ahead and had my zoo card",
          "We really enjoyed our visit. So much to see and do. The butterfly house was a great way to cool off on a hot day. The bear enclosure was gorgeous. Unfortunately, it was too hot for the bears to be visible. The red wolves were neat as were the lemurs. Make sure you spend",

          "This place is huge. Honestly, it should be enjoyed over many different visits. It seems to always be teaming with kids of all ages. There is so much to do both inside and out. It also seems to get a great variety of special exhibits. It has a very kid friendly and science",
          "Yes, it is a science museum at its heart but it is also the best park going if you have little ones. We would buy a yearly pass, write it off our taxes, and then go every single day to play. I can't speak highly enough of this place. We still go, even with teenagers, just not",
          "We visited the Museum of Life and Science in June 2018. This Museum is located in a very expansive area and requires a lot of walking. This Museum also offers very little shade outside of the walking paths to see the animals. The part of the Museum our kids (6 and 5) enjoyed",
          "Be sure to check out the butterflies here in a mini-rain forest. We attended a wedding on the site and would recommend this place to any visitor interested in ecology and nature.",
          "The museum was a weekly trip when my children were small, but we still go now that they are teens. The butterfly house is an oasis as are the outdoor trails. No one would expect to have such beautiful park-like environment in the middle of the urban landscape.",
          "We stopped here on our trip - we could easily spend all day here!!! The inside of the museum was great!! The outside was fabulous!!! The butterfly house was great! The tree houses were very fun!! The wind area with the boats was also a favorite! The wolfs just had puppies",
          "We loved this museum! It\u2019s part zoo, part science center, and has absolutely fantastic outdoor play spaces. We loved the beautiful butterfly pavilion. We could have spent the whole afternoon in the treehouses! As an added bonus, we enjoyed free reciprocal admission with our",
          "We only had part of a day to spend before driving 5 hours home, so we chose to come here. We were NOT disappointed, and could have stayed a full day and a half! Thankfully the weather was gorgeous and we only spent 4 hours exploring the outdoor exhibits. My 13 and 10 year old",
          "We had a great experience here yesterday. My daughter had a butterfly landed on her at the butterfly house. My son loves the Dino trail. The train is also a lot of fun. If you\u2019re planning on coming more than one day as there\u2019s so much to do getting the membership is a good idea",
          "This is a beautifully designed children\u2019s science museum and well worth the price. With young children on a nice day, a family could easily spend five hours. Diversity of exhibits is impressive. Mostly hands-on learning inside. Boardwalk nature walks. Butterfly house. A vast,",
          "This museum had a lot of things for kids and adults to do. It will occupy children young and old. Don't miss the outdoor area. it is very large and has a lot for everyone to explore. The butterfly house is especially cool. don't miss it.",
          "There are indoor and outdoor activities, plenty of space outside to enjoy a play area, and to see farm animals! Our 3 year old grandson loves this museum. We enjoyed the butterfly garden and the dinosaur walk too. Well worth the admission, this place offers a full day of",
          "Our 2 year old loves the Life Science Center. His favorite things to do are see the animals of course. The interior animal exhibit is his favorite and currently under renovation to be complete April 2018. The goats, pig, and cows outside are always entertaining. He also likes to",

          "This was a chilly day and the three generation visit. ALL of us had a great time...and we barely saw what all they offer. We had an 18 month old and a 3 1/2 year old with us. Everyone enjoyed the sights. We started in the main building, visited the butterfly house, climbed",
          "I would give the exhibits and activities 4 stars. One star deducted because I think the cost is too high for what it is. For our family of 4 (8 yo and 12 yo)- $60+. We came middle of the week, about 12:30-5. Not too crowded - lots of school groups were leaving as we were",
          "There is a lot to do and see both indoor and out. I have worked at science museums in several cities and the Museum of a Life and Science is a gem. I doors there are interactive building exhibits, space artifacts, spatial puzzles, live animals, a weather section. One of my",

          "This really is a gem. We take our grandchildren here frequently. Every time, they love it. The exhibits change often enough so they don't get bored.",
          "We spent a couple hours here and had a great time, my wife and I (26 and no kids) had fun with the outdoor stops. The butterfly house was really neat and warm on a cold day! The animals were fun to see! It would be a lot more enjoyable with kids for sure",
          "First, the museum itself is great. However the employees need some customer service training. I tried to purchase an item and apparently it had the wrong price tag on it. The cashier acted as I had put the wrong tag on it. Not a way to engage with the public",
          "We visited here last April. We were just 2 adults but still enjoyed the exhibits. Most of the inside galleries where kid-oriented, but we walked through everything to check it out. Outdoors was more interesting to us, with a nice walkway through some natural habitats and animal",
          "The museum is a great venue for special events like science of wine. Knowledgeable volunteers. Clean restrooms. Food trucks arranged for the event provide a quick casual meal. Nice open spaces inside and out. I\u2019ve never been to the museum during the day.",
          "So much to do. You can plan a full day of kid activities. Stroller might be good for littler children, it\u2019s a big space. Lots of animals to see.",
          "The Butterfly House is amazing. We were there on a day with LOTS of small children. The butterflies are everywhere, so colorful. The staff helped kids hold a butterfly that was just coming out of its cocoon. So much information! There is a trail with dinosaur sculptures that",

          "Durham can be proud of this. Fun, entertaining and educational. Staff very helpful and enjoyable visit.",
          "Short of a full-scale theme park, it would be hard to find an attraction more likely to satisfy children more than the Museum of Life and Science in Durham. To be certain, there are many things to interest adults as well, but the main focus is on the kids. The Museum offers",
          "I took my 3 year old for an afternoon and she loved it. So much to see and do that we had to rush to see it all. There was tons more to do but she set the pace. Sprout cafe was a good snack. Any kid who likes to learn can spend a day. We had a great time.",
          "The Museum is conveniently located in Durham. It has a large convenient parking lot and also has an overflow parking lot. We spent several mornings during our last few visits to Durham with my grandson who is 21 months old. There are so many interesting and fun exhibits",
          "The museum is an amazing and adventurous place for all. I toolk visiting friends from Tokyo and Japan. They had a wonderful and interactive time although they speak no English. We were there the entire day and could have gone a second. The outside exhibits and wetlands are my",

          "We purchased an annual pass for our grandkids and family to use, and we took the kids to the museum twice in one month. They loved it both times - especially the outdoor area. The outdoor area is the big draw here, so the middle of winter might not have as much appeal. We",
          "This is one of the best science museums I have ever been to! I have visited it twice with my son and 1 year old grandson. They have a membership and visit it often. All the exhibits are beautifully done and age appropriate. The outdoor areas are magical, from the train to",
          "Durham\u2019s jewel for people of all ages. The science area is fun for all. We especially like to walk around the outdoor areas experiencing the tree houses, the dinosaur trail, the Bears, Red Wolves, Lemurs and Tortoises. Our Grandchildren enjoy having a butterfly land on them in",
          "We took our grandchildren to ride the train to visit Santa. They loved the walk through the colored lights in the forest, the garden of blow-ups and the ice skating. The best was the decorated train trimmed in lights and riding in the dark. Santa was ok. Mrs Clause was sweet",

          "This wonderful venue has much more than the average \"museum,\" and it caters to kids (and adults) of ALL ages. There are tons of really fun and engaging science-based activities inside, and there's even more amazing stuff outside. A family can easily spend an entire day here",
          "I went with several children of varying ages. 5yrs to 12years and they all found something they enjoyed. And I will have to say I learned several things myself. This is a great place for a family or group outing.",
          "There were lots of young kids at the museum, but as adults with a college freshman, we had a great time. Spent a few hours there and ran out of time to see it all. First time my husband had been to a butterfly solarium in his 70 years. So he was impressed and loved it. Lots",
          "This is a wonderful place to bring your family and small children (2-7) , it doesn\u2019t really show it on the trip advisor page but this primarily a place for families. The parking fills up quickly so be aware of that. Additionally, this is one of only a few attractions where kids",

          "Since we were there last they have added many hands-on exhibits inside and outside. Just when you think they couldn't get any better, they do. This place isn't just for kids. It covers 84 acres and the paths are very easy to walk. We love sitting on a bench and watching the",

          "One of my family's favorite spots. We're in our 3rd year of membership because we love this place. Great for all kinds of days. Rainy and cold outside? Museums indoor areas have lots of kid friendly activities and space to run, build, move. Weather gorgeous and want to spend it",
          "Kids you take should be in the mood to pay attention and do fun learning, otherwise they will be board",
          "It had been a while since we had been here and we wanted to see all the changes. We used to enjoy bringing the children here. It is still fun. Doesn't everyone enjoy dinosaurs? The dinosaur trail was cool. They did a good job on the dinosaurs. Most are to just look at but they",
          "Nothing boring about this museum. It is oriented towards kids and families, but would be fun for anyone. Just walking the grounds outside is a trip into nature. The butterfly exhibit was excellent. Don't miss the wall where they have the butterflies hatching and get a look",

          "Will attend a wedding there at 7pm tonight, so we came first thing today to wear our 2 yr old out. If we hadnt mentioned that at ticket counter, we wouldnt have known we qualified for a discount! More than enough to keep ages 2 to 62 entertained. You can bring your own",

          "This is such a great place! Ours kids are 3 and 6 and we love it. The outdoor side can easily take all day. There is a swamp in the middle so beware of mosquitos and we did see water snakes. My kids really love the Hideaway Woods, which is this gigantic tree house/fort. They",

          "We had a 7 year old and a 2-1/2 year old with us and there was a lot to keep them both entertained. It was a rainy day when we went so we stayed inside. But there is more to offer outside for older kids. Highly recommend. Visit the website. It's worth seeing for sure!",

          "Paid the full adult admission of $18 per person. Did not feel like we got our money's worth. I was very interested in the Butterfly house. This area felt very small to me. We've been to butterfly exhibits in other cities and they just seemed better than here. We walked",
          "This is a must visit. You pay for parking only and Sat and Sun are free til 1 pm. The children we saw there were entranced with all the flowers. Dogs are allowed in almost all areas of the park making it a friendly stop for pooch travelers.",
          "Great place. I think this is more for pre-teen kids although there was stuff to do for everyone. The food was a little pricey. Overall if we return to the area with young kids we will most likely go back.",

          "We had the best first trip to this place. It's huge and there is something for everyone. My two year old loved it. We didn't even do half of it because she got tired but we still did a lot! The train was great and the cafe had something for everyone and was reasonably priced",
          "We don't have children, but wanted to see the butterfly house. We had so much fun! We played with the exhibits and had a blast seeing the animals and insects. It was hot and crazy packed, but definitely something we would recommend!!",
          "Expansive outdoor space, lots of interesting exhibits. Very enjoyable even if you don't have small children with you. Indoor areas appeal to a broad range of ages as well. Butterfly house is an experience not to be missed.",
          "We enjoyed the outdoor park much more than the inside -- of course my kids are 12 and 18. We loved the pigs and lemurs the best -- oh and the bears! Great place to visit.",
          "We went to this museum in the afternoon and found it to be interesting, engaging and diverse in its offerings. It seems great for people of all ages. Loved the lemurs, in the back of the extensive grounds. So nice it had a coffee shop for an afternoon pick me up too!",
          "My husband and I decided to visit this place for something different to do. Since it was in the middle of the week, we figured it would not be crowded. Lo and behold, there were young students and teacher chaperone(s) and it was noisy, which is to be expected when kids are",
          "I was un-aware that this place is designed 100% for kids. Which is great if you are one, or have one, I am not nor do I have one. I felt it was over priced for me. There are few animals and some in door exhibits. A super cool kids playground and such. Free parking is a bonus.",
          "You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this museum complex. The winding trails through outdoor exhibits make for a nice stroll. I especially like the butterfly house in the warmer weather. And, of course, if you have children, this is THE place to take them to spend the day, learn",
          "My family - husband, and two preteens - decided to visit this location on our weekend visit to NC from South West Florida for an event at Duke. It cost us almost $60 for entry, but soooo worth it! We instantly headed outdoors towards their wildlife section only to be met with",

          "Layout good. Not expensive. Good family outing. Can spend half a day there, but not sure you can find enough to do to spend a whole day there. Don't buy the fast food offered outside from the vendors.",
          "We've been members at the ML+S for 5 years and we still love going to the museum for a nice sunny day. It's prefect for little kids and big kids. They do a great job of maintaining the grounds and adding new attractions like the new tree house area in the middle of the train",

          "Plenty of children in the museum so you won't feel alone if you are visiting without children. The butterflies, farm animals...just so much to see and many, many things to touch and see how things work. While walking through the insect part of the museum, we were there in time",
          "This is my personal all time favorite museum in the RDU area. My older kids are in college now and their fondest memories are here. With my 3rd son coming along late in life...I have yet another excuse to visit! From the animals...to the train ride...to the butterfly",
          "This a great museum for families. The inside has many interactive and hands on activities. The outside exhibits has a modernized play area, barnyard, water features, wild life exhibits, train rides and butterfly house. There is an entrance fee so it can be pricy for a large",
          "North Carolina is so great for its attractions that make use of it's beautiful outdoor spaces--I'm very proud to live in the area. I took my toddler who loved the sights and animals. We didn't do any of the indoor attractions, and still burnt a couple of hours easily. Just",

          "Kids love this place, lots of climbing places, fun bugs to watch and great building areas. Always a fun day with the grandkids.",
          "What a great place to spend a few hours! The kiddos had a blast...we saw black bears, wolves, alpacas, African pygmy goats, Hereford cows, a donkey, and the butterfly aviary. All great to see live and to add to it we got to pilot mini sailboats, fire wind canons and some other",
          "We were in VA visiting family had a full day to entertain a grandson, age 3; and his big sister, age 20. Now how do we make them both happy??? Well this was the place. We never got inside so a second visit in the future.",
          "We have seen the museum grow from a small facility that our children went visited in the 1970's-1980's to to a amazing place that our grandsons enjoy visiting. There are outdoor exhibits reflecting the natural environment. Children and adults as well can enjoy watching the",

          "With an out-of-town friend, we spent a couple hours following the outdoor trails and paths of the museum on a beautiful spring day. There are so many indoor and outdoor exhibits that it\u2019s hard to choose how to spend your time. We began our trip at the Dinosaur Trail, a",

          "A beautiful indoor and outdoor space to help kids of all ages meet and greet nature! Ideal for all weather!",
          "My son and I visited the museum to see the area while my husband and daughter were on a college tour a Duke. At first, I was worried that my son wouldn't enjoy the park as it seemed from the outset to be geared toward younger children and he's a teen. We were both happily",
          "Brought my boys, ages 6 and 12. At first glance, my 12 year old was mortified that it seemed like only little kids here but both kids ended up loving it. It was a holiday and the line to enter was long so we did the outside first and let the inside clear out. We stayed all day",
          "We were visiting my new nephew and spent a family day at this wonderful establishment. Nephew is a year a half old and my daughter is eleven. Both the kids and adults loved every second. The parking lots were full to capacity, yet you felt like you had the entire park to",

          "Avoid the cafe! We got in line about 12:20. At 1:00, we realized there was no way we could order and eat lunch in time to catch our 1:30 train. So, we explored some more and came back afterwards. The line was just as long. In line at least 45 minutes to order, then we had",
          "We visited with our teen and 7-year-old and had a wonderful time. We visited during spring break so we weren't prepared for the line to enter, but it was a beautiful spring day and the line moved at an okay pace. Staff knowledgeable and courteous, grounds were very clean,",

          "We live in Durham so can visit here on the free days - yeah, transplanted Yankees so very frugal. I spend most of my time in the animal room or outdoors. I especially enjoy the new tree-house area, although I am too much of a coward to get to the highest level. And it's great",
          "The Museum is just fantastic for parents with kids or kids with parents, and that includes infants who have gotten to the crawling stage. But it makes grandparents with kids really cool! That's right, there are age appropriate things starting with crawlers. It is well thought",

          "Today we visited the North Carolina Museum of Life and Science. It is worth the $16 for adults and $11 for kids admission. The museum features two floors of exhibits, most are hands-on which are very engaging for all ages. In addition, we enjoyed many outdoor exhibits, which",
          "We've been to a number of children's museums and this is by far the best we have seen. There a large number of interactive exhibits that promote STEM eduaction. They are fun and effective! If in the area, I would highly recommend this... it's fun for all ages! Even 35 ;)",

          "Especially suited for elementary ages and younger. Very interactive, little reading necessary. Moderately priced and kids loved it.",
          "Great experience for school aged kids! Lots to do and see. The treehouses are AMAZING but I'd have liked to have seen some staff on site in that exhibit/attraction to maintain safety protocols and that rules were being followed. Wasn't a fan of the stream area being all access",

          "Museum is unique. Yes, it\u2019s educational and focus on STEM but distracts everywhere - petting zoo, wild life exhibit, wetlands and a train ride. Good for family with kids of different age group but not a value for your money. Cafe is poor \u2026",
          "I\u2019ve been going here since my school field trips in elementary school, and I go back every year. This museum is absolutely amazing, fun and informational. Even as an adult I go back and feel the joy I felt as a child.",
          "My family loved going every time I mention it",
          "Really expansive museum and outdoor play area. They don\u2019t limit visitors, multiple bus loads of school kids, which makes it impossible to use the facility if you have smaller kids. We will probably visit again on an off day.",
          "Hands down our favorite place for taking the kids on an outing. We became fast fans of the Life and Science museum and night a membership on our first visit. There is so much to do that even after 3 yrs here we still go weekly.\nAnd, is been \u2026",
          "Man this place is amazing several outside play areas. Tree houses, butterfly and insect building, main building full of awesome areas and there is a train to ride! You need to bring your family here.",
          "You can spend hours indoors, outdoors or both at this amazing center. Inside:  learn about aerodynamics, create a tornado, play a song by hopping around the room, visit NC wildlife exhibit, and more. Outside, visit bears, wolves, lemurs and farm animals, play in a tree house hideaway, walk through a dinosaur exhibit. I love this museum!",
          "Super fun place for adults and kids. We are annual pass holders and try to go a few times a month. The annual pass is a great deal. At just a few times a month it get the price down to a few dollars per visit. Parking is free. Food vendors \u2026",
          "The Durham Museum of Life and Science has very nice Areospace displays on the Apollo 15 mission to the moon in July of 1971. They also have the Mercury capsule that placed the monkey Enos in November of 1961 into a 2 orbit trip around the \u2026",
          "Love this place. IMO, best for kids over 18 months old. Lots to do inside and out. You can bring a picnic, but you'll have to eat outside the museum. We usually bring snacks inside with no problem. The cafe is good but pricey.  If it's \u2026",
          "I can't rate the place because I haven't been there yet but before going I wanted to know if there was any food available there for my grandkids.  The MLS website reveals nothing about food.  I had to go back to google and type the museum \u2026",
          "Many exhibits and great variety...a really good place for youngsters...good hands on experiments ... Maybe a little pricey...also, go in cooler weather so the animals are more active",
          "Great outdoor and indoor exhibitions for kids of all ages as well as adults.",
          "We love it! Well worth the membership fee!! So many things to do. We love the tree house, the train rides, slides, little stream, the butterfly garden and of course the little farm!! Our kids are ecstatic every time we bring them and never \u2026",
          "We spent all day long there. Many indoor and outdoor activities for kids.",
          "Best parts are butterfly area, dino walk, and outside animals viewing areas, for adults at least. Inside is a little small of a museum and heavily tailored to young kids. That said, Apollo 15/ space section is really cool. Their farm area is nice enough, not a huge number of animals to see but some good ones like alpacas.",
          "This was an amazing Museum and activity center for kids. The facility is clean and up to date. The activity\u2019s and workstations are very clever and well thought out. The outdoor activities are also very clean and modern. Was well worth the money for the events and time spent.",
          "The Museum of Life and Science is a great science museum with many unique spaces to learn from and to enjoy both indoors and outdoors.  With hands on exhibits and some great learning and playing spaces, this museum offers a wide variety of \u2026",
          "One of my favorite museums or science centers in the state. Tons of information exhibits, a working mini train with rides, a treehouse forest, petting zoo, climbing exhibits, learning stations, butterfly house, and more. Tons of restrooms and cafes because it is a lot of walking. Friendly staff and amazing experience.",
          "We have been members for two years and will continue to be as long as we live in North Carolina.  Worth the trip from Fayetteville even off just for a day trip.   Booth My 6 and 3 y/o absolutely love it, both inside and out.  Always a great \u2026",
          "Parent + you have kids under 12 = Go here often and become members asap. This place is a wonderland ! There is so much to do and its huge. Animals, insects, butterflies galore ! Science exhibits ! Train ride ! A huge playground ! Dinosaur \u2026",
          "Always great experience at this amazing place, doesn\u2019t matter your age!",
          "Really fun place to go for people of all ages. Really pricy to get in though, $20 is a bit steep for a college student (or just anyone over 12). Would love to go with my friends here more but I just can\u2019t afford it unfortunately",
          "Perfect place to go to let the kids have fun while learning at the same time. I really enjoy going in the spring when it's not too hot, but not cold at all. The kids can get wet outdoors...and so can I. Huge outdoor play space with \u2026",
          "We live on Charlotte but go here at least once a year and spend the day. We spent 6 hours leisurely exploring and still did not see everything. Main features of the outdoor areas include treehouses, far animals, butterfly garden, dinosaur \u2026",
          "A great place to take the kids and see sights (science wonders) for all. The parking could be better and more handicapped spots though. There is a play area, train, animals, interactive exhibits and so much more. Gifts shop is available for \u2026",
          "This museum is awesomeness truly! I used to regularly take my kids (in my small preschool group) for field trips there. Started going back when the Butterfly House was still an old greenhouse, lol. And there have been so many new things \u2026",
          "What an amazing place! Great for all ages, fantastic exhibits, the most pleasant staff, they were so helpful it was really a great time all in all! We will be looking into getting a membership when Our son is a little older.",
          "My niece could spend the entire day here. \nFrom a not parent point of view I enjoy myself when I baby sit and come here. There is food and and drinks available.\n\nParking will and does get full on weekends",
          "Great fun for a family with little ones. A little on the pricy side if you\u2019re visiting from out of state. Plenty to see and do to wear out little ones.",
          "This place is amazing! There are so many different things to do both inside & out. I can bring my toddler any day and he never gets bored, even after being there 20+ times (we became members this year) He loves the farm & tree house areas \u2026",
          "Our daughter has been going here monthly for 2.5 years and still loves it. Some other museums don't have much for younger audiences, but this one has plenty. There's also lots of hands-on stuff, unlike some museums which feel better suited \u2026",
          "There is a lot here, but tickets are very pricey, especially for adults. $20 for an adult is a little nuts. We came for the zoo and the butterfly house, everything else had tons of children running around and isn\u2019t really meant for adult anyways. Took us a good 3 hours to get around to everything though.",
          "One of our favorite places to always go and a membership is absolutely worth it! Even though it\u2019s a drive for us we always have a great time. Plan a day trip here and you still won\u2019t get to everything! There\u2019s so much to see and do. An excellent education for kids!",
          "I went with my son and almost two year old grandson. My grandson loved the dinosaurs! He also loved the mist area! He played and played and was soaking wet! We loved the animals and the trail was great! The butterfly building was awesome! \u2026",
          "\u201cEducational & Fun for all Ages!\u201d\nI grew up visiting this museum, and it's only gotten better as the years have passed! I recently visited with my in laws and little nephews (and my 2 month old babe) and I was pleasantly surprised with how \u2026",
          "We love this museum! We have gone two years in a row now and we could easily spend the whole day there! There are so many exhibits, indoor and out! My kids have a great time!!",
          "This museum is so freaking awesome!!! There is so much to do I don not even know where to begin!!! From Natural Science, to wildlife, to Space Age exhibits, everything in this place is super awesome!!! Fun for every age! If you have not been to this Museum you are really missing out!!! I absolutely loved it!!! \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f",
          "My kids loved to visit. My daughter really enjoyed the life sized dinosaurs when we visited and my son found all sorts of fun all over the exhibits. It was remarkably well suited for children with receptive disorders and did not overwhelm them as i was concerned about.",
          "Outstanding museum and experience for the whole family. Really, \u201cmuseum\" doesn\u2019t do it justice; there's a dinosaur trail, butterfly house, petting zoo, animal and space exhibits, playgrounds and, maybe best of all, legit tree houses. Like a \u2026",
          "We have a yearly membership to the museum. It is a great place to take the kids to play. There are a lot of great hands on science exhibits for the kids to try out and learn from. There is an animal exhibit inside the building as well as \u2026",
          "4 stars only because my toddler loved the play areas and wants to go again. The train ride is definitely not work 5$. I had high hopes after reading reviews but there are better options close to Raleigh. Mist area is most enjoyable. \u2026",
          "My wife's car pump adapter locked the bucket and the museum has nice private areas to go to for nursing Mom's.  Lifesaver for a our older sons birthday when we had left our youngest son at home. Thank you!!!",
          "Not a great wedding venue ... the museum seems ok but they do weddings here and they are to expensive for what is included they give you a hard time about vendors and everything \nLauren has proven to be difficult",
          "Tons of fun! There's so much to do, and I don't think we even saw half of it. We only had time for outside exhibits, and didn't even see all of them! Food at the Sprouts Cafe was really good. Hopefully, we'll be in the area again some time!",
          "The Greensboro Science Center has more to offer and at a more affordable price. The staff members were very unkind to my children.",
          "Best place for kids",
          "Very good museum. Lot's to do for children. , Outside there are also many places for children to explore and have fun. The grounds are well maintained . There a good little restaurant with outdoor dining. The butterfly house is wonderful, Have been  there a few times with the grand kids.",
          "We love this place try it go there at least once a year it is a great learning experience for adults and children I would give this place a 10 Stars but it only has five",
          "We love coming to the museum. There's so much to do especially for toddlers and small children. It is also fun for adults though probably not as much fun as it is for the kids. They have a great new tree house based playground. And it's always fun to ride the train. The cafe can also be very good knows how to make a good mean latte",
          "We travel a lot and always visit museums. This is THE BEST place ever!! It's totally worth the membership. Go rain or shine. Little babes or big kids. Parents will have a blast too!",
          "I love this place, and the kids do too.  They have so many things for any age to do.  Great food there too.  We will be annual pass holders for years.",
          "Awesome for the whole family!! We spent 6 hours there and had a great time!! Highly recommend!",
          "We had our wedding ceremony at the Museum of Life and Science and it was beautiful!  Lauren was very easy to work with and graciously answered my dozens of questions.  The day of the staff was very accommodating and helpful.  We're so pleased we chose this as our ceremony venue!",
          "I'm so glad we decided to purchase the membership.  The museum is huge and we were only able to see a fraction of it in our first visit.  My son (19 months old) loved the Hideaway Woods in particular.  The Into The Mist exhibit was really fun on the warm day we went.",
          "Great place for kids combining wonderful outdoor playcity, small zoo and quite expansive nature museum",
          "This is a great place for kids. If you come here often a membership comes in handy. There are many activities and your young ones will typically have an entire days worth of adventure.",
          "We recently became members of the Museum of Life and Science in Durham.  We had visited the museum before; but, this visit was even better.  The customer service from the museum employee (Terrence) at the front desk was fabulous! From the \u2026",
          "I have been going to this museum since I was in kindergarten.  I'm now 22 i have a little boy and he loves this place. They have made tons of improvements and have added many many things. My son's favorite part of the museum for some reason seems to be the stairs in front of the butter fly house -_-",
          "This place is awesome. I took my 4 year old nephew to see the dinosaur trail. He loved it and all the other things the museum had to offer. The mix of indoor and outdoor activities are great. Be sure you have a good pair of walking shoes, \u2026",
          "I love this place. We have been coming for years. They add new exhibits and keep it interesting. As the kids get older, they interact with the existing exhibits in new ways. It's great!",
          "Love this place! If you live in the area a membership is totally worth it. Our 5 year old loves it and we do too. So many fun and interesting things here and they're always doing something new.",
          "I gotta say, I love museums, and this place doesn't disappoint. \n\nThe admission isn't much, 16$, can add up quick fir a family of four and yes, they offer military discounts. \n\nI went before the tree houses were built, so I can't give my \u2026",
          "This was my first time going to this museum and unfortunately it was during my daughter's school field trip. Needless to say, we didn't even scratch the top surface with viewing the place because it's immaculate. You really need to go when \u2026",
          "Love the Durham Museum of Life and Science. It is an exciting way to learn more about the topic and get involved in the comunity. Lots of interesting things to do here. Thanks for everything that you do! Keep making science fun.",
          "They loved it! I can't wait to take them again. So many family friendly things and worth the cost of membership.",
          "Great museum with a bunch of cool programs year round.  It is very large and you unfortunately can't see everything in one visit.  The outdoor area is the best!",
          "I love this museum. They have wonderful educational exhibits that are just as much fun for adults as the kids. This museum has after hours activities that are great fun for the whole family. Recently, they had a Science of Beer exhibition \u2026",
          "My wife and children love this museum. Plenty of hands on Learning spaces. Love the outdoors section. The tree play area is amazing. Even when full there is plenty to do.",
          "I would actually give the museum 4-5 stars but their customer service and policies leave a lot to be desired. I arrived with a small group (11 people total) and asked for the group rate. Staff said we couldn't receive it because we didn't \u2026",
          "Fun for all ages-- we had a BLAST!",
          "Great place... wonderful for family... worth to get the yearly pass !!!",
          "Loved it nice museum for kids and adults!!!",
          "Fun for the whole family! We were in town for a week and checked this museum out. We were at first weary of spending the money on entrance, but it was well worth it. I had a blast, my wife had a blast and our 2 year old son had a blast. \u2026",
          "What a fun time for everyone",
          "Love this place!",
          "This place is a ton of fun. Our kids have done classes here. It doesn't get old.",
          "You don't have to be a kid to enjoy the Durham Museum of Life and Science, it can also be a great date spot!  Some of the most memorable activities include: Climbable Treehouses, outdoor improvisational music section, live animals, live \u2026",
          "This Museum is a local treasure. My family has had a membership for years, and it's one of the best investments I can recall. We can bring the kids here, spend an entire weekend afternoon, and head home with them happily exhausted without \u2026",
          "What a great place to take kids of all ages, to enjoy nature and learn about our earth and its inhabitants.",
          "Fun destination for families. There is a TON to do here. I find the tickets a little expensive,  we have a membership which is a great deal. We enjoy doing something different on each trip",
          "Fantastic place to visit. Definitely bring good walking shoes and a stroller if you have little ones. Carrying a worn out 2 year old for 3 miles of up and down, winding trails creates a worn out Dad. Worth every bit of it!",
          "Very cool museum -- I could spend hours here!  Unfortunately, there's not too much to do with a 10 month old here.  There's a petting zoo and a butterfly exhibit, which are both nice, but most of the installments are for slightly older \u2026",
          "My kids always love coming here. They are never bored because they have enough activities for them. I specially love their lab on 2nd floor and their new addition Hide Away Woods. My kids are 6 years apart, one is 8 and another one is 2 and they both can be equally engaged. A lot to do. My favorite place in town specially in winters. ",
          "Exceptional place for kids of ages 1 and above. Lots of neat stuff. Lots of diverse stuff. Combines learning and active fun with a really well organized layout. Just an awesome place. It's the first place we think of when out of towners are looking for something fun for their kids.",
          "As a parent of a younger child a few things set this museum apart from others: (1) it's spread out strategically and managed well. Some hiccups like overflow parking are never a problem because it's handled so smoothly by the volunteers. \u2026",
          "This is a great place to take your kids and the butterfly exhibit is really awesome. But other than that I thought it was too pricey for what you got. We had a great time but don't get your expectations too high.",
          "We've been members for 2 years, since our son was 1, and there have been activities for him at every stage. He especially loves the interactive, natural outdoor spaces, and the red wolves.",

          "Awesome place for families!!  Butterfly house is not to be missed.",
          "Cafe was dirty and I had to wipe down my own table. Animals were boring and u couldn\u2019t even see the bears. If u have a little tiny kid I guess it\u2019s fine.",
          "A fantastic local museum, with a constantly rotating set of active and interactive exhibits - everything from weather formation to getting up-close-and-personal with nature. When I was a kid myself, there was a raccoon here that I was \u2026",
          "Enjoyed my trip here with my 5-year old nephew. Plenty of activities inside, though several seem a bit tired and could do with a refresh. However, I think the outside areas are what make this place great. I loved the \"tree house\" built in \u2026",
          "There is so much to do here it is hard to say what exactly is the \"best\" The red wolf pups are great! Very cute.  The bears too. There was almost too much to do, which is never a bad thing.",
          "Great place for family fun.  Tons of activities for the kids, indoors and outside.  You can easily spend a full day visiting the various places outside; the butterfly house, the dinosaur trail, the play ground or the farmyard.  Then there \u2026",
          "It his is an excellent museum for both younger and older kids. With the addition of the new outdoor area, it is an especially great place to play, learn, and explore. My family goes here at least once a month, sometimes more often because of all the great exhibits and things to do.",
          "Plenty to do and very kid friendly.  Many trails and things for children to explore.  There is also a petting zoo and a large butterfly exhibit.  Kind of expensive if you are on a budget (almost $20/piece for 1 adult), but imo well worth the money.  Would definately recommend.",
          "Went with my 10yr old son whilst on holiday in NC.  Got to see a black bear, wolves and a whole host of farmyard animals.  There Dinosaur Trail was a huge hit.  You need nice weather as the majority of activities and things to see are outside on the trail that you follow.  Highly recommended!",
          "Our go-to destination for education and fun in Durham. The annual membership is totally worth every penny. We are quite thankful for L&S so our daughter has a place to grow and develop, and get out that extra toddler energy.",
          "We came from Smithfield to check out the science museum and was kinda shocked at the entrance for non durham residents and non members. My husband, our 3year old and I cost $60 to get in.. the zoo is cheaper and with more animals to see. \u2026",
          "I had taken my own children here back in the 80's, today was the 1st time I have taken my grands. Excellent experience!  The day is now a treasured memory.  Thanks! ",
          "Oh it was wonderful. The baby enjoyed herself. Her favorite exhibits was the dinosaur trail and the farm. Very well kept. Full of indoor and outdoor activities for children all ages. My daughter will be 2 at the end of the month. She loved \u2026",
          "The tree house bigger than our home sold us at first sight.  It's often very busy for good reason.  The animals are a lot of fun as well as the dinosaur trail.  There are also many wonderful exhibits inside but generally for older kids.  The MLS instantly became a kids activity staple for our family.",
          "We had an awesome time! Beautiful grounds, great place to go with kids! Well worth it and the food at the restaurant was really good!",
          "It's a nice place but is very cost prohibitive.  Has some live animals to see which is fun, the butterfly house is amazing, and the new tree houses are quite cool and fun for all ages but unless someone else is going I'd personally just \u2026",
          "The best collection of kid-friendly/adult-interesting activities in the area. They do a great job with holiday events, too (eg Santa train, egg hunt)",
          "Very nice museum for both children and adults...great play areas for children! Especially liked the butterfly world area.very scenic..",
          "We will be having our reception at the museum. Kelly (who runs events) could not be better at what she does.  I can't even remember how many emails I have sent asking question after question and she always answered with patience and \u2026",
          "Great museum with a bunch of cool programs.The outdoor area is the best! Mind blowing museum for kids.",
          "Although some of the exhibits are in need of minor renovations, this is still a great place to take the kids and to enjoy as an adult!  I agree with the family membership.  If you go a few times, it pays for itself.  This is a place where \u2026",
          "Best activity for young kids in Durham. The outdoor area is vast and way better than the inside parts. Definite recommend for nice days, but it's got enough to work on rainy days in a pinch. Membership is a good deal or it's good for out of \u2026",
          "This is a fantastic museum. There are a wide variety of interactive exhibits for kids of all ages. The new treehouse area is fantastic! We always try to make a stop at the butterfly house - if you can get there when they're releasing the newly hatched butterflies, that is an experience not to be missed. ",
          "Great place for rainy days or sunny. Indoor and outdoor activities. The main building is very interactive, maybe for the older child, for the younger one's there is the butterfly house, outdoor climbing frames and the train!",
          "So many things to do! This is a great place for kids and adults alike. You can learn and move at the same time with dynamic exibits. ",
          "Fun place to walk around and see the exhibits.  Be careful at the vending machines.  12oz water was stocked with 10oz.",
          "A great place for kids and adults. Fun scientific topics, hands on experience, intelligent workers. Been coming here for years and glad to be able to bring my kids here. ",
          "This place is great. We bought annual passes and take our 5 year old here at least weekly.\nThey have areas to play both indoors and outdoors, so it's something to do rain or shine. There is a cafe outside a short walk away from the main \u2026",
          "This place is great.  Don't listen to any of the negative comments.  Some parents go and forget they came for the kids... making it about themselves instead.",
          "Absolutely fantastic outdoor recreation for kids. Wish we had something like this in our city.",
          "Came to Durham this weekend just to go to this museum and it did not disappoint! We spent the entire day there and could have stayed longer. The lemurs are the best part!!",
          "This is a great place for for all ages really. There's a lot to do here and it's easy to get stuck in one section of the museum so if you live near by I recommend getting a membership.",
          "With a huge variety of activities, this is an amazing place to spend a Saturday.",
          "Great learning experience for kids. Lots of interactive displays and learning tools for kids and adults alike. The cafe also has great food!",

          "I grew up coming to this museum from Raleigh and, having just moved to Durham, wanted to revisit.  I'm glad I did - In addition to having the exhibits and features I missed, they've grown to be even more interesting with new exhibits and \u2026",
          "This place kept my nephews entertained all day. Have you seen that tree house? It makes me want one in my back yard. The food at the cafe was was delicious and a lot for what you pay for at a museum. I will probably share a meal next time. \u2026",
          "Excellent museum. Hard to get through the whole thing in one day, which imo means we got our money's worth. Can't wait to go back.",
          "Awesome place to take the kids to learn. So much to do and different environments. My neice loved to mist zone.",
          "This museum was amazing, and my 3yo had a blast! We went on a cloudy day which made it even better with the cooler air. My favorite part was the treehouse and my son loved the fog area. I highly suggest this museum and if you live closr, just buy the membership",
          "It's always fun for the kids, a great way to escape the heat while getting the kids out of the house to run around, the staff is always nice helpful and welcoming. I love this museum ",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Eno River State Park is a 4,312-acre (17.45 km2) North Carolina state park in Durham and Orange Counties, North Carolina. Together with the adjoining West Point on the Eno city park, the two parks preserve over 14 miles (22.5 km) of the Eno River and surrounding lands.\nThere are five public access areas with features including twenty-four miles of hiking trails, canoe launches, picnic areas, and historic structures.\n\n\n== Trails ==\n\n\n=== Buckquarter Creek ===\nBeginning at the parking lot for the Piper-Cox Museum, the Buckquarter Creek Trail goes up the river at Few's Ford. A staircase takes visitors to a view of the Eno River rapids down below. This 1.5-mile (2.4 km) loop is marked by red blazes. Holden Mill loop and the Ridge Trail branch off from the Buckquarter Creek Trail.\n\n\n=== Cabelands ===\nThe Cabelands Trail is 1.2 miles (1.9 km) long and is marked by red blazes. The trail passes through the few remains of the Cabe Mill. The stretch of the river is very rocky and is usually known as Cabe's Gorge.\n\n\n=== Cox Mountain ===\nThe Cox Mountain Trail is marked by blue blazes. The 3.75-mile (6.04 km) trail passes a picnic area and crosses the suspension foot bridge. The trail goes up 270 feet (82 m) in elevation and at one point follows Hillsborough Coach Road. When getting closer to Cox Mountain, the trail can get fairly steep. The trail connects to Fanny's Ford trail.\n\n\n=== Eno Quarry ===\nEno Quarry Trail is marked by blue blazes and is a 0.42-mile (0.68 km) loop. In the 1960s, stone was removed from the Eno Quarry Trail to aid in construction of Interstate 85. The quarry is now the site of a 4-acre (16,000 m2) pond. The trail has several spots that are good for fishing.\n\n\n=== Eno Trace ===\nEno Trace is a nature trail with several information kiosks pointing out wildlife. There is a short set of steps and at one point the trail follows alongside the river.\n\n\n=== Fanny's Ford ===\nFanny's Ford Trail is a 1.01-mile (1.63 km) loop and is mostly made up of flat ground and gentle hills. The trail is around the Cox Mountain trail and Hillsborough Coach Road, and at one point passes through the Few Mill's race. The trail is marked by purple blazes.\n\n\n=== Holden Mill ===\nThe Holden Mill trail is a combination of two loops and is 2.6 miles (4.2 km) long. The larger eastern loop follows the river bank for almost a mile, before climbing a 250-foot (76 m) rise in elevation. The smaller loop is a hike around the remains of Holden's Mill, but also follows the river at parts. It is marked by yellow blazes.\n\n\n=== Shakori ===\nThe Shakori Trail is a scenic 1.04-mile (1.67 km) hike marked by yellow U-shaped blazes. Hikers can view the remains of a 19th-century house and an old saw mill site. There is a 200-foot (61 m) elevation change. \n\n\n=== Laurel Bluffs ===\nThis trail starts at an intersection with the Pump Station Trail and goes east to Guess Road. It is 2.49 miles (4.01 km) long and generally stays close to the river except for short sections where cliffs and bluffs force it up and around on ridges. The trail passes the chimney and foundation of an old hunting lodge, the mostly-intact Guess Mill Dam, enters the millrace and comes out at the chimney at the Guess Mill site. Future plans are for Laurel Bluffs Trail to extend west to Cabelands Trail and to connect with West Point on the Eno city park trails. This connection will be a component of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail.\n\n\n=== Pump Station ===\nThe Pump Station Trail is known as the best spring wildflower trail in the park. It begins at the Nancy Rhodes Creek bridge on Rivermont Road and makes a 1.5 miles (2.4 km) loop. It is generally an easy hike with only a few gentle hills. The foundations of Durham\u2019s first water pumping station are near the river at the northeast section of the loop.\n\n\n== History ==\nNative Americans of the Eno, Shakori and Occoneechee tribes lived along the river prior to European settlement. Some of the tribes merged in the late 17th century and established a village near present-day Durham.Settlers moved to the area later to set up farms and gristmills. More than thirty mills were located on the Eno River. By the 1940s the last of the mills ceased operations.Efforts to protect the Eno River started in 1965 when the city of Durham proposed building a reservoir in the river valley. Concerned citizens led a campaign to save the Eno and formed the Association for the Preservation of the Eno River Valley. The association proposed the establishment of a state park and, in May 1972, the state of North Carolina approved the idea. In 1975, the state\u2014with help from the Eno River Association and the Nature Conservancy\u2014acquired more than 1,000 acres (4 km\u00b2) of land for the park.\n\n\n== The Eno River Association ==\nThe Eno River Association was established in 1966 and played an important role in creating the park. Since its inception it has purchased more than 4900 acres (20 km\u00b2) for the park. As a part of its conservation role the group engages in public outreach, notably producing the annual Festival for the Eno.The Festival for the Eno brings an average 30,000 visitors during three days in July. The festival includes music, crafts, food, and promotes environmental awareness. The proceeds are a major source of funding for the Eno River Association.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEno River\nWest Point on the Eno\nMountains-to-Sea Trail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Little did we think that so much greenery exists all around us and we were amazed at the views at the Eno River State Park. We choose the Cox Mountain Trail and it did not disappoint us. We went through the woods, the river, the hanging bridges, wooden steps and did a circle",
          "I used to live next to this park and I enjoyed walking in the woods in the spring. We went looking for wildflowers (lots, scattered along the path) and views (none to speak of except for some nice vistas along the river, upstream and down). There are a variety of trails,",
          "Trails range from easy to moderate. We live very nearby so know all the trails by heart. If you're in the area and want to work off some calories from Durham eateries, this is a great pro to do it in!",
          "A short drive from Durham, 15-20 minutes depending where in Durham you're coming from. Good for a walk and a picnic. Didn't try out the hiking trails.",
          "This state park along the river is very well maintained with many miles of hiking trails and lots of parking. Unfortunately, the trail maps are confusing and hard to follow. Better maps and signage would be extremely helpful. Other than that, the park is clean, a nice spot for",

          "It doesn't matter what trail you take, they all have their uniqueness about them. Either hiking along the river itself or on the ridges above, you will feel like you are alone with nature. Great flora and sometimes fauna will come your way. Best spot for wildflowers, spring",
          "No matter the season, there are always places to explore along the Eno--trails, river crossings, bridges, mill ruins, flora and fauna... The rock quarry is a favorite summer swimming hole, and the trails are well-marked and well-maintained. ERSP is truly a gem of the Triangle.",

          "We take our dog here sometimes for a bit of water-fetch (isn't always leashed for this...shhhhh!) There are some intimate pathways that take you further up the river or you can get on a more maintained trailhead here that, I believe, offers some miles along the river. This is",
          "There's a 20ft cliff people can dive off of as well as smaller cliffs and you can also walk down to the water. It's a good idea to use the tree logs as floatation devices or bring your own. It's a nice place for people or all ages; we even saw some dogs in the water or on",
          "I visit the Eno River Trails about 3 times a week. I run, I walk my dog, we swim in the river, we slide down the slippery falls, we swim at Bobbit's Hole. Its a great park, with trails for any distance. There are plenty of access points, but I'm not going to share my favorite",
          "We wanted something close by and outdoorsy so we drove over to Eno and hiked down to the river and took a swim. It is not necessarily easy to get into the river, but it is very worth. Would like to go back and spend more time here! Great for couples and families! lots of",

          "We had an amazing time during our short stay at Eno River State Park. The footbridges are very cool and walking along the river was super relaxing. We saw a few snakes, so as always, be aware of your surroundings and where you are stepping. A rainstorm hit before we arrived and",

          "I visited ERSP yday with my dogs and kids. We had such a good time. Our favorite was the quarry. It was big enough and not crowded at all. Parking is a little tough at the quarry. You might have to wait for a spot. The little rapids area at Fews Ford was very cute and fun",

          "I visited this park with my two dogs.We hiked a bit then headed to the river where we were delighted to find out that dogs are welcome in the water. My Kenzie's delight was a joy to see. So many trails to choose from and at one end of the river there are rock and driftwood",
          "The Eno River State Park is a super place to enjoy the river or hike on one of the numerous trails on the property. The park also features primitive camping on a reservation basis. We took a scout group camping on an overnight and had a fantastic time.",
          "Although we encountered a brief rain, we were able to enjoy some time swimming in the river and relaxing in our Eno hammock at Eno Park. Pretty cool-that company should make a commercial here! We also enjoyed hiking a short trail to cross a really neat suspended bridge. There",

          "this park stretches across orange and durham counties, with great walking and hiking trails along the Eno river. Very rustic in some areas, and deserted in some areas, leading to a very historic and natural feeling when walking by the river, or on top of the ridges. Historic",
          "Not as spectacular as I expected but the place is still beautiful. I really liked walking along the river and just sitting down on the shade and watch the water flow. Absolutely relaxing! Good hiking trails as well if you're a beginner. Not much crowd on a Sunday and the best",
          "Not nearly as impressive or beautiful as some of the other nature parks I've visited in North Carolina, but still good for a family picnic on a spring afternoon. The woods are yet to turn completely green for this time of the year. I hope to visit this place again when the",

          "We love visiting state parks. Or any parks, actually. It's our favorite part of traveling. I'm guessing in the \"when did you travel\" part, but it was at least a year ago and I still remember it. That's impressive, given how bad my memory is.",
          "This is a great casual adventure spot for those who want to get out of the city and enjoy the weather. On a weekend the parking is limited and there can definitely be a few big crowds but once you get out into the open you can definitely enjoy the area and surrounding trails.",
          "This is a really nice, accessible park that meanders along the Eno River in Durham and Orange counties. There are several park entrances and camping areas, plus many miles of trails. It can be very peaceful once you get away from the parking areas. Just about everyone we saw",

          "If you enjoy nature and walking in the woods, the Eno is as good a place you will find in the Triangle area. In Raleigh Umstead Park is comparable and in Orange county the NC Botanical Gardens are nice but not as large or wild as the Eno. Plus the Eno Foundation recently",

          "This is a great place to hike, kids to play, or just relax. We visited for a wedding that was occurring and enjoyed the scenery",
          "Eno River State Park is a great place to hike. There are a number of trails which always makes for a good day in the woods. Some of the trails could benefit from more frequent blazes. The park map could be handier.",

          "This is a great spot to take a hike of about any distance you prefer. It includes Cox Mountain trail to get some climbing in, or other trails that go right along the lovely Eno River for several miles. It provides a chance to see some wildlife, with turtles, a heron, a",
          "The park is so peaceful and so pretty. You will definitely get plenty of exercise on the trails. There are picnic tables right at the parking area so you can pack a lunch and keep in the car until you return from your hike. Cross the suspension bridge if you dare.",
          "Great hiking for the triangle. Lots of trails to. Choose from. The ParKing and maps could improve on some trails.",
          "This is a great state park and it is free to enter. There are several great hiking trails, the loop I did was about 5.5 miles and had a small amount of ascent and decent to it. We also saw several families with children swimming. I would recommend this place for a good weekend",
          "It is a lake in the middle of the quarry. You can jump off a ledge there or just float around. FLOATY RECOMMENDED, if not there are many logs you could float on. Park rangers strict with alcohol but still able to get away with if you really want. Wonderful time relaxing",
          "I had seen this state park on trip advisor, and we decided, last minute, to visit it on our way home from Durham! It was the highlight of our trip- just wish we would have taken water shoes! We walked with the kids and then let them wade in the water with their flip flops. There",

          "Visited the park for a short trek in May 2015 with a couple of friends. Found the park to be a nice walking and trekking destination. The trails are well defined , signages are located to guide the walkers and the best pet is the river crossing. It's an excellent place .",

          "went to 2 different locations. First went on a hike - it was nice. A lot of good scenery. Kept us entertained us for a few hours! Next day we went to a swimming hole. It was kind of crowded so we hiked upstream and chilled on a rock for a few hours. Nice and relaxing. Even saw",
          "We visited on a Saturday afternoon at the end of May and found very few people on the trail. We entered the Fews Ford area and started the Buckquarter Creek/Holden Mill Trail. Staring at the visitor center, the ranger was helpful and suggested this trail. There was some",

          "It was a beautiful hike. There was a variety of trees, plants, and flowers. We settled at a secluded spot on the river and went fishing. We caught mainly sunfish but a few other species not native to the area which made it more fun. Don't go alone because there are reports of",
          "My home is one of the fortunate few that is on the banks of the Eno, backed by forest preserve. I am forever grateful for the trails, the fews and preservation of this land..try and get off on some of the lesser known trails and you will find solitude and peace on the outskirts",

          "This is our absolute favorite park in the Durham area. There are trails for everyone and every level. The park has a picnic area and the river is great for wading in. One drawback is that weekends, especially when the weather is nice, it tends to be packed with people. If",
          "Eno River Park it's a very nice forest to visit for a couple of hours or to spend a whole day and even the night (camping it's allow upon registration). If you have the luxury to visit in a windy day then you'll want to stay as longer as possible. The sound of the trees moved by",

          "Just 10-15 minutes driving north of Durham. We went to the visitor center where we got a map and some information. Nice people work there. Because our time was limited we walked the Buckquarter Creek Trail, 1.5 mile loop. You walk in the forest and next to the Eno River. Lovely",
          "We spent time here on a 2 or 3 mile walk along the river with family and dogs. The paths are lovely, and we saw no litter. A great place to commune with nature, observe afternoon light, and spend time with others.",

          "Lots of walking paths with interesting audio guided tours you can call on your cell phone. The river/stream itself is beautifully clear and a rocky bottom, which is unusual for this part of North Carolina. There's a great suspension bridge that's fun to walk across and sway",
          "Our family loves hiking at the Eno River parks. We have two black labs that swim in the river. It's the best place to cool off in the summer as most trails are shaded. In the Spring we love watching the big spotted turtles.",
          "We went for a hike that we thought was only a mile or so. Resulted in a three mile loop, because we didn't take a map. The trails were well maintained and easy to walk. The forest was open with little undergrowth, but there wasn't a lot of birds or other wildlife. Probably",
          "This is a lovely state park with good trails along a stream. It's not breaktaking, but it's a nice retreat from the surrounding hub-bub of Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill. I was surprised to find such a nice area for hiking & picnicking so close to the city.",
          "We are extremely fortunate to have so much protected green space just 10 minutes out of downtown. We love all Eno Park entrances. The West Point on the Eno is easy access to the river. We also really enjoy going to the Few's Ford and Cole Mill entrances. The river is always",

          "What can I say about Eno River State Park that has not already been said? It's a gem, a diamond in the rough. The Triangle owes a lot to folks like the Eno River Association who helped preserve this haven on the edge of a growing urban sprawl. I am most familiar with the area",
          "Cool little park with interesting features. Can you find the abandoned house? Climb the derelict chimney stack if you dare!",

          "Great park to hike locally. I\u2019ve done the 5 mile ish trail a few times and have greatly enjoyed it. The scenery is wonderful and the trail pleasant while a bit challenging. The parking area gets full pretty quickly, so either arrive early or be aware that there is a secondary parking area nearby.",
          "Love Eno River trails!",
          "Cox trail is awesome! 4.6 mile loop, some of it along the river. The suspension foot bridge is not to be missed! It's close to the start of the hike & again at the end.",

          "The Fews Ford section of the park is absolutely breathtaking.  Several miles of trails with amazing views around every turn.  The suspension bridge and old barns take you back to to a different time.  Great place to bring the family for a day hike or for camping.  Some much more to explore.",
          "Beautiful park for a day hike. Lots of dogs on the trails too!",
          "Visited for the morning with our two young children, very accessible area! Trails were busy on the national holiday. Wish we'd known ahead of time about the Fews Ford wading area, we'll dress for getting out feet wet next time. Still many paths to choose from, my littles (5 and 2) thought the suspension bridge was great fun!",
          "Park rangers everywhere. Be smart, don't bring alcohol. Parking extremely limited.",

          "A very nice walk in the woods by a slow, lazy river.  We got a snake, many turtles, a woodpecker, and generally a pleasant morning.",
          "An awesome hiking place, especially for dogs too. There is a loop somewhere about a mile in that lasts for about 2.5 miles. And then the walk back from that it\u2019s about 4 miles total. And the dogs can swim pretty much the whole time in the river. We even went into the river it\u2019s really nice.",
          "Great place for hiking and camping. Several trails for walking. Swinging bridge is wonderful experience.",
          "One of my favourite places in the Triangle to hike and play ukulele. Most of trails are relatively shady, so you can hike without feeling like you are being pummeled by sun. Plus, they have skinks.",

          "My friends and I spent a Sunday afternoon here, hiking briefly on the trails that border the river and swimming just upstream of the ford. The footbridge that closes the river was really cool (I'm a sucker for bridges), and it was great \u2026",
          "This is a beautiful place to hike, play in the river, and picnic.  We always have a wonderful time with the kids here.  When the weather is warmer, the river is moderately shallow, so even small children can play in it.  Lots of rocks for climbing and just beautiful trails.",
          "3/31/18 First time visiting the Eno River State Park. Get there early as it gets busy around lunch.  Even with the crowd, everyone I encountered was very friendly. The trails are kept up and groomed very well. Use caution if you have weak \u2026",

        "wiki": "Bennett Place, Durham, North Carolina, was the site of the last surrender of a major Confederate army in the American Civil War, when Joseph E. Johnston surrendered to William T. Sherman. The first meeting (April 17, 1865) saw Sherman agreeing to certain political demands by the Confederates, which were promptly rejected by the Union cabinet in Washington. Another meeting had to be held (April 26) to agree on military terms only, in line with Robert E. Lee\u2019s recent surrender to Ulysses S. Grant. This effectively ended the war.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea, he turned north through the Carolinas for the Carolinas Campaign. Confederate President Jefferson Davis met his General Joseph E. Johnston in Greensboro, North Carolina, while Sherman had stopped in Raleigh.\nThough Davis wished strongly to continue the war, Johnston sent a courier to the Union troops encamped at Morrisville Station, with a message to General Sherman, offering a meeting between the lines to discuss a truce. Johnston's army was still an active fighting force that, unlike Robert E. Lee's beleaguered Army of Northern Virginia, which had surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865, had an available line of retreat along which, according to Davis, \"ample supplies\" had been placed.Johnston, escorted by a detachment of about 60 troopers of the 5th South Carolina Cavalry Regiment, traveled east along the Hillsborough Road toward Durham Station in Durham, Durham County. Sherman was riding west to meet him, with an escort of 200 men from the 9th and 13th Pennsylvania, 8th Indiana and 2nd Kentucky Cavalry. The farm of James and Nancy Bennett at Bennett Place, sometimes known as Bennett Farm, was a convenient place for privacy.\nThe first day's discussion (April 17) was intensified by the telegram Sherman handed to Johnston, informing of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. They met the following day, April 18, and signed terms of surrender. However, on April 24, Grant arrived and informed Sherman that the terms had been rejected by the presidential cabinet in Washington because they exceeded the terms that Grant had given Lee and included civil matters. The opposing generals met again on April 26, 1865, and with the assistance of Gen. John M. Schofield, agreed to new terms omitting the controversial sections.  The agreement disbanded all active Confederate forces in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, totaling 89,270 soldiers, which was the largest group to surrender during the Civil War.\n\n\n=== Bennett family leaves and the dedicated site ===\nJames and Nancy Bennett were like many families who suffered tremendously during the four years of war. They lost a son and son-in-law: Lorenzo, who served in the 27th North Carolina, buried in Winchester, Virginia; and their daughter Eliza's husband, Robert Duke, who died in a Confederate Army hospital and is buried in Lynchburg, Virginia. Their 3rd child, Alfonzo, was not in the war but died during the Civil War years (1864). The Bennetts never fully recovered from the war, and in 1878, James Bennett died and the family moved to the new community of Durham to begin a life without him.\nThe Bennett Farm was abandoned and fell into ruin; a fire finally destroying the farmhouse in 1921. In 1923 the Unity monument was dedicated on the site. In 1960 the Bennett Farm site was fully reclaimed and restored by local preservationists. It was then turned over to the State of North Carolina and made a state historic site.\n\n\n== Largest surrender of the American Civil War ==\n\nThe difficulty in reaching a surrender agreement lay in part in Johnston's desire, influenced by President Davis, for more than the purely military surrender that Major General Sherman offered. Sherman's original terms matched those offered by Lt. General Ulysses S. Grant to General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, but Johnston along with General John C. Breckinridge, also serving as Secretary of War for the Confederacy, insisted on resolutions of political issues, including the reestablishment of state governments, return of some weapons to state arsenals and civil rights after the war. Sherman, in accordance with Lincoln's stated overall wishes for a compassionate and forgiving end to the war, agreed on terms that included the political issues.  Sherman was unaware that on March 3, Lincoln had given Grant orders to discuss only military matters with Lee. Lincoln was later assassinated.After reading the original Sherman-Johnston terms of surrender, United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, taking a position in accordance with Lincoln's instructions to Grant, persuaded a unanimous Federal cabinet to reject the terms.  Sherman was instructed to call Johnston back to the table and request the military surrender of Johnston's army. In response, Jefferson Davis ordered Johnston to disband his infantry and escape with his mounted troops. However, Johnston disobeyed his orders and agreed to meet again with Major General Sherman at Bennett Farm. The second negotiation session took place on April 26, 1865. The opposing generals agreed to new military surrender terms that were substantially identical to the ones Grant had given to Lee, supplemented with corollary implementation terms written by Schofield pertaining to rations and return of the paroled soldiers to their homes. The surrender agreement ended the war for the 89,270 soldiers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Three more primary surrenders would follow in Citronelle, Alabama; Galveston, Texas; and Doaksville, Oklahoma.\n\n\n== Bennett Place State Historic Site ==\n\nThe home of James and Nancy Bennett, simple yeoman farmers, served as the site of the surrender negotiations between Major General William T. Sherman and General Joseph E. Johnston April 17, 18 and 26, 1865. It was the largest surrender of the American Civil War, officially ending the fighting in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. The original house burned in 1921 and was reconstructed as a two-story log structure covered by weatherboards with a gable roof and a shed addition.  Also on the property are a log kitchen and smokehouse.In 1923, the Unity Monument was placed on the site to commemorate this historic event. Among the many contributors to the preservation of this historic landmark were the Duke, Everett, and Morgan families.\nToday, Bennett Place State Historic Site belongs to the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources and is located in the west end of Durham, near Duke University.

          "Few know that the Civil War actually ended here. There is a great human story behind the surrender but better to visit and discover it yourself.

        "wiki": "The Nasher Museum of Art (previously the Duke University Museum of Art) is the art museum of Duke University, and is located on Duke's campus in Durham, North Carolina, United States. The Nasher, along with Dartmouth's Hood Museum of Art and Princeton's Art Museum, has been recognized as a place that \"raises the cultural bar\" on college campuses.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1936, art collector William Hayes Ackland wrote letters to three universities, attempting to find a place to bequest his collection to upon his death. Duke University President William Preston Few was receptive to this idea, and had plans drawn up for an art museum at Duke. After the death of both Few and Ackland, Duke refused to accept the gift, for reasons still not disclosed. Ackland's estate had to posthumously find a new location to build a museum, eventually creating the Ackland Art Museum.In 1969, the university established the Duke University Museum of Art on Duke's East Campus with medieval art from the Ernest Brummer Collection.In the later twentieth century, there was a push to move the location of the museum to a more central location. Professors of botany fought the plan because the new location would disturb the \"botanical study area,\" a field of plants.In the early twenty-first century, in part from a gift by alumnus Raymond Nasher, the museum became known as the Nasher Museum of Art and opened a new $24 million museum  designed by architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly. Since its reopening, annual attendance is about 100,000 visitors.\nMary D.B.T., great-granddaughter of Benjamin Newton Duke, brother of James Buchanan Duke, and James H. Semans were major contributors to the university art museum. Sarah Schroth, former Nancy Hanks Senior Curator, is the director of the museum.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe collection contains more than 13,000 works of art, including works by Ai Weiwei, Sanford Biggers, Christian Boltanski, William Cordova, Rineke Dijkstra, Marlene Dumas, Olafur Eliasson, Dar\u00edo Escobar, Deborah Grant, Hassan Hajjaj, David Hammons, Barkley L. Hendricks, Thomas Hirschhorn, Taiyo Kimura, Sean Landers, Glenn Ligon, Christian Marclay, Kerry James Marshall, Zanele Muholi, Wangechi Mutu, Dan Perjovschi, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Robin Rhode, Dario Robleto, Ed Ruscha, Cindy Sherman, Xaviera Simmons, Lorna Simpson, Jeff Sonhouse, Eve Sussman, Alma Thomas, Hank Willis Thomas, Mickalene Thomas, Bob Thompson, Kara Walker, Nari Ward, Andy Warhol, Carrie Mae Weems, Kehinde Wiley, Fred Wilson and Lynette Yiadom Boakye. The museum is dedicated to presenting contemporary art from around the world, with particular attention given to those who have been historically underrepresented. Founding director Kimberly Rorschach left for Seattle Art Museum in November 2012.\nThe museum has a strong collection of Pre-Columbian art (3,300 objects), with particularly significant holdings of Mayan ceramics and Peruvian textiles.\n\n\n== Selected exhibitions ==\n Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey \nMarch 21, 2013 \u2013 July 21, 2013\nThe Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University has organized Wangechi Mutu\u2019s first survey in the United States, the most comprehensive and innovative show yet for this internationally renowned, multidisciplinary artist. Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey presents more than 50 works from the mid-1990s to the present, including collage, drawing, sculpture, installation and video. The exhibition features many of the artist\u2019s most iconic collages drawn from major international collections, rarely seen early works and new creations. The exhibition also unveils the artist\u2019s sketchbooks of intimate drawings that reveal her creative process and inspirations, on public view for the first time. Other new highlights include Mutu\u2019s first-ever animated video, The End of eating Everything, created in collaboration with Santigold, commissioned by the Nasher Museum. Mutu also will transform the gallery into an environmental installation, including a monumental wall drawing, which allows visitors to immerse themselves in the artist's work. The exhibition is curated by Trevor Schoonmaker, Chief Curator and Patsy R. and Raymond D. Nasher Curator of Contemporary Art.\n The Record: Contemporary Art and Vinyl \nSeptember 2, 2010 \u2013 February 6, 2011\nThis is the first museum exhibition to explore the culture of vinyl records within the history of contemporary art. Bringing together forty-one artists from around the world who have worked with records as their subject or medium, this groundbreaking exhibition examines the record\u2019s transformative power in the years from the 1960s to the present. Through sound work, sculpture, installation, drawing, painting, photography, video, and performance, The Record combines contemporary art with outsider art, audio with visual, fine art with popular culture, and established artists with those exhibiting in a U.S. museum for the first time. The 41 artists in the exhibition include Laurie Anderson, David Byrne, Janet Cardiff, William Cordova, Jeroen Diepenmaat, Jasper Johns, Jack Goldstein, Taiyo Kimura, Ralph Lemon, Christian Marclay, Mingering Mike, Dave Muller, Vik Muniz, 9th Wonder, DJ Rekha, Robin Rhode, Dario Robleto, Ed Ruscha, Malick Sidibe, Xaviera Simmons, Su-Mei Tse, and Carrie Mae Weems. The exhibition is curated by Trevor Schoonmaker.\n Barkley L. Hendricks: Birth of the Cool \nFebruary 7, 2008 \u2013 July 13, 2008\nThis exhibit is the first career painting retrospective of renowned American artist Barkley L. Hendricks. Born in 1945 in Philadelphia, Hendricks' unique work resides at the nexus of American realism and post-modernism, a space somewhere between portraitists Chuck Close and Alex Katz and pioneering black conceptualists David Hammons and Adrian Piper. He is best known for his stunning, life-sized portraits of people of color from the urban northeast. Cool, empowering and sometimes confrontational, Hendricks' artistic privileging of a culturally complex black body has paved the way for today's younger generation of artists who are deeply indebted to him. This exhibition of Hendricks' paintings includes work from 1964 to the present. The exhibition will travel to the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Santa Monica Museum (Los Angeles,)the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston. There is a definitive full-color exhibition catalogue with over 160 reproductions, edited by the Nasher Museum's curator of contemporary art Trevor Schoonmaker.\n El Greco to Velazquez: Art during the Reign of Philip III \nAugust 21, 2008 \u2013 November 9, 2008\nThe Nasher Museum collaborated with the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston to present this groundbreaking exhibition \u2013 the first in the US to focus on Spanish art of the period between 1598 and 1621. The show examines a fascinating period bookended by the two giants of Spanish painting: the late works of El Greco and the early paintings of Vel\u00e1zquez. The exhibition is the culmination of 20 years of research by Sarah Schroth, the Nasher Museum's senior curator.\nThis exhibition includes some 120 paintings, sculptures and decorative art pieces, representing 20 artists. The masters will be seen in context with lesser-known artists working during this time in Spain. The show will bring together works of art from museums around the world, some of which rarely travel outside of their countries, creating a unique opportunity for American audiences. Key loans from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museo del Prado, the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, and the National Gallery of Art, among other institutions and private lenders, were secured.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNasher Museum of Art website\nArtDaily coverage of the Nasher's opening",

          "This is a nice smaller museum that has two exhibits and a theatre. The theatre presentation (Precarity) was a bit odd, but my wife liked it. The two permanent exhibits are smaller but have some interesting pieces. Overall, a Nice smaller museum good for 1-2 hours.",

          "On a cold or wet day, this is a great place to spend a couple of hours. We really enjoyed the Courtside photos of Bill Bamberger. The movie about John Akomfrah is worth viewing but read the description outside of the building first. We sat down and it took us a while to figure",
          "Hard for me to review these one but can't give it 5 stars specially after i went to the Ackland one in UNC. And is not a size issue (This one is smaller but doesn't mean isn't as good) i was shocked of all the noisemin the museum. I get it, this one is more for social gathering",
          "We had some time after visiting UNC and the Ackland Museum so we headed over to Duke to check out the Nasher. I'd say it's time for Duke to step up it's competition with UNC on the art front as the collection is small and disappointing. Where are the donors?!? Our little",
          "I love this small museum. The recent Carlo Dolci exhibit was gorgeous. It's one of those where I had to go twice. This was the country's first ever exhibit by this Florentine painter. What a joy to see these lesser known pieces. Keep up the great work, Nasher curators!",

          "This is a new addition to Durham as I have been here 31 years and the previous art collection was not housed in such a grand building. This is impressive. That we can also eat a great lunch or dinner while we see art is even better. The restaurant is not an afterthought but a",

          "For $14 each admission, we expected a museum experience, not just one exhibit. The Dolci was pretty great, more so because we've been to Florence, Italy experienced similar pieces. It took all of an hour.",

          "Ample parking, but as far as I could tell, no way from lot to entrance without negotiating stairs. Could be a problem for wheelchairs and those with mobility issues. Open, welcoming building. Major emphasis on black artists.",
          "Very nice art museum with diversified exhibits. Lunch on the terrace was very good. Only problem was the distance from the parking area to the museum.",
          "The museum itself is small, manageable for a morning, and varied. The cafe is fabulous. So good it almost kept us from the exhibits. Sit outside if the weather cooperates. Small entrance fee unless it's the first weekend of the month (Bank of America account gets you in free) or",
          "Went here to see the Doris Duke Shangri-la exhibit. A small museum with a fascinating permanent collection. Check out the quaint bookshop and cafe.",
          "I always enjoy going to the Nasher. It has beautiful architecture, fantastic exhibits and a wonderful, reasonably priced gift shop. They sometimes do receptions for the exhibits which are fun too! A must if you are in the Duke area.",
          "I am an art museum docent and make it a point to visit as many art museums that I can when I am traveling. I was so impressed with the quality of the North Carolina Museum of Art and so under impressed with the Nasher in terms of both it's temporary and permanent exhibits. That",
          "Worth a visit if you're in the area and looking for something to occupy a couple hours, as that's about what you can expect to spend here. The facility is beautiful and the exhibits are beautifully done.",
          "We have been there with 2 young kids. The exhibit was interesting and well organized. It was a little crowded but it was expected. The museum is not too big and this can be a little disappointing. The gift shop is nice too and not overpriced. The cafeteria is nice and the food",
          "Beautiful exhibit and so interesting! The museum is nice and bright with an excellent gift shop. A docent is really helpful to get the full exposure to the exhibit.",
          "We were able to go on a day with free admission to all galleries. The permanent collection was a great mixture of ancient artifacts to Warhols. The Wangechi Mutu exhibit was phenomenal.",
          "The building's architecture is sleek steel and glass and works well with the environment and landscape. The interior is wonderful - light, airy, open, however there does not seem to be much space available to showcase the collections. It seems to be more of an exhibition space",
          "Not all of the exhibits were open during our visit but what we did see was very interested and they have a very nice collection.",
          "I work at a University that has a larger museum than this -- and more collections open to the public -- and it is FREE. The collection is nice -- but really surprised by the $5 per person admission charge for something that doesn't even take an hour to see.",
          "Somewhat unattractive art museum, with mostly modern \"art\". Not as nice as museums at Harvard, Princeton and Penn, but not bad.",
          "This is a beautiful, new museum, with a small number of galleries. The large gallery, into which visiting installations go, was, unfortunately, closed, so we could only see the three galleries that were open to the public at that time. The Nasher has a respectable collection,",
          "Some marvelous works. Small but beautifully done museum with special exhibits periodically. Excellent lunch restaurant. On the Duke campus which is also well worth the visit.",
          "Carol and I visited the Nasher Museum for 2nd time this afternoon (i.. Thursday) We received bargain admission with senior discount tickets @ $4.00 each. We previewed a wonderful exhibit entitled Fantastic Journey by African artist Wengachuchi Mutu. The exhibit was awesome",
          "Almost all the attractions in the Triangle area are free but you have to pay admission for the Nasher museum. The $5.00 admission is well worth spending for the special exhibit \"Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey\". Normally, I find the audio guide too wordy but somehow this",
          "The museum was much smaller than I had expected and after slowly walking through the exhibits we were done in like 15 minutes. Maybe we caught it on a bad day because one of the halls was closed, but we haven't been back since and usually we love museums.",
          "With out of town guests, we enjoyed the special exhibit featuring modernists. It was well-curated and had lots of interesting pieces. We also visited the permanent collections, but did not find them as interesting.",
          "Parking is limited and it's a hike uphill to the museum, which can be a problem for the disabled (there is a dropoff, however). The museum building itself is structurally fascinating, from the atrium to the customizable exhibition space. Check Indyweek to see what's on, or go",
          "We go way, way back in Durham, to the years when the Duke Art Museum was an obscure part of a small building on East Campus. When the Nasher money came and the new museum was built, the original collection was integrated into the much grander facility--we've always been",
          "A relatively new, light-filled building, a great staff and very interesting collections. Their special exhibits are outstanding, and there are often 2 or more of then in a year. Check the website.",
          "One of three art musurms that we visited while in Raleigh/Durham. Very interesting exhibits, nice little restaurant. Which there also take a walk to the duke campus and visit the iconic cathedral.",
          "Saw the Cone Sisters exhibit in the fall of 2012. Great place, exhibits were well laid out, friendly staff. If you find yourself with a free afternoon in Durham, take the time to go by.",
          "The Nasher Museum is small, but lovely, and brings in a variety of excellent exhibits. I have been to most of them and also enjoy the pieces owned by the museum. The lectures I attended here were educational and interesting. I have enjoyed a nice lunch with family and friends",
          "Duke has added a real gem to the museum community in the Triangle. The five segment building joined by ab atrium draws one in and the gallerias are well lit and easy to navigate.",
          "Small collection but very well presented and lovely. There were a number of school children on private tours when we were there, all very engaged. We would definitely come back again.",
          "We spent all of our time at the excellent photography exhibit. It was tremendous, featuring a wonderful cross-section of the masters of photography. We had a nice day to enjoy a tasty lunch from the cafe outside. Having to pay for parking in advance was inconvenient because",
          "Attended this past Friday and saw Matisse, Picasso, etc. This is a very nice museum and they have wonderful special exhibits. The parking can be problematic, though. Well worth a visit.",
          "I like the setting of this museum. It's located near/on Duke campus in a forest of trees. Parking was difficult, but we were prepared for that since we visited on a Sunday, the last weekend before the exhibit closed. The exhibit itself was also very crowded, but we managed to",
          "Not only can you find excellent exhibits at the Duke University art museum, the Nasher, but also there is a restaurant featuring well-prepared local food. Parking is terrible. It is best to go early (opens at ten) to take your time with exhibits, and then have an early lunch.",
          "This is our second trip to this museum, and yes, it is small, but it has outstanding traveling exhibits. The Cone Sisters of Baltmore: Collecting Matisse and Modern Masters was suburb! Also saw an excellent exhibit of Alexander Caulder this summer. No, it's not the Louve,",
          "Saw the current \"Collecting Matisse\" exhibit at the Nasher. Well worth a visit. Very nice museum generally. The special exhibit was great. I would definitely recommend it.",
          "Small but nice, modern museum. Interesting exhibits but nothing too incredible. It's still a pleasant activity if you're looking for things to do in Durham.",
          "The exhibition of Matisse and the Collection of his work and other Modern Masters was well put together. I just wish it was larger. The chronology of their collecting was fairly well put together considering the space in which the curators were working. The works by Matisse",
          "Took my mom here because she loves museums, and I'm sorry to say I should've taken her to the NC museum of art instead of the Nasher. It's interesting, but there isn't a great order of things. I'm talking greek sculptures next to paper mache soccer balls and peruvian statues.",
          "I'm a pretty pretentious individual and my wife is an art historian. Despite that, I found this place to be the most self important, pretentious art gallery I have ever been to. The exhibits are unapologetically minimalistic and the ongoing displays are boring. I realize that",
          "After visiting the nearby Sarah Duke Gardens, we came to Nasher for lunch. Appreciated the handicapped spaces and drop off area. Ample parking. Second visit here. Exhibitions are primarily contemporary art. Would recommend.",
          "Museum is interesting although a bit on the small side. The modern art exhibits rotate and the permanent exhibits has more classical feel with Greek sculptures, paintings etc. Restaurant serves lunch and has an amazing rotating menu which can be visited without paying for",
          "We visited the Nasher Museum a few months ago and had dinner as well. Great museum, free after 5pm on Thursday nights too. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The gift shop is small but has some neat things in it. Dinner was very good and fairly priced. We are considering",
          "This small museum, housed in a modern state of the art building, is a pleasure. They sponsor some exhibitions that are very good/interesting- not everything will be from their collection. One can spend an enjoyable morning or afternoon browsing the exhibits and the small store.",
          "This is a beautiful building, inside and out. They regularly have world-class exhibits that are well-curated and interesting. Plus the rotating works they bring from their own collection are often great, too. The cafe is my favorite place to eat outdoors because the food is",
          "The museum is a great place to spend the day with something to see for everyone. the restaurant has a limited menu but the food is very good and the service is excellent.",
          "The museum is a must-see. We have gone when they have had exhibits that were in only two places in the United States and the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University was one of them. You have got to see it!",
          "We visited the Nasher to see the current (May 2012) Alexander Calder exhibit. It is a small museum with great display spaces. The Calder exhibit took up the better part of 2 of the 3 galleries and was worth the price of admission. The third gallery housed the museum's",
          "We went because of the Calder exhibit. Other than that, meh.",
          "I'm a frequent visitor to the Nasher in Dallas and the Nasher @ Duke is an equally fantastic place. Tucked in the Duke Forest, between East and West campus, the museum is a lovely spot to spend an afternoon.",
          "Loved seeing the Calder exhibit, but did not like that it was 1/3 other artists interspersed with Calder exhibit. Permanent collection nice but small.",
          "The exhibition was very good so is the restaurant.. Clean and good food.",
          "not strong in permanent collection, but good exhibitions, and a large, open, welcoming space. they obviously had plenty of land and money, even if not much of their own art. nice shop. very good cafe for lunch. worth a couple of hours.",
          "I had high expectations for the Nasher Museum on Duke's campus. After all, this is supposedly a major university and they had built an impressive, expensive new museum (2005) designed by a famous architect, Rafael Vinoly, in a prominent location that is readily accessible",
          "The shows generally are more interesting to read about than to actually see. You have to pay for parking and admittance, a sharp contrast to the excellent state art museum in Raleigh.",
          "Good museum for a university. I have seen 3 exhibits there and enjoyed them all. Small museum in my opinion. Holds other quality events there and has a very good publication and communications to members are very informative. I like the restaurant there as well.",
          "Though much smaller than the NC Museum of Art, the quality of the exhibitions and curating is way higher at the Nasher. Contemporary art is not always easy for the uneducated public to understand. The Nasher does a great job of presenting the work so that it is more accessible.",
          "Just saw the Calder exhibit there. Kids and adults all thought it was great.",
          "The Calder exhibit was great to see and the building itself is pretty cool. Worth the 30-60 minutes it will take to walk around and check it out.",
          "Granted they have some amazing pieces however it\u2019s very small and only takes about 15-30 min to see. Also, they don\u2019t give military discount=lame.",
          "Enjoy all kinds of art in this modern building on the edge of Duke U campus. The cafe is nice for an artful lunch.",
          "small enough but classy enough. Pretty good rotation of works, easy parking and accessibility",
          "I'm spoiled by exposure to the best of NY, London and Paris, so my standards for museums are pretty high. That said, the Nasher is a lovely place to spend a couple of hours, and I enjoy periodic visits when out of town friends come to stay.",
          "The contemporary visiting exhibits are always cutting edge.",
          "This museum is so light and bright. The art is easy to look at and it is well organized. It is quite small and can be done in under an hour. The day we were there it was filled with school children which always is distracting but at the same time it is wonderful to see the",
          "Service and food are good- Nice place to relax for lunch with a glass of wine. If you are going to visit the Nasher be sure to eat here. The food is much better than one expects in a Museum.",
          "I'm a very open-minded person and have been to over a hundred art musums around the world. Although the Nasher has some interesting exhibits, much of the collection is very modern, political, dark, and - frankly- disturbing. In fact, one of the security guards even came up to",
          "A Superior Cultural Find: Who would have thunk it? We were fortuate to visit the Nasher for \"Picasso and the Allure of Language\" Exhibition (20 Aug 2009 thru 3 Jan 2010). Wow! We have been blessed (courtesy Uncle Sam) museums in Rome, Paris, London, Spain, Germany, Thailand,",

          "LOVE this collection. They have some great and significant pieces. And good entry discounts!",
          "Cute gift shop, nice African masks and art, but some paintings of nudity... I like the area where you can write about yourself and display it. Very nice.",
          "nice staff, good art, reasonably priced giftshop, good all around",
          "I had a wonderful time here with my daughter just before she left for college. The space is open and inviting, and the exhibits well staged.",
          "Great art, but it is uppety and not comparable to the Dutch Museums, Rembrandt beats it all",
          "They have a great Cafe. Free admission for military.",
          "Contemporary University museum, interesting well curated exhibitions.",
          "Seems to be a progressive institution within a rather conservative environment.",
          "Smaller than expected but nice!",
          "A gem. This little art museum is very very nice. We attended the Dolci exhibit yesterday. Very nicely laid out - high quality. The cafe was excellent in quality and staff. This is almost a hidden gem in Durham, well worth spending an hour or two at!",
          "All I can say is this Museum is absolutely Gorgeous and it has so much Diversity ..Best Museum in the Raleigh Durham area....Hands down......",

          "Something different and delicious",
          "I love the Nasher!!",
          "This is a very clean, attractive, and well curated museum. I withheld a single star for the size of the collection; I would have liked for there to have been another wing, but it certainly has enough to engage a viewer for a few hours if you take your time and read/inspect the pieces.",
          "Worth a look every once in a while",
          "Pathetic excuse of a museum!  And it belongs to such a prestigious university!  Two rooms of mediocre European paintings (with the exceptions of Bricher and Bruce Crane), and that's that.  Even Sargent was mediocre.  Mayan ceramics were \u2026",
          "Small but fabulous museum.  A must see.",
          "Really awesome artwork of various degrees. Definitely something to return to. I hope they make more interactive sections in the future",
          "They were updating a wing, so it wasn't full.  However, it's worth seeing again.",
          "Great exhibits. The museum's own collection is worth the visit. The features are bonuses. 3.5 - 4 stars",
          "If you're looking to be moved and inspired by great works of Art, go elsewhere.  Think of the incredible technical facility, sense of beauty, and spiritual gravity of, say, Rembrandt.  The contemporary \"art\" on exhibit may seem clever--by \u2026",
          "So many great events happen here that are open to the public and also free! Not to mention it is pretty much across the street from Duke Gardens which is another great location to check out!",

          "Awesome place",
          "I've been to a number of outstanding art exhibits in recent years:  Matisse, Andy Warhol, Miro.  The Miro exhibit was spectacular and an outstanding tribute to the great artist.

        "wiki": "Washington Duke (December 18, 1820 \u2013 May 8, 1905) was an American tobacco industrialist and philanthropist who fought in the American Civil War.\n\n\n== Early Life & Civil War ==\nWashington Duke was born on December 18, 1820 in eastern Orange County, North Carolina, in what is today the township of Bahama.(Now in Durham County.) The eighth of ten children of Taylor Duke (c.1770\u20131830) and Dicey Jones (born c.1780), Washington worked as a tenant farmer until he married Mary Caroline Clinton (1825\u20131847) in 1842.  At the time of their marriage, his father-in-law gave the couple 72 acres of land located in what is today Durham County. It was on this land that he began his career as a subsistence farmer. The couple had two sons: Sidney Taylor Duke (1844\u20131858), and Brodie Leonidas Duke (1846\u20131919). Mary Duke died in 1847 at the age of 22.\nIn 1852, Duke built a homestead for his second wife, Artelia Roney (1829\u20131858), who was from Alamance County, North Carolina. It still exists. Artelia gave birth to three children between 1853 and 1856: daughter, Mary Elizabeth Duke (1853\u20131899), and sons, Benjamin Newton Duke, and James Buchanan Duke (more commonly known as \"Buck\").  In 1858, oldest son Sidney caught typhoid fever and died. Artelia, who had been caring for her stepson Sidney, also succumbed to the illness ten days later.\nVery little is known about Duke's antebellum views on politics. However, a majority of people in the Piedmont region of North Carolina leaned towards the Unionist position. Furthermore, the region's views on the issue of slavery was more of ambivalence, rather than strong feelings in favor or in opposition to slavery, and \"while substantial numbers of white in the piedmont were not directly connected to the institution [of slavery], they nonetheless mostly accepted its presence without thinking.\"  It is known that Duke owned one enslaved person, named Caroline, whom he purchased for $601, and had hired out the labor of an enslaved person from his neighbors to work on his farm.At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Duke was 40 years old, too old for the initial conscription into service for the Confederacy.  However, the second Confederate Conscription Act passed in September 1862 increased the draft-eligible age to 45.  Duke, aware that he would soon be called into military service, held a sale at his home on October 20, 1863, to sell the entirety of his farm equipment.  He enlisted in the Confederate navy, and served in Charleston, SC, and Richmond, VA, until his capture by Union forces in April 1865.  After a brief stint in a Federal prison, he was paroled and was sent by ship to New Bern, NC, and from there, walked 134 miles (216 km) back to his homestead.\n\n\n== Tobacco career ==\n\nAfter the war, Duke abandoned farming in favor of tobacco manufacture.  In 1865, using a converted corn crib as a factory, Duke started his first company, \"W. Duke and Sons,\" and began production of pipe tobacco under the brand name \"Pro Bono Publico\" (\"For the Public Good.\")   According to Duke, he, along with his sons Ben and Buck, produced between 400 and 500 pounds of pipe tobacco per day.  As their company slowly prospered, they built a two-story factory on the homestead in 1869.  In 1874, Washington Duke sold his farm and moved his family into the rapidly growing city of Durham.  He and his sons built a factory on Main Street, and Washington spent the rest of the decade as a traveling salesman for \"Pro Bono Publico.\"\nIn 1880, at the age of 60, Washington Duke sold his share in the business to Richard Harvey Wright, a farmer from nearby Franklin County.  W. Duke & Sons & Co., led by Washington Duke's son Buck as president, eventually achieved great success as a manufacturer of cigarettes. This business became the American Tobacco Company around 1890. Through merging multiple partners and through floating stock, the company became the largest tobacco manufacturer in the world.\nAfter selling his share in the company, Washington Duke became more involved with local politics as a member of the Republican Party, and devoted more time to charitable and philanthropic works.  A lifelong member and supporter of the Methodist church, Duke began to support local churches financially, as well as institutions of higher learning.  Duke helped to bring Trinity College, a Methodist college, to Durham from Randolph County in 1890.   In 1896 while Trinity College was struggling financially, Duke donated $100,000 to the institution on the condition that it \"open its doors to women, placing them on equal footing with men.\"  In appreciation, the school offered to rename itself after Duke, which he declined.\nWashington Duke died on May 8, 1905, at the age of 84.  Originally interred at Maplewood Cemetery in Durham, he was later re-interred in the Memorial Chapel within the Duke University Chapel.  In the 1910s, members of the Duke family began to plan what would become The Duke Endowment of Trinity College.  After the indenture for the $40,000,000 Duke Endowment was signed in December 1924 by Washington's youngest son, James B. Duke, Trinity College renamed itself to Duke University in honor of Washington Duke. Today, a statue of Washington Duke sits on Duke University's East Campus.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDurden, Robert Franklin, \"The Dukes of Durham: 1865\u20131929\", Duke University Press, 1975.

          "We were in Durham to visit the Bennett Place (Civil War surrender site), and happened to see this listed in the AAA book, so we went. The Duke Family Homestead was mildly interesting, but the Tobacco Museum on the same grounds was fascinating, even to us non-smokers. We read",
          "Since most of Durham was built on the Duke family's tobacco money, it's a good idea to remember how it happened and an object lesson in how some good things can come out of really bad ones. Well presented museum in a pretty location which both explains how and why tobacco",
          "The guided tour gives the history of the Duke family and the start of its tobacco empire. On a family farm and in a little tobacco shed, the cigarette kingdom was born in the USA. Learn how the term \"bull pen\" came about, too!",

          "This place was surprising in its content and information. I had a very informative tour with an extremely well educated guide who explained the functions of the place in a clear and pleasant manner. Well worth a trip",
          "We visited mid week and when we arrived we were the only people there. We were invited to view the wonderful museum they have set up and also the available videos. This was a perfect introduction to the tour of the homestead and grounds. The museum provided lots of facts in a",

          "FASCINATING and factual video about Duke and how he, and then his son, changed the life of American via tobacco. We have never smoked; deplore the stuff but finally learned just how marketing turned this terrible leaf into a must-have item. Museum is GREAT, and the old homestead",

          "This place has an extensive tobacco exhibit area including even old cigarette commercials on a TV. Has a history of Durham tobacco and what an impact it had on the tobacco industry. The museum is worth going by itself but there are also the 5-6 out buildings from the Duke",
          "Great day trip for tobacco history buffs! My Mother and her sisters were able to relive their days of growing up on a tobacco farm. There is a museum, short film, gift shop, and the Duke farm that started it all!",

          "If you are interested in history, history in NC (or Durham) or interested in the history and background of Tobacco, this would be a good place to visit. Take time to do the guided tour to get more out of your visit. Aside from the guided tour that takes you to the homestead,",
          "My husband and I visited the Duke homestead and were impressed with the authenticity. Regardless of what we now know about the dangers of smoking the tobacco industry had a huge impact on our nation's economy. Seeing this from the viewpoint of a late 19th century entrepreneur",
          "The homestead is largely a paean to the tobacco industry that made the Dukes wealthy--it's peaceful and pretty, but not much of real interest if one is not particularly interested in tobacco history. We did our own walking tour, but it might have been better to take a guided",
          "OK so my kids were here at Thanksgiving -- I am new to the area. I had seen it all ready and while it's (the museum, not the house) very dated in many ways, it's also amazing in how it documents the rise of the Duke family. They were the JP Morgans of the antebellum (post",

          "This is the Duke family old homestead. Wonderful small museum and self or given tour of tobacco barns and home. School tours and events can be arranged. Christmas here is magical and definitely worth taking the time. All decorated as would have been and so calm and beautiful!",
          "Definitely worth a stop if you're on the hunt for NC Historic Sites or just around in the Raleigh/Durham area. Great museum and the house is magnificent! The picnic area is a good spot to eat some lunch too.",
          "Washington Duke's sons founded the worlds largest tobacco company, American Tobacco Company. This made NC the center of the international tobacco empire. Duke University was named after the Duke's. My favorite thing in the museum was a cigarette dispenser that had 2 gum ball",
          "They have a large museum here that was very enjoyable. There is also a movie that should not be missed. After that there is a tour of the outbuildings. Unfortunately, our guide could not answer any of our questions.",
          "Has a museum about tobacco, its history, growing, producing products. Nothing about the damage it does. While tobacco is bad it did lead to the development of the area and is a part of its history. The buildings on the grounds were interesting and as a photographer I liked",
          "With the area's tobacco history this is a important stop for anyone trying to get to know the area. The museum is interactive and good for all ages. Admission is free.",
          "Museum on the grounds gives history of the homestead and the Duke family as well as lots of displays and original machinery used in processing tobacco. There is also a 15 minute movie that gives info about the area and the start of the Duke empire and the impact of tobacco on",
          "My family recently visited the Duke Homestead located a little north of Durham, NC. They offer a rather extensive museum on everything tobacco-related, a 15-minute film and a guided tour of the buildings and grounds. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable. She made the history",
          "Some visiting relatives and myself went to the Duke Homestead, as they had seen many of the other attractions in the area before. We thought it would be like an hour and go, but we were pleasantly surprised and stayed longer. There's a fixed exhibit on tobacco growing and the",
          "The museum and tour highlight a critical part of the area's history. Seeing the manufacturing machines in the museum was interesting along with the old TV ads for cigarettes. The tour shows how the Dukes started with pipe tobacco and moved up from there. The grounds and",
          "Well organised and with nice displays you learn a lot about Durham and the environment and life as it used to be at the beginning of the last century.",
          "The displays were very good. Having been rather knowledge challenged on the subject of tobacco growing and harvesting, I learned a lot. The video was very interesting. It's always nice to see an 1850's home and the furnishings. Our guide took us to the tobacco factory on the",
          "we had a group of 10 and varied ages. You can really learn a great deal about the growing, processing and selling of tobacco. The Homestead itself is interesting to see but if you only have time to tour the Museum, then it is worth the visit. It is free but donations are",
          "Worth the trip. Extremely interesting. Some very nostalgia items jogging my memory when I was a kid. The good thing, it not cheesy. Full of information on how the tobacco industry got started and boomed here in Durham.",
          "I never smoked, but thought I'd check out the Duke Homestead anyway. I found it quite interesting. The original home of Washington Duke was pretty humble. It's amazing how the family ended up so wealthy...and how the company thought tobacco might be healthy for you. HA!",
          "Quite interesting, not sure why is not high up on the attraction list. Easy to get to via GPS, plenty of parking space and free admission. A 45 minute guided tour which gives you the North Carolina tobacco history, demonstration, and the tour of the farm, factory, and warehouse",
          "Take a guided tour of the grounds and hear how Washington Duke made good switching from tobacco farmer to processor. This is where the Duke family fortune was made and increased exponentially by his son Buck. Our docent was knowledgeable and gave a great tour.",
          "This was a very interesting history lesson. The Duke's were master marketers and visionaries in how to create a monopoly to make millions. The museum has a lot of old items on display, including TV ads banned for over 40 years. The tour guides could do a little more studying",
          "Duke Homestead shows the visitor how tobacco was grown, processed and made ready for market (not an easy process). It is well maintained and a nicely done museum. Worth a visit.",
          "From small farm *which it was, the original Duke family farm* to giant monopoly (busted up by Teddy Roosevelt about 100 years ago) to a slow decline, but its recycled buildings are vital parts of Durham today. Excellent history and interpretation about tobacco farming.",
          "The museum and orientation film in the visitor centre are both very interesting. We enjoyed walking around the homestead and out buildings and had a picnic lunch in the gardens.",
          "It may be a tough sell in this PC world, but the Duke Tobacco museum is an excellent interactive experience that exploits the tremendously successful tobacco industry in North Carolina with an understandable slant toward the Duke family and its incredibly popular BULL DURHAM",

          "I knew nothing about tobacco processing and industry, especially at this time period. Not being from the area, I also didn't realize the contribution of the Duke family to Durham. The tour was only about 45 minutes long and consisted of viewing the outdoor buildings where",
          "The Duke Homestead is very close to our son's apartment so we dropped by for a very quick visit. We learned a lot about the tobacco industry in Durham. Walking on the beautiful grounds of the Duke Homestead felt like we had time-traveled to the mid-19th century. Lovely.",

Arrowheads left behind by the tribe can still be found today.\nWhen white settlers came to the area they noticed the springs that contained freshwater, which motivated them to invest in building mills across the area. The first mill built in the Eno was named Synott's Mill, which started operating in 1752 by Michael Synott, an almost legendary pioneer, who had problems in his personal life and appeared in court often. Shortly after Michael Synott died in 1780 the area was purchased by William Thetford and Charles Abercrombie, who built West Point Mill. While these mills were being produced a community began to build up and became known as West Point. The community was successful for a period of time but eventually all of its inhabitants died out or moved on. West Point Mill served its owners for 160 years until it was shut down by a paratrooper named Jacob Eller returning from the war in 1942, the last mill on the Eno to do so.It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWest Point on the Eno - City of Durham\nWest Point on the Eno - Eno River Association",

        "wiki": "The American Tobacco Company was a tobacco company founded in 1890 by J. B. Duke through a merger between a number of U.S. tobacco manufacturers including Allen and Ginter and Goodwin & Company. The company was one of the original 12 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896. The American Tobacco Company dominated the industry by acquiring the Lucky Strike Company and over 200 other rival firms. Antitrust action begun in 1907 broke the company into several major companies in 1911.The American Tobacco Company restructured itself in 1969, forming a holding company called American Brands, Inc., which operated American Tobacco as a subsidiary. American Brands acquired a variety of non-tobacco businesses during the 1970s and 1980s and sold its tobacco operations to Brown & Williamson in 1994. American Brands subsequently renamed itself \"Fortune Brands\".\n\n\n== History of the American Tobacco Company ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nJames Buchanan Duke's entrance into the cigarette industry came about in 1879 when he elected to enter a new business rather than face competition in the shredded pouched smoking tobacco business against the Bull Durham brand, also from Durham, North Carolina.\n\nIn 1881, two years after W. Duke, Sons & Company entered into the cigarette business, James Bonsack invented a cigarette-rolling machine. It produced over 200 cigarettes per minute, the equivalent of what a skilled hand roller could produce in one hour, and reduced the cost of rolling cigarettes by 50%. It cut each cigarette with precision, creating uniformity in the cigarettes it rolled. Public stigma was attached to this machine-rolled uniformity, and Allen & Ginter rejected the machine almost immediately.Duke set a deal with the Bonsack Machine Company in 1884. Duke agreed to produce all cigarettes with his two rented Bonsack machines and in return, Bonsack reduced Duke\u2019s royalties from $0.30 per thousand to $0.20 per thousand. Duke also hired one of Bonsack\u2019s mechanics, resulting in fewer breakdowns of his machines than his competitors\u2019. This secret contract resulted in a competitive advantage over Duke's competitors; he was able to lower his prices further than others could.\nIn the 1880s, while Duke was beginning to machine-roll all his cigarettes, he saw that growth rates in the cigarette industry were declining. His solution was to combine companies and found \u201cone of the first great holding companies in American history.\u201d Duke spent $800,000 on advertising in 1889 and lowered his prices, accepting net profits of less than $400,000, forcing his major competitors to lower their prices and, in 1890, join his consortium by the name of the American Tobacco Company.  The five constituent companies of American Tobacco: W. Duke & Sons, Allen & Ginter, W.S. Kimball & Company, Kinney Tobacco, and Goodwin & Company \u2013 produced 90% of the cigarettes made in 1890, the first year the American Tobacco Company was listed on the NYSE. Within two decades of its founding, the American Tobacco company absorbed about 250 companies and produced 80% of the cigarettes, plug tobacco, smoking tobacco, and snuff produced in the United States. With Duke's market control, American Tobacco grew its equity from $25,000,000 to $316,000,000.\n\n\n=== The \"Tobacco Trust\" ===\n\nAmerican Tobacco Company quickly became known as the \u201cTobacco Trust\u201d upon its founding. Duke controlled the cigarette market, and his trust caught the attention of legislators in the United States, a country with historical aversion to monopolies.American Tobacco Company focused solely on making and selling cigarettes, leaving growing of tobacco and retail distribution to independent entrepreneurs. Nonetheless, Duke aimed to eliminate inefficiencies and middlemen through vertical consolidation. The American Tobacco Company began to expand to Great Britain, China, and Japan. The company also maintained an interest in producing other tobacco products in case fads shifted; Duke wanted to be sure that he would be prepared with a multitude of tobacco styles. The Tobacco Trust's international expansion in conjunction with its consolidation of all types of tobacco \u201cultimately made the Trust so vulnerable to regulation and judicial dissolution\u201d.The Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in 1890, and in 1907, the American Tobacco Company was indicted in violation of it. In 1908, when the Department of Justice filed suit against the company, 65 companies and 29 individuals were named in the suit. The Supreme Court ordered the company to dissolve in 1911 on the same day that it ordered the Standard Oil Trust to dissolve. The ruling in United States v. American Tobacco Co. stated that the combination of the tobacco companies \u201cin and of itself, as well as each and all of the elements composing it whether corporate or individual, whether considered collectively or separately [was] in restraint of trade and an attempt to monopolize, and a monopolization within the first and second sections of the Anti-Trust Act.\u201d\n\n\n=== Dissolution ===\nDissolution proved complicated. The American Tobacco Company had combined many prior companies and processes. One department would manage a certain process for the entire organization, producing brands previously owned by other companies. \u201cPlants had been assigned specific products without regard for previous ownership.\u201d Over the course of eight months, a plan for the dissolution, meant to assure competition among the new companies, was negotiated.The trust needed to dissolve in such a way that no manufacturer had a monopoly on any type of tobacco product. Investors, holding millions of dollars of securities, also needed to be considered.  A large question was how to distribute trademarks and brands between the resulting companies.The American Tobacco Company's assets were split off into: American Tobacco Company, the existing R. J. Reynolds, Liggett & Myers, and Lorillard. The monopoly became an oligopoly. The main result of the dissolution of American Tobacco Trust and the creation of these companies was an increase in advertising and promotion in the industry as a form of competition.\n\n\n==== Liggett & Myers ====\nLiggett & Myers kept control of these plants: Liggett and Myers, St. Louis; Spaulding and Merrick, Chicago; Allen and Ginter, Richmond; smoking tobacco factory in Chicago; Nall and Williams, Louisville; John Bollman Company, San Francisco; Pinkerton Company, Toledo; W. R. Irby, New Orleans; two cigar factories in Baltimore and Philadelphia, and the Duke-Durham branch of the American Tobacco Company.\n\n\n==== P. Lorillard ====\nP. Lorillard retained the Lorillard properties in addition to S. Anargyos; the Luhrman and Wilburn Tobacco Company; plants in Philadelphia, Wilmington, Brooklyn, Baltimore, and Danville; and the Federal Cigar Company.\n\n\n== More recent history ==\n\nAt the same time as the antitrust action in 1911, the company's share in British American Tobacco (BAT) was sold. In 1994, BAT acquired its former parent, American Tobacco Company (though reorganized after antitrust proceedings). This brought the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall brands into BAT's portfolio as part of BAT's American arm, Brown & Williamson. B&W later merged with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 2004.\nAmerican Tobacco left Durham in the late 1980s. Brown & Williamson took over the Reidsville, North Carolina operation in 1995 and closed it, costing 1000 people their jobs, but Commonwealth Brands took it over in a deal completed in October 1996, when the plant had 311 employees, and kept 100 of them. ITG Brands announced November 1, 2018 that the plant would close in 2020.\n\n\n=== Redevelopment ===\nIn 2004, the previously abandoned American Tobacco Campus (ATC) in Durham was reopened as a complex of offices, shops, and restaurants. Developed by Capitol Broadcasting and reopened as the American Tobacco Historic District, phase 1 consisted of the Fowler, Crowe, Strickland, Reed, and Washington Buildings, and included the construction of two new parking garages and a waterfall feature through the center of the campus designed by Smallwood, Reynolds, Stewart, Stewart of Atlanta, Georgia and constructed by W. P. Law, Inc. based in Lexington, South Carolina. Phase 2, consisting of the remaining buildings and expansion of the water feature at the north end of the site, was under construction as of late 2006.  Many office spaces in the ATC are now used by Duke University.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 as the American Tobacco Company Manufacturing Plant. The nearby Watts and Yuille Warehouses were listed in 1984 and the Smith Warehouse in 1985.The American Tobacco Trail, named for the company, is a multi-use rail-trail that begins just south of the Durham complex and runs 22 miles (35 km) towards Chatham and Wake Counties. It follows the route of the railroad (Norfolk Southern Railway (former) Durham Branch) that once served the factories, but was later abandoned when these facilities were shut down.\n\n\n== Advertising ==\n\nBetween 1875 and the 1940s, cigarette companies often included collectible trading cards with their packages of cigarettes. Cigarette card sets document popular culture from the turn of the century, often depicting the period's actresses, costumes, and sports, as well as offering insights into mainstream humor and cultural norms.In the golden age of radio, as well as early television, American Tobacco was known for advertisements featuring a fast-talking tobacco auctioneer named L. A. \"Speed\" Riggs. His rapid-fire and song-like patter would always end with the exclamation, \"SOLD, American!\" Another famous tobacco auctioneer, F. E. Boone, was often heard in tandem with Riggs.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Companies portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSobel, Robert (1974). \"James Buchanan Duke: Opportunism Is the Spur\".

          "We walked the area and although ti seemed nice it clearly is an office area that is probably busy on weekdays. Not much to do there and I'm not sure what I'd do there during the week unless I had business in the area. If I did I'm sure it would be very nice. The campus looks",

          "I both love this area and am slightly disappointed, as I think they could have done a lot more to share the history of the tobacco trade in Durham here. However, without a doubt this area has been revitalized by the city, next to the Bull's ballpark. There is a river flowing",
          "I've only been to this area about four times over five years but have always looked forward to going back. A friend and I were going to a show at the Duke Campus so I decided to take her there as she had never been. We walked around the entire area to see what was there but was",
          "This is a wonderful area in Durham. The Tobacco Tower is beautiful when it is lit up at night. There are restaurants, fire pits, water falls and more. It is also all in walking distance from the DPAC, the Durham Bulls Stadium and downtown. Its great even to just go out and sit",
          "I'm from Charlotte, and came for a Bulls game. I wish My city preserved some historical artifacts as wells as Durham Tabacco district!!! Very cool to see the iron works and the water works make such a cool landscape and social hangout spot! Glad we stopped in",

          "I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m missing here. Sure it is kind of cool to look at the old factory, but I didn\u2019t see anything to do beyond a couple of restaurants and I didn\u2019t see any shops. Most of the area is private offices or companies. I had expected a vibrant shopping, eating,",

        "wiki": "Duke University Chapel is a chapel located at the center of the campus of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, United States. It is an ecumenical Christian chapel and the center of religion at Duke, and has connections to the United Methodist Church. Constructed from 1930 to 1932, the Chapel seats about 1,800 people and stands 210 feet (64 m) tall, making it one of the tallest buildings in Durham County.  It  is built in the Collegiate Gothic style, characterized by its large stones, pointed arches, and ribbed vaults. It has a 50-bell carillon and three pipe organs, one with 5,033 pipes and another with 6,900 pipes.The Chapel stands at the center of the university, on the highest ridge of Duke University's West Campus.  Although plans for a chapel were first made in April 1925, the cornerstone was not laid until October 22, 1930. When it was completed in 1935 at a cost of $2.3 million, the Chapel was the last of the original buildings to be built on West Campus. It was first used during Commencement in 1932, and was formally dedicated on June 2, 1935. Stained-glass windows and other details were installed at a later date.  The chapel was designed by Julian Abele, a noted African-American architect who designed much of Duke's west campus and who was also chief designer for the Philadelphia firm of Horace Trumbauer.As of 2015, the dean of the Chapel is the Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery. On May 11, 2015 the Chapel closed for a year due to necessary restoration work on the ceiling. The Chapel reopened May 11, 2016.\n\n\n== Exterior ==\n\n\n=== Entrance portal ===\nCarved on the ornate entrance to the Chapel are ten figures important to Methodism, Protestantism, and the American South. On the outer arch above the portal are carved three figures pivotal to the American Methodist movement: Bishop Francis Asbury stands in the center, while Bishop Thomas Coke and George Whitefield stand on the left and right, respectively. On the left wall within the entrance portal are carved (from left to right) Girolamo Savonarola, Martin Luther, and John Wycliffe. On the right wall (from left to right) are Thomas Jefferson, statesman of the South; Robert E. Lee, soldier of the South; and Sidney Lanier, poet of the South. John Wesley, founder of Methodism, stands atop the inner arch within the portal, directly above the Chapel doors.\nOn Lee's carving, the Italian sculptors inscribed 'US' on the belt buckle; it was partially chiseled away (since Lee was a Confederate general) but is still visible.\nThe university removed the statue of Lee from the entrance after it was vandalized in August 2017.\n\n\n=== Bell tower ===\nThe bell tower of Duke Chapel is modeled after the Bell Harry Tower of Canterbury Cathedral. It is 210 feet (64 m) tall and 38 feet (12 m) square at its base. Like the rest of the edifice, its main body is constructed of stone from the Duke Quarry near Hillsborough, North Carolina, while its upper trimmings are of limestone from Bedford, Indiana. Housed in the tower is a 50-bell carillon, a gift from The Duke Endowment. The heaviest bell, G-natural, weighs 11,200 pounds, and the lightest weighs 10.5 pounds.\nA service elevator and a winding staircase of 239 steps provide access to the top.  The bell tower is not open to the public, and restricted for Duke University students to special times during Orientation and Graduation.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nDuke Chapel, like many Christian churches and cathedrals, is cruciform, with a nave that measures 291 feet (89 m) long, 63 feet (19 m) wide, and 73 feet (22 m) high. The walls and vaults of the nave and transepts are constructed from Guastavino tile and were sealed in 1976 to increase sound reverberation and enhance the sound of the organ. The Chapel also houses a Memorial Chapel and a crypt.\n\n\n=== Stained-glass windows ===\nThe 77 Chapel windows were designed and constructed over a three-year period by 15 artists and craftsmen, including S. Charles Jaekle of G. Owen Bonawit, Inc. They are constructed from over one million pieces of glass, imported from England, France, and Belgium and varying in thickness between 1/8 and 3/16 inch. The largest window measures 17.5 by 38 feet (12 m), and the smallest measures just 14 by 20 inches (510 mm).\nThe windows depict scenes and characters from the Bible; of the 800 or 900 figures represented in the windows, 301 are larger than life-size. The large, upper clerestory windows along the nave and chancel depict scenes from the Old Testament, while the smaller medallion windows along the walls of the nave aisles represent scenes from the New Testament. Both Old and New Testament images are present in the two large transept windows as well as the altar window. The windows of the narthex depict women of the Old Testament, and the small windows of the two small entrance halls on either side of the narthex contain six scenes from the life of Jesus painted in black on amber glass. The windows of the Memorial Chapel are made from silver-tinted grisaille glass, and those in the crypt are of purple glass framed in lead grilles.\n\n\n=== Chancel ===\nDuke Chapel's chancel contains the altar, the choir stalls, the pulpit, and the lectern. Patriarchs, apostles, saints, and other religious figures carved in limewood and oak appear in the niches of the choir stalls and in the decorative screen behind the altar. Scenes from the Passion are carved into the north and south walls of the chancel.\n\n\n=== Organs ===\nDuke Chapel houses three large pipe organs, each constructed in a different style, which are used for religious services, ceremonies, recitals, and the study of organ performance. Additionally, a portable \"box\" organ belongs to the Chapel and accompanies small groups and organizations.\nThe Kathleen McClendon Organ is Duke Chapel's original organ and is lodged behind ornate oak screens in two chambers on either side of the chancel and in front of both transepts. Built in 1932, it was the last major instrument made by the Aeolian Organ Company before the company merged to form the Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company. 6,900 pipes, controlled by four manual keyboards and a pedal keyboard, provide a wide range of dynamic expression and orchestral voicing for the organ's individual stops. The organ was fully restored by Foley-Baker Inc. of Tolland, Connecticut, in 2009. Broome & Company of Connecticut restored the existing reed stops and added a new unenclosed Festival Trumpet.\nThe Benjamin N. Duke Memorial Organ, dedicated in 1976, was built by the Dutch Flentrop Company in the 18th century styles of Dutch and French organs. Housed in the arch between the narthex and the nave, it contains 5,033 pipes controlled by four keyboards and a pedal keyboard. The organ's main case, in which most of the pipes are housed, is built of solid mahogany and decorated with various colors and gold leaf. 40 feet (12 m) tall and 4.5 feet (1.4 m) deep, the main case is situated on a solid oak balcony overlooking the nave.\nThe Brombaugh Organ, installed in 1997 in a \"swallow's nest\" gallery of the Memorial Chapel, was the last organ to be added to the Chapel. It is a two manual and pedal organ of 960 pipes, modeled in the style of Renaissance Italian instruments. It produces a gentle, sparkling tone with very low wind pressure, and like instruments of the 16th and 17th centuries, it is tuned in meantone temperament. The Duke family crest can be seen at the top of the organ case.\n\n\n== Memorial Chapel ==\nA Memorial Chapel was later added to the left of the chapel by the Duke Memorial Association. Intended as a place for reflection and prayer, the Memorial Chapel is open to visitors, and is separated from the rest of the Chapel by large iron gates. Along the left wall, the University's benefactors\u2014Washington Duke and his two sons, James B. Duke and Benjamin N. Duke\u2014are entombed in three 30-ton, white Carrara marble sarcophagi carved by Charles Keck. Over the altar are three limewood figures: Jesus stands in the center, with St. Paul on the left and St. Peter on the right. A boss with the Duke family coat of arms graces the ceiling.\n\n\n=== Crypt ===\nSeveral important people of Duke University are interred in the crypt directly beneath the Memorial Chapel, including three Presidents of the University: William Preston Few (1924\u20131940), Julian Deryl Hart (1960\u20131963) with his wife Mary Johnson Hart, and Terry Sanford (1969\u20131985) with his wife Margaret Rose Sanford. The wife of James B. Duke, Nanaline Holt Duke, is also buried in the crypt, as are James A. Thomas, Chairman of the Duke Memorial Association, and James T. Cleland, former Dean of Duke Chapel, with his wife Alice Mead Cleland.\nTwo plaques on the walls of the crypt commemorate University Presidents Arthur Hollis Edens (1949\u20131960) and Robert Lee Flowers (1941\u20131948).\n\n\n== Relative size ==\nAt 210 feet, the Duke University Chapel is one of the tallest university chapels in the world. The Chapel of Princeton University (121 feet), the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at Notre Dame (218 feet), and the King's College Chapel, Cambridge at University of Cambridge (289 feet) hold comparable sizes, according to Princeton University.\n\n\n== Robert E. Lee statue vandalization and removal ==\nOn August 16 and 17, 2017, in the wake of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia and subsequent calls for the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials across the United States, the 85-year-old statue of Robert E. Lee in the Chapel's entrance portal was defaced: the statue\u2019s face was damaged, and its nose chipped off. Research showed that \"an unnamed Vanderbilt University professor\" worked with John Donnelly, who designed the chapel's ornamental stonework, to install the statue in the first half of the 1930s, but that \"[t]he documents do not fully explain how the statue came to be included in the Chapel.\" A week after the events in Charlottesville, Duke University President Vincent Price approved the removal of the statue. Announcing the removal in an August 19 email to students, staff, faculty and alumni, Prince promised to preserve the statue \"so that students can study Duke's complex past and take part in a more inclusive future.\" As of August 7, 2019 the space occupied by Robert E. Lee has yet to be filled with a new statue.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCollegiate Gothic\nGothic revival architecture\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDuke Chapel Website",

          "Was there Saturday night they did a wonderful job in their concert they are just a group of beautiful people. On a second note the sound system that Duke Chapel used is horrible I really wish they would invest in a better one. The song that they did acapella without using the mics was wonderful.",
          "Always beautiful, rain or shine, night or day. :)",
          "Chapel is a bit of an understatement. It's basically a Gothic cathedral and it's gorgeous. Played a gig there recently and was happy every time I had a moment to look around. If you like visiting cathedrals in Europe, you'll prob enjoy this.",
          "The Chapel is absolutely gorgeous! Oscar made it a wonderful experience. His knowledge and 22 years of service for Duke University Chapel shows in the way he speaks about not only the chapel but the Duke family as well. He made us feel like family encouraging us to come back.",

          "The architecture is truly beautiful. Walking into the chapel brings a sense of calm. Duke's campus makes you feel like you are in England - the stone, the crenenlation on the buildings, the flying buttresses of the chapel and the quads of the dorms. Definitely worth stopping in to see",

          "Like the university campus, Duke Chapel is pretentious. It is amusing how the chapel and the campus pretend to be old. The chapel is nice enough, I guess, for North Carolina. But if you have seen any of the cathedrals outside North America, you won't be too impressed. Even a small cathedral in Ecuador beats this.",

          "Surprisingly less than 100 years old. A beautiful homage to the grand European cathedrals.  Stain glass windows are. The highlight. Ornate woodworking done at a high skill level.   A grand building but it does feel like a little too much of a copy of Europe. How much more stunning it would be with more 1930 touches, like art deco.",
          "We stopped in quickly on a hot day to cool off and enjoy the gothic architecture. It's a beautiful space and the organs are quite lovely. Since no services were happening on this random Friday, we were able to wander around the space as wished.Definitely a lovely spot to visit if you're in the area.",

        "wiki": "The Duke Lemur Center is an 85-acre (34 ha) sanctuary for rare and endangered strepsirrhine primates, located at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. It is the largest sanctuary for strepsirrhine primates in the world.The center is open to the public through tours, for which visitors must make an appointment.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1966, a prosimian colony of approximately 90 individuals, belonging to John Buettner-Janusch, was relocated from the Center for Prosimian Biology at Yale University to Duke University, creating the Duke Lemur Center (DLC). Through the 1970s, the colony grew to approximately 700 individuals representing 33 species. The current colony ranges between 250 and 300 animals, representing approximately 25 species.  Originally called the Duke University Primate Center (DUPC), the center's name was changed in April 2006 after a refocusing of the scientific goals and overall mission. Specimens from its scientific collection may thus be assigned the code DPC.The mission of the Duke University Lemur Center is to \"promote research and understanding of prosimians and their natural habitat as a means of advancing the frontiers of knowledge, to contribute to the educational development of future leaders in international scholarship and conservation and to enhance the human condition by stimulating intellectual growth and sustaining global biodiversity.\"According to Duke University, the Lemur Center, the only university-based facility in the world devoted to the study of strepsirrhine primates, \"is home to the world's largest colony of endangered primates \u2013 including more than 200 lemurs, bush babies and lorises.... More than 85 percent of the center's inhabitants were born on site.\"In 1997, the center began a program to reintroduce black-and-white ruffed lemurs into the 5,500-acre (2,200 ha) Betampona Natural Reserve in Madagascar, the first return of any prosimian primates to the island nation.In 2009 and 2010, the center completed two new buildings for housing lemurs. The first building was completed in 2009 and is a 14,922-square-foot (1,386.3 m2) facility (including exterior animal runs) with 7,056 square feet (655.5 m2) of interior space. It can house up to 60 animals that can be released into the 69-acre (28 ha) Duke Forest if weather permits. The second building was completed in 2010 and is a 20,637-square-foot (1,917.2 m2) facility (including exterior animal runs) with 9,883 square feet (918.2 m2) of  interior space. Together, they are able to house 140 lemurs. The buildings are designed with animal housing wings radiating from a central core which houses common resources like laboratories, exam rooms, food prep, bathrooms, and storage spaces. Both buildings are designed for low water and electricity use, and are LEED registered. The total cost of the two-buildings, designed by architects Lord, Aeck & Sargent of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was $10.4 million.In 2013, a lemur briefly escaped from its habitat at the center.  It was returned unharmed after five hours in Durham.\n\n\n== Zoboomafoo ==\n\nThe children's television show Zoboomafoo, produced by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), was filmed at the Duke Lemur Center. In order to film the show, a custom-made animal sound stage was constructed on the Duke University campus. One of the show's hosts Martin Kratt, holds a degree in Zoology from Duke University.On November 10, 2014, Jovian, the Coquerel's sifaka best known for mainly portraying Zoboomafoo in the series of the same name, died of renal failure in his home at the Duke Lemur Center at the age of 20.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nDuke University\nNature: The Loneliest Animals (Chapter 4): Lemur survival in captivity at the Duke Lemur Center",

          "I've lived in this area for 20 years and had never hear of the lemur center until about a year ago. What a great place! You do need reservations ahead of time to go, so be sure and call a few weeks in advance if you can. This was a tour of the Duke Lemur Center which is a",
          "This place was a great balance to the historical sites and museums that we saw in the Triangle area. First we learned about Madagascar (had known virtually nothing than location): size of island, varying climate zones ,and the people. Then we learned the many kinds of lemurs and",
          "We took a private tour of the grounds seeing more kinds of lemurs than we knew existed. Our guide told us many fascinating facts about the different lemurs. We got to see up close all of the lemurs, learning about their personalities. While we were extremely close, no",
          "Lemurs are the most endangered mammals, due in large part to the loss of habitat in Madagascar, with around 90% of the rainforest already having been destroyed. This facility is dedicated to the preservation and breeding of these wonderful animals, many of whom stand in very",
          "A great experience to learn more about these fun animals. The tour is very informative and you can be close to the lemurs.",
          "The Lemur center does good work. They do a good job education you about lemurs and their challenges in the wild. The tour is limited. We were only able to see 2 small areas with enclosures. We were not allowed to see any lemurs in their free range areas. In mi-October, all of",
          "I have always loved lemurs ( I'd always watch the show on BPS Zoboomafoo). But my favorite is the ring-tailed. So I was excited when I found this place! The staff were very knowledgeable about lemurs and about the specific lemurs they had at their center. It was so cool learning",

          "First visit to the Duke Lemur Center. While waiting for the tour to start, overheard our tour guide talking about wanting to rush the group thru the tour to another employee. This set me off from the get go. Our tour guide was named Lisa. The tour started with information,",

          "We were told we had to make a reservation ahead of time, so we reserved a tour time a few weeks ahead. The tour started with a cute 5 min. movie. Then our guide took us to see several kinds of lemurs housed on the grounds. The lemurs have different colors & different",
          "Went in a private tour with our family. It was amazing. The tour guide was very nice and extremely knowledgeable. She clearly knows every lemur and cares about them. We learned a ton. What more can I say, the lemurs were very cute and entertaining. One note, if you go in the",
          "Our whole Durham trip centered on going to the Lemur center. The staff and center did not disappoint. We got to see a few of the 240 lemurs on site. Gift shop prices are reasonable. Their adopt a Lemur program is a great gift idea for that person who has everything.",
          "This can be great fun for the family - Lemurs are very unusual and suggest you call the Center to assure they are available for viewing. If so, have a great time!",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the center and had an excellent tour guide, who was very patient with the kids and their questions. However, my first impression came from the receptionist when we went in to pay. We were a party of 8, so we paid separately. Not a big",
          "This is a great place to visit, since it helos donaye to perseving the lemur speices all over Madagascar. It is pricey, so if you go, make sure you want to! The kids trips will definitely be better for smaller kids, since the normal trip explanations will fly over their heads.",
          "We visited here with family, including a niece who had worked here as a volunteer last summer. The facility is nicely kept and the guides are enthusiastic and knowledgeable about these unusual creatures. It's mostly outside, so not a good place on a scorching day, FYI.",
          "The center is interesting and we find commendable the work they are doing for the Lemurs. The facilities are clean and the Lemurs are healthy. The guides answered our questions and were very polite. However, we found the walking (more of a standing) tour overpriced (more $100/",
          "We happened to be visiting the area, and decided to check out the lemur center. In reviewing the options, we decided upon the costly walking with lemurs tour. We pre-booked the tour and came to the center a bit before the tour started. There is a small shop with Lemur shirts",
          "Visited the Lemur Center and the grandkids 2-9 were just thrilled to see them in an urban environment. While they were resting for the most part , they exhibited some curiousity and came out for a brief time. I will go back at a time when it isn't so hot and maybe they will be",
          "For my birthday, my wife adopted a lemur for me. After doing some research, we discovered they offered tours. We took the walking tour, and our Guide, Mel, was a total professional. She encouraged questions, and was very knowledgeable and informative, as was everyone else",
          "This is the best lemur facility because it is the only facility of its kind. Their mission appears to be to preserve this species forever in captivity as their habitat is being destroyed and likely will never be restored. There is no plan to attempt to breed these animals to",
          "Really enjoyed my visit here. It\u2019s pretty much a guided tour of a zoo full of lemurs. The guides provide a lot of information. You are able to get really close to the lemurs although they are in cages. You unfortunately can\u2019t hold them.",
          "A nice facility, the tour was very interesting and you learned quite a lot about the Lemurs. They had some caged areas to see a few of the various Lemur species, but it was difficult to get many good views. The cost was high for what you got to see. They had a small gift shop,",
          "I visited the DUKE LEMUR CENTER with a friend that was my roommate on a month\u2019s cruise from Cape Town to Singapore across the Indian Ocean. We hit a typhoon at sea and were unable to dock in MADAGASCAR, thus cancelling the opportunity to see the lemurs. Thanks to this amazing",
          "The walking tour was great! We saw a a lot of different lemurs. Our tour guide Faye was awesome! We got to see some of the lemurs eat breakfast. I liked how 50% of the money they made was from the tour. You got to learn and see how the lemurs live and play.",
          "Lemurs are an endangered species, and the Duke Lemur Center is the only place keeping then from becoming extinct. Their natural habitat is Madagascar, and the destruction of their forests there is creating a dire situation for their survival. This tour was a great way to spend",
          "Duke Lemur Center is a tourist attraction, but also a research institution. A lemur may define the cuteness of an animal, however, human is literally bringing lemur close to extinction... Conservation biology and ecology are the new kids in the block as to traditional biology,",
          "The lemurs are so cute - and the lemur center is not like a typical zoo - you get a tour from a scientist that studies the lemurs and knows their behavior. It's worth a stop if you can get tickets.",
          "it was an educational visit to see the animals, the only place to see lemur's in nature. learned a lot and looking to another visit soon",
          "This is a great place to see what a lemur is and how they live. The center is trying to preserve these cute animals. An hour should be more than enough time to visit",
          "They have a great collection of very endangered species. All kinds of lemurs as well as other primates. It'sa great way to spend a day with the family. Be sure to make reservations",
          "I've always been intrigued by lemurs, parodied in the cartoon movies Madagascar 1 and 2, but had not had the opportunity to see them up close until a recent visit to the Duke Lemur Center. The guides provided a wonderful interpretive tour, and a lot of information on how they",
          "The Lemurs Live tour provides a great overview of the lemurs in residence, the local research efforts, and the Center\u2019s conservation efforts in Madagascar. The tour guide was friendly and provided great information on all the lemurs. We had the opportunity to see a few lemurs",
          "If you're really a big lemur enthusiast, then this is for you. But if you just want to actually interact with the cute little creatures and take pictures, then you may be disappointed. Most of the tour is talking. By tge time you get to the cages, they are behind a glass",

          "Our guide was very well informed and good at engaging all members of the group. Kids and adults of all ages will find this interesting and fun. Because it was pretty cool out, some of the lemurs weren't outside when we went, but we still got to see quite a few. Definitely worth",

          "The tour itself is comprehensive and interesting. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable about the some 200 plus lemur inhabitants. On its 80 acres, there are several outdoor enclosures that an be visited during the warmer months for the premium price of $95. The rest of the",
          "I went with a group to visit the Lemur Center. There were lots of Lemurs in the outside cage area, so we got to see a good number of the different varieties of lemurs. Didn't know there were so many different kinds. This is a good outing for both older children and adults.",
          "My family and I enjoyed the \"Behind the Scenes\" Tour at the Duke Lemur Center. We were able to get close to the lemurs, who were in their cages, because of the chilly weather, and not outside in the forest. Our two guides were very knowledgeable, and even fed some of the lemurs",
          "After years of waiting, I finally got to see the lemurs. Totally worth the wait! The tour starts with a short informative video, then a walk to see some of the lemurs in their outdoor homes. It's a little tough to get a picture of them in the enclosures, but their cuteness is",
          "We enjoyed the Walking with Lemurs tour this fall. You walk through the Lemur portion of Duke Forest with a guide and get to see a few lemurs at feeding time. This insures an up close and personal experience with these darling and funny animals. Tammy, our guide was very",
          "You must come here- the lemur variety is amazing. Tour is complete and knowledgeable tour guide. We even get to see the nocturnal lemurs (you go inside and they put on red lights so you can see them in the dark). The lemurs are so energetic and cute. Gift shop has great",
          "The Lemur Center is visitor friendly and very educational. I can't believe that I had lived in Durham for years before visiting. It is a real treat for young and old alike.",
          "We LOVED our tour of the lemur center! Our tour guide, Alivia, was absolutely wonderful. She seemed to know everything there was to know about lemurs and the center. We learned so much about these animals, like the fact that they have to come from Madagascar to be classified as",
          "It was so cool to be next to lemurs with no cages in between you. I got great photos of the mongoose lemurs and the rind tails! The caged exhibits were also fantastic! This the only place in the world to see that many lemurs ( I saw 9 different species but they have over 16",
          "The Lemur Center is great. Everyone was very knowledgeable and friendly, and they are doing some very interesting research as well as conservation projects here. I took the Walking with Lemurs tour, where our group got to accompany staff members to the free-ranging lemurs' daily",
          "You can get a guided tour, which is the best way to learn all the fascinating details about lemurs and their lives. This place has some very rare individuals in captivity, and it is working diligently to prevent extinction. Some of these animals are nocturnal, and they have a",
          "I called and left a voice mail message with my phone number about their evening tours and never received a return phone call. So, I cannot comment on the facility.",
          "One can learn so much about these special animals just by visiting & taking A tour. The staff is very well informed . I will go again. Just beautiful",
          "It is enchanting to do the Walking with Lemurs tour and be out in the forest with free ranging lemurs of different types. We saw ring-tailed and blue-eyed black lemurs. It is so amazing to watch them jumping around in the trees. And coquerel sifakas who travel on the ground by",
          "A great afternoon activity for the whole family. We booked ahead and enjoyed our visit. Great tour leader. Did have some problems seeing all of the lemurs as it was cold outside. Would recommend spring or autumn visits when they are out in their cages more.",
          "As others have said - you must book in advance to be able to visit. We did without any issues. An interesting tour that includes a 15 minute video and then about a 60 minute tour. Only slight complaint is that our tour guide would talk while we were walking to the cages - and",
          "The best way to visit Lemur Center is to call them (919) 401 7240 and schedule a guided tour. The center houses endangered primate species in a large park. The tour is very informative. We highly recommend especially if you have children eager to learn (or if you have a child's",

          "I was on a short trip to North Carolina and was looking for something to do in the Durham area, and stumbled upon this on TripAdvisor. Going here was an excellent decision. The lemurs were so adorable, and our tour guide was hilarious and amazing. Once I learned there were",
          "They have the guided and self-guided tour options. We had enjoyed both, so it is really your preference. In the self-guided tour, you go at your own pace and there are docents at the different areas to talk about and answer questions on the lemurs. It is not a big facility, so",

          "We got to go as a prescheduled group to the Duke Lemur Center. This has been a research facility for lemurs for more than 50 years and has the world\u2019s largest and most diverse collection of lemurs outside of Madagascar. We started at the visitor center and gift shop, moved on to",
          "Outside of Mozambique, this is the only place which has 15 species of Lemurs, who live in a safe preserve; the ones on display are rotated so they aren't always caged. While there are 100 species of Lemur, this place has the most outside of Mozambique. Many are endangered --",
          "DH & I signed up for the walking with lemurs tour. We did get to the center super early which was fun as we browsed the shop and watched a short video. Our small group was taken into an enclosure and then watched the lemurs being called to their feeding. There was lots of",
          "I think I would have had a better experience if it was not raining outside. The Lemurs were all inside their cages and you don't really get to see many if you just step inside the building. I would recommend visiting if the weather is good and the lemurs can come outside of",
          "The center which houses 200+ lemurs is the largest collection of this animal outside its homeland on the island of Madagascar. Our young guide was knowledgeable and answered all questions. Was difficult to get good pictures because of the screens on the cages. When the weather",

          "This is not Disney World, it is not the NC Zoo, but it is so very interesting and so wonderful. What the people do here to preserve for all of us these interesting and amazing little animals for all of us who would otherwise never have a chance to see them. Lets say they are",
          "I doubt that there is any where else to see this variety of lemurs. There is lots to learn about these relatives of ours, and this is a good place to start.",
          "I visited the center with a group of 17 women. Our guide, Cynthia, was delightful, knowledgeable and articulate. It was a rainy day but she made the visit well worthwhile. I was impressed how well she answered our numerous questions and had extensive knowledge about the center",
          "We had a very nice visit but we did not get to see much variety for the \u201cpremiere\u201d experience. For $200, two of us went to one enclosure, saw 2 types of lemurs and the nocturnal building- very hard to see. Because it was warm, the lemurs hung around us after being brought out",
          "Need to book for guided tour of the centre. The guide was friendly and provided a very informative tour.",
          "The Lemur Center is a worthwhile experience. Unusually chilly weather unfortunately curtailed the viewing on the day of our visit, as the lemurs don\u2019t go outside (where they are more easily viewed) when the temp is below 45 degrees. Reservations must be made in advance, so",
          "We went on a cold morning in Feb. but were able to see many Lemurs playing in their indoor habitats. The guide was VERY knowledgeable. I plan to go back sometime in the warmer months as well! Such good information and a fun walk around the center.",
          "The Lemur center is neat and I enjoyed the tour. I give it three stars as it is small and though the lemurs are cute and hte tour guides knowledgeable you don't actually spend alot of time there. Well managed and well informed staff!",
          "Alana was an excellent & knowledgeable guide as my friends and I toured this interesting place. You will see a variety of lemur species; I thought the coolest ones were those that hop to get around - they hop both vertically and horizontally, they don't walk. You must book ahead",
          "We took a group of 35 homeschoolers, aged 5-13, on an enrichment tour on an absolutely beautiful day (trips go out regardless of weather, so we lucked out). The tour began with a movie about lemurs inside the gift shop, and then we broke up into two groups and walked the",
          "Yes, you must reserve. I visited this place two or three years ago with ~100 college students. The welcome is very friendly and informative. You get a video. If the outdoor temperature is under 46 degrees, the lemurs will be kept inside. If over 46 degrees, outside, and you may",
          "We had such a great time. Book a reservation in advance, and bring your camera. And please do NOT take pictures in the dark building - as the Center has posted on the door, it hurts the Lemurs eyes. We were disgusted with the number of visitors who were sneaking pictures in",
          "This is a must do family activity in when visiting the Durham area. They do a great job of education and the lemurs are amazing!",
          "The Duke Lemur Center does very good work in studying lemurs and helping the species survive. They have a nice facility as well and I could tell the animals were well cared for. The Lemurs Live tour is $12 plus tax and is a 90 minute tour that includes an introduction video. The",
          "Really great place kid-friendly felt more of like a scientific Institute than a place to go take your kids and see lemurs but it's a one of a kind of place to check out everybody was super friendly",
          "Take the time to reserve when you know your travel dates, this is a highly popular venue. I was able to get in because I was a single & able to fill a waiting list. That said, this was an amazing place, the tour was extensive & the lemurs absolutely fascinating! Children of",
          "We did the Keeper for A Day, their priciest tour. This experience was amazing and we loved it, though it was a bit long and it was hot out in October. You start of changing into scrubs and see some of the facility. Then you prepare some meals for the Aye Aye lemurs, animals you",
          "We went as a group with a 3 year old and a 1 1/2 year old. The children enjoyed the gift shop and the video much more than the exhibit. The lady who took us around had much more information to share than we could take with the little ones. All the enclosures seemed to be",
          "Great tour of the Lemur centre with my two teenage kids. Informative and great to be able to see Lemurs free ranging it as well as in the cages. We did the one hour basic tour which was fine for us.",
          "Not your first thought when visiting Durham or Duke University but a \u2018must\u2019 stop if you have the time. More Lemurs here than any where in the world other than their native home of Madagascar. Must book in advance and at least a month in advance is recommended. Best to come",
          "I visited Duke's Lemur Center, with a tour organized by Carrboro's Park & Recreation. Although it was a somehow interesting visit, guided by a knowledgeable volunteer, I was disappointed, as the animals were caged and difficult to see through the enclosures. I couldn't take any",
          "We enjoyed our visit and the very professionally guided tour that came with it. This is a research facility so you can't roam the grounds by yourself. You have to stay with the group. Reservations suggested. One couple was having keeping their young. It engaged, so people with",
          "I went with a friend and took my 3yr old and 4yr old on the Little Lemurs tour. For about 20min or so of the 45 min tour, we sat inside the gift shop and watched a little video on lemurs. We then went outside and briefly looked at all the enclosures. My kids didn't care much",
          "Most of the year center is for private tours and don't know if I would have wished to pay for the higher fee so going during the summer for self guided was a great introduction. Young people were at every exhibit to answer questions about the animals which made for a very",
          "Since you don't often see Lemurs outside of Madagascar ( and they don't travel well) this is an ideal opportunity to learn more about these prosimian primates. They are amazing creatures and each species represented at the Center has unique characteristics. We were a family",
          "We bit the bullet and paid the $ to do the 'Walking with Lemurs' tour and are so glad we did! With a limit of 8-10 people the experience is very intimate. We went in the ringtail and sifaka enclosure and spent 90 mins observing and learning about these quirky creatures...they",
          "What a great place to see these amazing creatures outside of their native Madagascar. Take a tour that goes into their habitat. Awesome to be that close. Please read the Web site tour info.",
          "Wonderful facility with great and caring staff and many adorable lemurs. Very much worth a visit, and much better than a zoo. Lemurs are mere feet or yards away, and while they are enclosed sometimes, you can tour the free rangers and see lemurs on the ground and in the trees",

          "Saw almost nothing for $12. Also, First stop the tour guide was some kid, Patrick, who talked way too fast in that slurred, 20-something-speak, and who would not slow down and enunciate when asked to modify his presentation style. Can't/won't recommend.",

          "WOW! we did the tour where we got to go into the enclosure with the lemurs. One of the females came down and was touching the camera lens...talk about a close up! Watching them eat and move was fascinating! I would not recommend this for small children, as we had to stay quiet",
          "The fact that this is a non-for-profit organization that saves and helps these amazing and cute animals makes it all worth it for paying to enter. I read some reviews about complaining about the price? It is NOT that expensive, especially for the great things they do for NON",
          "We recently enjoyed a tour of the center and had an enthusiastic tour guide. Very knowledgeable and informative! These fascinating creatures are endangered and outside of their native habitat of Madagasgar, the Lemur Center has the most lemurs in the world. Doing vital research",
          "Hi folks like my title, but i think we rushed through the Duke Lemur Center and I wished we would have had more time. These little animals are amazing, They are very personable and inviting. The tour guide we had was very knowledgeable and made the experience very worth while,",
          "Very nice NONPROFIT facility. Tours only by reservation, and unless you are lucky, those reservations need to be made weeks in advance. Get to see both diurnal (awake in the day) and nocturnal Lemurs and a few related species. The ones you see are in cages, but the facility",
          "My husband and I just took our 11 year old grandson to the Walking with Lemurs tour in Durham. We had a wonderful time and our guide - Hannibal - was very informative about the different lemurs we saw and what their habitat in Madagascar would be like. As we approached the",
          "We took two children. The price is ok, but be prepared for walking and a tour guide giving you lots of information. We were expecting more--it was just walking and stopping at the cages. We did like seeing the lemurs, but before the hour tour ended, my 9 year old grand was",
          "Incredible research facility that allows visitors in for tours. My 9y daughter and I loved the twilight tours; they answered so many questions! We were face to face with so many different types of lemurs! Incredible staff and incredible animals! We're coming back!",
          "The Duke Lemur Center is a wonderful place to visit. I particularly recommend the \"Walking with Lemurs\" tour. It is expensive at $95/pp, but well worth it at least once in a lifetime. Seeing the Sifakas dance and jump from tree to tree is spectacular. You also visit the caged",
          "Well done and interesting. Best is that you learn the history of these beautiful animals and concerns about the danger of them becoming extinct. Lots of info on their natural habitat and the work that is being done to save them.",

          "I definitely recommend this, but my negative is that I felt my \"tour\" was a bit too long. First, I sat in a room waiting for my orientation film to begin. We were late starting because a couple of tour members (for my time slot) were late. The film was o.k. but too long. I",
          "Our tour group was split into two groups. We heard a little from both guides before the actual tour and knew exactly which guide we wanted. Unfortunately, we were \"assigned\" to the other guide, who just didn't do a very good presentation. I feel like we spent $24 for a mediocre",
          "My family and I went here last week, and we loved it!! Lemurs are such beautiful creatures. We were here on a day the temperature rose to 99 degrees in Durham, and we had such a fun tour, led by Hannibal. He carried a bag of Craisins and was able to lure lemurs right to the",
          "The tour came highly recommended to us by a Raleigh-Durham local, and while the facility is tucked doesn't look anything like the photos on the website, I was impressed at each point of the 90-minute tour by how much I learned about efforts to protect and preserve these",
          "It is a bit pricey, but this is an excellent place to see Lemurs up close and the talks the guides give are very in depth. You can ask any and all questions. It's very interesting.",
          "I just did the basic tour - I thought I would see some lemurs in the natural habitat as you see on the website. But the basic tour just takes you in some of the housing units where you see some lemurs. If you can afford it, probably the tour that takes you out in the woods to",
          "The facility was clean and had a nice flow. The trails are well kept, the tour guide was friendly and very knowledgeable. There were many different types of lemurs to see and hear. Taking pictures is difficult due to the type of cages. There is a gift shop and drinks available",
          "then you will find it surprisingly in Durham! Outside of Madagascar they have the world's largest collection of lemurs - cute critters who can be very active and engaging if not too hot outside. The tour guides make all the difference otherwise you will just whip past all the",
          "My sister insisted that we go see the Lemurs. In my mind it was some strange facility. In reality it's an open-air section of the woods that has spacious, humane cages for the Lemurs so that research can be done in order to prevent them from going extinct. I was impressed by the",
          "So you think lemurs are cute? well, they are but you can see and learn so much more here at the Duke Lemur center. Take advantage of planning ahead and take the tour. Fun and enjoyable for children and adults.",
          "My husband and I took the Walking with Lemurs tour, which took us inside the enclosure of a group of ring-tailed and red-fronted lemurs. It was wonderful to observe and photograph them without barriers! We remained outside the enclosures for the remainder of the tour, as many",
          "Just a wonderful experience. It is spacious, clean, caring employees, and very special experience to meet some of our ancestors.",
          "A remarkable effort to preserve and protect the lemurs of Madagascar! Need to make an appointment prior.",
          "Our guide seemed to know everything about these little guys. We toured the facility, asked lots of questions and bought tee shirts to support their cause. This is a nice was to spend part of a day with family, especially children.",
          "It was neat to go on this small tour and see all the lemurs. I'm not much of a nature lover, but this was very cool to see! The tour was not very long at all. Totally doable and worth it!",
          "This was just a wonderful experience. Tour guides are knowledgable and passionate. Our guide, Faye, was so engaging and you could really tell she loved her work. You learn so much about the animals without being bored. We even got to see a baby munch on its first flowers. The",
          "We took one of our Cub Scout dens to the Duke Lemur center last summer as part of their working on a STEM based award. Our visit to the Lemur center was interesting, engaging and well organized. The staff seemed engaged and did a great job with keeping the kids interested.",
          "Plan on spending the day. Tours are great as is just walking around on your own. If you've never seen Lemurs before, you're in for a treat :)",
          "You need to plan ahead and make an appointment but it is well worth it. Interesting story on how this place came to be. If I remember correctly, there are more Lemurs here than in Madagascar where their habitat has declined dramatically.",
          "We took a 10:30 tour and it was cold out - there was ice on the path - so the Lemurs were all inside. We did get to see most of them inside but some of the views were so-so since its through a door and down an aisle way. I found the ringtails curious and actually played a bit",
          "We did the lemurs live tour. Very informative and interesting. Make sure you visit when it's above 41 degrees you will be able to see them much better. Cute and curious creatures.",

          "You need to plan ahead most of the time to get tickets. But once you're in, it's a fascinating tour. You get to see lots of different lemurs with all kinds of personalities. The tour guides are quite knowledgeable and keep things moving at a pace that keeps everybody engaged.",
          "We had wanted to visit the Duke Lemur Center for quite a while. We found an offer on Groupon for tour tickets, made our reservations, which you should make via phone well in advance of your desired tour date, since they book up early. There are multiple types of tours offered,",
          "The volunteer led tour was really informative. The guide knew lots of interesting facts that really made the trip worthwhile. We visited in the fall, so the lemurs were in the indoor facilities. This wasn't bad, though- since the lemurs were still really active (and vocal at",

          "Located a couple of miles from Duke's West Campus, the Lemur Center is a research facility that allows public tours. You do need to make a reservation and you have to stay with the guide the entire time. We visited on a day where there was alternate sunshine and pouring rain,",
          "As others said, it's rather educational. And the most important part, lemurs are so adorable. Just one thing, don't go there in cold weathers. When it's cold, you are not likely to see lemurs outside.",
          "Duke Lemur Center is a great way to learn about these unique creatures and get up close with them. We did the basic tour and were able to see many of the center's inhabitants. The tour lasted about 75 minutes so is appropriate for all ages and the trails are very accessible",

          "I went with a group of 7, varied ages. We had a blast. The guide we had was very knowledgeable about the lemurs and the facility. The lemurs are in cages, but you have a good view of them all. The entire group laughed when the lemurs started \"talking to each other\" it echoed",

          "It was my daughter's dream come true! It was her ambition to visit the Duke Lemur Centre. It was a very pleasant experience for us as we participated in a Guided lemur tour with a very knowledgeable host and then watched the lemurs \"paint\" works of art for us which we were",
          "We went for the \"Lemurs Live!\" tour - inexpensive at $9 for seniors. The video before the tour was quite interesting and informative but the tour itself was disappointing. The guide kept telling us to take lots of pictures but that was impossible since one only got to glimpse",
          "I heard about this place as it is the largest center for lemurs outside of Madagascar. It is a research center that offers tours so make sure to make a reservation and plan your reservation in the future as they book up quickly. The video at the beginning of the tour was very",
          "This was an interesting experience. We went there twice; the first time was the regular tour, \"Lemurs Live,\" which was fun (also, we had a Groupon, so it was inexpensive), but really not much more than a souped-up zoo tour. The lemurs were cute to look at, but they were in",
          "Extremely informative and the lemurs are really entertaining. Our volunteer guide is a child psychiatrist and had lots of cool things to say about Lemur behavior. Oscar the baby lemur was jumping around like a yr old kid. Sadly, the wire is so think and dark that it's almost",
          "Poorly organized and a lot of information repeated. Thought the video was better than the tour. Our guide Went on and on and on. Cut it shorter and make it more fun. The Lemur's are fun to watch get their crazins. OK visit, but once is enough.",
          "Fascinating zoo-like opportunity to view a multitude of lemurs. Very interesting tour. Worth a visit while in Durham.",
          "I took my 9 year old granddaughter, and we had the best time. There are so many lemurs, and they are so active. I had no idea it would be such an attractive place with beautifully landscaped areas. I had no idea there were so many different lemurs, either. She is after me",
          "This was the one thing I planned before I went on my trip - and you have to book early, because it sells out. I would have liked to do the \"up close and personal\" tours, but they're just too expensive. Do the standard tour; it's absolutely worth it! The lemurs are so adorable,",

          "This is a great learning experience. The staff here really know their info on lemurs. They even can tell you who is making all the noise as you walk through the center. I would highly recommend a visit to this place.",

          "We took the Walking with Lemurs tour. It was a magical experience to be so close to these amazing animals with no barriers between us and them. Seeing them in the forest, rather than just in their enclosures, was beautiful too. The guides were very knowledgeable and took us",
          "Toured the Lemur Center yesterday. Our guide, Chris, provided us with lots of good info about why Lemurs are important and how and why they came to Duke. He patiently answere all of our questions. Don't forget to look for the Lemurs in the wild as you exit the parking lot.",
          "Having been a Duke student, I remembered that Duke had a Primate Center back in the 90s and wondered if it were still there. I discovered that it had a major overhaul and was now just the Duke Lemur Center. Wanting to find something a little different to do on a recent trip",
          "This is a fascinating operation, and houses more lemurs than anyplace else outside of Madigascar. You need to make reservations for are accompanied by a guide. But it was a big hit with both grownups and the 5 year olds.",
          "My wife and I visited the lemur center a few days before the early February blizzard, and it was already pretty cold out. The lemurs are kept inside at any temperature below 45, but I think they're going to be inside more often than not even in slightly warmer temps. Visiting",
          "Took my daughter (9) today on a tour of the Duke Lemur Center and we enjoyed it, even if the weather wasn't the best. It starts with a short film about the center and explains what lemurs are. I did not realize that DLC has more lemurs than any place outside of Madagascar, and",
          "Finally made it here on a Friday afternoon in November but was disappointed when the $10 tour had virtually no lemurs to observe (hence the lower rating than I would like to have given). It was either too cool for them in a late November afternoon or some of the doors were",

          "This is a wonderful place to learn about lemurs!!! Duke Lemur Center has the most lemurs in the world outside of Madagascar (currently they have 262 lemurs from 16 different species). The one hour guided tour is well worth the money, which is used to support the Center. We loved",
          "Loved this! Great video overview and then a tour led by a dedicated volunteer. Saw many lemur, aya ayes and bushbabies.",
          "I was skeptical at first but I was glad my daughter talked me into this. The tour starts with a 15 minute movie. A guide then takes you around the grounds to different types of lemurs. The tour lasts about an hour and costs $10 each. Discounts apply for students, military,",
          "This is a very educational and interesting experience and well worth the time to plan ahead and do it. The staff are polite and helpful and take their jobs seriously. This is a place for the lemurs and we are allowed to visit them",
          "I\u2019ve seen lemurs on loan from the Duke University Lemur Center on a couple occasions, but hadn\u2019t visited the Center until yesterday. The video at the start of the tour and our guide were excellent. I agree with a couple of the other reviewers who state that taking photos",

          "If you are an animal lover, you may well find this a tour you are very glad you heard about and took while not breaking the bank to do so. The center houses a lot of varieties of lemurs and the guides are knowledgable. It's a fun way to spend a morning or afternoon.",
          "So many lemurs to see and learn about! Very knowledgeable staff, too. I've brought family here several times and done most of the tours (the every day ones and the \"Walk with the Lemurs\" tour). Call ahead to make a reservation, as they book pretty quickly (though they will",
          "I had expected a walk through one of the lemur habitats, but no. Essentially this tour is a guided walk around a very small specialised zoo with cages that restrict a good view of the animals. They say to take plenty of photos. Ok. If you don't mind shooting through a thick",
          "I spent a full day at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, NC. It was awesome \u2013 a world class adventure. Their animal species, ancient primates, are some of the most endangered and most unique animals on earth. With wide range of tours, you can get to meet many of them up close. All",

          "I did the $10 tour and it was rather slow. We were guided to about 6 different cages to see 2 Lemurs in each. They weren't terribly active. It was neat and I learned some things and it sounds like they're doing good work, but if I could go again (I don't live in the area), I",
          "Really enjoyed the tour, and the lemurs. Unfortunately they were not out and hard to see. Definitely plan to return in nicer weather",

          "This is my third visit to Durham, but the first time I was able to get tickets to tour the Lemur Center. Be sure to call ahead. We learned so much about the animals, our guide was full of information. The nocturnal creatures were fascinating. A different experience, great for",

          "Lemurs are quite likeable animals, it seems. We took the regular tour, and were disappointed not to see them except behind glass. It was Feb., so they were inside and not out in the cages outside. The nocturnal lemurs were all incredible. Amazing they are here in NC.",
          "I knew next to nothing about lemurs before this tour. The staff were obviously very devoted to their lemur guests and to educating the public about them. You not only learn about the lemurs, but also what is being done to save their natural habitat by the Duke center working",
          "Lemurs are distant cousins to us and at the Duke Lemur Center you can learn all about these unusual and interesting creatures. Located outside of Durham the basic tour is educational and gives you a fair amount of exposure to these animals. Tours are guided by students and",
          "Off the beaten track and a little hard to find is the Duke Lemur Center. Lemur's are not something most of us see on a regular basis, and the facility here is unique in that regard. I enjoyed my visit very much.",
          "More than half of the Lemurs in captivity are in the single center here. It is well designed and the staff is eager to show the animals and their behaviors to you. Great for families with kids over 5.",
          "Nice place to take the kids. Kind of loud when they got to making noises at each other, but neat. It could really be more if it was bigger, but good to be able to see animals that are not the norm in this area.",
          "The staff is knowledgeable and the lemurs are so adorable. Just watch the gift shop - I was charged for something that wasn't purchased and wasn't in my bag of souvenirs. Of course, didn't realize the mistake until it was too late!",

          "I took a group of kids over from my Eco-Adventures Camp. We scheduled in advance but still had to wait a while for the next session - not a problem at all. Loved seeing and learning about the lemurs but wasn't as exciting as I hoped it would be. We did go on a day that was",
          "This was such a fun tour. I would love to go again. The staff was fun, and knew the answers to all our questions. We learned a lot, and it was so much fun to see all the different types. The lemurs are fun to see and hear!! This tour is great for all ages. I'll be back!",
          "the lemur center is well worth a visit - the animals are clearly cared for well, and staff are very knowledgable. we visited on a 100 degree day, so the lemurs were not very active, but still very interesting.",
          "Noting the \"poor\" in my username: I got out to the center to find out it's nearly $20 a person to do the regular tour. That involves watching an educational TV special, then standing for over an hour to talk outside of about 5 cages and 3 indoor enclosures each with two lemurs",
          "I've been there at least half a dozen times; almost all of them were marvelous tours. The one that wasn't was with a boring guide. Unfortunately, there's no way to predict. And -- it might not have been bad that time if I hadn't had such great guides in the past.",
          "Very informative, fascinating. My daughter made a power point to share what she'd learned with her class, and she remembered so many facts!",
          "At first I was enthralled, but by the time we walked through the entire center i was a little bored with lemurs! I guess if you are a \"lemur lover\" you will love it, but it just didn't hold my interest.",
          "If you get the chance, I highly recommend the \"Walking With Lemurs\" tour. You get to go out in the woods with the keepers and are surrounded by the lemurs as they are fed. Wonderful photography opportunities. We saw ring-tails, red ruffed, and sifakas (with babies) extremely",
          "This center is very interesting, and it's nice to learn about a species that you don't see very often elsewhere -- even in a zoo. One thing I must mention, though, is that lemurs are not exactly cute animals.",
          "A tour of the Lemur Center is a fantastic learning experience. The guides are terrific and seeing the lemurs up close is a real thrill. They are such interesting animals and the work going on at the Center is fascinating. You won't be disappointed.",
          "We had great tour of the Lemur Center. Our young teenage kids loved this diversion while their older sister was touring Duke's campus. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "A wonderful family outing to see Lemurs of all kinds. You will not be disappointed, you always see the animals interacting, playing and eating. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.",
          "Our daughter was going to be taking a summer studies class that was at the Lemur Center so we decided to take a tour. Had no idea that this was the largest lemur center in the world! We had a blast!",

          "Great tour. Kids loved it. Learned a lot! Very friendly and informative staff. Will definitely return and donate in the future",
          "Not a big place and not a tourist attraction, but well worth the visit. Run by students and volunteers, the only place you will get to see so many different lemurs and relatives, and who doesn't love lemurs?",
          "I volunteered here one day and had a great time. The staff is extremely well informed, the research is interesting, and the animals are fascinating",
          "Two of my friends from Philadelphia Zoo and I visited Duke Lemur center. We loved it!!! Lemurs are my favorite animals. I love all animals but I love lemurs best. We did the regular tour and highly recommend it to everyone. We also did the training tour and the free range",
          "Very interesting place. Only problem there were 15 people in our tour so it was hard to get close enough to actually see the animals",
          "My children and I first learned about lemurs watching the childrens' show Zaboomafoo, so naturally I started to research where we might be able to see them. Thankfully, just an hour away is the Duke Lemur Center. We went on the Lemurs Live tour where we learned about the",
          "An ideal tour for families you will learn about what makes lemurs some of the most fascinating animals in the world. You will typically observe about 10 different species of lemurs and be sure to bring your camera, as you will be amazed by these wonderful creatures! You do",
          "The lemurs are lots of fun to see. They are very active and chummy with each other. We got a guided tour and the guide told a bunch of little schoolkids that they (mankind) developed from creatures like these. She didn't mention that this was a theory and that not everyone",

Simply can't take any good pictures. Was a waste of time an money. May be I'll take the 'walk with the lemurs' tour some day and update this review.",

        "wiki": "Kevin Michael Costner (born January 18, 1955) is an American actor, director, producer and musician.  He has received two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.\nCostner began his acting career with Sizzle Beach, U.S.A. (1981). Following a few minor supporting parts, he rose to prominence with his  portrayal of Eliot Ness in The Untouchables (1987). This was followed by a widely successful period in his career with starring roles in No Way Out (1987), Bull Durham (1988), Field of Dreams (1989), Dances with Wolves (1990), for which he won two Academy Awards, JFK (1991), Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991), The Bodyguard (1992), and A Perfect World (1993). In 1995, Costner starred in and co-produced Waterworld. The most expensive film ever made at the time, it was a box office disappointment (which nonetheless made a small profit) that marked a downturn in his career. His second directorial feature, The Postman (1997), was another failure. He has since starred in a string of unsuccessful films which failed to propel his career forward as a leading man; Message in a Bottle (1999), For Love of the Game (1999), Thirteen Days (2000), 3000 Miles to Graceland (2001), Dragonfly (2002),  Rumor Has It (2005), The Guardian (2006), Mr. Brooks (2007), 3 Days to Kill (2014), McFarland, USA (2015), Draft Day (2014), and Criminal (2016). However, he has had supporting parts in critically favored films including The Upside of Anger (2005), Man of Steel (2013), Hidden Figures (2016) and Molly's Game (2017). \nOn television, Costner portrayed Devil Anse Hatfield in the miniseries Hatfields & McCoys (2012), winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. Since 2018, he has starred as John Dutton on the drama series Yellowstone.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCostner was born on January 18, 1955 in Lynwood, California, and grew up in Compton, California. He is the youngest of three boys, the middle of whom died at birth. His mother, Sharon Rae (Tedrick), was a welfare worker, and his father, William Costner, was an electrician and, later, a utilities executive at Southern California Edison. His father's heritage originates with German immigrants to North Carolina in the 1700s, and Costner also has English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh ancestry. Costner was raised Baptist. He was not academically inclined in school. He enjoyed sports (especially football), took piano lessons, wrote poetry, and sang in the First Baptist Choir. He has stated that a viewing of the 1962 film How the West Was Won at the age of seven had \"formed\" his childhood.He has described spending his teenage years in different parts of California as his father's career progressed, as a period when he \"lost a lot of confidence\", having to make new friends often. Costner lived in Ventura, then in Visalia; he attended Mt. Whitney High School and moved to Orange County, where he graduated from Villa Park High School in 1973. He earned a BA in marketing and finance from California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) in 1978. While at CSUF, he became a brother in the Delta Chi fraternity.Costner became interested in acting and dancing while in his last year of college, and upon graduation, he married Cindy Silva, who worked at Disneyland as Cinderella. The couple honeymooned in Puerto Vallarta; on the return plane journey, they had a chance encounter with actor Richard Burton, who had purchased all the seats around him for solitude. Burton agreed to speak to Costner after he finished reading his book. Costner, who had been taking acting classes but had not told his wife about his desire to be an actor, watched Burton closely and approached when Burton gestured. Costner told Burton that he would prefer to avoid the drama that followed Burton and asked if he would have to tolerate that if he became an actor. Burton replied, \"You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes. I think you'll be fine.\" After the plane landed, Burton's limousine pulled up to the curb where Costner and his wife were waiting for a taxi. Burton wished Costner good luck, and the two never met again. Costner credits Burton with partially contributing to his career.\nHaving agreed to undertake a job as a marketing executive, Costner began taking acting lessons five nights a week, with the support of his wife. His marketing job lasted 30 days. He took work which allowed him to develop his acting skills via tuition, including working on fishing boats, as a truck driver, and giving tours of stars' Hollywood homes to support the couple while he also attended auditions.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCostner made his film debut in the film Sizzle Beach, U.S.A. (known originally as Hot Malibu Summer). Filmed in the winter of 1978\u201379, the film was not released until 1981 and re-released in 1986. The release complications and lack of documentation lead many to believe that Costner's debut was in The Touch (also known as Stacy's Knights), in 1983 with Eve Lilith and Andra Millian. Costner made a brief appearance in the Ron Howard film Night Shift (1982). He is listed in the credits as 'Frat Boy No. 1' and appears at the climax of a frat-style, blow-out party in the New York City morgue, when the music is suddenly stopped by a frantic Henry Winkler. Costner can be seen holding a beer and looking surprised at the sudden halt of celebration.\n\nCostner appeared in a commercial for the Apple Lisa and Table for Five in 1983, and, the same year, had a small role in the nuclear holocaust film Testament. Later, he was cast in The Big Chill and filmed several scenes that were planned as flashbacks, but they were removed from the final cut. His role was that of Alex, the friend who committed suicide, the event that brings the rest of the cast together.  Costner was a friend of director Lawrence Kasdan, who promised the actor a role in a future project. That became Silverado (1985) and a breakout role for Costner. He also starred that year in the smaller films Fandango and American Flyers and appeared alongside Kiefer Sutherland in an hour-long special episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories.\nCostner achieved movie star status in 1987, when he starred as federal agent Eliot Ness in The Untouchables and in the leading role of the thriller No Way Out. He solidified his A-list status in the baseball-themed films Bull Durham (1988) and Field of Dreams (1989). In 1990, he partnered with producer Jim Wilson to form the production company Tig Productions. Tig's first film was the epic Dances with Wolves which Costner directed and starred in. This film was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including two for him personally (Best Picture and Best Director). The same year saw the release of Revenge, in which he starred along with Anthony Quinn and Madeleine Stowe, directed by Tony Scott; Costner had wanted to direct it himself.\nCostner followed with Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991); the Oliver Stone-directed JFK (1991); The Bodyguard (1992); and Clint Eastwood's A Perfect World (1993); all of which provided box office or critical acclaim. He took the title role in the biopic Wyatt Earp (1994), directed by Kasdan. The War, also made in 1994, seemed to gain little attention. The science fiction-post-apocalyptic epics Waterworld (1995) and The Postman (1997), the latter of which Costner also directed, were both commercial disappointments and both largely regarded by critics as artistic failures. However, while Waterworld achieved respectable box office and some positive reviews, results for The Postman were far worse and it ended up \"winning\" five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Director for Costner. Costner starred in the golf comedy Tin Cup (1996) for Ron Shelton, who had previously directed him in Bull Durham. He developed the film Air Force One and was set to play the lead role of the President, but ultimately decided to concentrate on finishing The Postman instead. He personally offered the project to Harrison Ford. In 1999, he starred in Message in a Bottle  with Robin Wright, based on the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks.\n\n  The film drew mixed reviews and just about broke even at the box office.\nHis career revived somewhat in 2000 with Thirteen Days, in which he portrayed Kenneth O'Donnell, a top adviser to John F. Kennedy. The western Open Range, which he directed and starred in, received critical acclaim in 2003, and was a surprise success commercially. He received some of his best reviews for his supporting role as retired professional baseball player Denny Davies in The Upside of Anger, for which he received a nomination from the Broadcast Film Critics Association and won the San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. After that, Costner starred in The Guardian and in Mr. Brooks, in which he portrayed a serial killer. In 2008, his Tig Productions company closed and was changed to Tree House Films. In 2008, Costner starred in Swing Vote. He starred opposite Jennifer Aniston in the 2005 movie Rumour Has It. Costner was honored on September 6, 2006, when his hand and foot prints were set in concrete in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre alongside those of other celebrated actors and entertainers. In 2010, he appeared in The Company Men alongside Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper. It debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, and received good reviews. It was released in cinemas worldwide in January 2011. The film was considered to be an Oscar contender, but did not get a nomination.\nCostner announced that he would be returning to the director's chair for the first time in seven years, in 2011, with A Little War of Our Own. He was also about to team up again with director Kevin Reynolds in Learning Italian. Neither film has been made as of February 2017.\nHe also appears, as a special cameo, in Funny or Die's \"Field of Dreams 2: NFL Lockout\". Costner portrayed Jonathan Kent in the rebooted Superman film Man of Steel, directed by Zack Snyder. Costner was going to have a role in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts.\nCostner starred in the three-part miniseries Hatfields & McCoys, which premiered on May 28, 2012, on the History Channel. It broke a record by pulling 13.9 million viewers. The miniseries tells the true American story of a legendary family feud \u2013 one that spanned decades and nearly launched a war between Kentucky and West Virginia. The role earned Costner the 2012 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie, the 2013 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie, and the 2013 Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Limited Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television.In 2014, Costner appeared in the spy movie Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, as Thomas Harper, a mentor for the series' title character. The same year, he starred in the thriller 3 Days to Kill and the drama Draft Day and produced and starred in Black or White. Black or White premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival and opened in the United States in 2015. In 2015, Costner played coach Jim White in the drama film McFarland, USA, about cross-country running. In 2016, he played the fictional character Al Harrison, a NASA Space Task Group supervisor, in Hidden Figures, and in 2017, he starred with Jessica Chastain in Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut film Molly's Game. In 2018, he has appeared in the television series Yellowstone, marking the first regular TV series role of his career.\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Country music ===\n\nCostner is the singer in Kevin Costner & Modern West, a country rock band which he founded with the encouragement of his wife Christine. In October 2007, they began a worldwide tour which included shows in Istanbul and Rome. The group also performed at NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races at Daytona International Speedway and Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina.\nThe band released a country album, Untold Truths, on November 11, 2008, on Universal South Records. The album peaked at No. 61 on the Billboard Top Country Albums and No. 35 on the Top Heatseekers chart. Three singles (\"Superman 14\", \"Long Hot Night\" and \"Backyard\") have been released to radio, although none have charted. For the single \"Superman 14\" a live music video was made.\nIn 2009, they went on tour with opening act The Alternate Routes. In August, at the Big Valley Jamboree in Camrose, Alberta, Costner and the band were scheduled next on stage when a severe thunderstorm struck, causing the stage and stands on the main stage to collapse. One person was reported dead and forty injured. Later, an auction was held to raise money for the two young sons of the woman killed. A dinner with Costner was auctioned off for $41,000. Two guitars, one autographed by Costner, helped raise another $10,000 each.A second Kevin Costner and Modern West album, Turn It On, was released in February 2010 in Europe and was supported by a European tour. In July 2012, the band performed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the 20th annual Telus World Skins Game in support of the IWK Health Centre Foundation, donating a guitar personally autographed by Costner.Kevin Costner has also appeared in the documentary film Country Roads by Marieke Schr\u00f6der.\n\n\n=== Baseball ===\nSeveral of Costner's films have included a baseball theme: Chasing Dreams, Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, For Love of the Game, and The Upside of Anger, in three of which his character is a pro baseball player and one a former pro baseball player.\nCostner has a home in Austin, Texas, and sometimes appears at Texas Longhorns baseball practices and games. He was a close friend of former Longhorns baseball coach Augie Garrido from Garrido's days coaching at Cal State Fullerton, Costner's alma mater. He cast Garrido to play the role of the Yankee manager in For Love of the Game. He tries to attend every College World Series game that CSUF Titans plays in Omaha, Nebraska. Costner walked-on for a try-out, but did not make the team early in his time at the university.\nCostner was a partial owner of the Zion, Illinois-based Lake County Fielders independent baseball team in the North American League. The Fielders name was an homage to Field of Dreams, with the logo showing a ballplayer standing amid a field of corn.\n\n\n=== Business interests ===\n\nIn 1995, Costner began developing oil separation machines based on a patent he purchased from the US government. The machines developed by the company were of little commercial interest until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when BP took six of the machines from a company in which Costner owned an interest, Ocean Therapy Solutions, for testing in late May 2010. On June 16, 2010, BP entered into a lease with Ocean Therapy Solutions for 32 of the oil-water separation devices. Although Spyron Contoguris and Stephen Baldwin previously sold their interests in Ocean Therapy Solutions in mid-June to another investor in the company, they filed a lawsuit in Louisiana District Court claiming $10.64 million for securities fraud and misrepresentation. The suit claimed that Costner kept a meeting with BP secret from them, and the secret meeting resulted in an $18-million down payment on a $52 million purchase, and that after the down payment, but before any announcement, another investor used part of the downpayment to buy out their shares, thus excluding them from their share of the profits from the total sale. The suit claimed that, despite public statements by Costner, Ocean Therapy Solutions, BP and others to the contrary, Baldwin and Contogouris were told that BP was still testing the machines and had not yet committed to lease the machines from Ocean Therapy Solutions and that the other investor in Ocean Therapy Solutions purchased their shares for $1.4 million to Baldwin and $500,000, to Contogouris. In June 2012, a federal jury in Louisiana deliberated for less than 2 hours before rejecting Baldwin's and Contogouris' claims in the multimillion-dollar oil-clean-up case, and the court ordered Baldwin and Contogouris to reimburse Costner and the other defendants in the case for their costs.On June 6, 2004, Costner opened Tatanka: The Story of the Bison one mile south of Deadwood, South Dakota, on U.S. Route 85, for what he hoped would be an educational and emotional place for people to learn about America's westward expansion. Promoters stated in a news release that the $5-million attraction had a new, 3,800-square-foot interactive center featuring exhibit, retail, and food and beverage areas, as well as offices and a small orientation theater. The visitor center features graphics, photographs, and text describing how bison came to North America and how Native American tribes used the animals for food, clothing, shelter, and other needs. The centerpiece is a bronze sculpture depicting a buffalo jump commonly used by Plains Indians to kill and process large numbers of animals on which they depended for survival. Hill City artist Peggy Detmers created 14 bronze bison in the act of running from their pursuers and three bronze Lakota riders on horseback. Three of the massive bison are posed in midair, cascading over the face of a cliff. Costner commissioned the work in 1994 from Detmers. The five-fourths-scale bronzes, each weighing between 2,500 and 8,000 pounds, were cast at Eagle Bronze Foundry in Lander, Wyoming. The encampment features living Lakota interpreters of history, dressed in period attire and settled among their tipis.In July 2004, Costner fired Francis and Carla Caneva, who managed the Midnight Star casino in Deadwood. A judge subsequently ordered Costner to pay a percentage of $6.1 million to buy out the Canevas as his business partners. In October 2006, Costner asked the South Dakota Supreme Court to re-examine the ruling, as an accountant hired by the actor had determined the market value of the casino to be $3.1 million.\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nCostner serves on an honorary board for the National World War I Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. In spring 2011, he recorded two radio spots for the museum that were aired on Kansas City Royals Radio Network.\n\n\n=== NASCAR ===\nCostner was named ceremonial Grand Marshal of the NASCAR Cup Series' Auto Club 500 which took place on February 25, 2007, at the California Speedway. In 2008, he worked with the NASCAR Media Group and CMT Films to help produce the NASCAR Documentary The Ride of Their Lives which would be released in 2009. Costner would be the narrator for that documentary. Also in 2009, he was named the spokesman for NASCAR Day which took place on May 15. The next day, May 16, he and his country music band would perform in the infield of Charlotte Motor Speedway as well as participate as a judge in the 2nd annual Victory Challenge before the 25th Running of the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn 1975 while in college, Costner started dating fellow student Cindy Silva, and married three years later.  During their marriage, they had three children. The couple divorced in 1994 after 16 years of marriage. He has a son with Bridget Rooney, with whom he had a brief relationship following his divorce, and then dated politcal activist Birgit Cunningham. In 1996, he lived with supermodel Elle Macpherson.On September 25, 2004, Costner married his girlfriend of four years, model and handbag designer Christine Baumgartner, at his ranch in Aspen, Colorado. They have three children.\n\n\n== Political activism ==\nCostner was raised in a Baptist home and sang in the church choir. When commenting on his religious beliefs, he says that he has faith in God, but it is tested. Early in his life, Costner was a Republican. He was a supporter and good friend of Ronald Reagan, frequently playing golf with the former President. He eventually switched his affiliation in the early 1990s. Since 1992, Costner has financially supported a variety of Democratic politicians, including Al Gore and Tom Daschle, but also made contributions to Republican Phil Gramm as late as 1995. He said publicly in 2008 that he has no ambition to run for political office, adding \"I've lived quite a colorful life\".In the final days before the 2008 election, Costner campaigned for Barack Obama, visiting various places in Colorado, where he has a home. In his speech, Costner stated the need for young voters to get to the polls, early and with enthusiasm. \"We were going to change the world and we haven't\", Costner said at a Colorado State University rally. \"My generation didn't get it done, and we need you to help us\".In October 2014, Costner sent a tribute to British troops serving around the world thanking them for their work.On December 22, 2019, Costner endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg at a rally in Indianola, Iowa. Costner narrated a commercial for J. D. Scholten, a Democrat running for the U.S. House of Representatives from Iowa's 4th congressional district.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Honors ==\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nKevin Costner at the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\nKevin Costner on IMDb\nKevin Costner at AllMovie\nKevin Costner at the TCM Movie Database \nKevin Costner in the Hollywood Walk of Fame Directory",

          "My husband and I visited the Duke homestead and were impressed with the authenticity. Regardless of what we now know about the dangers of smoking the tobacco industry had a huge impact on our nation's economy. Seeing this from the viewpoint of a late 19th century entrepreneur",
          "The homestead is largely a paean to the tobacco industry that made the Dukes wealthy--it's peaceful and pretty, but not much of real interest if one is not particularly interested in tobacco history. We did our own walking tour, but it might have been better to take a guided",
          "OK so my kids were here at Thanksgiving -- I am new to the area. I had seen it all ready and while it's (the museum, not the house) very dated in many ways, it's also amazing in how it documents the rise of the Duke family. They were the JP Morgans of the antebellum (post",

          "The displays were very good. Having been rather knowledge challenged on the subject of tobacco growing and harvesting, I learned a lot. The video was very interesting. It's always nice to see an 1850's home and the furnishings. Our guide took us to the tobacco factory on the",
          "we had a group of 10 and varied ages. You can really learn a great deal about the growing, processing and selling of tobacco. The Homestead itself is interesting to see but if you only have time to tour the Museum, then it is worth the visit. It is free but donations are",

          "This was a very interesting history lesson. The Duke's were master marketers and visionaries in how to create a monopoly to make millions. The museum has a lot of old items on display, including TV ads banned for over 40 years. The tour guides could do a little more studying",
          "Duke Homestead shows the visitor how tobacco was grown, processed and made ready for market (not an easy process). It is well maintained and a nicely done museum. Worth a visit.",
          "From small farm *which it was, the original Duke family farm* to giant monopoly (busted up by Teddy Roosevelt about 100 years ago) to a slow decline, but its recycled buildings are vital parts of Durham today. Excellent history and interpretation about tobacco farming.",

          "The movie was great, a little cheesy with some other actors. My teenage daughter objected to the sad tone taken with the demise of tobacco, but the point was how tobacco's rise and fall led to the rise of Durham, and fall unless an alternative was found (medicine, they say).",
          "We go whenever we have out of town visitors. Very interesting and kid friendly. The guides we've gotten have been great and gear tours to the group. Many special programs during the year. Free.",
          "There is an interesting musuem, which is free of charge, that is worth visiting. One starts with a good, educational, film on the growth of the tobacco industry. Outside, there was a very old home, which we found to be locked, and a number of small buildings used in tobacco",

          "I really enjoyed Duke Homestead just for a chance to step back in time and see what it was like so long ago. They still grow and dry tobacco here using the same methods. We went during the Summer Children's Festival and lots of local merchants were selling their wares, and there",

        "wiki": "Durham (/\u02c8d\u028cr\u0259m/) is a city in and the county seat of Durham County in the U.S. state of North Carolina. Small portions of the city limits extend into Orange County and Wake County.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population to be 278,993 as of July 1, 2019, making it the 4th-most populous city in North Carolina, and the 79th-most populous city in the United States. The city is located in the east-central part of the Piedmont region along the Eno River. Durham is the core of the four-county Durham-Chapel Hill Metropolitan Area, which has a population of 542,710 as of U.S. Census 2014 Population Estimates. The Office of Management and Budget also includes Durham as a part of the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area, commonly known as the Research Triangle, which has a population of 2,037,430 as of U.S. Census 2014 Population Estimates.A railway depot was established on land donated by Bartlett S. Durham in 1849, the namesake of the city. Following the American Civil War, the community of Durham Station expanded rapidly, in part due to the tobacco industry. The town was incorporated by act of the North Carolina General Assembly, in April 1869. The establishment of Durham County was ratified by the General Assembly 12 years later, in 1881. It became known as the founding place and headquarters of the American Tobacco Company. Textile and electric power industries also played an important role. While these industries have declined, Durham underwent revitalization and population growth to become an educational, medical, and research centre.Durham is home to several recognized institutions of higher education, most notably Duke University and North Carolina Central University. Durham is also a national leader in health-related activities, which are focused on the Duke University Hospital and many private companies. Duke and its Duke University Health System, in fact, are the largest employers in the city. North Carolina Central University is a historically black university that is part of the University of North Carolina system. Together, the two universities make Durham one of the vertices of the Research Triangle area; central to this is the Research Triangle Park south of Durham, which encompasses an area of 11 square miles and is devoted to research facilities.\nOn the Duke University campus are the neo-Gothic Duke Chapel and the Nasher Museum of Art. Other notable sites in the city include the Museum of Life and Science, Durham Performing Arts Center, Carolina Theatre, and Duke Homestead and Tobacco Factory. Bennett Place commemorates the location where Joseph E. Johnston surrendered to William T. Sherman in the American Civil War. The city is served, along with Raleigh, by Raleigh\u2013Durham International Airport.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-establishment ===\nThe Eno and the Occoneechi, related to the Sioux and the Shakori, lived and farmed in the area which became Durham. They may have established a village named Adshusheer on the site. The Great Indian Trading Path has been traced through Durham, and Native Americans helped to mold the area by establishing settlements and commercial transportation routes.\nIn 1701, Durham's beauty was chronicled by the English explorer John Lawson, who called the area \"the flower of the Carolinas.\" During the mid-1700s, Scots, Irish, and English colonists settled on land granted to George Carteret by King Charles I (for whom the Carolinas are named). Early settlers built gristmills, such as West Point, and worked the land.\nPrior to the American Revolution, frontiersmen in what is now Durham were involved in the Regulator movement. According to legend, Loyalist militia cut Cornwallis Road through this area in 1771 to quell the rebellion. Later, William Johnston, a local shopkeeper and farmer, made Revolutionaries' munitions, served in the Provincial Capital Congress in 1775, and helped underwrite Daniel Boone's westward explorations.\nLarge plantations, Hardscrabble, Cameron, Lipscomb, and Leigh among them, were established in the antebellum period. By 1860, Stagville Plantation lay at the center of one of the largest plantation holdings in the South. African slaves were brought to labor on these farms and plantations, and slave quarters became the hearth of distinctively Southern cultural traditions involving crafts, social relations, life rituals, music, and dance. There were free African-Americans in the area as well, including several who fought in the Revolutionary War.\n\n\n=== Antebellum and Civil War ===\nPrior to the arrival of the railroad, the area now known as Durham was the eastern part of present-day Orange County and was almost entirely agricultural, with a few businesses catering to travelers (particularly livestock drivers) along the Hillsborough Road. This road, eventually followed by US Route 70, was the major east\u2013west route in North Carolina from colonial times until the construction of interstate highways. Steady population growth and an intersection with the road connecting Roxboro and Fayetteville made the area near this site suitable for a US Post Office. Roxboro, Fayetteville and Hillsborough Roads remain major thoroughfares in Durham, although they no longer exactly follow their early 19th century rights-of-way.Durham's location is a result of the needs of the 19th century railroad industry. The wood-burning steam locomotives of the time had to stop frequently for wood and water and the new North Carolina Railroad needed a depot between the settled towns of Raleigh and Hillsborough. The residents of what is now downtown Durham thought their businesses catering to livestock drivers had a better future than a new-fangled nonsense like a railroad and refused to sell or lease land for a depot. In 1849, a North Carolina Railroad depot was established on a four-acre tract of land donated by Dr. Bartlett S. Durham; the station was named after him in recognition of his gift. A U.S. post office was established there on April 26, 1853, now recognized as the city's official birthday.Durham Station, as it was known for its first 20 years, was a depot for the occasional passenger or express package until early April 1865, when the Federal Army commanded by Major General William T. Sherman occupied the nearby state capital of Raleigh during the American Civil War. The last formidable Confederate Army in the South, commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, was headquartered in Greensboro 50 miles (80 km) to the west. After the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee at Appomattox, Virginia on April 9, 1865, Gen. Johnston sought surrender terms, which were negotiated on April 17, 18 and 26 at Bennett Place, the small farm of James and Nancy Bennett, located halfway between the army's lines about 3 miles (4.8 km) west of Durham Station.\nAs both armies passed through Durham, Hillsborough, and surrounding Piedmont communities, they enjoyed the mild flavor of the area's Brightleaf Tobacco, which was considered more pleasant to smoke or chew than was available back home after the war. Some began sending letters to Durham to get more.\n\n\n=== Reconstruction and the rise of Durham tobacco ===\n\nThe community of Durham Station grew slowly before the Civil War, but expanded rapidly following the war. Much of this growth attributed to the establishment of a thriving tobacco industry. Veterans returned home after the war with an interest in acquiring more of the tobacco they had sampled in North Carolina. Numerous orders were mailed to John Ruffin Green's tobacco company requesting more of the Durham tobacco. W.T. Blackwell partnered with Green and renamed the company as the \"Bull Durham Tobacco Factory\". The name \"Bull Durham\" is said to have been taken from the bull on the British Colman's Mustard, which Mr. Blackwell mistakenly believed was manufactured in Durham, England. Mustard known as Durham Mustard was originally produced in Durham, England, by Mrs Clements and later by Ainsley during the eighteenth century. However, production of the original Durham Mustard has now been passed into the hands of Colman's of Norwich, England.\n\n\n=== Incorporation ===\nAs Durham Station's population rapidly increased, the station became a town and was incorporated by act of the North Carolina General Assembly, on April 10, 1869. It was named for the man who provided the land on which the station was built, Dr. Bartlett Durham. At the time of its incorporation by the General Assembly, Durham was located in Orange County. The increase in business activity, land transfers etc., made the day long trip back and forth to the county seat in Hillsborough untenable, so twelve years later, on April 17, 1881, a bill for the establishment of Durham County was ratified by the General Assembly, having been introduced by Caleb B.Green, creating Durham County from the eastern portion of Orange County and the western portion of Wake County. In 1911, parts of Cedar Fork Township of Wake County was transferred to Durham County and became Carr Township.\n\n\n=== Early growth (1900\u20131970) ===\n\nThe rapid growth and prosperity of the Bull Durham Tobacco Company, and Washington Duke's W. Duke & Sons Tobacco Company, resulted in the rapid growth of the city of Durham. Washington Duke was a good businessman, but his sons were brilliant and established what amounted to a monopoly of the smoking and chewing tobacco business in the United States by 1900. In the early 1910s, the Federal Government forced a breakup of the Duke's business under the antitrust laws. The Dukes retained what became known as American Tobacco, a major corporation in its own right, with manufacturing based in Durham. American Tobacco's ubiquitous advertisements on radio shows beginning in the 1930s and television shows up to 1970 was the nation's image of Durham until Duke University supplanted it in the late 20th century.\nPrevented from further investment in the tobacco industry, the Dukes turned to the then new industry of electric power generation, which they had been investing in since the early 1890s. Duke Power (now Duke Energy) brought in electricity from hydroelectric dams in the western mountains of North Carolina through the newly invented technology of high voltage power lines. At this time (1910\u20131920), the few towns and cities in North Carolina that had electricity depended on local \"powerhouses\". These were large, noisy, and smoky coal-fired plants located next to the railroad tracks. Duke Power quickly took over the electricity franchises in these towns and then electrified all the other towns of central and western North Carolina, making even more money than they ever made from tobacco. Duke Power also had a significant business in local franchises for public transit (buses and trolleys) before local government took over this responsibility in the mid- to late 20th century. Duke Power ran Durham's public bus system (now the Durham Area Transit Authority) until 1991.\nThe success of the tobacco industry in the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged the then-growing textile industry to locate just outside Durham. The early electrification of Durham was also a large incentive. Drawing a labor force from the economic demise of single family farms in the region at the time, these textile mills doubled the population of Durham. These areas were known as East Durham and West Durham until they were eventually annexed by the City of Durham.\n\nMuch of the early city architecture, both commercial and residential, dates from the period of 1890\u20131930. Durham recorded its worst fire in history on March 23, 1914. The multimillion-dollar blaze destroyed a large portion of the downtown business district. The fire department's water source failed during the blaze, prompting voters to establish a city-owned water system in place of the private systems that had served the city since 1887.Durham quickly developed a vibrant Black community, the center of which was an area known as Hayti, (pronounced HAY-tie), just south of the center of town, where some of the most prominent and successful black-owned businesses in the country during the early 20th century were established. These businesses \u2014 the best known of which are North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and Mechanics & Farmers Bank \u2014 were centered on Parrish St., which would come to be known as \"Black Wall Street.\" In 1910, Dr. James E. Shepard founded North Carolina Central University, the nation's first publicly supported liberal arts college for African-Americans.\nIn 1924, James Buchanan Duke established a philanthropic foundation in honor of his father Washington Duke to support Trinity College in Durham. The college changed its name to Duke University and built a large campus and hospital a mile west of Trinity College (the original site of Trinity College is now known as the Duke East Campus).Durham's manufacturing fortunes declined during the mid-20th century. Textile mills began to close during the 1930s. Competition from other tobacco companies (as well as a decrease in smoking after the 1960s) reduced revenues from Durham's tobacco industry.\nIn a far-sighted move in the late 1950s, Duke University, along with the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in Raleigh, persuaded the North Carolina Legislature to purchase a large tract of sparsely settled land in southern Durham County and create the nation's first \"science park\" for industry. Cheap land and a steady supply of trained workers from the local universities made the Research Triangle Park an enormous success which, along with the expansion resulting from the clinical and scientific advances of Duke Medical Center and Duke University, more than made up for the decline of Durham's tobacco and textile industries.\n\n\n=== Civil Rights Movement ===\n\nAs a result of its substantial African-American community, including many courageous activists, a prominent civil rights movement developed in Durham. Multiple sit-ins were held, and Martin Luther King, Jr., visited the city during the struggle for equal rights. The Durham Committee on Negro Affairs, organized in 1935 by C.C. Spaulding, Louis Austin, Conrad Pearson, and James E. Shepard, has been cited nationally for its role in fighting for Black voting rights. The committee also has used its voting strength to pursue social and economic rights for African-Americans and other ethnic groups. In 1957, Douglas E. Moore, minister of Durham's Asbury Temple Methodist Church, along with other religious and community leaders, pioneered sit-ins throughout North Carolina to protest discrimination at lunch counters that served only whites.\n\nWidely credited as the first sit-in of the Civil Rights Movement in North Carolina, on June 23, 1957, Moore and six others assembled at the church to plan the protest. The young African Americans moved over to the segregated Royal Ice Cream Parlor and took up whites-only booths. When they refused to budge, the manager called the police who charged them with trespassing. Unlike the Greensboro Four, three years later, the Royal Seven were arrested and ultimately found guilty of trespassing.\n\nThe six-month-long sit-in at a Woolworth's counter in Greensboro, NC, captured the nation's attention. Within a week, students from North Carolina College at Durham and Duke University staged a sit-in in Durham. About a week later, Martin Luther King Jr. met Moore in Durham, where King coined his famous rallying cry \"Fill up the jails,\" during a speech at White Rock Baptist Church. Advocating non-violent confrontation with segregation laws for the first time, King said, \"Let us not fear going to jail. If the officials threaten to arrest us for standing up for our rights, we must answer by saying that we are willing and prepared to fill up the jails of the South.\"\nThis community was not enough to prevent the demolition of portions of the Hayti district for the construction of the Durham Freeway during the late 1960s. The freeway construction resulted in losses to other historic neighborhoods, including Morehead Hills, West End, and West Durham. Combined with large-scale demolition using Urban Renewal funds, Durham suffered significant losses to its historic architectural base.\n\n\n=== 1970s \u2013 present ===\n\nIn 1970, the Census Bureau reported city's population as 38.8% black and 60.8% white. Durham's growth began to rekindle during the 1970s and 1980s, with the construction of multiple housing developments in the southern part of the city, nearest Research Triangle Park, and the beginnings of downtown revitalization. In 1975, the St. Joseph's Historical Foundation at the Hayti Heritage Center was incorporated to \"preserve the heritage of the old Hayti community, and to promote the understanding of and appreciation for the African American experience and African Americans' contributions to world culture.\" A new downtown baseball stadium was constructed for the Durham Bulls in 1994. The Durham Performing Arts Center now ranks in the top ten in theater ticket sales in the US according to Pollstar magazine. Many famous people have performed there including B.B. King and Willie Nelson. After the departure of the tobacco industry, large-scale renovations of the historic factories into offices, condominiums, and restaurants began to reshape downtown. While these efforts continue, the large majority of Durham's residential and retail growth since 1990 has been along the I-40 corridor in southern Durham County.Major employers in Durham are Duke University and Duke Medical Center (39,000 employees, 14,000 students), about 2 miles (3.2 km) west of the original downtown area, and companies in the Research Triangle Park (49,000 employees), about 10 miles (16 km) southeast. These centers are connected by the Durham Freeway (NC 147).\n\n\n=== Downtown revitalization ===\n\nIn recent years the city of Durham has stepped up revitalization of its downtown and undergone an economic and cultural renaissance of sorts. Partnering with developers from around the world, the city continues to promote the redevelopment of many of its former tobacco districts, projects supplemented by the earlier construction of the Durham Performing Arts Center and new Durham Bulls Athletic Park. The American Tobacco Historic District, adjacent to both the athletic park and performing arts center, is one such project, having successfully lured a number of restaurants, entertainment venues, and office space geared toward hi-tech entrepreneurs, investors, and startups. Many other companies have purchased and renovated historic buildings, such as Measurement Incorporated and Capitol Broadcasting Company.\nThe American Underground section of the American Tobacco Campus, home to successful small software firms including Red Hat, was selected by Google to host its launch of the Google Glass Road show in October 2013. The district is also slated for expansion featuring 158,000 square feet of offices, retail, residential or hotel space The Durham County Justice Center, a major addition to downtown Durham, was completed in early 2013.\nMany of the historic tobacco buildings elsewhere in the city have been converted into loft-style apartment complexes. The downtown corridor along West Main St. has seen significant redevelopment including bars, entertainment venues, art studios, and co-working spaces, in addition to shopping and dining in nearby Brightleaf Square, another former tobacco warehouse in the Bright Leaf Historic District. Other current and future projects include expansion of the open-space surrounding the American Tobacco Trail, new hotels and apartment complexes, a $6.35-million facelift of Durham City Hall, and ongoing redevelopment of the Duke University Central Campus.\nIn 2013, 21c Museum Hotels announced plans to fully renovate the Hill Building. The renovations added a contemporary art museum and upscale restaurant to the historic building. Additionally, a boutique hotel was built in this major renovation effort in downtown Durham. Skanska Construction is responsible for managing this project.In 2014, it was announced that downtown Durham would be the site of a brand new 27 story high building, tentatively named \"City Center Tower\", titled \"One City Center\" as of 2018. Along with other new buildings in downtown Durham, it was under construction in 2018. Construction has already started, and the building will be at the corner of Main St. and Corcoran St. It will be directly across from Durham's current tallest building, but once completed, will be the new tallest building in downtown Durham and the 4th largest building in the Triangle. Originally scheduled for a 2016 opening, the building was then expected to open in May 2018. This is an ambitious, $80 million project.In October 2014, a major new development, the Durham Innovation District, was announced. The development will span 15 acres and comprise over 1.7 million square feet of office, residential, and retail space.On April 10, 2019, a gas explosion rocked Kaffeinate, a coffee shop in Bright Leaf Historic District. The blast destroyed a city block and killed Kong Lee, the owner, as well as injuring 25 others.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nDurham is located in the east-central part of the Piedmont region at 35\u00b059\u203219\u2033N 78\u00b054\u203226\u2033W (35.988644, \u221278.907167).

The first two groups tend to be affiliated with Democratic party progressive activists, while the third group tends to attract Republican activists. Compared to other similarly sized Southern cities, Durham has a larger than average population of middle class African-Americans and white liberals. Working together in coalition, these two groups have dominated city and county politics since the early 1980s.\nDurham operates under a council-manager government.

Naturally, a merger of Durham City Schools (several inner city neighborhoods) and Durham County Schools in the early 1990s has not been without controversy. More recently, the Durham City Council's 2018 statement opposing militarized policing that mentioned Israel has drawn its third lawsuit [4]. In 2018, Durham appointed its first Latinx council member Javiera Caballero. Durham has had majority female county boards since the 1980s, and in 2020, Durham elected, for the first time, an all female Durham County Board of Commissioners and the first Muslim-American woman to win elected office in the history of North Carolina [5].\nFederally, Durham is split between North Carolina's 1st congressional district and North Carolina's 4th congressional district.

A new Amtrak station was built in 2011 in a former tobacco warehouse. Some of the downtown streets cross the tracks at grade level, while other intersections have grade separation. One downtown railroad underpass has attracted national media coverage, because it provides only 11 feet-8 inches of clearance, and has damaged the roofs of many trucks. As of October 26, 2019, the underpass was closed down to both automotive and train traffic in preparation for raising it to 12 feet and 4 inches, so as to provide clearance underneath to reduce large vehicle damage.National bus service is provided by Greyhound and Megabus at the Durham Transit Station in downtown Durham, which opened in 2009.

GoTriangle also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nFrom 1995, the cornerstone of GoTriangle's long-term plan was a 28-mile (45 km) rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles (11 km) to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program. Government agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.The region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Duke University also maintains its own transit system, Duke Transit operates more than 30 buses with routes throughout the campus and health system. Duke campus buses and vans have alternate schedules or do not operate during breaks and holidays.\nIn an effort to create safer roadways for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians, drivers can enroll in Durham's Pace Car Program and agree to drive the speed limit, stop at all stop signs, stop at all red lights, and stop to let pedestrians cross the street.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Born in Durham ===\n\nErnie Barnes, artist/painter\nKara Medoff Barnett, theatre producer, arts director\nBetty Davis, funk and soul singer\nBen Brantley, The New York Times theater critic\nMic'hael Brooks, NFL player\nKelly Bruno, world-record holding amputee runner and athlete; contestant on reality TV show Survivor: Nicaragua\nShirley Caesar, pastor and gospel recording artist\nRoger Lee Craig, Major League Baseball pitcher and manager\nJames Buchanan Duke, industrialist, founder of The Duke Endowment and Duke University\nThe Duffer Brothers, creators of the Netflix series Stranger Things\nRick Ferrell, Major League Baseball catcher; member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame\nJohn Wesley Fletcher, pastor\nTate Fogleman, NASCAR driver\nPenny Fuller, award-winning actress in numerous Broadway, film, and television productions\nDavid Garrard, NFL (2002\u20132013) quarterback\nDavid Gergen, advisor to presidents Ford, Reagan, and Clinton\nJohn H.

The center conducts programs in nature education and wildlife conservation.\n\n\n== Mission ==\nInspiring people to develop a positive lifelong connection with nature & encouraging active engagement in conservation. Piedmont Wildlife Center accomplishes this mission through a community oriented approach to nature education, leadership development and conservation science.\n\n\n== Facility ==\nThe Piedmont Wildlife Center was founded in 2003. The office is located at Leigh Farm Park which is an 82.8 acre city park in South Durham. The center itself is located in a log cabin at the end of the Leigh Farm road.  This is the location of their main office and outdoor raptor viewing exhibits.\n\n\n== Efforts ==\nPiedmont Wildlife Center's nature education programs reach adults, teens, and children in the Triangle Region of North Carolina. The programs feature hands on experiences with a focus on primitive skills, field natural history, nature conservation and community leadership. They are inspired by the tradition of Coyote Mentoring, established by the Eight Shields Institute.\nPiedmont Wildlife Center supports conservation projects with a goal of developing a greater understanding of the current state of bio-diversity in the greater Piedmont area in order to conserve local species and habitats.\n\n\n== Biological Inventory ==\nLeigh Farm Park (home of PWC) is a critical biological buffer area that links a chain of ecosystems across the Piedmont region, maintaining a wildlife corridor across central North Carolina and beyond. The park and the surrounding North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) area include five habitat types: bottomland hardwood forest, upland hardwood forest, pine forest, forested wetlands and fields.\nHabitat fragmentation is a significant threat to wildlife. As a means of habitat protection, Piedmont Wildlife Center (PWC), associated scientists, and volunteers are currently surveying the biodiversity of Leigh Farm Park. Past survey methods have included animal tracking, the use of trail cameras, and GPS and GIS software.\nThe goal of this ongoing inventory is to inform a more complete understanding of the current condition of diversity in the parklands\u2014this information shapes the education and outreach programs PWC organizes in support of biodiversity in the greater Piedmont area.\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Piedmont Wildlife Center website\nGuide to the Piedmont Wildlife Center Records 2003-2009",

        "wiki": "Duke Forest is a forest managed by Duke University for research, teaching, and recreation.  It is located in the edge of the Piedmont (United States) in Durham County, Orange County, and Alamance County in North Carolina.  Four of its six divisions lie within the triangle formed by Durham, Chapel Hill, and Hillsborough.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe 7,060 acres (2,860 ha) Duke Forest is made up of six divisions which are fully accessible for teaching and research.  Numerous forest types and ecosystems, soils, and previous land uses are represented on the forest.  It is a resource unparalleled by any other university for its size, accessibility, length of management, and accumulation of long-term data (since 1931).\n\nLike much of the North Carolina Piedmont, the forest was farmed for cotton.  After about a century of such management, the soils' native fertility was exhausted, and could no longer create the yields necessary to support farmers.  Then, in 1929, the Great Depression began.  Land was abandoned and secondary succession began.  Pioneer species such as loblolly pine, yellow poplar, and sweetgum quickly colonized these abandoned farm fields.  These trees now dominate much of the forest.\nSome parts are dominated by oak and hickory trees.  These correspond to old woodlots between fields.  Many of these stands were never cleared for agriculture.  Thus, these stands bear the closest resemblance to precolonial conditions.\n\n\n== Divisions ==\nDurham Division (Durham County)\nKorstian Division (Orange County)\nEdeburn (formerly 'Eno') Division (Orange County)\nBlackwood Division (Orange County)\nHillsboro Division (Orange County)\nDailey Division (Alamance County)\n\n\n== Management ==\n\nFrom inception, Duke Forest's priorities have been research and teaching.  The Forest initially supported the teaching and research activities of the newly created Duke School of Forestry. Limited areas are logged each year, providing revenue to support forest management, but also for each generation of Forestry students to study the patterns and timing of succession after different logging treatments. Activities in the forest have now broadened to include botany, zoology, soil science, geography, and many other fields, in addition to the forestry and environmental science activities of the present-day version of the Duke School of Forestry, the Nicholas School of the Environment.  The Duke University Lemur Center is located in Duke Forest, off Erwin Road.\nThe forest is visited every year by thousands of students from local schools and universities, and many other universities and organizations throughout the nation.  Research data and records are made available for use elsewhere, as well as at Duke.\n\n\n== Recreation ==\n\nThe Duke Forest has many roads and trails through some of the most scenic areas near Duke University, through woods with streams, flowers, and wildlife.  Limited public access, including biking, hiking, and horseback riding, is allowed on established forest roads as long as it does not conflict with research and teaching activities.  It also serves as home to the many runners on Duke's cross country running teams.\n\n\n== External links ==\nDuke Forest\nNicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences\nDuke University\nDuke University Lemur Center36\u00b000\u2032N 79\u00b001\u2032W",

          "Great tour. Got to see lots of lemurs. Made we want to travel to Madagascar for one of the ecotours there!",
          "I've lived in this area for 20 years and had never hear of the lemur center until about a year ago. What a great place! You do need reservations ahead of time to go, so be sure and call a few weeks in advance if you can. This was a tour of the Duke Lemur Center which is a",
          "This place was a great balance to the historical sites and museums that we saw in the Triangle area. First we learned about Madagascar (had known virtually nothing than location): size of island, varying climate zones ,and the people. Then we learned the many kinds of lemurs and",
          "We took a private tour of the grounds seeing more kinds of lemurs than we knew existed. Our guide told us many fascinating facts about the different lemurs. We got to see up close all of the lemurs, learning about their personalities. While we were extremely close, no",
          "Lemurs are the most endangered mammals, due in large part to the loss of habitat in Madagascar, with around 90% of the rainforest already having been destroyed. This facility is dedicated to the preservation and breeding of these wonderful animals, many of whom stand in very",
          "A great experience to learn more about these fun animals. The tour is very informative and you can be close to the lemurs.",
          "The Lemur center does good work. They do a good job education you about lemurs and their challenges in the wild. The tour is limited. We were only able to see 2 small areas with enclosures. We were not allowed to see any lemurs in their free range areas. In mi-October, all of",
          "I have always loved lemurs ( I'd always watch the show on BPS Zoboomafoo). But my favorite is the ring-tailed. So I was excited when I found this place! The staff were very knowledgeable about lemurs and about the specific lemurs they had at their center. It was so cool learning",
          "Lemurs! This is the largest population outside of Madagascar And these guys aren\u2019t just part of a zoo - they are the subject of important research. Reservation are a must and fill up way in advance. A variety of tours offers different focuses. So worth the time - a truly unique",
          "First visit to the Duke Lemur Center. While waiting for the tour to start, overheard our tour guide talking about wanting to rush the group thru the tour to another employee. This set me off from the get go. Our tour guide was named Lisa. The tour started with information,",
          "The guided tour was amazing and so informational. There are 10+ species of lemurs that you won't know about if you don't take the tour.",
          "We were told we had to make a reservation ahead of time, so we reserved a tour time a few weeks ahead. The tour started with a cute 5 min. movie. Then our guide took us to see several kinds of lemurs housed on the grounds. The lemurs have different colors & different",
          "Went in a private tour with our family. It was amazing. The tour guide was very nice and extremely knowledgeable. She clearly knows every lemur and cares about them. We learned a ton. What more can I say, the lemurs were very cute and entertaining. One note, if you go in the",
          "Our whole Durham trip centered on going to the Lemur center. The staff and center did not disappoint. We got to see a few of the 240 lemurs on site. Gift shop prices are reasonable. Their adopt a Lemur program is a great gift idea for that person who has everything.",
          "This can be great fun for the family - Lemurs are very unusual and suggest you call the Center to assure they are available for viewing. If so, have a great time!",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the center and had an excellent tour guide, who was very patient with the kids and their questions. However, my first impression came from the receptionist when we went in to pay. We were a party of 8, so we paid separately. Not a big",
          "This is a great place to visit, since it helos donaye to perseving the lemur speices all over Madagascar. It is pricey, so if you go, make sure you want to! The kids trips will definitely be better for smaller kids, since the normal trip explanations will fly over their heads.",
          "We visited here with family, including a niece who had worked here as a volunteer last summer. The facility is nicely kept and the guides are enthusiastic and knowledgeable about these unusual creatures. It's mostly outside, so not a good place on a scorching day, FYI.",
          "The center is interesting and we find commendable the work they are doing for the Lemurs. The facilities are clean and the Lemurs are healthy. The guides answered our questions and were very polite. However, we found the walking (more of a standing) tour overpriced (more $100/",
          "We happened to be visiting the area, and decided to check out the lemur center. In reviewing the options, we decided upon the costly walking with lemurs tour. We pre-booked the tour and came to the center a bit before the tour started. There is a small shop with Lemur shirts",
          "Visited the Lemur Center and the grandkids 2-9 were just thrilled to see them in an urban environment. While they were resting for the most part , they exhibited some curiousity and came out for a brief time. I will go back at a time when it isn't so hot and maybe they will be",
          "For my birthday, my wife adopted a lemur for me. After doing some research, we discovered they offered tours. We took the walking tour, and our Guide, Mel, was a total professional. She encouraged questions, and was very knowledgeable and informative, as was everyone else",
          "This is the best lemur facility because it is the only facility of its kind. Their mission appears to be to preserve this species forever in captivity as their habitat is being destroyed and likely will never be restored. There is no plan to attempt to breed these animals to",
          "Really enjoyed my visit here. It\u2019s pretty much a guided tour of a zoo full of lemurs. The guides provide a lot of information. You are able to get really close to the lemurs although they are in cages. You unfortunately can\u2019t hold them.",
          "A nice facility, the tour was very interesting and you learned quite a lot about the Lemurs. They had some caged areas to see a few of the various Lemur species, but it was difficult to get many good views. The cost was high for what you got to see. They had a small gift shop,",
          "I visited the DUKE LEMUR CENTER with a friend that was my roommate on a month\u2019s cruise from Cape Town to Singapore across the Indian Ocean. We hit a typhoon at sea and were unable to dock in MADAGASCAR, thus cancelling the opportunity to see the lemurs. Thanks to this amazing",
          "The walking tour was great! We saw a a lot of different lemurs. Our tour guide Faye was awesome! We got to see some of the lemurs eat breakfast. I liked how 50% of the money they made was from the tour. You got to learn and see how the lemurs live and play.",
          "Lemurs are an endangered species, and the Duke Lemur Center is the only place keeping then from becoming extinct. Their natural habitat is Madagascar, and the destruction of their forests there is creating a dire situation for their survival. This tour was a great way to spend",
          "Duke Lemur Center is a tourist attraction, but also a research institution. A lemur may define the cuteness of an animal, however, human is literally bringing lemur close to extinction... Conservation biology and ecology are the new kids in the block as to traditional biology,",
          "The lemurs are so cute - and the lemur center is not like a typical zoo - you get a tour from a scientist that studies the lemurs and knows their behavior. It's worth a stop if you can get tickets.",

          "This is a great place to see what a lemur is and how they live. The center is trying to preserve these cute animals. An hour should be more than enough time to visit",
          "They have a great collection of very endangered species. All kinds of lemurs as well as other primates. It'sa great way to spend a day with the family. Be sure to make reservations",
          "I've always been intrigued by lemurs, parodied in the cartoon movies Madagascar 1 and 2, but had not had the opportunity to see them up close until a recent visit to the Duke Lemur Center. The guides provided a wonderful interpretive tour, and a lot of information on how they",
          "The Lemurs Live tour provides a great overview of the lemurs in residence, the local research efforts, and the Center\u2019s conservation efforts in Madagascar. The tour guide was friendly and provided great information on all the lemurs. We had the opportunity to see a few lemurs",
          "If you're really a big lemur enthusiast, then this is for you. But if you just want to actually interact with the cute little creatures and take pictures, then you may be disappointed. Most of the tour is talking. By tge time you get to the cages, they are behind a glass",
          "Fun place to visit and learn. Will have to go back during the warmer months for a closer look. Highly recommended for all ages.",
          "Our guide was very well informed and good at engaging all members of the group. Kids and adults of all ages will find this interesting and fun. Because it was pretty cool out, some of the lemurs weren't outside when we went, but we still got to see quite a few. Definitely worth",
          "The Duke Lemur Center houses about 200 members of 17 species of lemurs and their biological cousins in a protected setting in the Duke Forest on the outskirts of Durham, NC. The Center provides housing for an endangered set of species, supports international conservation efforts",
          "The tour itself is comprehensive and interesting. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable about the some 200 plus lemur inhabitants. On its 80 acres, there are several outdoor enclosures that an be visited during the warmer months for the premium price of $95. The rest of the",
          "I went with a group to visit the Lemur Center. There were lots of Lemurs in the outside cage area, so we got to see a good number of the different varieties of lemurs. Didn't know there were so many different kinds. This is a good outing for both older children and adults.",
          "My family and I enjoyed the \"Behind the Scenes\" Tour at the Duke Lemur Center. We were able to get close to the lemurs, who were in their cages, because of the chilly weather, and not outside in the forest. Our two guides were very knowledgeable, and even fed some of the lemurs",
          "After years of waiting, I finally got to see the lemurs. Totally worth the wait! The tour starts with a short informative video, then a walk to see some of the lemurs in their outdoor homes. It's a little tough to get a picture of them in the enclosures, but their cuteness is",
          "We enjoyed the Walking with Lemurs tour this fall. You walk through the Lemur portion of Duke Forest with a guide and get to see a few lemurs at feeding time. This insures an up close and personal experience with these darling and funny animals. Tammy, our guide was very",
          "You must come here- the lemur variety is amazing. Tour is complete and knowledgeable tour guide. We even get to see the nocturnal lemurs (you go inside and they put on red lights so you can see them in the dark). The lemurs are so energetic and cute. Gift shop has great",
          "The Lemur Center is visitor friendly and very educational. I can't believe that I had lived in Durham for years before visiting. It is a real treat for young and old alike.",
          "We LOVED our tour of the lemur center! Our tour guide, Alivia, was absolutely wonderful. She seemed to know everything there was to know about lemurs and the center. We learned so much about these animals, like the fact that they have to come from Madagascar to be classified as",
          "It was so cool to be next to lemurs with no cages in between you. I got great photos of the mongoose lemurs and the rind tails! The caged exhibits were also fantastic! This the only place in the world to see that many lemurs ( I saw 9 different species but they have over 16",
          "The Lemur Center is great. Everyone was very knowledgeable and friendly, and they are doing some very interesting research as well as conservation projects here. I took the Walking with Lemurs tour, where our group got to accompany staff members to the free-ranging lemurs' daily",
          "You can get a guided tour, which is the best way to learn all the fascinating details about lemurs and their lives. This place has some very rare individuals in captivity, and it is working diligently to prevent extinction. Some of these animals are nocturnal, and they have a",
          "I called and left a voice mail message with my phone number about their evening tours and never received a return phone call. So, I cannot comment on the facility.",

          "It is enchanting to do the Walking with Lemurs tour and be out in the forest with free ranging lemurs of different types. We saw ring-tailed and blue-eyed black lemurs. It is so amazing to watch them jumping around in the trees. And coquerel sifakas who travel on the ground by",
          "A great afternoon activity for the whole family. We booked ahead and enjoyed our visit. Great tour leader. Did have some problems seeing all of the lemurs as it was cold outside. Would recommend spring or autumn visits when they are out in their cages more.",
          "As others have said - you must book in advance to be able to visit. We did without any issues. An interesting tour that includes a 15 minute video and then about a 60 minute tour. Only slight complaint is that our tour guide would talk while we were walking to the cages - and",
          "The best way to visit Lemur Center is to call them (919) 401 7240 and schedule a guided tour. The center houses endangered primate species in a large park. The tour is very informative. We highly recommend especially if you have children eager to learn (or if you have a child's",

          "I was on a short trip to North Carolina and was looking for something to do in the Durham area, and stumbled upon this on TripAdvisor. Going here was an excellent decision. The lemurs were so adorable, and our tour guide was hilarious and amazing. Once I learned there were",
          "They have the guided and self-guided tour options. We had enjoyed both, so it is really your preference. In the self-guided tour, you go at your own pace and there are docents at the different areas to talk about and answer questions on the lemurs. It is not a big facility, so",
          "Being this the most diverse collection of Lemurs (outside from Madagascar) this is a mandatory visit for tourists and locals. Not only you have the opportunity to meet Lemurs, but you learn about the cutting edge research that Duke is doing around them.",
          "We got to go as a prescheduled group to the Duke Lemur Center. This has been a research facility for lemurs for more than 50 years and has the world\u2019s largest and most diverse collection of lemurs outside of Madagascar. We started at the visitor center and gift shop, moved on to",
          "Outside of Mozambique, this is the only place which has 15 species of Lemurs, who live in a safe preserve; the ones on display are rotated so they aren't always caged. While there are 100 species of Lemur, this place has the most outside of Mozambique. Many are endangered --",
          "DH & I signed up for the walking with lemurs tour. We did get to the center super early which was fun as we browsed the shop and watched a short video. Our small group was taken into an enclosure and then watched the lemurs being called to their feeding. There was lots of",
          "I think I would have had a better experience if it was not raining outside. The Lemurs were all inside their cages and you don't really get to see many if you just step inside the building. I would recommend visiting if the weather is good and the lemurs can come outside of",
          "The center which houses 200+ lemurs is the largest collection of this animal outside its homeland on the island of Madagascar. Our young guide was knowledgeable and answered all questions. Was difficult to get good pictures because of the screens on the cages. When the weather",

          "This is not Disney World, it is not the NC Zoo, but it is so very interesting and so wonderful. What the people do here to preserve for all of us these interesting and amazing little animals for all of us who would otherwise never have a chance to see them. Lets say they are",
          "I doubt that there is any where else to see this variety of lemurs. There is lots to learn about these relatives of ours, and this is a good place to start.",
          "I visited the center with a group of 17 women. Our guide, Cynthia, was delightful, knowledgeable and articulate. It was a rainy day but she made the visit well worthwhile. I was impressed how well she answered our numerous questions and had extensive knowledge about the center",
          "We had a very nice visit but we did not get to see much variety for the \u201cpremiere\u201d experience. For $200, two of us went to one enclosure, saw 2 types of lemurs and the nocturnal building- very hard to see. Because it was warm, the lemurs hung around us after being brought out",
          "Need to book for guided tour of the centre. The guide was friendly and provided a very informative tour.",
          "The Lemur Center is a worthwhile experience. Unusually chilly weather unfortunately curtailed the viewing on the day of our visit, as the lemurs don\u2019t go outside (where they are more easily viewed) when the temp is below 45 degrees. Reservations must be made in advance, so",
          "We went on a cold morning in Feb. but were able to see many Lemurs playing in their indoor habitats. The guide was VERY knowledgeable. I plan to go back sometime in the warmer months as well! Such good information and a fun walk around the center.",
          "The Lemur center is neat and I enjoyed the tour. I give it three stars as it is small and though the lemurs are cute and hte tour guides knowledgeable you don't actually spend alot of time there. Well managed and well informed staff!",
          "Alana was an excellent & knowledgeable guide as my friends and I toured this interesting place. You will see a variety of lemur species; I thought the coolest ones were those that hop to get around - they hop both vertically and horizontally, they don't walk. You must book ahead",
          "We took a group of 35 homeschoolers, aged 5-13, on an enrichment tour on an absolutely beautiful day (trips go out regardless of weather, so we lucked out). The tour began with a movie about lemurs inside the gift shop, and then we broke up into two groups and walked the",
          "Yes, you must reserve. I visited this place two or three years ago with ~100 college students. The welcome is very friendly and informative. You get a video. If the outdoor temperature is under 46 degrees, the lemurs will be kept inside. If over 46 degrees, outside, and you may",
          "We had such a great time. Book a reservation in advance, and bring your camera. And please do NOT take pictures in the dark building - as the Center has posted on the door, it hurts the Lemurs eyes. We were disgusted with the number of visitors who were sneaking pictures in",
          "This is a must do family activity in when visiting the Durham area. They do a great job of education and the lemurs are amazing!",
          "The Duke Lemur Center does very good work in studying lemurs and helping the species survive. They have a nice facility as well and I could tell the animals were well cared for. The Lemurs Live tour is $12 plus tax and is a 90 minute tour that includes an introduction video. The",

          "Take the time to reserve when you know your travel dates, this is a highly popular venue. I was able to get in because I was a single & able to fill a waiting list. That said, this was an amazing place, the tour was extensive & the lemurs absolutely fascinating! Children of",
          "We did the Keeper for A Day, their priciest tour. This experience was amazing and we loved it, though it was a bit long and it was hot out in October. You start of changing into scrubs and see some of the facility. Then you prepare some meals for the Aye Aye lemurs, animals you",
          "We went as a group with a 3 year old and a 1 1/2 year old. The children enjoyed the gift shop and the video much more than the exhibit. The lady who took us around had much more information to share than we could take with the little ones. All the enclosures seemed to be",
          "Great tour of the Lemur centre with my two teenage kids. Informative and great to be able to see Lemurs free ranging it as well as in the cages. We did the one hour basic tour which was fine for us.",
          "Not your first thought when visiting Durham or Duke University but a \u2018must\u2019 stop if you have the time. More Lemurs here than any where in the world other than their native home of Madagascar. Must book in advance and at least a month in advance is recommended. Best to come",
          "I visited Duke's Lemur Center, with a tour organized by Carrboro's Park & Recreation. Although it was a somehow interesting visit, guided by a knowledgeable volunteer, I was disappointed, as the animals were caged and difficult to see through the enclosures. I couldn't take any",
          "We enjoyed our visit and the very professionally guided tour that came with it. This is a research facility so you can't roam the grounds by yourself. You have to stay with the group. Reservations suggested. One couple was having keeping their young. It engaged, so people with",
          "I went with a friend and took my 3yr old and 4yr old on the Little Lemurs tour. For about 20min or so of the 45 min tour, we sat inside the gift shop and watched a little video on lemurs. We then went outside and briefly looked at all the enclosures. My kids didn't care much",
          "Most of the year center is for private tours and don't know if I would have wished to pay for the higher fee so going during the summer for self guided was a great introduction. Young people were at every exhibit to answer questions about the animals which made for a very",
          "Since you don't often see Lemurs outside of Madagascar ( and they don't travel well) this is an ideal opportunity to learn more about these prosimian primates. They are amazing creatures and each species represented at the Center has unique characteristics. We were a family",
          "We bit the bullet and paid the $ to do the 'Walking with Lemurs' tour and are so glad we did! With a limit of 8-10 people the experience is very intimate. We went in the ringtail and sifaka enclosure and spent 90 mins observing and learning about these quirky creatures...they",
          "What a great place to see these amazing creatures outside of their native Madagascar. Take a tour that goes into their habitat. Awesome to be that close. Please read the Web site tour info.",
          "Wonderful facility with great and caring staff and many adorable lemurs. Very much worth a visit, and much better than a zoo. Lemurs are mere feet or yards away, and while they are enclosed sometimes, you can tour the free rangers and see lemurs on the ground and in the trees",
          "My daughter and I took the Walk with the Lemurs tour. It wasn't cheap but I was glad to support the DLC. We did get an up close view of the Lemurs in their natural habitat and our tour guide was very knowledgeable but not a lot of walking \"with\"the Lemurs. We went out in their",

          "Highly recommend! Make sure to call ahead for availability. 100% one of a kind, outside of Madagascar.",
          "This is the hidden gem of Durham. Amazing to see the lemurs up close, and the staff is so knowledgeable. Go early in the day as possible if you visit during the summer -- it gets HOT.",
          "This is a very special trip-- about 2-3 hours total. It's unique and you get to see a whole variety of lemurs (made 5-10 different types at least). You need to plan the trip a couple weeks in advance if you're open to any date, and a couple months in advance if you want",
          "The Center is a lemur SANCTUARY! DO NOT expect to be immersed in the lemur habitat. The folks there are quite nice and the guide we had was quite knowledgeable about lemurs. There are quite a variety of lemur species to see; HOWEVER, you only get to walk around the lemur pen",
          "The tour guide was nice and knowledgeable. The lemurs were cute, however, we were disappointed at how short the tour was. We walked around to like 5 different lemur cages and then we were done. I was kind of disappointed, with all the positive reviews and hearing others talk",

          "Incredible research facility that allows visitors in for tours. My 9y daughter and I loved the twilight tours; they answered so many questions! We were face to face with so many different types of lemurs! Incredible staff and incredible animals! We're coming back!",
          "The Duke Lemur Center is a wonderful place to visit. I particularly recommend the \"Walking with Lemurs\" tour. It is expensive at $95/pp, but well worth it at least once in a lifetime. Seeing the Sifakas dance and jump from tree to tree is spectacular. You also visit the caged",

          "I definitely recommend this, but my negative is that I felt my \"tour\" was a bit too long. First, I sat in a room waiting for my orientation film to begin. We were late starting because a couple of tour members (for my time slot) were late. The film was o.k. but too long. I",

          "The tour came highly recommended to us by a Raleigh-Durham local, and while the facility is tucked doesn't look anything like the photos on the website, I was impressed at each point of the 90-minute tour by how much I learned about efforts to protect and preserve these",

          "I just did the basic tour - I thought I would see some lemurs in the natural habitat as you see on the website. But the basic tour just takes you in some of the housing units where you see some lemurs. If you can afford it, probably the tour that takes you out in the woods to",
          "The facility was clean and had a nice flow. The trails are well kept, the tour guide was friendly and very knowledgeable. There were many different types of lemurs to see and hear. Taking pictures is difficult due to the type of cages. There is a gift shop and drinks available",
          "then you will find it surprisingly in Durham! Outside of Madagascar they have the world's largest collection of lemurs - cute critters who can be very active and engaging if not too hot outside. The tour guides make all the difference otherwise you will just whip past all the",
          "My sister insisted that we go see the Lemurs. In my mind it was some strange facility. In reality it's an open-air section of the woods that has spacious, humane cages for the Lemurs so that research can be done in order to prevent them from going extinct. I was impressed by the",

          "This was an interesting experience. We went there twice; the first time was the regular tour, \"Lemurs Live,\" which was fun (also, we had a Groupon, so it was inexpensive), but really not much more than a souped-up zoo tour. The lemurs were cute to look at, but they were in",
          "Extremely informative and the lemurs are really entertaining. Our volunteer guide is a child psychiatrist and had lots of cool things to say about Lemur behavior. Oscar the baby lemur was jumping around like a yr old kid. Sadly, the wire is so think and dark that it's almost",
          "Poorly organized and a lot of information repeated. Thought the video was better than the tour. Our guide Went on and on and on. Cut it shorter and make it more fun. The Lemur's are fun to watch get their crazins. OK visit, but once is enough.",

          "We took the Walking with Lemurs tour. It was a magical experience to be so close to these amazing animals with no barriers between us and them. Seeing them in the forest, rather than just in their enclosures, was beautiful too. The guides were very knowledgeable and took us",
          "Toured the Lemur Center yesterday. Our guide, Chris, provided us with lots of good info about why Lemurs are important and how and why they came to Duke. He patiently answere all of our questions. Don't forget to look for the Lemurs in the wild as you exit the parking lot.",

          "This is a wonderful place to learn about lemurs!!! Duke Lemur Center has the most lemurs in the world outside of Madagascar (currently they have 262 lemurs from 16 different species). The one hour guided tour is well worth the money, which is used to support the Center. We loved",

          "I've been there at least half a dozen times; almost all of them were marvelous tours. The one that wasn't was with a boring guide. Unfortunately, there's no way to predict. And -- it might not have been bad that time if I hadn't had such great guides in the past.",

The Bulls play their home games at Durham Bulls Athletic Park, situated in the downtown area of Durham, North Carolina. Durham Bulls Athletic Park is often called the \"DBAP\" or \"D-Bap\". The Bulls are the Triple-A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays. \nOriginally established in 1902 as the Durham Tobacconists and disbanded and restarted numerous times over the years, the Bulls became internationally famous following the release of the 1988 movie Bull Durham starring Kevin Costner, Tim Robbins, and Susan Sarandon.\nSince 1991, the team has been owned by the Raleigh-based Capitol Broadcasting Company. The Durham Bulls are operated by the operating entity Durham Bulls Baseball Club, Inc. which is also owned by the Capitol Broadcasting Company.\n\n\n== Team history ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1902\u20131926) ===\nThe Bulls were founded in 1902 as the Durham Tobacconists. The official date when the franchise formed was March 18. William G. Bramham, later President of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (Minor League Baseball), was the first owner. The Tobacconists took the field for the first time on April 24 in an exhibition game against Trinity College. Their first game in the North Carolina League was at Charlotte on May 5 against the Hornets, and their first home game was against the New Bern Truckers on May 12. The league, however, folded in July, not having played a full season.In December 1912, the Durham Tobacconists re-formed as the Durham Bulls in the North Carolina State League. Their first game was on April 24, 1913 at Hanes Field on the Trinity College campus (now the East Campus of Duke University). They defeated the Raleigh Capitals 7-4. On May 30, 1917, however, the North Carolina State League folded due to America's joining of the Allied Powers during World War I. The Bulls were declared league champions, even though the season was shortened to only 36 games.On October 31, 1919, the Bulls joined the Piedmont League, a minor league with clubs scattered around Virginia and North Carolina. Seven years later, in 1926, the team moved from Hanes Field to El Toro Park. The park was dedicated on July 26 by the Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who put on a show by riding a real bull, the team mascot, onto the playing field.\n\n\n=== Durham Athletic Park and the Carolina League (1932\u20131957) ===\nSix years later, in 1932, the team became affiliated with the National League's Philadelphia Phillies, the first of ten teams that the Bulls have been affiliated with. The next year, the city of Durham purchased El Toro Park, renaming it the Durham Athletic Park after the 1933 season. The Bulls were unable to operate for the 1934 and 1935 seasons due to the Great Depression. Meanwhile, a team from Wilmington, North Carolina who also played in the Piedmont League and was a Cincinnati Reds affiliate called the Wilmington Pirates relocated to Durham and was going to replace the Bulls. The Bulls franchise, however, was re-activated by having the operations of the Wilmington ball club integrated into the Bulls. The Reds then switched affiliations from the former Wilmington ball club to the Bulls and the Bulls continued as the same franchise. On the evening of June 17, 1939, the Durham Athletic Park burned to the ground hours after the Bulls defeated the Portsmouth Cubs 7-3. The groundskeeper, Walter Williams, who was asleep under the grandstand when the blaze began, was able to escape though the fire nearly killed him. Damage costs were more than $100,000. In a remarkable two-week turnaround, Durham Athletic Park was functioning again by July 2, with the old wooden grandstand replaced by concrete and steel.  Temporary bleachers were also added and seated 1,000. The crowd that day saw the Bulls beat the Charlotte Hornets 11-4.\n\nA new Durham Athletic Park was finally completed in April 1940, in time for an exhibition game between the Cincinnati Reds and Boston Red Sox, which attracted 5,574 fans. Only 1,587 turned out ten days later for the Bulls' first game of the season. On September 5, 1943, the last-place Bulls played their last Piedmont League game, beating Richmond 15-5. The following year, the Piedmont League became an all-Virginia league, and there was no baseball in Durham in 1944.\nIn 1945, a second Carolina League formed. On April 27 the reactivated Bulls played their first game in the new league, defeating the Burlington Bees 5-0. Three years later, in September 1948, Tom Wright, a former Bulls outfielder, became the first Carolina League player to make it to the majors when he debuted with the Boston Red Sox. Three years after that, the Bulls helped make history when their 5-4 loss to the Danville Leafs featured the first black player in Carolina League history, Percy Miller Jr., who played for the Leafs. It would not be until April 18, 1957 that the Bulls fielded African-American players, when third baseman Bubba Morton and pitcher Ted Richardson took the field in a loss to Greensboro. That season also saw the first Carolina League All-Star game played in Durham.\n\n\n=== Raleigh-Durham era (1967\u20131980) ===\nIn 1967, the Bulls became a New York Mets affiliate. One year later, the Bulls were renamed the Raleigh-Durham Mets. The franchise was renamed because the Bulls acquired the nearby Raleigh Pirates and merged with them. The team still maintained their affiliation with the Mets, playing half of their home games at Durham Athletic Park and half at Devereaux Meadow in Raleigh. The team switched affiliations from the Mets to the Philadelphia Phillies and were renamed the Raleigh-Durham Phillies for the 1969 season. The team hadn't been affiliated with the Phillies since the 1932 season. The Phillies abandoned the franchise and the team became independent, renaming themselves the Raleigh-Durham Triangles for the 1970 season. The team played as the Triangles from 1970\u20131971 and remained independent for both seasons. The franchise disbanded again before the 1972 season, and baseball would not return to Durham until 1980. Also, minor league baseball in Raleigh ended for good. \nFor the 1980 season, the Raleigh-Durham Triangles were reformed and renamed back to the Durham Bulls. On June 22 of that same year, the local CBS affiliate, then WTVD in Durham, broadcast the Bulls game locally, the first time that the Bulls had ever been featured on television. The team also became an affiliate of the Atlanta Braves that season and would remain so until 1998.\n\n\n=== The Bull Durham years (1988\u20131994) ===\nTeam owner Miles Wolff began pushing for a new ballpark for the Bulls in 1988 in order to attract Triple-A baseball, but stadium plans were pushed back for years. When the film Bull Durham was released in mid-1988, it led to a major resurgence of local popular interest in the team and their ballpark. Both the real Bulls and their movie counterparts played in the High-A Carolina League in the late 1980s. On August 30, 1990, a crowd of 6,202 made the Bulls the first Class-A team in history to pass the 300,000 mark in attendance for a season.The Bulls were sold to the Raleigh-based Capitol Broadcasting Company in 1991. Capitol president Jim Goodmon initially proposed building the new stadium near Raleigh-Durham International Airport, but after city leaders in Durham offered to renovate the old ballpark or help build a new stadium, the current downtown Durham site was secured. In July 1992, the Bulls unveiled their current mascot, Wool E. Bull, a moniker submitted by Durham resident Jim Vickery out of a pool of 500, inspired by the otherwise unrelated novelty song oldie, \"Wooly Bully\". The \"E\" in his name stands for \"education.\" The next June, the Bulls retired the number 18 belonging to Joe Morgan, the first hall of famer to play for the Bulls, who was a member of the 1963 club (Chipper Jones, who played for the Bulls in 1992, was the second, elected in 2018). Morgan's number remained the only one retired by the club for many years; he attended the ceremony where his number was retired. The team also retained the snorting bull sign that was used in Bull Durham and it remained at Durham Athletic Park until both team and sign left after the 1994 season.\n\n\n=== DBAP and Triple-A baseball (1995\u20132003) ===\nDurham Bulls Athletic Park opened its doors in 1995, complete with a new snorting bull sign. The 1997 season was the final one in which the Bulls were an affiliate of the Atlanta Braves and also their last year in the High-A Carolina League. In 1998, the franchise moved two levels up to Triple-A and joined the International League (IL), in part because of their popularity as the main team in Bull Durham, and also because the Triple-A leagues needed two more teams to accommodate affiliates for the Major League Baseball expansion teams Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Arizona Diamondbacks. Wolff's dream of attracting Triple-A baseball came true when the Bulls became the Triple-A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now Tampa Bay Rays), who have remained their parent club ever since. DBAP expanded its seating capacity due to the move. 1998 also saw the Bulls play their first game outside the United States when they played road games against the Ottawa Lynx (now the Lehigh Valley IronPigs), though it would be another year before they recorded their first win in Canada.\nThe Bulls' second appearance on film was in The Rookie, released in 2002. It starred Dennis Quaid as Jim Morris, a baseball pitcher who is now retired. The real Jim Morris did play for the Bulls briefly during the 1999 season and was then called up to the major leagues on September 18, 1999 at the age of 35. He made his debut against Royce Clayton of the Texas Rangers, striking him out on four pitches. Morris made four more appearances later that year.\nThe 2001 season saw the Bulls set single-game (10,916 on July 23) and full-season (505,319 set on September 1) attendance records. The Bulls celebrated their 100th anniversary season in 2002. On September 12, 2002, the Bulls won their first IL championship, defeating the Buffalo Bisons 2-0 for the Governors' Cup. In 2003, Durham became the first club in the 119-year history of the championship to sweep back-to-back final playoff series, defeating the Pawtucket Red Sox.\n\n\n=== Championships and success (2005\u20132015) ===\nAfter missing the playoffs for the 2005 and 2006 seasons, the Bulls captured the 2007 South Division title with an 80-64 regular season record. Durham defeated the Toledo Mud Hens in a three-game sweep during the first round of the playoffs, but were defeated three games to two in the Governors' Cup Final by the Richmond Braves (now Gwinnett Braves). 2007 was also the first season of Charlie Montoyo as Bulls manager, replacing Bill Evers. In 2008, with a record of 74-70 the Bulls would once again win the South Division. After defeating the Louisville Bats three games to one in the first round, the Bulls again lost the championship, this time in four games to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees.\nIn 2009, they won the division for a third consecutive season with an 83-61 record. Facing the Louisville Bats in the first round again, the Bulls were victorious, winning in five games. The third time was the charm for the Bulls in the Governors' Cup final, as they dethroned the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees in three games to win the championship, their third since joining the International League. The Bulls advanced to the Triple-A Baseball National Championship Game against the champions of the Pacific Coast League for the first time in team history, as that championship game did not exist at the time of the Bulls' previous two Governors' Cup championships. Facing the Memphis Redbirds, the Bulls would win their first class championship, scoring the winning run on a wild pitch in the bottom half of the 11th inning. Also in 2009, the Bulls retired the number 8 of Crash Davis, the main character of Bull Durham, which was their first number retirement in 16 years.\nOn August 19, 2010, the Bulls won their fourth straight division championship. Almost two weeks later, the Bulls set the Triple-A wins record winning their 84th game of the 2010 season. On August 2, 2011, the Bulls defeated the Charlotte Knights, the Chicago White Sox affiliate, 18-3 for their 6,000th win in franchise history. The team retired the number 20 of longtime general manager Bill Evers the following year. In 2013, the team won its fourth Governors' Cup title, defeating the Pawtucket Red Sox in the International League Final. The same year the number 10, belonging to former Bulls player Chipper Jones, was retired. Following a $20 million renovation to the DBAP, the Bulls hosted the 27th Triple-A All-Star Game on July 16, 2014 which saw the International League prevail 7-3 over the Pacific Coast League. Montoyo became the franchise's all-time winningest manager on July 21, earning his 614th victory to pass Evers. On August 31, 2014, the Bulls again broke their all-time paid attendance record, finishing the year with a cumulative mark of 533,033.\n\n\n=== Changes and a second championship (2015-present) ===\nBefore the 2015 season, Jared Sandberg was named the fourth manager in the team's Triple-A history, replacing Montoyo. The 2015 season saw the Bulls set both a new single-game paid attendance record on July 4, and a new single-season paid attendance record, finishing with a cumulative mark of 554,788. In 2016, the Bulls had the franchise's second-highest attendance numbers and retired Montoyo's number 25. Overall, the team had their fourth losing season since 1998 and missed the playoffs. \n2017 proved a watershed year for the Bulls, as they captured their first South Division championship since 2014 with an 86-56 record. The Bulls then won their second Triple-A National Championship, defeating the Memphis Redbirds after beating the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders for their fifth Governors' Cup title. Success continued in 2018; the team went 79-60 and won their second straight South Division championship and Governor's Cup before falling to Memphis in the National Championship.Sandberg left before the 2019 season. The Bulls hired Brady Williams as their 5th Triple-A manager. The team finished 2019 with a 75-64 record, making the playoffs as a wild card, and advanced to the Governor's Cup before losing to Columbus. After the season, Baseball America named the Bulls the most successful MiLB franchise of the 2010s.\n\n\n== Alumni ==\nNotable players to pass through the franchise include:\n\n\n=== Non-Tampa Bay Rays affiliation ===\n\nSteve Avery\nJim Bibby\nJeff Blauser\nBob Boone\nLawrence \"Crash\" Davis\nJulio Franco\nRon Gant\nChipper Jones\nAndruw Jones\nDavid Justice\nRyan Klesko\nWes Livengood\nMickey Lolich\nJavier L\u00f3pez\nGreg Luzinski\nKevin Millwood\nJoe Morgan\nBubba Morton\nAce Parker\nJohnny Pesky\nJason Schmidt\nRusty Staub\nJohnny Vander Meer\n\n\n=== Tampa Bay Rays affiliation ===\n\nThe most notable baseball player to have once played for the Bulls is Hall of Famer Joe Morgan. Morgan spent part of the 1963 season with the Bulls before earning a promotion to the Houston Colt 45s (Houston Astros). His number 18 was retired by the team on August 9, 2002, during a postgame ceremony which he attended. Danny Gans, a Las Vegas entertainer and former minor league baseball player, played Bulls' third baseman in Bull Durham. In 2012, Hideki Matsui, former New York Yankee & 2009 World Series MVP,  also played for the team.\n\n\n== Retired numbers ==\n\n\n== Season by season records ==\nNorth Carolina State League\n\n1917 \u2013 In first place (24-12) when league ceased play due to World War IPiedmont League\n\n1922 \u2013 Won second half of the season (69-58 overall) and defeated the High Point Furniture Makers in the play-off to take the title\n1924 \u2013 Won pennant with a 74-46 record\n1925 \u2013 Won first half of the season (68-58 overall) and defeated the Winston-Salem Twins in the playoff to take the title\n1926 \u2013 Won second half of the season (73-71 overall), but lost to the Greensboro Patriots in the playoff\n1929 \u2013 Won pennant with an 85-51 record\n1930 \u2013 Finished second (71-68), defeated the first-place Henderson Gamecocks in a playoff\n1936 \u2013 Finished second (79-63), lost to the first-place Norfolk Tars in the playoffs\n1939 \u2013 Finished second (75-65), lost to the Rocky Mount Red Sox in the playoffs\n1940 \u2013 Finished fourth (73-62), but defeated the Richmond Colts and Rocky Mount Red Sox to take playoff title\n1941 \u2013 Won pennant (84-53), defeated the Norfolk Tars and the Greensboro Patriots to take playoff titleCarolina League\n\n1946 \u2013 Finished third (80-62), lost to the Raleigh Capitals in the playoff finals\n1951 \u2013 Finished first (84-56), lost to the Reidsville Luckies in the first round of the playoffs\n1952 \u2013 Finished second (76-59), lost to the Reidsville Luckies in the playoff finals\n1954 \u2013 Finished fourth (70-68), lost to the Fayetteville Highlanders in the first round of the playoffs\n1955 \u2013 Finished fourth (69-69), lost to the High Point-Thomasville Hi-Toms in the first round of the playoffs\n1956 \u2013 Finished second (84-69), lost to the Danville Leafs in the first round of the playoffs\n1957 \u2013 Won first half of the season (79-61 overall) and defeated the High Point-Thomasville Hi-Toms in the playoff to take the title\n1959 \u2013 Finished third (70-60), lost to the Wilson Tobs in the first round of the playoffs\n1962 \u2013 Finished first (89-51), lost to the Kinston Eagles in the playoff finals\n1963 \u2013 Finished second in the West Division (78-65), lost to the Greensboro Yankees in the first round of the playoffs\n1965 \u2013 Finished first in the West Division (83-60), lost to the Portsmouth Tides in the playoff finals\n1967 \u2013 Finished first in the West Division (74-64), defeated the Portsmouth Tides in the playoff finals\n1968 \u2013 Finished first in the East Division (83-56), lost to the High Point-Thomasville Hi-Toms in the playoff finals\n1969 \u2013 Finished second in the East Division (79-62), defeated the Burlington Senators in the playoff finals\n1980 \u2013 Finished first in the NC Division (84-56), lost to the Peninsula Pilots in the playoff\n1982 \u2013 Finished second in the South Division (80-56), lost to the Alexandria Dukes in the playoff finals\n1989 \u2013 Finished first in the South Division (84-54), lost to the Prince William Cannons in the playoff finals\n1990 \u2013 Finished third in the South Division (71-68)\n1991 \u2013 Finished third in the South Division (79-58)\n1992 \u2013 Finished second in South Division (70-70)\n1993 \u2013 Finished third in the South Division (69-69)\n1994 \u2013 Won second half of season in the South Division (66-70 overall), lost to the Winston-Salem Warthogs in the playoffs(Note: The Bulls played as the Raleigh-Durham Mets in 1968 and the Raleigh-Durham Phillies in 1969)\nInternational League\n\nThe Bulls have won the Governors' Cup (the championship of the IL) six times, and have played in the championship series thirteen times.\n\n1998 \u2013 Lost to the Buffalo Bisons\n1999 \u2013 Lost to the Charlotte Knights\n2002 \u2013 Defeated the Buffalo Bisons\n2003 \u2013 Defeated the Pawtucket Red Sox\n2007 \u2013 South Division Champions; lost to the Richmond Braves\n2008 \u2013 South Division Champions; lost to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees\n2009 \u2013 South Division Champions; defeated the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees\nDefeated the Memphis Redbirds in the National Championship Game\n2010 \u2013 South Division Champions; lost to the Columbus Clippers\n2013 \u2013 South Division Champions; defeated the Pawtucket Red Sox\nLost to the Omaha Storm Chasers in the National Championship Game\n2014 \u2013 South Division Champions; lost to the Pawtucket Red Sox\n2017 \u2013 South Division Champions; defeated the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders\nDefeated the Memphis Redbirds in the National Championship Game\n2018 \u2013 South Division Champions; defeated the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders\nLost to the Memphis Redbirds in the National Championship Game\n2019 \u2013 Finished third in the South Division; lost to the Columbus Clippers\n\n\n== Notable former broadcasters ==\nListed below are former Bulls broadcasters who made it to the MLB.

Explorer Post 50 is a program that is similar to Explorer Post 5 which is located at NBC affiliate WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina (which is owned by the Bulls' parent company, Capitol Broadcasting). Explorer Post 50 is a youth-based television production group with students who have completed middle-school and are 14 to 20 years old. Explorer Post 50 provides all of the camera work for Durham Bulls TV on RTN, replays and \"fan cams\" on the video board in left field, and the highlights of all of the Durham Bulls home games. Explorer teaches youth how to produce a live broadcast, including graphics, replays, graphic scores aka \"Fox Box\", camera work, producing, and directing. Two students from Explorer Post 50 have been hired by ESPN, one at ESPN Regional Television and another at ESPN Master Control. Starting in the 2008 season, Explorer Post 50 hands out academic scholarships to the graduating seniors of the program who are on their way to college.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHoladay, J.

          "As a baseball fanatic I enjoy visiting minor league ballparks and Durham was no exception. We ate at Tobacco Road, a restaurant in the outfield, which is not inside the park, but you can watch the game from there. Watch out for flying balls, esp during batting practice, if you",

          "There are pay-to-park lots in the area. The stadium is nestled among office buildings. The staff was friendly and helpful--the usher actually took me to my seat. It is a well designed ballpark with good sight lines. It is a pleasant setting to watch a top level minor league",
          "We don\u2019t come often, but always find it enjoyable to visit the Durham Bulls. Wait! One time there was a special promotion of some kind and we couldn\u2019t get a parking place so we went home. Otherwise, it\u2019s made for a fun evening and parking has been easy. You don\u2019t have to",

          "You can see some almost-major league baseball in this 10,000 seat stadium in the middle of Downtown Durham. The food selection is excellent (BBQ!); the women's rooms are plentiful; parking is not free but very easy. There is so much to do (eat/drink/stroll) before or after a",
          "We attended as a company activity when staff member was leaving. With a staff consisting of all ages, this was excellent choice. And it was $1 concessions night, one of numerous themed nights throughout the season. Ballpark allows people to put names on big board of those",

          "Since we've never been to a Durham Bulls game before I went online and purchased tickets behind third base. The seats were great except for one very big drawback - it was a day game with a start time of 1:05 PM and it was a hot summer day. If you decide to attend a day game",
          "My wife and I attended a Durham Bulls game last night, as we have periodically since this park opened and even before in the old park. We've always made it an outing for food and fun. The weather was a little iffy, but the game and the entertainment between innings was",

          "Great stadium, excellent location, tough to park, lots if fun between innings, great restaurants on the way to the park. Parking is cheap but a real problem. Food at the stadium is not cheap but that is just half the problem. Hotdogs or franks at a ball park do not come in a",
          "While there was no game while we were there, the park was lovely, and the restaurants and eateries which are part of the ballpark made it seem like the ideal place to view a game!",
          "Our family regularly visits the DBAP since we only live 4 miles away. It's geared toward a family atmosphere, but the die hard fan will still enjoy it. The Bulls are always competitive, which makes for good baseball. The organization engages the community well - our daughter",
          "We went as a field trip for my daughter's class. It was a nice time but parking is ridiculous so leave early before the game to find a space. This is baseball park food and not cheap but hey, its for the kiddos, right?",
          "We have been to DBAP several times and each time we are provided a great baseball experience. From the food and atmosphere to the promotions and activities staff, everything here is done well. Excellent place to watch a game. Enjoyed our visit on Saturday to catch some ACC",
          "We visited for several games during the 2018 ACC championships. We scored some great seats in the 200 level that were well shaded at all times and had a nice breeze blowing; thanks to the oversized fans in the roof. Food and Beer selections were excellent and reasonably priced.",

          "Our family was visiting Durham (my wife had a conference at Duke) so my 5-month-old daughter and I ventured out into town for something to do. As luck would have it the Bulls were in town and had a perfectly timed 10:35am start on that Wednesday. I bought my ticket behind home",

The store is amazing. This is a great family or friends evening out. Parking is poor but pre-planning",

          "We went here while visiting Duke. This was a fun Sunday evening at a great price. I love that they serve local beers. Our $18 tickets 3 rows from first plate were great. We even got to run the bases after the game.",
          "Love the food stall which sells Italian sausages and hotdogs as what is a visit to a ballpark without indulging in hot dogs. There are condiment stations placed along the various food stall creating the ability to add your favorite toppings. There are stalls selling pizza,",

          "In baseball season, there is nothing better than to take in a game at the Durham Bulls Athletic Park. I am aware that my historical information may be faulty, but to me this is the cradle of baseball in the USA. This is the set of the Bull Durham film, after all. Did you know",
          "Small means good views from anywhere and a cozier atmosphere. Food options have lines that take way too long but overall a nice experience.",
          "We love seeing baseball games at the DBAP. It is just off 147 so it is easy to get to and there is a lot of pay parking. The place has lots of great restaurants around it and inside it. All of the seats are good views, but we like to get the ones that are covered when we can.",

          "Hint: pair this trip with dinner beforehand at Tobacco Road for an awesome time! My family really enjoys games at the park, but be prepared to pay. Almost everything in the park costs extra, even the kids playing zone. This a unique ballpark with a \u201cblue monster\u201d wall in left",
          "I didn't go to a game, but went to a meeting of the Durham Rotary Club at the park. The club meets in a lovely room overlooking home plate and it is a great venue. The lunch was catered, but I don't know by whom. It was a delicious buffet meal. The room has everything a meeting",
          "My daughter works for the Bulls. Great organization! My son, his friend and his friends mom and I had a blast at the game we attended. Can't wait until next season.",
          "It's a fairly typical baseball stadium, but with the advantage of being very family friendly (safe) and clean. Don't try to get a beer while interesting parts of the games are happening, because a large beer selection at some stands slows down the whole process.",

          "You don't have to like baseball to enjoy the DBAP. This is Durham's backyard -- where everybody goes to hang out, and eat funnel cakes, and run into old friends. There is a great play area for kids, and between innings there are kid-centered activities and regular antics from",

          "Went to the Bulls game with my cousin. Very nice ballpark (just like Camden Yards in Baltimore but without the upper deck).. Reasonably priced, good quality AAA baseball. Parking was iffy. No real parking dedicated to the ballpark. Overall a very positive experience.",
          "In fairness, I was not here for a ballgame. I was with an out of town business group. We met and had lunch in the premium suite area overlooking the stadium from above home plate. The lunch for 130 was catered by the Bulls. Very good. Look forward to coming to a game.",
          "I've come here for a couple Bulls games before. I have no complaints about this place. There are many options for food and drinks and the prices aren't as high as they could he at some other event venues. Overall a great time with family, friends or even on a date!",

          "We had such a fun time at the Bulls game! Friendly staff, great atmosphere and the team is good too. Fun to see a win and the celebration after. They have a great Bulls gear store with various price levels. We bought hats and shirts too. We'll definitely go back on our next",
          "Relive Bull Durham just by sitting in the stands and gazing out to the field. This historic baseball park was built in 1926 and still in use. It's been upgraded with accessible seating. If you're a baseball fan and passing through Durham, this site is a must see!",

          "We decided to take a client to the game and had no trouble finding a block of tickets for a weeknight game. The park is clean and is easily accessible in the downtown area of Durham. There are also nice places to eat within walking distance to the park. The area is also safe",
          "Enjoyed the game- lots of places to eat surround the park. We're glad we ate before we went in as concession stands ran out of lots of items- probably due to being near end of season. Stadium is easy to navigate and visibility of field was good. Kids loved the bull and that",

          "Went to two Durham Bulls games within a couple of weeks of each other. Wonderful Triple-A baseball. Team is fun to watch, and the stadium is the best minor league park I've ever been in. The field dimensions and inside look are patterned after Fenway Park in Boston, though the",
          "This is a nice ball park. Traffic near and around the park can be a little crazy. If you are disabled( in a wheelchair) there are elevators to get you to the the seats at top. I would suggest planning ahead for seat selection. Also you may need to ask where elevators are as they",

          "I wish the game had been more exciting. The Bulls didn't make one run. Oh well. The parking was close and reasonably priced. Will Call was easy to find. The food selection was about what you'd expect at a sports venue: burgers, hotdogs, wings, bbq, pizza. Enjoyed Woolie Bulls",
          "I coordinated a Father's Day outing for family to the game. Ordering tickets was easy as was getting to our seats for the game. My one disappointment was that the concession stand I visited said they had veggie hotdogs but they did not actually have any.",
          "This is truly one of Durhams most popular spots. Bring the kids and enjoy a great evening with a good group of folks. Food is nice and won't cost you the moon. And yes enjoy a cold beer with your buddies. Clean, fun, easy access, and folks working there want you to enjoy",
          "My infant son is special needs and we were sitting in the handicap section due to his wheel chair and it was warm. He started to have a seizure and a lady employee called for help on her radio and employees came running to help. We were rushed to a cooler area while ambulance",

          "This is our first visit to the area and would thoroughly recommend it. It was great entertainment (we were not bothered about who won, just the enjoyment of the game). As Brits we could follow the rules as it is slightly akin to rounders (I am sure the team would not agree).",

          "I would have to agree with Dan S. who said this is the best minor league ballpark. It's not the fanciest, though it is relatively new and has the modern amenities. It just has great sign lines, a lot of covered seating,and great atmosphere. And the snorting smoking bull sign",
          "My son and I had so much fun at the Bulls Baseball game! It was so hot and humid but the crowd was really into the game and the atmosphere was electric. If you are a baseball fan you definitely need to take in a game while you are in town.",

          "The Bulls might be the most recognizable name in minor league baseball so they have a lot to live up to and the DBAP does. We've come here for years with our children and always make sure to take in at least one game each summer. The ballpark is really great -- nicely designed",

          "We attended the Durham Bulls game on July fourth. The Bulls lost the game, but we had a great time as usual at the ball park. This is a super place to take kids if you don't worry about all the junk they might want to eat.",

          "OK, if you like perfection in athletics, you'll probably prefer MLB. But I go to watch the future of baseball, for fun, and for value. You get all three at DBAP. And to boot, tickets are available, the seats are good, and you don't have to battle huge crowds to park and to",
          "This is a beautiful ballpark with ample parking to accommodate it's location in downtown Durham. The facility is clean and family friendly. Lot's of restaurants around as well if you want a sit down meal before the game. The food in the ballpark looked like the typical menu",

          "Been to a couple of generations of this park. The sight lines are better than previous and the dedication to fun makes this a good place to bring kids. As an adult baseball fan, I wish the seats were closer to the action and I could really hear the action. I have no problems",

          "Not a die hard baseball fan, but had the opportunity to see Kevin Costner perform there for a 4th of July... it's a fun evening for the family. Plenty of other activities for the kids if their attention span fades. As opposed to some places that are sponsored and promote only mainstream beer, this stadium includes some microbrews.",

The bulls won, and we had delicious food and sat through a rainstorm! Plus, we got captured on the large screen out near centerfield! This is a must visit place for children and adults alike!",

          "One of the nicest MiLB stadiums I've ever been to. The facility is relatively new and super clean. The fans are great, and are really happy to be there. Everything was priced pretty reasonably which is something of a surprise considering the industry. 20% off on gear can't be beat!",
          "A great place to enjoy an evening at the ballpark. It is comparable (and in some instances better) than going to a major league game. It is reasonably priced and there is plenty for kids to do if they aren't into the game. It's a great place for the family to enjoy an evening together",

There are plenty of breweries, restaurants and places nearby to walk after the game as well, making this a great night out.",
          "The service was great and the atmosphere was wonderful.",
          "GREAT PLACE FOR A BALL GAME.",
          "Great place to watch a baseball game. We were able to sit in the shade on the firstbase side. Go on thursday night for reduced concession prices. And fridays for fireworks. There is something for all ages with the playground area in right \u2026",
          "We always love going for games. The food of course over prices but not as bad as I expected. The play area is my concern. The ticket prices are high for what they have and the tiny baby play area that is the only free play structure is \u2026",

          "Beautiful stadium, great walking area, clean!",
          "Great views, concessions and pricing.\nWhy four stars? Water fountains were tough to find and I'm not sure if there was one in the upper level. \n(Non star rating factor: The atmosphere was a little flat compared to a few other MiLB parks I've visited, could have also been the night as the Bulls were shut out with only three hits.)",
          "Very well put together.",
          "Hit the bull, win a suit! Wooly Bull , pretty sure it was his dad you had to hit to win that suit.",
          "If you're from Durham or live in Durham, you have to go to at least 1 Bulls game! It's a great atmosphere, the food is good, the beer is good, oh and there's baseball. They have a lot of theme nights, like Star Wars, Stranger Things, and \u2026",

          "My first ever Durham Bulls game and in the sun which is about to set",
          "Good time with great friends. It was very warm though it would be nice if they could do things to help people cool down. A bottle of water should not be $4.00 that made a nice time frustrating.",
          "This was DBYAL's 'Field of Dreams' night and the kids and parents had a blast!  They went out on the field with the team and chased the bull.  They have a variety of food, ice cream, drinks to choose from.  We will remember the hospitality and love that was shown by the team and staff.",

          "I've been attending games here for almost 20 years now.  In the past, when I was single, it was a ton of fun.  Now, with a family, it's the same amount of fun!  It's a good mix of sport and entertainment.  The experience itself is modern \u2026",
          "Loved the atmosphere and the game will definitely see another!!",

          "Durham Bulls baseball games are great family fun! No place where you can get this high level of play for like 10 bucks a person. Great seats and always great food and Beer.",
          "Great place to watch a game! Prices aren't terrible starting at $9.75. If it's a sunny day go ahead and pay the price difference of $5.00 and get in the shade. They have plenty of parking decks around.",
          "Always a good game to see.  You can meet a lot of new prospects that later you see on TV.  Wool E. Bull mascot is a great entertainment for everyone.  Secure entries and plenty of parking places around",
          "The concert is Lit. North Carolina is the move",
          "Have always had a good experience over the years and the reason I gave it a 4 this time is because they hyped their food app FANFOOD to download so you can order from your seat and pick-up when ready and the app was only good for the Hot \u2026",

          "Good fun for the whole family",
          "Very quaint ballpark without a bad seat in the house. It was the first time I have ever had pork BBQ nachos. The grounds mix the modern with the stories pastbof the Durham Bulls. There is lots of nearby parking, and the American Tobacco campus offers more to do both before and after the game.",

          "Another great game. As usual the food options in the park were expensive and dirty. Never did find a public restroom with running hot or warm water. Made me wonder how any of the stadium employees cleaned their hands. Hummmm?",
          "Great ballpark in \u2665\ufe0f of downtown Durham. Not the ballpark featured in the movie Bull Durham which is a bit further north of this one.",
          "Love the park! Great venue for baseball!",
          "Classic American ballpark experience. Lots of food options and local traditions. The games are great for kids. Ticket pricing is very reasonable. You should spend the extra few bucks for baseline or behind the plate seats for the shade, as \u2026",
          "Great ballpark with one of the best minor league teams there is. Tickets are cheap and vendors are plentiful: there are tacos, BBQ, popsicles, bottomless popcorn. Minor league baseball at its finest and one of the cutest mascots, Wool E. Bull! Also, the movie Bull Durham has brought this team some added celebrity status.",
          "We weren't able to attend a game here, but the park looks very nice. We are a a bar overlooking the field.",
          "I had a really great time here.  There was a pretty good variety of food, that was very tasty.  The game itself was pretty good.  In between most innings there was also some kind of entertainment that was pretty entertaining.  At the end of \u2026",
          "Great family night out",
          "Best place in the area to catch a baseball game, without question.  Recently renovated, family-friendly, great on weekends and weekdays alike.  Added an in-house brewery last year.  Tickets are reasonably priced - best bet is a game with fireworks on the weekend.  Adjacent to American Tobacco and the DPAC.",
          "DBAP is a great minor league park.  There isn't a bad seat in the house, the food options are plentiful and serve a diverse collection of palates, and there's plenty of beer options for those who think a game isn't complete without some \u2026",
          "Great views, great food and affordable pricing for America\u2019s favorite past time. My dad and I enjoy a game every time he is in town and he quite enjoys it as well. Days the $1 section is open, go for it! Not a bad seat anywhere in this ballpark.",

          "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE GAME!!",
          "Loved my first Bulls game experience! I went on a Thursday night when they have $1 concessions (limited to hot dogs, popcorn, & soda) but I loved not breaking the bank to have a ballpark meal. The selection of local beers was awesome too. Stadium was clean and very nice. Can't wait to come back again and again.",
          "One of the premiere ball parks in the country. It has such a great atmosphere from the aesthetics to the fans. The only issue I have is the hour and a half, usually 45 minutes both ways, with the traffic and parking around the stadium.",
          "I have been coming here since I was a little kid and every year I come here, the experience brings enjoyment especially watching Wool E. Bull shoots t-shirts in the stand and cruise around the field in his little car!",
          "Honestly this is a five star venue. I'm giving it only 1 star because of three  things. When I went it was my first visit to a baseball park and I am not a fan of baseball.\n\nThe second and most important reason is that I was seated front \u2026",

          "Great place to catch a game. Would much rather sit here with excellent views than behind a pole at Fenway with an occluded view that costs 10x as much. The fireworks at the end are phenomenal.",
          "A wonderful, family friendly, facility and event. The staff are fantastic:  friendly, enthusiastic, helpful, knowledgeable. A Durham treasure. Our 3 year old grandaughter had a wonderful time. She loves Wool E Bull!!",
          "I love the ballpark- it is clean, the fans are well-mannered, and you don't see a bunch of drunks as I have seen in other venues.  This is a great outing for a family, and the emcee should get a raise - a big one!  The Bulls are my favorite team, so I am a bit prejudiced in my enjoyment of a Bulls home game.  Great fun!",
          "Had a blast at the Durham bulls game. Great location and facility. We decided to take the Amtrak from Cary to Durham and it's easily walkable through the ATC.",
          "Very nice what a great time!",
          "The park setting is nothing short of perfect. I just wish the park ushers would do more to ensure that people stay seated during the games. Many \"fans,\"  oblivious that they are blocking the view for others, just stand around and forget they are at a baseball game.",
          "A beautiful ball park!",
          "One of the best minor league venues in all of MiLB to be totally honest. Lots of choices for food and beverage, very cheap tickets, and they do a lot to keep the crowd engaged.  The fireworks shows are pretty impressive as well.",

          "The Bulls Stadium is awesome! It is the cleanest and nicest minor league stadium I have ever been to. Great local food and even had its own brewery. It's also right beside the American Tobacco Campus so if you are looking to grab food/drinks or just walk around a nice park, you're in a great location. ",

          "Super modern. Not crowded.",
          "I have been going to Bulls games since they were at the old park.  The DBAP is great, and improving all the time.  This year, however, I had one huge issue.  During one game, we got seats under the awning in the upper deck.  The seats were \u2026",

          "Plenty of shade. Lol",
          "Great atmosphere. Facilities are clean and plentiful. The staff is always helpful when we have questions. My family loves the fireworks on Fridays. I'd give 5 stars if they had more toddler friendly food and drinks. ",
          "Awesome ballpark and surrounding neighborhood.",
          "Best ballpark in the minor league.",
          "The park is actually a great place to just go hang out. Some tickets are \"standing room only\" which equates to paying a cover charge at a bar (and there are quite a few bars inside the park) and just spending time with friends outdoors. OH and did I mention, there's a baseball game going on?",
          "My all time favorite ball park!",

          "We went for a game and had a blast! It was inexpensive and enjoyable. I usually go to major league games and haven't had the opportunity to sit so close to the field before, so that was cool, and the intermissions were hilarious. The food was also pretty cheap, and it was quick to get in. Very nice place!",

          "Nothing quite like this iconic minor league baseball team here in the heart of downtown Durham. Sure, whenever there is a game it makes traffic a nightmare, but it\u2019s certainly a great family outing. Good luck finding parking if your \u2026",

          "Fun night out.",
          "One of the very best baseball venues outside of North Chicago.  They brew their own beers and stock the concession stands with phenomenal local eats.  Whether you're new to the area or an old Durham soul, this is the epicenter of Bull City.",

        "wiki": "Durham Bulls Athletic Park (DBAP, pronounced \"d-bap\") is a 10,000-seat ballpark in Durham, North Carolina that is home to the Durham Bulls, the Triple-A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball.  It is also home to the Duke Blue Devils and North Carolina Central Eagles college baseball teams. The $18.5-million park opened in 1995 as the successor to the Durham Athletic Park. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe ballpark was designed by HOK Sport (now Populous), who also designed Camden Yards in Baltimore, Progressive Field in Cleveland, and Coors Field in Colorado as part of the \"new\" old-stadium-like movement of the 1990s. The Bulls began playing at the DBAP in 1995 when the team played in the Class A Advanced Carolina League. In 1998, Durham moved up to the Triple-A level, causing the DBAP to be expanded to 10,000 seats. The first Triple-A game was played on April 16, 1998.\n\nA roof covers approximately 2,500 seats behind home plate and down both the first and third base lines to the end of each dugout. All seats at the DBAP are extra wide with seat backs, extra leg room and over 95% of the seats have cup holders. The stadium was designed and built so that every seat gives fans a great view of the field with an intimate ballpark feel. Durham Bulls Athletic Park is located in downtown Durham and can be accessed from the Durham Freeway. The ballpark reflects many characteristics of old-time parks and the historic downtown Durham architecture.\nFollowing a playoff game on September 6, 2007, the playing surface was named Goodmon Field, in honor of the owner of the Durham Bulls and CEO of Capitol Broadcasting.On August 30, 2011, Triple-A Baseball announced that Durham Bulls Athletic Park would be the host site of the 2012 Triple-A National Championship Game on Tuesday, September 18, 2012. The Triple-A National Championship Game pits the winner of the International League's Governors' Cup against the Pacific Coast League Champions in a one-game, winner take all championship. The Bulls were the first International League team to host this annual game. The game was projected to bring in $2.5 million just for the city of Durham with another $2 million for the adjacent cities (including Raleigh). The game itself saw Reno of the PCL win an easy 10-3 victory over Pawtuckett of the IL. \nOn June 15, 2019, the DPAP set a new paid attendance record with 12,000 attending a game versus the Scranton /Wilkes-Barre RailRiders.\n\n\n=== The Blue Monster ===\nThe ballpark's left-field fence is a 32-foot-high (9.8 m) wall, 305 feet (93 m) from home plate, known as the Blue Monster. It resembles Fenway Park's Green Monster, including a manual scoreboard. Original plans called for a wall 8 feet high, however, due to the park's dimensions conflicting with a nearby road designers shortened left field by several feet. As a result, the wall ended up being 24 feet tall. The wall reached its current height in 1998. The club introduced a furry \"Blue Monster\" mascot during the 2007 season who now shares mascot duties with \"Wool E. Bull\" and \"Lucky the Wonder Dog\".\nThe bull sign mounted atop of the Blue Monster was modeled after the bull used in the 1988 film, Bull Durham. The actual sign from the movie (which featured at the Bulls previous home, Durham Athletic Park) formerly hung in the DBAP concourse but is now in storage. Although much sturdier than the original, the new sign's limitations were revealed in violent winds that rocked the Piedmont on April 16, 2007 \u2013 the bull's head and forelegs were torn off by the storm. The damage was fixed by that weekend, but plans were made to replace the sign.\n\n\n== Renovations ==\nThe ballpark has undergone a number of renovations and enhancements since opening, with its first renovations starting only a couple of years after the park opened. Construction of a \"warehouse type\" building, Diamond View, began in 1997 and was completed during the 1998 season. Diamond View is located behind the right field seating sections and uses the same architecture as the DBAP, including the green roof, brickwork and windows. In 2002, the DBAP unveiled a new playground area in the right field section of the concourse. In the Fall of 2003, the field of the DBAP received a major face lift. After nine years of service, the top layers of grass and soil were removed and replaced with brand new top soil and Tissport\u2122 Bermuda grass. The renovation took place over several weeks and cost over $100,000.\nBefore the 2004 season, a 13' by 17' Daktronics ProStar LED video board was installed in place of the original scoreboard, giving the Bulls a major technology upgrade for the time. They were able to show instant replay and other graphics.\nFollowing the 2006 season, the DBAP underwent major renovations in the outfield, including a new left field wall complete with a new video board located above the manual scoreboard. The old video board was reshaped into a video billboard and placed in right field.\nIn 2008, with the addition of the Diamond View II building in left field, the Blue Monster pavilion opened allowing fans to watch the game atop the Blue Monster for the first time. The famous snorting bull was replaced by a new two-sided bull so that it may be viewed from Diamond View 2 and 3. The Bulls' TV Crew were also equipped with high-definition cameras and production equipment along with HD production capabilities that same year. This also complemented a new state-of-the-art BOSE sound system.\nOne year later a stairwell was added to the pavilion. This connected it to the third base concourse, making the DBAP a 360\u00b0 ballpark. For the 2010 season, the Diamond View II Building opened a new restaurant called the \"Tobacco Road Sports Cafe\". It has outdoor seating to watch the game during game days or just to enjoy a North Carolina summer evening. Outside the ballpark are four more restaurants: the Cuban Revolution, Saladelia, Tyler's Restaurant & Taproom, and Mellow Mushroom. Construction of Diamond View III began in 2012 and was completed in 2013.\nBefore the start of the 2016 season the Bulls announced additions to the park, including an updated kids play area called Playground 42. Two new message boards also were installed at the main entrance. The boards were made up from pieces of the park's former video board, which was removed due to the 2014 renovations. In 2019, three new ribbon boards were added to the outside of Diamond View II. \n\n\n=== 2014 Renovation ===\nAfter the end of the 2013 season for the Durham Bulls, major renovations to the entire stadium began and were finished by opening day of the 2014 season.  After a 20-year lease extension was signed between the Bulls and city of Durham, keeping the minor league team at the stadium through 2033, both parties agreed that improvements were much needed.  The renovations cost approximately $9 million, $6 million of which was covered by the city.  In their agreement to renovate the stadium, it was set that the city of Durham would have a maximum cap of $12 million spent on all renovations.  Anything beyond the $12 million would be covered by the Bulls, with the team having to pay a minimum of $2 million towards the total costs.\n\nThe biggest issue for fans attending games at the DBAP had been long concession lines and an overcrowded concourse with no view of the field.  To alleviate this problem, concessions were added to the upper-level concourse, which previously had none. New picnic areas were added down the third-base line and in the outfield stands. Additionally, a new club area was built that can also be used for non-Durham Bulls related events during the off-season.  The club area now had its own kitchen, separate from the regular concessions' kitchen to help improve the speed of the food service.\nThe field was completely restructured within the renovation as well. The entire field and underground plumbing was removed and updated with new plumbing, better drainage, new sod, and a new crown to ensure that the field drains properly.  This had not been done in the 18-year life of the stadium and was a much-needed part of the renovation.\nAdditionally, the stadium had new field lighting, a new ticket entrance down the third base line, and new scoreboards and video boards. TS Sports of Dallas was contracted to install three new state-of-the-art, HD displays. They include the Blue Monster primary display (25.4' (h) x 63' (w)), right field LED wall display (6.5' (h) x 327.6' (w)), and the club level fascia display (3.2' (h) x 119.8' (w)).\nThe renovations were finished before the opening pitch of the 2014 Durham Bulls season on April 3, 2014.  The quick turnaround was primarily due to Durham being the host city for the 2014 Triple-A All-Star Game.  This nationally televised game brought in visitors from across the country for a 5-day festival. Had it not been for this reason, Mike Birling, the Bulls then- general manager, stated that the renovation would have most likely been done in phases.\n\n\n== Dimensions ==\nThe original dimensions were: Left Field \u2013 305 ft (93.0 m), Left Center Field \u2013 371 ft (113.1 m), Center Field \u2013 400 ft (121.9 m), Right Center Field \u2013 373 ft (113.7 m), Right Field \u2013 327 ft (99.7 m). The power alleys are now posted as 375 ft (114.3 m) and right field as 325 ft (99.1 m).\n\n\n== Other events ==\nIn addition to hosting the Bulls, DBAP has also been host to other baseball events since its opening. These include hosting eight ACC Baseball Tournaments, hosting the Triple-A All-Star Game in 2014, and hosting the Triple-A National Championship Game in 2012. In the 2012 Triple-A National Championship Game, the Pacific Coast League's Reno Aces defeated the International League's Pawtucket Red Sox, 10\u20133. In the 2014 Triple-A All-Star Game, the International League All-Stars defeated the Pacific Coast League All-Stars, 7\u20133. Perhaps the most significant game during any of the events was an 18-inning contest between the UNC Tar Heels and the NC State Wolfpack during the 2013 ACC tournament semifinals. It set records for both the largest attendance for a college baseball game in NC with 11,392 attending, and the longest baseball game in ACC tournament history.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of NCAA Division I baseball venues\nAmerican Tobacco Historic District\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Geographic data related to Durham Bulls Athletic Park at OpenStreetMap\nOfficial Bulls web site description of the stadium\nDurham Bulls Athletic Park Views - Ball Parks of the Minor Leagues",

        "wiki": "Greensboro ( (listen); formerly Greensborough) is a city in and the county seat of Guilford County, North Carolina, United States.  It is the third-most populous city in North Carolina, the 68th-most populous city in the United States, and the largest city in the Piedmont Triad metropolitan region. At the 2010 United States Census the city population was 269,666. In 2019 the estimated population was 296,710. Three major interstate highways (Interstate 40, Interstate 85, and Interstate 73) in the Piedmont region of central North Carolina were built to intersect at this city.\nIn 1808, \"Greensborough\" (the spelling before 1895) was planned around a central courthouse square to succeed Guilford Court House as the county seat. The county courts were thus placed closer to the geographical center of the county, a location more easily reached at the time by the majority of the county's citizens, who depended on horse and foot for travel.\nIn 2003, the previous Greensboro \u2013 Winston-Salem \u2013 High Point metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was re-defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. This region was separated into the Greensboro\u2013High Point MSA and the Winston-Salem MSA. The 2010 population for the Greensboro\u2013High Point MSA was 723,801. The combined statistical area (CSA) of Greensboro\u2013Winston-Salem\u2013High Point, popularly referred to as the Piedmont Triad, had a population of 1,599,477.\nAmong Greensboro's many notable attractions, some of the most popular include the Wet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe water park, the Greensboro Science Center, the International Civil Rights Museum, the Weatherspoon Art Museum, the Greensboro Symphony, the Greensboro Ballet, Triad Stage, the Wyndham Golf Championship, the headquarters of the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Greensboro Coliseum Complex which hosts various sporting events, concerts, and other events, the Greensboro Grasshoppers of the South Atlantic Baseball League, the Carolina Dynamo of the Premier Development Soccer League, the Greensboro Swarm of the NBA G League, the Greensboro Roller Derby, and the National Folk Festival.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nAt the time of European encounter, the inhabitants of the area that became Greensboro were a Siouan-speaking people called the Saura. Other indigenous cultures had occupied this area for thousands of years, typically settling along the waterways, as did the early settlers.\nQuaker migrants from Pennsylvania, by way of Maryland, arrived at Capefair (now Greensboro) in about 1750. The new settlers began organized religious services affiliated with the Cane Creek Friends Meeting in Snow Camp in 1751. Three years later, 40 Quaker families were granted approval to establish New Garden Monthly Meeting. (The action is recorded in the minutes of the Perquimans and Little River Quarterly Meeting on May 25, 1754: \"To Friends at New Garden in Capefair\", signed by Joseph Ratliff.) The settlement grew rapidly during the next three years, adding members from as far away as Nantucket in Massachusetts. It soon became the most important Quaker community in North Carolina and mother of several other Quaker meetings that were established in the state and west of the Appalachians.After the Revolutionary War, the city of Greensboro was named for Major General Nathanael Greene, commander of the rebel American forces at the Battle of Guilford Court House on March 15, 1781. Although the Americans lost the battle, Greene's forces inflicted heavy casualties on the British Army of General Cornwallis. Following this battle, Cornwallis withdrew his troops to a British coastal base in Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\nGreensboro was established near the geographic center of Guilford County, on land that was \"an unbroken forest with thick undergrowth of huckleberry bushes, that bore a finely flavored fruit.\" Property for the future village was purchased from the Saura for $98. Three north-south streets (Greene, Elm, Davie) were laid out intersecting with three east-west streets (Gaston, Market, Sycamore). The courthouse was built at the center of the intersection of Elm and Market streets. By 1821, the town was home to 369 residents.\n\nIn the early 1840s, Greensboro was designated by the state government as one of the stops on a new railroad line, at the request of Governor John Motley Morehead, whose plantation, Blandwood, was in Greensboro. Stimulated by rail traffic and improved access to markets, the city grew substantially, soon becoming known as the \"Gate City\" due to its role as a transportation hub for the Piedmont. The railroads transported goods to and from the cotton textile mills. Many of the manufacturers developed workers' housing in mill villages near their facilities.\nTextile companies and related businesses continued into the 21st century, when most went bankrupt, reorganized, and/or merged with other companies as textile manufacturing jobs moved offshore. Greensboro is still a major center of the textile industry, with the main offices of International Textile Group (Cone, Burlington Industries), Galey & Lord, Unifi, and VF Corporation (Wrangler, Lee, The North Face, and Nautica). ITG Brands, maker of Kool, Winston and Salem brand cigarettes, is the third largest tobacco company in the United States and is headquartered in Greensboro. Rail traffic continues to be important for the city's economy, as Greensboro is a major regional freight hub. In addition, four Amtrak passenger trains stop in Greensboro daily on the main Norfolk Southern line between Washington and New Orleans by way of Atlanta.\nThough the city developed slowly, early wealth generated in the 18th and 19th centuries from cotton trade and merchandising resulted in owners' constructing several notable buildings. The earliest, later named Blandwood Mansion and Gardens, was built by a planter in 1795. Additions to this residence in 1846, designed by Alexander Jackson Davis of New York City, made the house influential as America's earliest Tuscan-style villa. It has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. Other significant plantation houses and estates were developed, including \"Dunleith\", designed by Samuel Sloan; Bellemeade; and the Bumpass-Troy House. Since the late 20th century, the latter has been adapted and operates as a private inn.\n\n\n=== Civil War and last days of the Confederacy ===\nIn the mid-19th century, many of the residents of the Piedmont and western areas of the state were Unionist, and Guilford County did not vote for secession. But, once North Carolina joined the Confederacy, some citizens joined the Confederate cause, forming such infantry units as the Guilford Grays to fight in the Civil War. From 1861 to March 1865 the city was relatively untouched by the war, although residents had to deal with the regional shortages of clothing, medicines, and other items caused by the US naval blockade of the South.\nIn the final weeks of the war, Greensboro played a unique role in the last days of the Confederate government. In April 1865 General P. G. T. Beauregard was instructed by the commanding officer of the Army of Tennessee, General Joseph E. Johnston, to prepare for a defense of the city. During this time, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and the remaining members of the Confederate cabinet had evacuated the Confederate Capital in Richmond, Virginia, and moved south to Danville, Virginia.\nWhen Union cavalry threatened Danville, Davis and his cabinet managed to escape by train and reassembled in Greensboro on April 11, 1865. While in the city, Davis and his cabinet decided to try to escape overseas in order to avoid capture by the victorious Union forces; they left Greensboro and separated. Greensboro is notable as the last place where the entire Confederate government met as a group: it is considered by some the \"final\" capital city of the Confederacy.At nearly the same time, Governor Zebulon B. Vance fled Raleigh, the capital of North Carolina, before the forces of Union General William Tecumseh Sherman swept the city. For a brief period beginning April 16, 1865, he and other officials maintained the state capital in Greensboro. Governor Vance proclaimed the North Carolina Surrender Declaration on April 28, 1865. Later, Vance surrendered to Union officials in the parlor of Blandwood Mansion. Historian Blackwell Robinson wrote, \"Greensboro witnessed not only the demise of the Confederacy but also that of the old civil government of the state.\"Once surrender negotiations were completed at Bennett Place (in present-day Durham) between General Johnston and General Sherman on April 26, 1865, Confederate soldiers in Greensboro stacked their arms and received their paroles, and headed for home.\n\n\n=== Industrialization and growth ===\n\nAfter the war, investors worked to restore the textile mills and related industry. In the 1890s, the city continued to attract attention from northern industrialists, including Moses and Caesar Cone of Baltimore, Maryland. The Cone brothers established large-scale textile plants, changing Greensboro from a village to a city within a decade. By 1900, Greensboro was considered a center of the Southern textile industry, with large-scale factories producing denim, flannel, and overalls. The resulting prosperity was expressed in the construction of notable twentieth-century civic architecture, including the Guilford County Courthouse, West Market Street United Methodist Church by S. W. Faulk, several buildings designed by Frank A. Weston, and the Julius I. Foust Building of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, designed by Orlo Epps.\nDuring the twentieth century, Greensboro continued to increase in population and wealth. Grand commercial and civic buildings, many of which still stand today, were designed by local architects Charles Hartmann and Harry Barton. Other notable industries became established in the city, including Vicks Chemical Co. (famous for over-the-counter cold remedies such as VapoRub and NyQuil), Carolina Steel Corporation, and Pomona Terra Cotta Works. During the first three decades, Greensboro grew so rapidly that there was an acute worker housing shortage. Builders set a construction goal of 80 to 100 affordable housing units per year to provide homes for workers. Greensboro's real estate was considered \"the wonder of the state\" during the 1920s. Growth continued even through the Great Depression, as Greensboro attracted an estimated 200 new families per year to its population. The city earned a reputation as a well-planned community, with a strong emphasis on education, parks, and a profitable employment base.\nIt has two major public research universities, North Carolina A&T State University, a historically black college established in the late 19th century, and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. During the height of the civil rights movement in the early 1960s, students from A&T were the major force in protests to achieve racial justice, desegregation of public facilities, and fair employment, beginning with the Greensboro Four, who sat in at the segregated lunch counter at Woolworth's in 1960 to gain service. The largest civil rights protests in North Carolina history took place in Greensboro in May and June 1963. In the 21st century, the universities are leaders in new areas of research in high tech and science, on which the city hopes to build a new economy.\nWartime and postwar prosperity brought development, and designs commissioned from nationally and internationally known architects. For instance, Walter Gropius, a leader of the German Bauhaus movement in the United States, designed a factory building in the city in 1944. Greensboro-based Ed Loewenstein designed projects throughout the region. Eduardo Catalano and George Matsumoto were hired for projects whose designs have challenged North Carolinians with modernist architectural concepts and forms.\n\n\n=== Civil rights movement ===\n\nIn 1960, the Census Bureau reported Greensboro's population as 74.0% white and 25.8% black. As in the rest of the state, most blacks were still disenfranchised under state laws, Jim Crow laws and customs were in effect, and public facilities, including schools, were racially segregated by law. This was after the US Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Facilities reserved for blacks were generally underfunded by the state and city governments, which were dominated by conservative white Democrats.\nIn the postwar period, blacks pushed in North Carolina and across the South to regain the ability to exercise their constitutional rights as citizens. College students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College (A&T), a historically black college, made Greensboro a center of protests and change. On February 1, 1960, four black college students sat down at an \"all-white\" Woolworth's lunch counter, and refused to leave after they were denied service. They had already purchased items in other parts of the store and kept their receipts. After being denied lunch service, they brought out the receipts, asking why their money was good everywhere else in the store but not at the lunch counter. Hundreds of supporters soon joined in this sit-in, which lasted several months. Such protests quickly spread across the South, ultimately leading to the desegregation of lunch counters and other facilities at Woolworth's and other chains.\nWoolworth's went out of business due to changes in 20th-century retail practices, but the original Woolworth's lunch counter and stools are still in their original location. The former Woolworth's building has been adapted as the International Civil Rights Center and Museum, which opened on February 1, 2010, the 50th anniversary of the sit-ins. (A section of the counter is on display at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. to mark the courage of the civil rights protesters.)\n\nThe white business community acceded to the desegregation of Woolworth's and made other minor concessions, but the civil rights movement had additional goals, holding protests in 1962 and 1963. In May and June 1963, the largest civil rights protest in North Carolina history took place in Greensboro. Protesters sought desegregation of public accommodations, and economic and social justice, such as hiring policies based on merit rather than race. They also worked for the overdue integration of public schools, as the US Supreme Court had ruled in 1954 that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. Each night more than 2,000 protesters marched through Greensboro's segregated central business district. William Thomas and A. Knighton Stanley, coordinators of Greensboro's local CORE chapter, invited Jesse Jackson, then an activist student at A&T, to join the protests. Jackson quickly rose to prominence as a student leader, becoming the public spokesman of the non-violent protest movement. Seeking to overwhelm city jails, as was done in protests led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Birmingham, Alabama, the protesters invited arrest by violating segregation rules of local businesses; they were charged with trespassing and other non-violent actions. College and high school students constituted most of the protesters, and at one point approximately 1,400 blacks were jailed in the city of Greensboro. The scale of protests disrupted the business community and challenged the leadership of the mayor and Governor Terry Sanford.\nFinally the city and business community responded with further desegregation of public facilities, reformed hiring policies in city government, and commitments to progress by both Greensboro's mayor and Governor Sanford. Sanford declared, \"Anyone who hasn't received this message doesn't understand human nature.\" Significant changes in race relations still came at a painfully slow pace, and the verbal commitments from white leadership in 1963 were not implemented in substantial ways.\n\n\n=== Dudley High School/A&T protests ===\n\nIn May 1969, students of James B. Dudley High School were outraged when the administration refused to let a popular candidate named Claude Barnes run for student union class president, allegedly due to his membership in Youth for the Unity of Black Society. After their appeals to the school were rejected, the students asked activists at North Carolina A&T State University for support in a protest. Protests escalated and after students at A&T had thrown rocks at police, they returned on May 21 armed with tear gas canisters, using this against the crowds. The uprising grew larger, and the governor ordered the National Guard to back up local police. After there were exchanges of gunfire, the governor ordered the National Guard into the A&T campus, in what was described at the time as \"the most massive armed assault ever made against an American university.\" The National Guard swept the college dormitories, taking hundreds of students into \"protective custody\". The demonstrations were suppressed. The disturbances were investigated by the North Carolina State Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights; its 1970 report concluded that the National Guard invasion was a reckless action as it was disproportionate to the danger posed by student protests. It criticized local community leaders for failing to respond adequately to the Dudley High School students when the issues first arose. They declared it \"a sad commentary that the only group in the community who would take the Dudley students seriously were the students at A&T State University.\"\n\n\n=== Greensboro Massacre ===\n\nWhile making progress, African Americans in Greensboro continued to suffer acts of prejudice. On November 3, 1979, members of what would become the Communist Workers Party (CWP) held an anti-Ku Klux Klan rally in the black Morningside Homes public housing project. It was covered by four local TV news stations. During the protest, two cars containing Klansmen and neo-Nazis arrived. After a confrontation, the KKK and CWP groups exchanged gunfire. Five CWP members were killed. Eleven CWP members and one Klansman were injured. Television footage of the actions was shown nationwide and around the world, and the event became known as the Greensboro Massacre. In November 1980, six KKK defendants were each acquitted in a state criminal trial by an all-white jury after a week of deliberations. Families of those killed and injured in the attack filed a civil suit against the city and police department for failure to protect the black citizens. In 1985, a jury in this case found five police officers and two other individuals liable for $350,000 in damages; the monies were to be paid to the Greensboro Justice Fund, established to advance civil rights.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 131.8 square miles (341.4 km2), of which 126.5 square miles (327.7 km2) is land and 5.3 square miles (13.7 km2), or 4.01%, is water.Greensboro is located among the rolling hills of North Carolina's Piedmont, situated midway between the state's Blue Ridge and Great Smoky Mountains to the west and the Atlantic beaches and Outer Banks to the east. The view of the city from its highest building\u2014the Lincoln Financial tower (commonly known as the Jefferson-Pilot Building after its previous owner)\u2014shows an expanse of shade trees in the city. Interstates 40, 85, and 73 intersect at the city.\n\n\n=== Downtown area ===\nDowntown Greensboro has attracted development investment in recent years with such new construction as First National Bank Field, residential construction, and offices. The Southside neighborhood downtown exemplifies central-city reinvestment. The formerly economically depressed neighborhood has been redeveloped as an award-winning neotraditional-style neighborhood featuring walkability, compact blocks and local amenities and services. Downtown Greensboro has an active nightlife with numerous nightclubs, bars and restaurants.\nThe redevelopment of the downtown was stimulated by the 2006 opening of the Elon University School of Law. The law school is credited with attracting student dollars to the downtown both day and night.\n\n\n=== Four Seasons/Coliseum area ===\n\nThe Four Seasons Town Centre is a three-story shopping mall with 1,141,000 square feet (106,000 m2) of shopping space that was developed by the Koury Corporation. Located at 410 Four Seasons Town Centre, it is adjacent to the Koury Convention Center and Sheraton Hotel. Boasting over 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of flexible meeting space, the Joseph S. Koury Convention Center is the largest convention center in the Southeast between Atlanta and Washington, D.C. The hotel has more than 1,000 rooms.The Greensboro Coliseum is located at 1921 W. Gate City Boulevard. This multi-purpose complex consists of the 22,000-seat Greensboro Coliseum, 2,400-seat War Memorial Auditorium, 300-seat Odeon Theatre, and the 167,000-square-foot (15,500 m2) Special Events Center, which includes three exhibition halls, a 4,500-seat mini-arena and eight meeting rooms. The 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) Pavilion is located adjacent. The Coliseum's website notes the complex hosts \"a broad range of activities, including athletic events, cultural arts, concerts, theater, educational activities, fairs, exhibits, and public and private events of all kinds including conventions, convocations and trade and consumer shows.\"The War Memorial Auditorium has been demolished. Also, the addition of the Greensboro Aquatic Center that host National swimming and diving events is located in this complex.\n\n\n=== Airport area ===\nIn 1998, FedEx built a $300 million mid-Atlantic air-cargo and sorting hub at Piedmont Triad International Airport, following an intensive competition for the hub among other regions of the state, as well as locations in South Carolina. The project was challenged in court based on the quality of planned noise and pollution abatements from neighborhoods near the planned hub site. The hub opened in 2009. Originally projected by FedEx to employ 750 people in its first two years of operation and eventually 1,500, local FedEx employment has been nearly the same as before the facility was constructed.In March 2015 HondaJet, with a manufacturing facility in Greensboro, announced that it had received provisional type certification (PTC) from the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This achievement indicates the FAA's approval of the HondaJet design based on certification testing, design reviews, and analyses completed to date.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nGreensboro, like much of the southeastern United States, has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), with four distinct seasons. Winters are short and generally cool, with a January daily average of 38.9 \u00b0F (3.8 \u00b0C). On average, there are 75 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and 4.3 days that fail to rise above freezing. Measurable snowfall occurs nearly every winter, and accumulates to a normal of 7.5 inches (19.1 cm), usually in January and February and occasionally December and March; the actual amount may vary considerably from winter to winter. Cold-air damming (CAD) can facilitate freezing rain, often making it a more pressing concern than snow. Summers are hot and humid, with a daily average in July of 78.5 \u00b0F (25.8 \u00b0C). There is an average 32 days per year with highs at or above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C), but, as in much of the Piedmont South, 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ readings are uncommon. Autumn is similar to spring in temperature but has fewer days of rainfall and less total rainfall. Extremes in temperature have ranged from \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 21, 1985, up to 104 \u00b0F (40 \u00b0C), on July 17, 1914.\nThunderstorms are common during the humid spring and summer months, some being severe. On April 2, 1936, at around 7:00 pm, a large, F-4 tornado cut a seven-mile (11 km) swath of destruction through southern Greensboro. 14 people were killed and 144 were injured from the tornado, which moved through part of downtown. The storm was part of an outbreak known as the 1936 Cordele-Greensboro tornado outbreak. Strong tornadoes have struck the Greensboro area since then, notably Stoneville on March 20, 1998; Clemmons and Winston-Salem on May 5, 1989; Clemmons and Greensboro on May 7, 2008; High Point on March 28, 2010; and Greensboro on April 15, 2018. \n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 269,666 people; 111,731 households; and 63,244 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,131.7 people per square mile (822.9/km2). There were 124,074 housing units at an average density of 980.8 per square mile (378.6/km2). The racial composition of the city was 48.4% White, 40.6% Black or African American, 4.0% Asian American (1.6% Vietnamese, 0.7% Indian), 0.5% Native American, 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 3.8% some other race, and 2.6% two or more races. Non-Hispanic Whites were 45.6% of the population in 2010, compared to 70.9% in 1970. People of Hispanic or Latino heritage, who may be of any race, in 2010 were 7.5% of the population (4.6% Mexican, 0.7% Puerto Rican).\n\nOf the 124,074 households in the city in 2010, 30.1% included children under the age of 18, 35.5% were headed by married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.4% were classified as non-family. Of the total households, 33.8% were composed of individuals, and 9.0% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.31 persons, and the average family size was 3.00 persons.The age distribution in 2010 was 22.7% under the age of 18, 14.5% from 18 to 24, 28.2% from 25 to 44, 23.1% from 45 to 64, and 11.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33.4 years. For every 100 females, there were 88.7 males, and for every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.6 males.For the period 2011\u201315, the estimated median annual income for a household in the city was $41,628, and the median income for a family was $53,150. Male full-time workers had a median income of $40,143 versus $34,761 for females. The per capita income for the city was $25,929. About 14.6% of families and 19.3% of the population were living below the poverty line, including 25.9% of those under age 18 and 10.5% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nIn Greensboro, 48.33% of the population is religiously affiliated. The largest religion in Greensboro is Christianity, with the most affiliates being either Baptist (11.85%) or Methodist (10.25%). The remaining Christian populations are Presbyterian (3.97%), Roman Catholic (3.71%), Pentecostal (2.61%), Episcopal (1.17%), Latter-Day Saints (1.02%), Lutheran (0.96%), and other Christian denominations (11.03%) including Greek Orthodox, Quaker, Moravian, Church of Christ, and non-denominational. After Christianity, the largest religion in Greensboro is Islam (0.82%), followed by Judaism (0.60%). Eastern religions make up the minority in Greensboro (0.34%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Greensboro economy and the surrounding Piedmont Triad area have traditionally been centered around textiles, tobacco, and furniture. Greensboro's central proximity in the state has made it a popular place for families and businesses, as well as becoming more of a logistics hub, with FedEx having regional operations based in the city.Notable companies headquartered in Greensboro include the Honda Aircraft Company, HAECO Americas, ITG Brands, Kayser-Roth, VF, Mack Trucks, Volvo Trucks of North America, Qorvo, the International Textile Group, NewBridge Bank, The Fresh Market, Atlantic Coast Conference, Cook Out, Ham's, Biscuitville, Fusion3, TIMCO, Tripps, Wrangler, Kontoor Brands and Columbia Forest Products. Greensboro is a \"center of operations\" for the insurance company Lincoln Financial Group.City leaders have been working to attract new businesses in the nanotech, high-tech, aviation and transportation/logistics sectors. The University of North Carolina at Greensboro and North Carolina A&T State University opened a joint research park, Gateway University Research Park.\n\n\n=== Largest employers ===\nAccording to the city's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are:\n\n\n=== Top industries ===\nAccording to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics:\n\n\n== Arts ==\nGreensboro is home to an active and diverse arts community.\n\nThe Carolina Theatre of Greensboro is a performing arts facility that has been a part of downtown Greensboro since 1927. Since the facility's renovation in the 1990s, the theater has served as the home of the Greensboro Ballet, the Community Theatre of Greensboro, the Livestock Players Musical Theatre, the Greensboro Youth Symphony, and a variety of other local performing arts groups.\nCity Arts showcases a variety of musical and theatrical productions by the Livestock Players, the Greensboro Children's Theatre, the Music Center, the Greensboro Concert Band, Philharmonia of Greensboro, the Choral Society of Greensboro, and the Greensboro Youth Chorus. Most of these groups participate in the city's annual OPUS Concert Series and the summer \"Music for a Sunday Evening in the Park\" series.\nThe Greensboro Mural Project contributes to the vibrancy of the city by engaging the community in a participatory arts process around social issues, allowing for people throughout the community to help paint the city together.\nThe Community Theatre of Greensboro has presented Broadway and off-Broadway plays and musicals for more than 45 years. The CTG's Studio Theatre is housed in the Greensboro Cultural Center.\nThe Eastern Music Festival brings more than 100 summer performances, from symphonic works to chamber music to recitals by professional and talented students from around the world. The event also hosts the Fringe Festival, showcasing avant-garde and nontraditional music and performances.\nElsewhere Collaborative is a living museum set inside a former thrift store on South Elm Street in downtown Greensboro. Elsewhere is an interactive, evolving environment of objects, creatives, and creations. The living museum hosts events, performances, projects, and productions that activate the 58-year collection and foster communications between creatives and participants.\nGreensboro Ballet and School of Greensboro Ballet: A traditional December production of The Nutcracker is just one of the many artistic and educational activities offered by the ballet company. The School of Greensboro Ballet is one of a relative few nonprofit ballet schools in the nation.\nThe Greensboro Cultural Center houses more than 25 visual and performing arts organizations, five art galleries, rehearsal halls, a sculpture garden, a privately operated restaurant with outdoor cafe-style seating, and an outdoor amphitheater. Art galleries include the African American Atelier, the Green Hill Center for North Carolina Art, the Greensboro Artists' League Gallery and Gift Shop, the Guilford Native American Art Gallery and the Mattye Reed African Heritage Center Satellite Gallery.\nThe Greensboro Opera Company is a highly regarded regional opera company founded in October 1981 that has experienced much growth and expansion. Beginning with the production of Verdi's La traviata featuring June Anderson (then a rising young New York City Opera soprano), the company expanded from a single fall production of a major opera in the years 1981\u201389 to the addition of Sunday matinee performances in the 1990\u201399 season when, in response to successive sold-out productions of Madame Butterfly and Carmen in 1997 and 1998, a second spring opera with two performances was added, beginning in 1999\u20132000. The company has successfully blended outside and local singers with a full orchestra, manned by members of the Greensboro Symphony, in the pit at their home at Greensboro's War Memorial Auditorium.\nThe Greensboro Symphony Orchestra, led by conductor Dmitry Sitkovetsky, has developed a strong reputation among national musical organizations, including continued exposure on National Public Radio's Performance Today.

          "Went with my wife for Kayaking fun and it was very pleasant, enjoyable, and inexpensive to do. The lake was quiet and we had it pretty much all to ourselves. But my one suggestion is that if you're not in shape skip this activity. It works the arms, shoulders, and in general",

        "wiki": "The Research Triangle, commonly referred to as simply The Triangle, is a region in the Piedmont of North Carolina in the United States, anchored by three major research universities: North Carolina State University, Duke University, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as well as the cities of Raleigh and Durham and the town of Chapel Hill. The nine-county region, officially named the Raleigh\u2013Durham\u2013Cary combined statistical area (CSA), comprises the Raleigh\u2013Cary and Durham\u2013Chapel Hill Metropolitan Statistical Areas and the Henderson Micropolitan Statistical Area.\nA 2019 Census estimate put the population at 2,079,687, making it the second largest combined statistical area in the state of North Carolina behind Charlotte CSA. The Raleigh\u2013Durham television market includes a broader 24-county area which includes Fayetteville, North Carolina, and has a population of 2,726,000 persons.The \"Triangle\" name was cemented in the public consciousness in the 1950s with the creation of Research Triangle Park, home to numerous tech companies and enterprises. Although the name is now used to refer to the geographic region, \"the Triangle\" originally referred to the universities, whose research facilities, and the educated workforce they provide, have historically served as a major attraction for businesses located in the region.Most of the Triangle is part of North Carolina's first, second, and fourth congressional districts.\nThe region is sometimes confused with The Triad, which is a North Carolina region adjacent to and directly west of the Triangle comprising Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and High Point, among other cities.\n\n\n== Counties ==\nDepending on which definition of the Research Triangle region is used, as few as three or as many as 16 counties are included as part of the region. All of these counties when included hold a population of over 2,167,000 people.\nThe three core counties of Wake, Durham and Orange are the homes of the three research universities for which the area is named.\nThe 2019 members of the Research Triangle Regional Partnership are:\n\nChatham\nDurham\nFranklin\nGranville\nJohnston\nLee\nPerson\nWake\nWarren\n\n\n=== NC Regional Councils of Governments Definition ===\nAll counties in the State of North Carolina are in one of 16 regional councils which provide programs and services to local governments.  The Triangle J Council of Governments includes Chatham, Durham, Johnston, Lee, Moore, Orange, and Wake Counties.  The northern Triangle counties of Person, Granville, Franklin, Vance and Warren are part of the Kerr-Tar Regional Council of Governments.\n\n\n=== Office of Management and Budget Definition ===\n\nAs of September 14, 2018, the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineated the Raleigh-Durham-Cary Combined Statistical Area as consisting of two metropolitan and one micropolitan statistical areas.  Those three statistical areas in turn are defined as consisting of a total of nine counties.  The MSAs and their constituent counties are:\n\nDurham-Chapel Hill Metropolitan SA\nChatham County\nDurham County\nGranville County\nOrange County\nPerson County\nHenderson Micropolitan SA\nVance County\nRaleigh-Cary Metropolitan SA\nFranklin County\nJohnston County\nWake CountyPrior to September 2018, the OMB had used the name Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area and it included several additional counties. The Dunn Micropolitan Statistical Area (Harnett County) and Sanford Micropolitan Statistical Area (Lee County) were moved to the Fayetteville-Sanford-Lumberton Combined Statistical Area, while the Oxford Micropolitan Statistical Area (Granville County) was folded into the Durham-Chapel Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Raleigh Metropolitan Statistical Area was also renamed the Raleigh-Cary Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nThe table below outlines the populations of the constituent counties of the Raleigh\u2013Durham-Cary Combined Statistical Area as of July 1, 2019.\n\n\n== Cities ==\n\nThe Triangle region, as defined for statistical purposes as the Raleigh\u2013Durham\u2013Cary CSA, comprises nine counties, although the U.S. Census Bureau divided the region into two metropolitan statistical areas and one micropolitan area in 2003. The Raleigh-Cary metropolitan area comprises Wake, Franklin, and Johnston Counties; the Durham-Chapel Hill metropolitan area comprises Durham, Orange, Chatham, Granville, and Person Counties; and the Henderson micropolitan area comprises Vance County.\nSome area television stations define the region as Raleigh\u2013Durham\u2013Fayetteville. Fayetteville is more than 50 miles (80 km) from Raleigh, but is part of the Triangle television market.\n\n\n=== 15 largest municipalities ===\n\n\n== Education ==\nPublic secondary education in the Triangle is similar to that of the majority of the state of North Carolina, in which there are county-wide school systems (the exception is Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools within Orange County but apart from Orange County Schools). Based in Cary, the Wake County Public School System, which includes the cities of Raleigh and Cary, is the largest school system in the state of North Carolina and the 15th-largest in the United States, with average daily enrollment of 159,949 as of the second month of the 2016\u201317 school year. Other larger systems in the region include Durham Public Schools (about 33,000 students) and rapidly growing Johnston County Schools (about 31,000 students).\n\n\n=== Institutions of higher education ===\n\nCampbell University\nCentral Carolina Community College\nDuke University\nDurham Technical Community College\nLouisburg College\nMeredith College\nNorth Carolina Central University\nNorth Carolina State University\nPiedmont Community College\nShaw University\nSoutheastern Baptist Theological Seminary and The College at Southeastern\nSt. Augustine's College\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nVance-Granville Community College\nWake Technical Community College\nWilliam Peace University\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== College sports ===\nWith the significant number of universities and colleges in the area and the relative absence of major league professional sports, NCAA sports are very popular, particularly those sports in which the Atlantic Coast Conference participates, most notably basketball.\nThe Duke Blue Devils (representing Duke University in Durham), NC State Wolfpack (representing North Carolina State University in Raleigh), and North Carolina Tar Heels (representing the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) are all members of the ACC. Rivalries among these schools are very strong, fueled by proximity to each other, with annual competitions in every sport. Adding to the rivalries is the large number of graduates the high schools in the region send to each of the local universities. It is very common for students at one university to know many students attending the other local universities, which increases the opportunities for \"bragging\" among the schools. The four ACC schools in the state, Duke, North Carolina, North Carolina State, and Wake Forest University (the last of which was originally located in the town of Wake Forest before moving to Winston-Salem in 1956), are referred to as Tobacco Road by sportscasters, particularly in basketball. All four teams consistently produce high-caliber teams. Each of the Triangle-based universities listed has won at least two NCAA Basketball national championships.\nThree historically black colleges, including recent Division I arrival North Carolina Central University and Division II members St. Augustine College and Shaw University also boost the popularity of college sports in the region.\nOther colleges in the Triangle that field intercollegiate teams include Campbell University, Meredith College, and William Peace University.\n\n\n=== Professional sports ===\n\nThe region has only one professional team of the four major sports, the Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL, based in Raleigh. Since moving to the Research Triangle region from Hartford, Connecticut, they have enjoyed great success, including winning a Stanley Cup. With only one top-level professional sports option, minor league sports are quite popular in the region. The Durham Bulls in downtown Durham are a AAA Minor League baseball affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays, and the Carolina Mudcats, based in Zebulon, 10 miles east of Raleigh, are the Advanced-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. In Cary, North Carolina FC plays in the second-level United Soccer League, and the North Carolina Courage began play in the National Women's Soccer League in 2017 after the owner of North Carolina FC bought the NWSL franchise rights of the Western New York Flash and relocated the NWSL franchise to the Triangle.\n\nThe area also had a team in the fledgling World League of American Football \u2013 however, the Raleigh\u2013Durham Skyhawks, coached by Roman Gabriel, did not exactly cover themselves in glory; they lost all 10 games of their inaugural (and only) season in 1991. The team folded after that, being replaced in the league by the Ohio Glory, which fared little better at 1\u20139, ultimately suffering the same fate \u2013 along with the other six teams based in North America \u2013 when the league took a two-year hiatus, returning as a six-team all-European league in 1995.\n\n\n== Commerce ==\nAnchored by leading technology firms, government and world-class universities, medical centers and schools, the area's economy has performed exceptionally well. Significant increases in employment, earnings, personal income, and retail sales are projected over the next 15 years.\nThe region's growing high-technology community includes such companies as IBM, Lenovo, SAS Institute, Cisco Systems, NetApp, Red Hat, EMC Corporation, and Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to high-tech, the region is consistently ranked in the top three in the U.S. with concentration in life science companies. Some of these companies include GlaxoSmithKline, Biogen Idec, BASF, Merck & Co., Novo Nordisk, Novozymes, and Pfizer. Research Triangle Park and North Carolina State University's Centennial Campus in Raleigh support innovation through R&D and technology transfer among the region's companies and research universities (including Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).\nThe area fared relatively well during the late-2000s recession, ranked as the strongest region in North Carolina by the Brookings Institution and among the top 40 in the country.  The change in unemployment during 2008 to 2009 was 4.6% and home prices was 2%.  The Greensboro metropolitan area was listed among the second-weakest and the Charlotte area among the middle in the country.\n\n\n=== Major employers ===\n\n\n=== Major hospitals, medical centers and medical schools ===\n\nThe Research Triangle region is served by these hospitals and medical centers:\nHospitals of the Duke University Health System\nDuke Ambulatory Surgery Center (Durham)\nDuke Children's Hospital and Health Center (Durham)\nDuke Raleigh Hospital (formerly Raleigh Community Hospital)\nDuke University Medical Center (Durham)\nDuke Regional Hospital (formerly Durham Regional Hospital)\nPerson Memorial Hospital (Roxboro)\nHospitals of the UNC Health Care system\nChatham Hospital (Siler City)\nNorth Carolina Cancer Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nNorth Carolina Children's Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nNorth Carolina Memorial Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nNorth Carolina Neurosciences Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nNorth Carolina Women's Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nRex Hospital (Raleigh)\nJohnston Medical Center (Smithfield)\nHospitals of the WakeMed system\nWakeMed Raleigh Campus (formerly Wake Memorial Hospital and Wake Medical Center)\nWakeMed Cary Hospital (formerly Western Wake Medical Center)\nOther hospitals and medical centers\nCentral Regional Hospital,(Butner)\nDurham VA Medical Center (Durham)\nFranklin Regional Medical Center (Louisburg)\nHarnett Health System (Dunn)\nBetsy Johnson Regional Hospital\nAngier Medical Services\nGood Hope Hospital\nBetsy Johnson Cancer Research Clinic\nCentral Harnett Hospital\nMedical Schools\nDuke University School of Medicine\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine\nCampbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Freeways and primary designated routes ===\n\nThe Triangle proper is served by three major interstate highways: I-40, I-85, and I-87 along with their spurs: I-440 and I-540, and seven U.S. Routes: 1, 15, 64, 70, 264, 401, and 501. US Highways 15 and 501 are multiplexed through much of the region as US 15-501. I-95 passes 30 miles east of Raleigh through Johnston County, with I-87 connecting I-95 at Rocky Mount, NC to Raleigh via the US 64\u2013264 Bypass.\nThe two interstates diverge from one another in Orange County, with I-85 heading northeast through northern Durham County toward Virginia, while I-40 travels southeast through southern Durham, through the center of the region, and serves as the primary freeway through Raleigh. The related loop freeways I-440 and I-540 are primarily located in Wake County around Raleigh. I-440 begins at the interchange of US 1 and I-40 southwest of downtown Raleigh and arcs as a multiplex with US 1 northward around downtown with the formal designation as the Cliff Benson/Raleigh Beltline (cosigned with US 1 on three-fourths of its northern route) and ends at its junction with I-40 in southeast Raleigh. I-540, sometimes known as the Raleigh Outer Loop, extends from the US 64\u2013264 Bypass to I-40 just inside Durham County, where it continues across the interstate as a state route (NC 540), prior to its becoming a toll road from the NC 54 interchange to the current terminus at NC Highway 55 near Holly Springs. I-95 serves the extreme eastern edge of the region, crossing north\u2013south through suburban Johnston County.\nU.S. Routes 1, 15, and 64 primarily serve the region as limited-access freeways or multilane highways with access roads. US 1 enters the region from the southwest as the Claude E. Pope Memorial Highway and travels through suburban Apex where it merges with US 64 and continues northeast through Cary. The two highways are codesignated for about 2 miles (3.2 km) until US 1 joins I-440 and US 64 with I-40 along the Raleigh\u2013Cary border. Capital Boulevard, which is designated US 1 for half of its route and US 401 the other is not a limited-access freeway, although it is a major thoroughfare through northeast Raleigh and into the northern downtown area.\nNorth Carolina Highway 147 is a limited-access freeway that connects I-85 with Toll Route NC 540 in northwestern Wake County. The older, toll-free portion of the four-lane route\u2014known as the Durham Freeway or the I.L. \"Buck\" Dean Expressway\u2014traverses downtown Durham and extends through Research Triangle Park to I-40. The Durham Freeway is often used as a detour or alternate route for I-40 through southwestern Durham the Chapel Hill area in cases of traffic accident, congestion or road construction delays. The tolled portion of NC 147, called the Triangle Expressway\u2014North Carolina's first modern toll road when it opened to traffic in late 2011\u2014continues past I-40 to Toll NC 540. Both Toll NC 147 and Toll NC 540 are modern facilities which collect tolls using transponders and license plate photo-capture technology.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nA partnering system of multiple public transportation agencies currently serves the Triangle region under the joint GoTransit branding. Raleigh is served by the Capital Area Transit (CAT) municipal transit system, while Durham has the Durham Area Transit Authority (DATA) system. Chapel Hill is served by Chapel Hill Transit, and Cary is served by C-Tran public transit systems. However, Triangle Transit, formerly called the Triangle Transit Authority (TTA), works in cooperation with all area transit systems by offering transfers between its own routes and those of the other systems. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nPlans have been made to merge all of the area's municipal systems into Triangle Transit, and Triangle Transit also has proposed a regional rail system to connect downtown Durham, downtown Cary and downtown Raleigh with multiple suburban stops, as well as stops in the Research Triangle Park area. The agency's initial proposal was effectively cancelled in 2006, however, when the agency could not procure adequate federal funding. A committee of local business, transportation and government leaders currently are working with Triangle Transit to develop a new transit blueprint for the region, with various modes of rail transit, as well as bus rapid transit, open as options for consideration.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\n\n==== Raleigh\u2013Durham International Airport (RDU) ====\n (IATA: RDU, ICAO: KRDU, FAA LID: RDU)\n\nRaleigh\u2013Durham International Airport (RDU) has nonstop passenger service to 68 destinations with over 450 average daily departures, including nonstop international service to Canada, Europe, and Mexico. It is located near the geographic center of The Triangle, 4 1\u20442 miles (7.2 km) northeast of the town of Morrisville in Wake County. The airport covers 5,000 acres (2,023 ha) and has three runways.In 1939 the General Assembly of North Carolina chartered the Raleigh\u2013Durham Aeronautical Authority, which was changed in 1945 to the Raleigh\u2013Durham Airport Authority. The first new terminal opened in 1955. Terminal A (now Terminal 1) opened in 1981. American Airlines began service to RDU in 1985.\nRDU opened the 10,000-foot (3,000 m) runway, 5L-23R, in 1986. American Airlines opened its north\u2013south hub operation at RDU in the new Terminal C in June 1987, greatly increasing the size of RDU's operations with a new terminal including a new apron and runway. American brought RDU its first international flights to Bermuda, Cancun, Paris and London.\nIn 1996, American Airlines ceased its hub operations at RDU due to Pan Am and Eastern Airlines. Pan Am and Eastern were Miami's main tenants until 1991, when both carriers went bankrupt. Their hubs at MIA were taken over by United Airlines and American Airlines. This created a difficulty in competing with US Airways' hub in Charlotte and Delta Air Lines' hub in Atlanta, Georgia for passengers traveling between smaller cities in the North and South. Midway Airlines entered the market, starting service in 1995 with the then somewhat novel concept of 50-seat Canadair Regional Jets providing service from its RDU hub primarily along the East Coast. Midway, originally incorporated in Chicago, had some success after moving its operations to the midpoint of the eastern United States at RDU and its headquarters to Morrisville, NC. The carrier ultimately could not overcome three weighty challenges: the arrival of Southwest Airlines, the refusal of American Airlines to renew the frequent flyer affiliation it had with Midway (thus dispatching numerous higher fare-paying businesspeople to airlines with better reward destinations), and the significant blow of September 11, 2001. Midway Airlines filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 13, 2001, and ceased operations entirely on October 30, 2003.\nIn February 2000, RDU was ranked as the nation's second fastest-growing major airport in the United States, by Airports Council International, based on 1999 statistics. Passenger growth hit 24% over the previous year, ranking RDU second only to Washington Dulles International Airport.

Durham in 1849, the namesake of the city. Following the American Civil War, the community of Durham Station expanded rapidly, in part due to the tobacco industry. The town was incorporated by act of the North Carolina General Assembly, in April 1869. The establishment of Durham County was ratified by the General Assembly 12 years later, in 1881. It became known as the founding place and headquarters of the American Tobacco Company. Textile and electric power industries also played an important role. While these industries have declined, Durham underwent revitalization and population growth to become an educational, medical, and research centre.Durham is home to several recognized institutions of higher education, most notably Duke University and North Carolina Central University. Durham is also a national leader in health-related activities, which are focused on the Duke University Hospital and many private companies. Duke and its Duke University Health System, in fact, are the largest employers in the city. North Carolina Central University is a historically black university that is part of the University of North Carolina system. Together, the two universities make Durham one of the vertices of the Research Triangle area; central to this is the Research Triangle Park south of Durham, which encompasses an area of 11 square miles and is devoted to research facilities.\nOn the Duke University campus are the neo-Gothic Duke Chapel and the Nasher Museum of Art. Other notable sites in the city include the Museum of Life and Science, Durham Performing Arts Center, Carolina Theatre, and Duke Homestead and Tobacco Factory. Bennett Place commemorates the location where Joseph E. Johnston surrendered to William T. Sherman in the American Civil War. The city is served, along with Raleigh, by Raleigh\u2013Durham International Airport.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-establishment ===\nThe Eno and the Occoneechi, related to the Sioux and the Shakori, lived and farmed in the area which became Durham. They may have established a village named Adshusheer on the site. The Great Indian Trading Path has been traced through Durham, and Native Americans helped to mold the area by establishing settlements and commercial transportation routes.\nIn 1701, Durham's beauty was chronicled by the English explorer John Lawson, who called the area \"the flower of the Carolinas.\" During the mid-1700s, Scots, Irish, and English colonists settled on land granted to George Carteret by King Charles I (for whom the Carolinas are named). Early settlers built gristmills, such as West Point, and worked the land.\nPrior to the American Revolution, frontiersmen in what is now Durham were involved in the Regulator movement. According to legend, Loyalist militia cut Cornwallis Road through this area in 1771 to quell the rebellion. Later, William Johnston, a local shopkeeper and farmer, made Revolutionaries' munitions, served in the Provincial Capital Congress in 1775, and helped underwrite Daniel Boone's westward explorations.\nLarge plantations, Hardscrabble, Cameron, Lipscomb, and Leigh among them, were established in the antebellum period. By 1860, Stagville Plantation lay at the center of one of the largest plantation holdings in the South. African slaves were brought to labor on these farms and plantations, and slave quarters became the hearth of distinctively Southern cultural traditions involving crafts, social relations, life rituals, music, and dance. There were free African-Americans in the area as well, including several who fought in the Revolutionary War.\n\n\n=== Antebellum and Civil War ===\nPrior to the arrival of the railroad, the area now known as Durham was the eastern part of present-day Orange County and was almost entirely agricultural, with a few businesses catering to travelers (particularly livestock drivers) along the Hillsborough Road. This road, eventually followed by US Route 70, was the major east\u2013west route in North Carolina from colonial times until the construction of interstate highways. Steady population growth and an intersection with the road connecting Roxboro and Fayetteville made the area near this site suitable for a US Post Office. Roxboro, Fayetteville and Hillsborough Roads remain major thoroughfares in Durham, although they no longer exactly follow their early 19th century rights-of-way.Durham's location is a result of the needs of the 19th century railroad industry. The wood-burning steam locomotives of the time had to stop frequently for wood and water and the new North Carolina Railroad needed a depot between the settled towns of Raleigh and Hillsborough. The residents of what is now downtown Durham thought their businesses catering to livestock drivers had a better future than a new-fangled nonsense like a railroad and refused to sell or lease land for a depot. In 1849, a North Carolina Railroad depot was established on a four-acre tract of land donated by Dr. Bartlett S. Durham; the station was named after him in recognition of his gift. A U.S. post office was established there on April 26, 1853, now recognized as the city's official birthday.Durham Station, as it was known for its first 20 years, was a depot for the occasional passenger or express package until early April 1865, when the Federal Army commanded by Major General William T. Sherman occupied the nearby state capital of Raleigh during the American Civil War. The last formidable Confederate Army in the South, commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, was headquartered in Greensboro 50 miles (80 km) to the west. After the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee at Appomattox, Virginia on April 9, 1865, Gen. Johnston sought surrender terms, which were negotiated on April 17, 18 and 26 at Bennett Place, the small farm of James and Nancy Bennett, located halfway between the army's lines about 3 miles (4.8 km) west of Durham Station.\nAs both armies passed through Durham, Hillsborough, and surrounding Piedmont communities, they enjoyed the mild flavor of the area's Brightleaf Tobacco, which was considered more pleasant to smoke or chew than was available back home after the war. Some began sending letters to Durham to get more.\n\n\n=== Reconstruction and the rise of Durham tobacco ===\n\nThe community of Durham Station grew slowly before the Civil War, but expanded rapidly following the war. Much of this growth attributed to the establishment of a thriving tobacco industry. Veterans returned home after the war with an interest in acquiring more of the tobacco they had sampled in North Carolina. Numerous orders were mailed to John Ruffin Green's tobacco company requesting more of the Durham tobacco. W.T. Blackwell partnered with Green and renamed the company as the \"Bull Durham Tobacco Factory\". The name \"Bull Durham\" is said to have been taken from the bull on the British Colman's Mustard, which Mr. Blackwell mistakenly believed was manufactured in Durham, England. Mustard known as Durham Mustard was originally produced in Durham, England, by Mrs Clements and later by Ainsley during the eighteenth century. However, production of the original Durham Mustard has now been passed into the hands of Colman's of Norwich, England.\n\n\n=== Incorporation ===\nAs Durham Station's population rapidly increased, the station became a town and was incorporated by act of the North Carolina General Assembly, on April 10, 1869. It was named for the man who provided the land on which the station was built, Dr. Bartlett Durham. At the time of its incorporation by the General Assembly, Durham was located in Orange County. The increase in business activity, land transfers etc., made the day long trip back and forth to the county seat in Hillsborough untenable, so twelve years later, on April 17, 1881, a bill for the establishment of Durham County was ratified by the General Assembly, having been introduced by Caleb B.Green, creating Durham County from the eastern portion of Orange County and the western portion of Wake County. In 1911, parts of Cedar Fork Township of Wake County was transferred to Durham County and became Carr Township.\n\n\n=== Early growth (1900\u20131970) ===\n\nThe rapid growth and prosperity of the Bull Durham Tobacco Company, and Washington Duke's W. Duke & Sons Tobacco Company, resulted in the rapid growth of the city of Durham. Washington Duke was a good businessman, but his sons were brilliant and established what amounted to a monopoly of the smoking and chewing tobacco business in the United States by 1900. In the early 1910s, the Federal Government forced a breakup of the Duke's business under the antitrust laws. The Dukes retained what became known as American Tobacco, a major corporation in its own right, with manufacturing based in Durham. American Tobacco's ubiquitous advertisements on radio shows beginning in the 1930s and television shows up to 1970 was the nation's image of Durham until Duke University supplanted it in the late 20th century.\nPrevented from further investment in the tobacco industry, the Dukes turned to the then new industry of electric power generation, which they had been investing in since the early 1890s. Duke Power (now Duke Energy) brought in electricity from hydroelectric dams in the western mountains of North Carolina through the newly invented technology of high voltage power lines. At this time (1910\u20131920), the few towns and cities in North Carolina that had electricity depended on local \"powerhouses\". These were large, noisy, and smoky coal-fired plants located next to the railroad tracks. Duke Power quickly took over the electricity franchises in these towns and then electrified all the other towns of central and western North Carolina, making even more money than they ever made from tobacco. Duke Power also had a significant business in local franchises for public transit (buses and trolleys) before local government took over this responsibility in the mid- to late 20th century. Duke Power ran Durham's public bus system (now the Durham Area Transit Authority) until 1991.\nThe success of the tobacco industry in the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged the then-growing textile industry to locate just outside Durham. The early electrification of Durham was also a large incentive. Drawing a labor force from the economic demise of single family farms in the region at the time, these textile mills doubled the population of Durham. These areas were known as East Durham and West Durham until they were eventually annexed by the City of Durham.\n\nMuch of the early city architecture, both commercial and residential, dates from the period of 1890\u20131930. Durham recorded its worst fire in history on March 23, 1914. The multimillion-dollar blaze destroyed a large portion of the downtown business district. The fire department's water source failed during the blaze, prompting voters to establish a city-owned water system in place of the private systems that had served the city since 1887.Durham quickly developed a vibrant Black community, the center of which was an area known as Hayti, (pronounced HAY-tie), just south of the center of town, where some of the most prominent and successful black-owned businesses in the country during the early 20th century were established. These businesses \u2014 the best known of which are North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and Mechanics & Farmers Bank \u2014 were centered on Parrish St., which would come to be known as \"Black Wall Street.\" In 1910, Dr. James E. Shepard founded North Carolina Central University, the nation's first publicly supported liberal arts college for African-Americans.\nIn 1924, James Buchanan Duke established a philanthropic foundation in honor of his father Washington Duke to support Trinity College in Durham. The college changed its name to Duke University and built a large campus and hospital a mile west of Trinity College (the original site of Trinity College is now known as the Duke East Campus).Durham's manufacturing fortunes declined during the mid-20th century. Textile mills began to close during the 1930s. Competition from other tobacco companies (as well as a decrease in smoking after the 1960s) reduced revenues from Durham's tobacco industry.\nIn a far-sighted move in the late 1950s, Duke University, along with the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in Raleigh, persuaded the North Carolina Legislature to purchase a large tract of sparsely settled land in southern Durham County and create the nation's first \"science park\" for industry. Cheap land and a steady supply of trained workers from the local universities made the Research Triangle Park an enormous success which, along with the expansion resulting from the clinical and scientific advances of Duke Medical Center and Duke University, more than made up for the decline of Durham's tobacco and textile industries.\n\n\n=== Civil Rights Movement ===\n\nAs a result of its substantial African-American community, including many courageous activists, a prominent civil rights movement developed in Durham. Multiple sit-ins were held, and Martin Luther King, Jr., visited the city during the struggle for equal rights. The Durham Committee on Negro Affairs, organized in 1935 by C.C. Spaulding, Louis Austin, Conrad Pearson, and James E. Shepard, has been cited nationally for its role in fighting for Black voting rights. The committee also has used its voting strength to pursue social and economic rights for African-Americans and other ethnic groups. In 1957, Douglas E. Moore, minister of Durham's Asbury Temple Methodist Church, along with other religious and community leaders, pioneered sit-ins throughout North Carolina to protest discrimination at lunch counters that served only whites.\n\nWidely credited as the first sit-in of the Civil Rights Movement in North Carolina, on June 23, 1957, Moore and six others assembled at the church to plan the protest. The young African Americans moved over to the segregated Royal Ice Cream Parlor and took up whites-only booths. When they refused to budge, the manager called the police who charged them with trespassing. Unlike the Greensboro Four, three years later, the Royal Seven were arrested and ultimately found guilty of trespassing.\n\nThe six-month-long sit-in at a Woolworth's counter in Greensboro, NC, captured the nation's attention. Within a week, students from North Carolina College at Durham and Duke University staged a sit-in in Durham. About a week later, Martin Luther King Jr. met Moore in Durham, where King coined his famous rallying cry \"Fill up the jails,\" during a speech at White Rock Baptist Church. Advocating non-violent confrontation with segregation laws for the first time, King said, \"Let us not fear going to jail. If the officials threaten to arrest us for standing up for our rights, we must answer by saying that we are willing and prepared to fill up the jails of the South.\"\nThis community was not enough to prevent the demolition of portions of the Hayti district for the construction of the Durham Freeway during the late 1960s. The freeway construction resulted in losses to other historic neighborhoods, including Morehead Hills, West End, and West Durham. Combined with large-scale demolition using Urban Renewal funds, Durham suffered significant losses to its historic architectural base.\n\n\n=== 1970s \u2013 present ===\n\nIn 1970, the Census Bureau reported city's population as 38.8% black and 60.8% white. Durham's growth began to rekindle during the 1970s and 1980s, with the construction of multiple housing developments in the southern part of the city, nearest Research Triangle Park, and the beginnings of downtown revitalization. In 1975, the St. Joseph's Historical Foundation at the Hayti Heritage Center was incorporated to \"preserve the heritage of the old Hayti community, and to promote the understanding of and appreciation for the African American experience and African Americans' contributions to world culture.\" A new downtown baseball stadium was constructed for the Durham Bulls in 1994. The Durham Performing Arts Center now ranks in the top ten in theater ticket sales in the US according to Pollstar magazine. Many famous people have performed there including B.B. King and Willie Nelson. After the departure of the tobacco industry, large-scale renovations of the historic factories into offices, condominiums, and restaurants began to reshape downtown. While these efforts continue, the large majority of Durham's residential and retail growth since 1990 has been along the I-40 corridor in southern Durham County.Major employers in Durham are Duke University and Duke Medical Center (39,000 employees, 14,000 students), about 2 miles (3.2 km) west of the original downtown area, and companies in the Research Triangle Park (49,000 employees), about 10 miles (16 km) southeast. These centers are connected by the Durham Freeway (NC 147).\n\n\n=== Downtown revitalization ===\n\nIn recent years the city of Durham has stepped up revitalization of its downtown and undergone an economic and cultural renaissance of sorts. Partnering with developers from around the world, the city continues to promote the redevelopment of many of its former tobacco districts, projects supplemented by the earlier construction of the Durham Performing Arts Center and new Durham Bulls Athletic Park. The American Tobacco Historic District, adjacent to both the athletic park and performing arts center, is one such project, having successfully lured a number of restaurants, entertainment venues, and office space geared toward hi-tech entrepreneurs, investors, and startups. Many other companies have purchased and renovated historic buildings, such as Measurement Incorporated and Capitol Broadcasting Company.\nThe American Underground section of the American Tobacco Campus, home to successful small software firms including Red Hat, was selected by Google to host its launch of the Google Glass Road show in October 2013. The district is also slated for expansion featuring 158,000 square feet of offices, retail, residential or hotel space The Durham County Justice Center, a major addition to downtown Durham, was completed in early 2013.\nMany of the historic tobacco buildings elsewhere in the city have been converted into loft-style apartment complexes. The downtown corridor along West Main St. has seen significant redevelopment including bars, entertainment venues, art studios, and co-working spaces, in addition to shopping and dining in nearby Brightleaf Square, another former tobacco warehouse in the Bright Leaf Historic District. Other current and future projects include expansion of the open-space surrounding the American Tobacco Trail, new hotels and apartment complexes, a $6.35-million facelift of Durham City Hall, and ongoing redevelopment of the Duke University Central Campus.\nIn 2013, 21c Museum Hotels announced plans to fully renovate the Hill Building. The renovations added a contemporary art museum and upscale restaurant to the historic building. Additionally, a boutique hotel was built in this major renovation effort in downtown Durham. Skanska Construction is responsible for managing this project.In 2014, it was announced that downtown Durham would be the site of a brand new 27 story high building, tentatively named \"City Center Tower\", titled \"One City Center\" as of 2018. Along with other new buildings in downtown Durham, it was under construction in 2018. Construction has already started, and the building will be at the corner of Main St. and Corcoran St. It will be directly across from Durham's current tallest building, but once completed, will be the new tallest building in downtown Durham and the 4th largest building in the Triangle. Originally scheduled for a 2016 opening, the building was then expected to open in May 2018. This is an ambitious, $80 million project.In October 2014, a major new development, the Durham Innovation District, was announced. The development will span 15 acres and comprise over 1.7 million square feet of office, residential, and retail space.On April 10, 2019, a gas explosion rocked Kaffeinate, a coffee shop in Bright Leaf Historic District. The blast destroyed a city block and killed Kong Lee, the owner, as well as injuring 25 others.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nDurham is located in the east-central part of the Piedmont region at 35\u00b059\u203219\u2033N 78\u00b054\u203226\u2033W (35.988644, \u221278.907167).

Other events include jazz festivals, plays, symphony concerts, art exhibitions, and a multitude of cultural expositions, including the American Dance Festival, Tobacco Road Dance, and the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival. A center of Durham's culture is its Carolina Theatre, which presents concerts, comedy and arts in historic Fletcher Hall and Independent and repertory film in its cinemas. Notable dining establishments are primarily concentrated in the Ninth Street, Brightleaf, and University Drive areas. There is a resurgence of restaurants in and around the downtown area, including several new restaurants in the American Tobacco District. The Nasher Museum of Art opened in October 2005 and has produced nationally recognized traveling exhibitions of global, contemporary art.\nDurham also boasts an outstanding history museum, the Museum of Durham History. In 2019, the museum hosted several exhibits, including one on journalist and civil rights activist Louis Austin, and in conjunction with the 150th anniversary of the city of Durham, an exhibit titled, \"150 Faces of Durham,\" which highlighted many of the women and men who influenced the history of Durham.\nThe Durham Association for Downtown Arts (DADA) is a non-profit arts organization located in the downtown area. It was founded in 1998 and then incorporated in 2000. The organization's mission is a commitment to the development, presentation and fiscal sponsorship of original art and performance in Durham. DADA strives to support local artists working in a diversity of artistic media. Emphasizing community, DADA helps local residents gain access to these artists by providing free or low-cost venue admission.\nMovies such as Bull Durham (1988) and The Handmaid's Tale (1989) have been shot in Durham.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nDurham has an active and diverse local music culture.

In the 1960s and 1970s, more than 40 R&B, soul, and funk groups\u2014including The Modulations, The Black Experience Band, The Communicators, and Duralcha\u2014recorded over 30 singles and three full-length albums. Durham was also home to ten recording labels that released soul music, though most of them only released one or two records apiece. A few successful local soul groups from Durham also recorded on national labels like United Artists or on regional labels in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nDurham is home to the nationally known Scrap Exchange, the largest nonprofit creative reuse arts center in the country, and the Nasher Museum of Art as well as a plethora of smaller visual arts galleries and studios. As a testament to the arts, downtown Durham sponsors an organically grown celebration of culture and arts on display every third Friday of the month, year round. The event has come to be known as 3rd Friday.\nA selection of locally renowned galleries remain in business throughout the city. Galleries include but are not limited to local spots such as the Pleiades Gallery, the Carrack Modern Art, and Golden Belt Studios. Supporting a variety of local, nationwide, and worldwide talent, these galleries often host weekly events and art shows. The Durham Art Walk is another annual arts festival hosted in May each year in downtown Durham. The Durham Art Walk features a variety of artists that come together each year for a large showcase of work in the streets of Durham. A secondary magnet school, Durham School of the Arts, is also located in downtown Durham. It focuses on providing education in various forms of art ranging from visual to the performing arts.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nCollegiate athletics are a primary focus in Durham. Duke University's men's basketball team draws a large following, selling out every home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium in 2009. The fans are known as the Cameron Crazies and are known nationwide for their chants and rowdiness. The team has won the NCAA Division I championship three times since 2001 and five times overall. Duke competes in a total of 26 sports in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nDurham's professional sports team is the Durham Bulls International League baseball team. A movie involving an earlier Carolina League team of that name, Bull Durham, was produced in 1988. Today's Bulls play in the Durham Bulls Athletic Park, on the southern end of downtown, constructed in 1994. One of the more successful teams in the minor leagues, the Bulls usually generate an annual attendance of around 500,000. Previously the Durham Athletic Park, located on the northern end of downtown, had served as the Bull's homebase. Historically, many players for the current and former Durham Bulls teams have transferred to the big leagues after several years in the minor leagues. The DAP has been preserved for the use of other teams as well as for concerts sponsored by the City of Durham and other events. The Durham Dragons, a women's fast pitch softball team, played in the Durham Athletic Park from 1998\u20132000. The DAP recently went through a $5 million renovation.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe area is predominantly Democratic, and has voted for the Democratic Party's presidential candidate in every election since the city's founding in 1869. Durham County is the most liberal county in North Carolina, measured by the percentage of voters aligning with the Democratic party in the last several presidential elections 2008 United States presidential election in North Carolina#By county. The shifting alliances of the area's political action committees since the 1980s has led to a very active local political scene. Notable groups include the Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People, the Durham People's Alliance, and the Friends of Durham. The first two groups tend to be affiliated with Democratic party progressive activists, while the third group tends to attract Republican activists. Compared to other similarly sized Southern cities, Durham has a larger than average population of middle class African-Americans and white liberals. Working together in coalition, these two groups have dominated city and county politics since the early 1980s.\nDurham operates under a council-manager government. The mayor, since 2017, is Steve Schewel, who was elected with 59.45% of the vote. The seven-member City Council is the primary budgetary and lawmaking authority.\n\nKey political issues have been the redevelopment of Downtown Durham and revival of other historic neighborhoods and commercial districts, ending cash bail, ending mandatory sentencing minimums, decriminalization of marijuana, raising minimum wage for city employees to $15, the fluoridation of public drinking water, a 45% reduction of crime, a 10-year plan to end homelessness, initiatives to reduce truancy, issues related to growth and development. Naturally, a merger of Durham City Schools (several inner city neighborhoods) and Durham County Schools in the early 1990s has not been without controversy. More recently, the Durham City Council's 2018 statement opposing militarized policing that mentioned Israel has drawn its third lawsuit [4]. In 2018, Durham appointed its first Latinx council member Javiera Caballero. Durham has had majority female county boards since the 1980s, and in 2020, Durham elected, for the first time, an all female Durham County Board of Commissioners and the first Muslim-American woman to win elected office in the history of North Carolina [5].\nFederally, Durham is split between North Carolina's 1st congressional district and North Carolina's 4th congressional district. The 1st district is represented by Democrat G.K. Butterfield, elected in 2004. The 4th district is represented by Democrat David Price, elected in 1996.\n\nSince 2003 the city has had a policy to prohibit police from inquiring into the citizenship status of persons unless they have otherwise been arrested or charged with a crime. A city council resolution mandates that police officers \"...may not request specific documents for the sole purpose of determining a person's civil immigration status, and may not initiate police action based solely on a person's civil immigration status ...\" Since 2010, the Durham police have accepted the Mexican Consular Identification Card as a valid form of identification.In 2006, racial and community tensions stirred following allegations of a sexual assault by three white members of the Duke University lacrosse team in what is now known as the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case. The allegations were made by Crystal Gail Mangum a young, female African-American student and mother of two young children. She and another young woman had been hired to dance at a party that the team held in an off-campus house. In 2007, all charges in the case were dropped and the players were declared innocent. Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong was dismissed from his job and disbarred from legal practice for his criminal misconduct handling of the case including withholding of exculpatory evidence. There have been several other results from the case, including lawsuits against both city and Duke University officials.\nThe new Durham County Justice Center was completed in early 2013.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nPublic schools in Durham are run by Durham Public Schools, the eighth largest school district in North Carolina. The district runs 46 public schools, consisting of 30 elementary, 10 middle, 2 secondary, and 12 high schools. Several magnet high schools focus on distinct subject areas, such as the Durham School of the Arts and the City of Medicine Academy. Public schools in Durham were partially segregated until 1970.\nThe North Carolina School for Science and Mathematics is a high school operated by the University of North Carolina in central Durham. The residential school accepts rising juniors living in North Carolina with a focus on science, mathematics, and technology.\nThere are several charter school options as well, including Research Triangle High School (a STEM school in Research Triangle Park), Voyager Academy (K-12), Kestrel Heights School (K-12), Maureen Joy Charter School (K-8), and most recently Excelsior Classical Academy (K-8).\nSeveral private schools operate in Durham, such as Durham Academy, Carolina Friends School, and Duke School. There are also religious schools, including Trinity School of Durham and Chapel Hill.In December 2007, Forbes.com ranked Durham as one of the \"Top 20 Places to Educate Your Child;\" Durham was the only MSA from North Carolina to make the list.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nDuke University has approximately 14,000 students, split evenly between graduates and undergraduates. Duke's 8600 acre campus and Medical Center are located in western Durham, about 2 miles (3.2 km) from downtown. Duke forms one of the three vertices of the Research Triangle along with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. The university's research, medical, and teaching efforts are all among the highest-ranked in both the United States and the world.North Carolina Central University is a public, historically black university located in southeastern Durham. It was ranked the number 1 Public HBCU in the nation by U.S. News & World Report in 2010 and 2011. It was ranked the 10th best HBCU overall. The university was founded by James E. Shepard in 1910 as the National Religious Training School and Chautauqua to address the needs of the region's black population, and now grants baccalaureate, master's, professional and doctoral degrees. NCCU became a university in 1969 and joined the University of North Carolina system in 1972.\nDurham Technical Community College is a two-year public institution that grants associate degrees.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe major daily newspaper in Durham is The Herald-Sun, which began publication in 1893. The Durham-based Independent Weekly, noted for its progressive/liberal perspective, provides political and entertainment news for the greater Research Triangle; it began publication in 1983. Duke's independent student newspaper, The Chronicle (Duke University), also provides local coverage.\nDurham is part of the Raleigh-Durham-Fayetteville designated market area, the 24th largest broadcast television market in the United States. ABC owned and operated WTVD is licensed to and based in Durham, while the studios for statewide public television service UNC-TV are based in Research Triangle Park. All major U.S. television networks have affiliates serving the region.\nThe city is part of the Raleigh-Durham Arbitron radio market, ranked #43 nationally. National Public Radio affiliate WUNC, based in Chapel Hill, has significant operations in Durham.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nMost travel in Durham is by private motor vehicle on its network of public streets and highways. Important arteries for traffic include NC 147, which connects Duke University, downtown, and Research Triangle Park, U.S. 15-501 between Durham and Chapel Hill, I-85, connecting Durham to Virginia and western North Carolina cities, and I-40 running across southern Durham County between the Research Triangle Park and Chapel Hill. The I-40 corridor has been the main site of commercial and residential development in Durham since its opening in the early 1990s. Over 95% of commuters use a car to get to work, with 14% of those people in carpools.Durham maintains an extensive network of bicycle routes and trails and has been recognized with a Bicycle Friendly Community Award. The American Tobacco Trail begins in downtown and continues south through Research Triangle Park and ends in Wake County. The city is also considering furthering the progress on the Triangle Greenway System.\nAir travel is serviced by Raleigh-Durham International Airport, 12 miles southeast of Durham, which enplanes about 4.5 million passengers per year. Frequent service (five flights a day or more) is available to Philadelphia, Atlanta, New York LaGuardia, New York Kennedy, Newark, Washington Reagan, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare, Dallas, Houston, Miami, and Charlotte. Non-stop daily service is provided to approximately 30 destinations in the United States and daily international service is also available to London Heathrow, Toronto-Pearson and Paris Charles de Gaulle.\nAmtrak operates a daily train between Charlotte and New York City (the Carolinian) which stops in downtown Durham. The State of North Carolina, in cooperation with Amtrak, operates three additional daily trains between Raleigh and Charlotte which also stop in Durham. A new Amtrak station was built in 2011 in a former tobacco warehouse. Some of the downtown streets cross the tracks at grade level, while other intersections have grade separation. One downtown railroad underpass has attracted national media coverage, because it provides only 11 feet-8 inches of clearance, and has damaged the roofs of many trucks. As of October 26, 2019, the underpass was closed down to both automotive and train traffic in preparation for raising it to 12 feet and 4 inches, so as to provide clearance underneath to reduce large vehicle damage.National bus service is provided by Greyhound and Megabus at the Durham Transit Station in downtown Durham, which opened in 2009. GoDurham provides municipal bus service.\n\nGoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Research Triangle Park and several of the region's larger suburban communities. GoTriangle also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nFrom 1995, the cornerstone of GoTriangle's long-term plan was a 28-mile (45 km) rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles (11 km) to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program. Government agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.The region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Duke University also maintains its own transit system, Duke Transit operates more than 30 buses with routes throughout the campus and health system. Duke campus buses and vans have alternate schedules or do not operate during breaks and holidays.\nIn an effort to create safer roadways for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians, drivers can enroll in Durham's Pace Car Program and agree to drive the speed limit, stop at all stop signs, stop at all red lights, and stop to let pedestrians cross the street.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Born in Durham ===\n\nErnie Barnes, artist/painter\nKara Medoff Barnett, theatre producer, arts director\nBetty Davis, funk and soul singer\nBen Brantley, The New York Times theater critic\nMic'hael Brooks, NFL player\nKelly Bruno, world-record holding amputee runner and athlete; contestant on reality TV show Survivor: Nicaragua\nShirley Caesar, pastor and gospel recording artist\nRoger Lee Craig, Major League Baseball pitcher and manager\nJames Buchanan Duke, industrialist, founder of The Duke Endowment and Duke University\nThe Duffer Brothers, creators of the Netflix series Stranger Things\nRick Ferrell, Major League Baseball catcher; member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame\nJohn Wesley Fletcher, pastor\nTate Fogleman, NASCAR driver\nPenny Fuller, award-winning actress in numerous Broadway, film, and television productions\nDavid Garrard, NFL (2002\u20132013) quarterback\nDavid Gergen, advisor to presidents Ford, Reagan, and Clinton\nJohn H.

          "It is a small museum, but if you love history and are one of those museum geeks who enjoy reading each exhibit, it's interesting and very educational. And a bit funny - there is this \"robot tobacco farmer\", who speaks with Southern accent when you push a button - a bit creepy,",

          "The original homestead of Washington Duke, this is a simple place. The charm of the original structures and basic nature of the farm lured me in. This isn't a fancy or busy place (although I went in the winter). There's an interesting museum area where you can get the history",
          "The Duke family made its fortune in the tobacco industry, but it all started here at the small family farm just after the civil war. If you are at all curious about the Duke family, or about tobacco history, this is the place to stop and visit. Guided tours are offered at",
          "The home of Washington Duke can be visited on a guided tour, and visitors can walk through the tobacco museum on their own. Last weekend friends and I enjoyed a candlelight tour of the site. It was fabulous with offerings of hot cider and popcorn, dancing the Virginia reel,",
          "We were in Durham to visit the Bennett Place (Civil War surrender site), and happened to see this listed in the AAA book, so we went. The Duke Family Homestead was mildly interesting, but the Tobacco Museum on the same grounds was fascinating, even to us non-smokers. We read",
          "Since most of Durham was built on the Duke family's tobacco money, it's a good idea to remember how it happened and an object lesson in how some good things can come out of really bad ones. Well presented museum in a pretty location which both explains how and why tobacco",
          "The guided tour gives the history of the Duke family and the start of its tobacco empire. On a family farm and in a little tobacco shed, the cigarette kingdom was born in the USA. Learn how the term \"bull pen\" came about, too!",
          "This home and museum is well worth seeing if you have any interest in American history. As a former smoker, I now understand how tobacco growing and marketing grew to be the industry that it became. Very informative.",

          "Enjoyed my time there. Interesting to learn a bit about Durham and how it came to be. Really cool exhibition.",
          "This place was surprising in its content and information. I had a very informative tour with an extremely well educated guide who explained the functions of the place in a clear and pleasant manner. Well worth a trip",
          "We visited mid week and when we arrived we were the only people there. We were invited to view the wonderful museum they have set up and also the available videos. This was a perfect introduction to the tour of the homestead and grounds. The museum provided lots of facts in a",

          "FASCINATING and factual video about Duke and how he, and then his son, changed the life of American via tobacco. We have never smoked; deplore the stuff but finally learned just how marketing turned this terrible leaf into a must-have item. Museum is GREAT, and the old homestead",
          "Very informative about the history of tobacco farming. There is a short walking trail to see the different buildings and tobacco crop in addition to the museum its self. Worth the stop if in the area.",
          "Buildings are open on tour only, on the hour. Interesting film about tobacco history and the Dukes on the half hour. Museum on grounds is a very interesting history of tobacco and the regional growers. There are many artifacts of the industry.",
          "This place has an extensive tobacco exhibit area including even old cigarette commercials on a TV. Has a history of Durham tobacco and what an impact it had on the tobacco industry. The museum is worth going by itself but there are also the 5-6 out buildings from the Duke",
          "Great day trip for tobacco history buffs! My Mother and her sisters were able to relive their days of growing up on a tobacco farm. There is a museum, short film, gift shop, and the Duke farm that started it all!",

          "If you are interested in history, history in NC (or Durham) or interested in the history and background of Tobacco, this would be a good place to visit. Take time to do the guided tour to get more out of your visit. Aside from the guided tour that takes you to the homestead,",
          "My husband and I visited the Duke homestead and were impressed with the authenticity. Regardless of what we now know about the dangers of smoking the tobacco industry had a huge impact on our nation's economy. Seeing this from the viewpoint of a late 19th century entrepreneur",
          "The homestead is largely a paean to the tobacco industry that made the Dukes wealthy--it's peaceful and pretty, but not much of real interest if one is not particularly interested in tobacco history. We did our own walking tour, but it might have been better to take a guided",
          "OK so my kids were here at Thanksgiving -- I am new to the area. I had seen it all ready and while it's (the museum, not the house) very dated in many ways, it's also amazing in how it documents the rise of the Duke family. They were the JP Morgans of the antebellum (post",

          "On this tour, you learn about why North Carolina became so successful in tobacco growth and sales, and how the Dukes worked their way up the ladder through innovation. You tour inside the house, the tobacco \"factory\", and meet a cat or two along the way. I would recommend",
          "My husband isn't typically interested in museums, but he really enjoyed this site. I knew he would be because of the agricultural part of it, but I think he was also interested in learning this is where Duke University got its name. The guided tour of the homestead and",
          "This is the Duke family old homestead. Wonderful small museum and self or given tour of tobacco barns and home. School tours and events can be arranged. Christmas here is magical and definitely worth taking the time. All decorated as would have been and so calm and beautiful!",
          "Definitely worth a stop if you're on the hunt for NC Historic Sites or just around in the Raleigh/Durham area. Great museum and the house is magnificent! The picnic area is a good spot to eat some lunch too.",
          "Washington Duke's sons founded the worlds largest tobacco company, American Tobacco Company. This made NC the center of the international tobacco empire. Duke University was named after the Duke's. My favorite thing in the museum was a cigarette dispenser that had 2 gum ball",
          "They have a large museum here that was very enjoyable. There is also a movie that should not be missed. After that there is a tour of the outbuildings. Unfortunately, our guide could not answer any of our questions.",
          "Has a museum about tobacco, its history, growing, producing products. Nothing about the damage it does. While tobacco is bad it did lead to the development of the area and is a part of its history. The buildings on the grounds were interesting and as a photographer I liked",

          "My family recently visited the Duke Homestead located a little north of Durham, NC. They offer a rather extensive museum on everything tobacco-related, a 15-minute film and a guided tour of the buildings and grounds. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable. She made the history",
          "Some visiting relatives and myself went to the Duke Homestead, as they had seen many of the other attractions in the area before. We thought it would be like an hour and go, but we were pleasantly surprised and stayed longer. There's a fixed exhibit on tobacco growing and the",

          "The displays were very good. Having been rather knowledge challenged on the subject of tobacco growing and harvesting, I learned a lot. The video was very interesting. It's always nice to see an 1850's home and the furnishings. Our guide took us to the tobacco factory on the",
          "we had a group of 10 and varied ages. You can really learn a great deal about the growing, processing and selling of tobacco. The Homestead itself is interesting to see but if you only have time to tour the Museum, then it is worth the visit. It is free but donations are",
          "Worth the trip. Extremely interesting. Some very nostalgia items jogging my memory when I was a kid. The good thing, it not cheesy. Full of information on how the tobacco industry got started and boomed here in Durham.",
          "I never smoked, but thought I'd check out the Duke Homestead anyway. I found it quite interesting. The original home of Washington Duke was pretty humble. It's amazing how the family ended up so wealthy...and how the company thought tobacco might be healthy for you. HA!",
          "Quite interesting, not sure why is not high up on the attraction list. Easy to get to via GPS, plenty of parking space and free admission. A 45 minute guided tour which gives you the North Carolina tobacco history, demonstration, and the tour of the farm, factory, and warehouse",
          "Take a guided tour of the grounds and hear how Washington Duke made good switching from tobacco farmer to processor. This is where the Duke family fortune was made and increased exponentially by his son Buck. Our docent was knowledgeable and gave a great tour.",
          "This was a very interesting history lesson. The Duke's were master marketers and visionaries in how to create a monopoly to make millions. The museum has a lot of old items on display, including TV ads banned for over 40 years. The tour guides could do a little more studying",
          "Duke Homestead shows the visitor how tobacco was grown, processed and made ready for market (not an easy process). It is well maintained and a nicely done museum. Worth a visit.",
          "From small farm *which it was, the original Duke family farm* to giant monopoly (busted up by Teddy Roosevelt about 100 years ago) to a slow decline, but its recycled buildings are vital parts of Durham today. Excellent history and interpretation about tobacco farming.",
          "The museum and orientation film in the visitor centre are both very interesting. We enjoyed walking around the homestead and out buildings and had a picnic lunch in the gardens.",
          "It may be a tough sell in this PC world, but the Duke Tobacco museum is an excellent interactive experience that exploits the tremendously successful tobacco industry in North Carolina with an understandable slant toward the Duke family and its incredibly popular BULL DURHAM",
          "The area is very nice.... A little less interesting than some of the other historic sites...but we probably should have tried to go when there was something special going on.",
          "I knew nothing about tobacco processing and industry, especially at this time period. Not being from the area, I also didn't realize the contribution of the Duke family to Durham. The tour was only about 45 minutes long and consisted of viewing the outdoor buildings where",
          "The Duke Homestead is very close to our son's apartment so we dropped by for a very quick visit. We learned a lot about the tobacco industry in Durham. Walking on the beautiful grounds of the Duke Homestead felt like we had time-traveled to the mid-19th century. Lovely.",
          "The movie was great, a little cheesy with some other actors. My teenage daughter objected to the sad tone taken with the demise of tobacco, but the point was how tobacco's rise and fall led to the rise of Durham, and fall unless an alternative was found (medicine, they say).",
          "We go whenever we have out of town visitors. Very interesting and kid friendly. The guides we've gotten have been great and gear tours to the group. Many special programs during the year. Free.",
          "There is an interesting musuem, which is free of charge, that is worth visiting. One starts with a good, educational, film on the growth of the tobacco industry. Outside, there was a very old home, which we found to be locked, and a number of small buildings used in tobacco",
          "We enjoyed the history of the Duke where we stayed, top accomodation so we thought we would go and see where it all started from. The guide was very helpful",
          "I really enjoyed Duke Homestead just for a chance to step back in time and see what it was like so long ago. They still grow and dry tobacco here using the same methods. We went during the Summer Children's Festival and lots of local merchants were selling their wares, and there",
          "The homestead has a small tobacco museum that recounts the history of the ancient use of tobacco right up to the big business it became in the 20th century. Tobacco was a core of the North Carolina economy until the visionary leaders of the state took steps in the mid-1900s to",
          "Unless there is a special event with period costumes and reenactments, this museum is pretty ho-hum. Good to remember the history of Duke and their contribution to Durham, though. A once-is-enough experience.",
          "you have got to see the the building where the 'dukes' started out. it is amazing! the new part is really cool it tells about the history of tobacco in durham",
          "Museum is well done. Guided tour was excellent. Not having a tobacco farm background, I came away with a huge appreciation for the process and work involved in tobacco farming of yesteryear.",
          "Even for non-smokers, this is a very fascinating display of old tobacco growing and processign equipment. No admission fee, donations only. Good film about the history of tobacco and the Duke family.",
          "Called in the afternoon, after we had been to Stagville in the morning. It came a poor second I am afraid, ok the reception area and the information about tobacco was good, the tour the dwellings and outbuildings was poor, although a member of staff was present sitting outside",
          "My husband and I were let down on how unmaintained the grounds around the historic site were. The building itself which houses the museum was clean and had state of the art informative displays. Restrooms were clean. The grassy areas walking back towards all the barn were",
          "Just learned a lot about this site on the tour and the historic buildings are very interesting. Worth an afternoon visit for sure",
          "My husband and I visited with my ILs years ago before we had children. There is so much to learn about the Duke family and tobacco farming. I am not sure what there is that might appeal to young children, but we certainly enjoyed ourselves.",
          "This is a free attraction. The museum's budget apparently has impacted the upkeep of it. It is worth spending severa lhours at.",
          "Good place to go if you live here, but wasn't on the list of places to take people with only a weekend. The house Mr. Duke lived in was neat, and the tobacco making process was interesting.",
          "Very interesting museum. I was disappointed because they were short staffed the day we visited so we weren't able to go though the buildings",
          "Small exhibit. Great film. Shows how the Duke family made their fortune. Informative.",
          "It was very interesting and informative. Learned a few new things about tobacco through the years in NC, even though I am a native. The staff was very helpful.",
          "As a new resident of NC, I wanted to visit this historic landmark and learn more about the amazing Duke family. And amazing they were! The Duke's have a wonderful legacy of good that they have shared with all American's in one way or another. While it is true that today we",

          "This park follows much of the Eno River, so be aware that it\u2019s a very different park when there has been a lot of rain. Before taking off for a hike, grab a map at any of the entrances and choose a trail based on your experience. This also lets you know what type of blaze",
          "Took my son and mother to this park. The staff were great, and they all put in extra effort to ensure our visit was excellent. They recommended trails and fishing spots. The sound of the river added to our hike. The ranger spent time with my son, which was much appreciated. A",

          "Wanted to do a hike in the Burlington area, this place is 40 minutes near Durham. Nice 4 mile hike (buck creek loop n Holden loop). Along a nice creek that folks were swimming in. Hike had some elevation but not too strenuous. Park offers many more trails as well.",

          "We\u2019ve lived in the area for years but today was our first trip to Eno River. There are several walking trails available with varying difficulty. We ended up taking the Holden Mill Trail which had beautiful views right on the river and was quiet and peaceful. Keep an eye out",

          "This is a great place to go hiking. The area near the rapids is where most people want to be, but the quarry trail is nice too. The visitor center has restrooms and a limited supply of gifts. It also has a display of animals found in the park. 2 reasons for why I did not",
          "The Eno is well managed with a diverse amount of terrain for such a small park. I really enjoy swimming in the Eno quarry and hiking along the river. Expect to see people when you go as it is so close to Durham.",
          "On a warmer-than-usual February day, we decided to day trip over to Eno River State Park. The Cole Mill and Bobbit Hole trails were a perfect jaunt in the woods and along the river with relatively little elevation gain. The Cox Mountain trail was a little more moderate, although",

          "A great place to explore and picnic a whole day or an afternoon. Whether it be a hike, trail or cycling (not highly recommended) it's an ideal place. The best time is the fall season with the colors and the winter breeze in the corner. If you're a nature photographer, it'll be",

          "The odd and interesting thing about this park is how disjointed it is, geographically. It winds along the river in several areas, each separated from the others. You can spend many hours hiking and resting in each area, then get in your car to drive to another one. I hope",

          "Great outdoor easy hike with 10 Year old and dog. Hiked along river to suspension bridge and walked to cabin and back to parking lot...enough for my daughter. Bring towels...you can walk in river and will need to dry off your kids and dog! Fun quick afternoon outdoor activity!",
          "This was such a beautiful place to hike, I have lived here 25 years and this is my first time there, I loved it, my dogs loved it. I will be back. Not too hard to hike and the river is amazing, the views and pretty.",
          "My family went for a picnic at Eno River State Park this weekend and I was surprised by the size of the park and how nice the picnic area was. We hiked along the river to the old cabin in the woods which was a very nice hike. There were signs all around the parking areas to lock",
          "Little did we think that so much greenery exists all around us and we were amazed at the views at the Eno River State Park. We choose the Cox Mountain Trail and it did not disappoint us. We went through the woods, the river, the hanging bridges, wooden steps and did a circle",
          "I used to live next to this park and I enjoyed walking in the woods in the spring. We went looking for wildflowers (lots, scattered along the path) and views (none to speak of except for some nice vistas along the river, upstream and down). There are a variety of trails,",
          "Trails range from easy to moderate. We live very nearby so know all the trails by heart. If you're in the area and want to work off some calories from Durham eateries, this is a great pro to do it in!",

          "This state park along the river is very well maintained with many miles of hiking trails and lots of parking. Unfortunately, the trail maps are confusing and hard to follow. Better maps and signage would be extremely helpful. Other than that, the park is clean, a nice spot for",
          "We had an afternoon to kill so I found this state park . It was easy to find and it was free . There are so many walking trails , you could literally spend the day walking all of them . There are trails by the river . They have a swinging suspension bridge . The trails are",
          "It doesn't matter what trail you take, they all have their uniqueness about them. Either hiking along the river itself or on the ridges above, you will feel like you are alone with nature. Great flora and sometimes fauna will come your way. Best spot for wildflowers, spring",
          "No matter the season, there are always places to explore along the Eno--trails, river crossings, bridges, mill ruins, flora and fauna... The rock quarry is a favorite summer swimming hole, and the trails are well-marked and well-maintained. ERSP is truly a gem of the Triangle.",
          "Eno River State Park is a lovely place. Located very conveniently to Durham, Eno River State Parks offers nice un-manicured trails through the woodlands and by the River. These uncrowded trails (at least uncrowded on a Feb weekend with 70F degree weather) were a haven for",

          "Lush and inviting state park. Plenty of different trails predominantly easy, walking along the river and through mainly wooded areas. Definitely a popular destination, even with a surprisingly large number of people on the trails - it was still a calming and relaxing",

          "We take our dog here sometimes for a bit of water-fetch (isn't always leashed for this...shhhhh!) There are some intimate pathways that take you further up the river or you can get on a more maintained trailhead here that, I believe, offers some miles along the river. This is",
          "There's a 20ft cliff people can dive off of as well as smaller cliffs and you can also walk down to the water. It's a good idea to use the tree logs as floatation devices or bring your own. It's a nice place for people or all ages; we even saw some dogs in the water or on",
          "I visit the Eno River Trails about 3 times a week. I run, I walk my dog, we swim in the river, we slide down the slippery falls, we swim at Bobbit's Hole. Its a great park, with trails for any distance. There are plenty of access points, but I'm not going to share my favorite",
          "We wanted something close by and outdoorsy so we drove over to Eno and hiked down to the river and took a swim. It is not necessarily easy to get into the river, but it is very worth. Would like to go back and spend more time here! Great for couples and families! lots of",

          "We had an amazing time during our short stay at Eno River State Park. The footbridges are very cool and walking along the river was super relaxing. We saw a few snakes, so as always, be aware of your surroundings and where you are stepping. A rainstorm hit before we arrived and",

          "I visited ERSP yday with my dogs and kids. We had such a good time. Our favorite was the quarry. It was big enough and not crowded at all. Parking is a little tough at the quarry. You might have to wait for a spot. The little rapids area at Fews Ford was very cute and fun",

          "The quarry is a wonderful swimming hole! Jump from high rocks or just float around and relax. Bring a life-jacket and/or flotation device. Once you move out into the water...you will NOT be able to touch the bottom. Use extra caution when bringing children.",

          "This park has great trails, a really cool suspension foot-bridge and some neat historic pieces to see. My kids loved walking the trails and getting in the Eno River. You will enjoy being so far out while being so close to town.",
          "Trail Life Troop NC-1421, sponsored by Intentional Love Baptist Church (iLove) spent the weekend Friday June 10, Saturday June 11 nights hiking, camping out, and enjoying the refreshing waters of the Eno River. We left early enough Sunday morning June 12 to get everyone home in",

          "I visited this park with my two dogs.We hiked a bit then headed to the river where we were delighted to find out that dogs are welcome in the water. My Kenzie's delight was a joy to see. So many trails to choose from and at one end of the river there are rock and driftwood",
          "The Eno River State Park is a super place to enjoy the river or hike on one of the numerous trails on the property. The park also features primitive camping on a reservation basis. We took a scout group camping on an overnight and had a fantastic time.",
          "Although we encountered a brief rain, we were able to enjoy some time swimming in the river and relaxing in our Eno hammock at Eno Park. Pretty cool-that company should make a commercial here! We also enjoyed hiking a short trail to cross a really neat suspended bridge. There",

          "this park stretches across orange and durham counties, with great walking and hiking trails along the Eno river. Very rustic in some areas, and deserted in some areas, leading to a very historic and natural feeling when walking by the river, or on top of the ridges. Historic",
          "Not as spectacular as I expected but the place is still beautiful. I really liked walking along the river and just sitting down on the shade and watch the water flow. Absolutely relaxing! Good hiking trails as well if you're a beginner. Not much crowd on a Sunday and the best",
          "Not nearly as impressive or beautiful as some of the other nature parks I've visited in North Carolina, but still good for a family picnic on a spring afternoon. The woods are yet to turn completely green for this time of the year. I hope to visit this place again when the",

          "Being so interested (ok, maybe obsessive) in nature & travel, I would certainly say this is not a spectacular or amazing spot when comparing to the rest of the world, but it is a hell of a lot nicer than many of the state parks in the triangle area (Umstead State Park in Raleigh",
          "We love visiting state parks. Or any parks, actually. It's our favorite part of traveling. I'm guessing in the \"when did you travel\" part, but it was at least a year ago and I still remember it. That's impressive, given how bad my memory is.",
          "This is a great casual adventure spot for those who want to get out of the city and enjoy the weather. On a weekend the parking is limited and there can definitely be a few big crowds but once you get out into the open you can definitely enjoy the area and surrounding trails.",

          "There are many accesses to the Eno River trails. Go to the Eno River website to learn about them. The Eno River is a narrow, winding river through several counties in the Piedmont. Most of the access is in Orange and Durham Counties. The trails vary from less than a mile to",

          "Just 10-15 minutes driving north of Durham. We went to the visitor center where we got a map and some information. Nice people work there. Because our time was limited we walked the Buckquarter Creek Trail, 1.5 mile loop. You walk in the forest and next to the Eno River. Lovely",

          "As long as we have lived here we had never gone to the Eno River State Park. We always go to the West Point on the Eno. We were driving around and saw a sign for the park entrance and decided to check it out. We started out following the blue trail (not much to see) and then",
          "Lots of walking paths with interesting audio guided tours you can call on your cell phone. The river/stream itself is beautifully clear and a rocky bottom, which is unusual for this part of North Carolina. There's a great suspension bridge that's fun to walk across and sway",
          "Our family loves hiking at the Eno River parks. We have two black labs that swim in the river. It's the best place to cool off in the summer as most trails are shaded. In the Spring we love watching the big spotted turtles.",
          "We went for a hike that we thought was only a mile or so. Resulted in a three mile loop, because we didn't take a map. The trails were well maintained and easy to walk. The forest was open with little undergrowth, but there wasn't a lot of birds or other wildlife. Probably",
          "This is a lovely state park with good trails along a stream. It's not breaktaking, but it's a nice retreat from the surrounding hub-bub of Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill. I was surprised to find such a nice area for hiking & picnicking so close to the city.",
          "We are extremely fortunate to have so much protected green space just 10 minutes out of downtown. We love all Eno Park entrances. The West Point on the Eno is easy access to the river. We also really enjoy going to the Few's Ford and Cole Mill entrances. The river is always",

          "What can I say about Eno River State Park that has not already been said? It's a gem, a diamond in the rough. The Triangle owes a lot to folks like the Eno River Association who helped preserve this haven on the edge of a growing urban sprawl. I am most familiar with the area",
          "Cool little park with interesting features. Can you find the abandoned house? Climb the derelict chimney stack if you dare!",

          "This is a really nice, accessible park that meanders along the Eno River in Durham and Orange counties. There are several park entrances and camping areas, plus many miles of trails. It can be very peaceful once you get away from the parking areas. Just about everyone we saw",

          "If you enjoy nature and walking in the woods, the Eno is as good a place you will find in the Triangle area. In Raleigh Umstead Park is comparable and in Orange county the NC Botanical Gardens are nice but not as large or wild as the Eno. Plus the Eno Foundation recently",

          "This is a great place to hike, kids to play, or just relax. We visited for a wedding that was occurring and enjoyed the scenery",
          "Eno River State Park is a great place to hike. There are a number of trails which always makes for a good day in the woods. Some of the trails could benefit from more frequent blazes. The park map could be handier.",

          "Great hiking for the triangle. Lots of trails to. Choose from. The ParKing and maps could improve on some trails.",
          "This is a great state park and it is free to enter. There are several great hiking trails, the loop I did was about 5.5 miles and had a small amount of ascent and decent to it. We also saw several families with children swimming. I would recommend this place for a good weekend",
          "It is a lake in the middle of the quarry. You can jump off a ledge there or just float around. FLOATY RECOMMENDED, if not there are many logs you could float on. Park rangers strict with alcohol but still able to get away with if you really want. Wonderful time relaxing",
          "I had seen this state park on trip advisor, and we decided, last minute, to visit it on our way home from Durham! It was the highlight of our trip- just wish we would have taken water shoes! We walked with the kids and then let them wade in the water with their flip flops. There",

          "Visited the park for a short trek in May 2015 with a couple of friends. Found the park to be a nice walking and trekking destination. The trails are well defined , signages are located to guide the walkers and the best pet is the river crossing. It's an excellent place .",
          "The Eno river quarry is part of the Eno River state park and is worth the trip. The water is great and the jump off the ledge is scary in a good way.",
          "Many trail entrances to the river and trails all around! Keep eye out for snakes and check yourself for ticks. Enjoy the deer.",
          "went to 2 different locations. First went on a hike - it was nice. A lot of good scenery. Kept us entertained us for a few hours! Next day we went to a swimming hole. It was kind of crowded so we hiked upstream and chilled on a rock for a few hours. Nice and relaxing. Even saw",
          "We visited on a Saturday afternoon at the end of May and found very few people on the trail. We entered the Fews Ford area and started the Buckquarter Creek/Holden Mill Trail. Staring at the visitor center, the ranger was helpful and suggested this trail. There was some",

          "We went there the other day. Nice trails. My son had a blast crossing the bridge and checking out the log cabin, Looking forward to going there again soon.",
          "It was a beautiful hike. There was a variety of trees, plants, and flowers. We settled at a secluded spot on the river and went fishing. We caught mainly sunfish but a few other species not native to the area which made it more fun. Don't go alone because there are reports of",
          "My home is one of the fortunate few that is on the banks of the Eno, backed by forest preserve. I am forever grateful for the trails, the fews and preservation of this land..try and get off on some of the lesser known trails and you will find solitude and peace on the outskirts",
          "Lots of trees, plenty of wildlife, very rustic setting. There were a lot of mosquitoes that day we were there so we did not stay very long. Walking trail along the water was nice.",

          "This is a pleasant park in northern Durham. We have visited many times over the past 12 plus years. As noted in my previous review, there are many repairs that need to be made. The bridge by the old mill needs the steps, near the riverside, and hand rail repaired. Timbers on",

          "My boyfriend and I went here around Christmas for a short trail run. It was easy to get to and very quiet and peaceful. Its a nice place for a short nature walk. Hard to get lost. A little reservoir to walk around and quaint, little stream.",
          "This is our absolute favorite park in the Durham area. There are trails for everyone and every level. The park has a picnic area and the river is great for wading in. One drawback is that weekends, especially when the weather is nice, it tends to be packed with people. If",
          "Eno River Park it's a very nice forest to visit for a couple of hours or to spend a whole day and even the night (camping it's allow upon registration). If you have the luxury to visit in a windy day then you'll want to stay as longer as possible. The sound of the trees moved by",
          "I'm hesitant to give a positive review because I don't really want this spot to lost its intimacy! I haven't been swimming there but I've been told it's a nice casual spot to spend a summer afternoon in the water.",

          "Not much different from other parks I have been to...but a nice brief getaway. Maps and signs a bit confusing. Nice shallow wading area for kids and small falls. Some areas are fairly steep (for out of shape older folks).",
          "I really love the trails and find them peaceful and relaxing, yet they are also good running trails. Unfortunately, I have to give this a four because the trails are rocky and strange, with quite a few tripping hazards.",
          "Just 10-15 minutes driving north of Durham. We went to the visitor center where we got a map and some information. Nice people work there. Because our time was limited we walked the Buckquarter Creek Trail, 1.5 mile loop. You walk in the forest and next to the Eno River. Lovely",
          "We spent time here on a 2 or 3 mile walk along the river with family and dogs. The paths are lovely, and we saw no litter. A great place to commune with nature, observe afternoon light, and spend time with others.",

          "Not a massive Eno enthusiast like some others, but love NC STate parks in general. This park is very very nice, though crowded on the weekends. Keep walking though and you end up with some isolation. Strongly recommend",
          "Pound for pound this is the best hiking around. Many folks go through Roxboro Rd or Cole Mill, but I prefer some of the more hidden access points. Nearly all of the trails are easy to moderate. There are places to swim and a big quarry. It's a real treasure! I definitely",

          "Took my little boy here and was surprised at so many nice things to do while still having the solitude of nature. We were able to go canoeing then took a short hike and found a millhouse from colonial times.",
          "We walk along the Eno State Park trails often. Take our dog with us much of the time. Very calming walking along the river, seeing the turtles sunning themselves on huge rock and logs. Watching the cranes come in for a landing. It's always a pleasure and great exercise.",
          "Little creeks with small water fall, clear cold water, plenty of areas for walking, hiking, tadpoles and fish. However the ranger was a little off the wall. Instead of asking my husband about our plates he waited for him to pass get back into our truck and drive to the creek",

          "Several easy trails along the river, well maintained with a map at each trailhead. I have been here several times and walked most of the trails, the Mountain to the Sea trail in NC goes through this state park. The last time I brought my 2 young grandsons and they had a ball",

          "As long as we have lived here we had never gone to the Eno River State Park. We always go to the West Point on the Eno. We were driving around and saw a sign for the park entrance and decided to check it out. We started out following the blue trail (not much to see) and then",
          "Lots of walking paths with interesting audio guided tours you can call on your cell phone. The river/stream itself is beautifully clear and a rocky bottom, which is unusual for this part of North Carolina. There's a great suspension bridge that's fun to walk across and sway",
          "Our family loves hiking at the Eno River parks. We have two black labs that swim in the river. It's the best place to cool off in the summer as most trails are shaded. In the Spring we love watching the big spotted turtles.",
          "We went for a hike that we thought was only a mile or so. Resulted in a three mile loop, because we didn't take a map. The trails were well maintained and easy to walk. The forest was open with little undergrowth, but there wasn't a lot of birds or other wildlife. Probably",
          "This is a lovely state park with good trails along a stream. It's not breaktaking, but it's a nice retreat from the surrounding hub-bub of Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill. I was surprised to find such a nice area for hiking & picnicking so close to the city.",
          "We are extremely fortunate to have so much protected green space just 10 minutes out of downtown. We love all Eno Park entrances. The West Point on the Eno is easy access to the river. We also really enjoy going to the Few's Ford and Cole Mill entrances. The river is always",

          "What can I say about Eno River State Park that has not already been said? It's a gem, a diamond in the rough. The Triangle owes a lot to folks like the Eno River Association who helped preserve this haven on the edge of a growing urban sprawl. I am most familiar with the area",
          "Cool little park with interesting features. Can you find the abandoned house? Climb the derelict chimney stack if you dare!",

        "wiki": "County Durham (, locally /\u02c8d\u025cr\u0259m/ listen) is a county in North East England. The county town is Durham, a cathedral city. \nCounty Durham can refer to the modern ceremonial county, the smaller area of a unitary authority, or the historic county with different boundaries. The largest settlement in the ceremonial county is Darlington, closely followed by Hartlepool, Billingham and Stockton-on-Tees. It borders Tyne and Wear to the north-east, Northumberland to the north, Cumbria to the west and North Yorkshire to the south. The area of the unitary authority, Durham County Council, does not include Darlington, Hartlepool or Stockton-on-Tees.  The historic county's boundaries stretch between the rivers Tyne and Tees, thus including places such as Gateshead, Jarrow, South Shields and Sunderland, but do not include the part of the modern county south of the Tees.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the county was an ecclesiastical centre, due largely to the presence of St Cuthbert's shrine in Durham Cathedral, and the extensive powers granted to the Bishop of Durham as ruler of the County Palatine of Durham. The county has a mixture of mining, farming and heavy railway heritage, with the latter especially noteworthy in the southeast of the county, in Darlington, Shildon and Stockton. In the centre of the city of Durham, Durham Castle and Durham Cathedral are UNESCO-designated World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nMany counties are named after their principal town, and the expected form here would be Durhamshire, but this form has never been in common use. The ceremonial county is officially named Durham, but the county has long been commonly known as County Durham and is the only English county name prefixed with \"County\" in common usage (the practice is common in Ireland). Its unusual naming (for an English shire) is explained to some extent by the relationship with the Bishops of Durham, who for centuries governed Durham as a county palatine (the County Palatine of Durham), outside the usual structure of county administration in England.\nThe situation regarding the formal name in modern local government is less clear. The structural change legislation which in 2009 created the present unitary council (that covers a large part \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the ceremonial county) refers to \"the county of County Durham\" and names the new unitary district \"County Durham\" too. However, a later amendment to that legislation, refers to the \"county of Durham\" and the amendment allows for the unitary council to name itself \"The Durham Council\". In the event the council retained the name of Durham County Council. With either option, the name does not include County Durham.\nThe former postal county was named \"County Durham\" to distinguish it from the post town of Durham.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe county boundaries used for parliamentary constituencies are those used between 1974 and 1996 (i.e. consisting of only the area governed by Durham County Council and the Borough of Darlington). This area of the county elects seven Members of Parliament. As of the 2019 General Election, four of these MPs are Conservatives and three MPs are Labour. The rest of the ceremonial county is included in constituencies in the Cleveland parliamentary constituency area. \n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe ceremonial county of Durham is administered by four unitary authorities. The ceremonial county has no administrative function, but remains the area to which the Lord Lieutenant of Durham and the High Sheriff of Durham are appointed.\n\nCounty Durham (governed by Durham County Council): the unitary district was formed on 1 April 2009 replacing the previous two-tier system of a county council providing strategic services and seven district councils providing more local facilities. It has 126 councillors. The seven districts abolished were:Chester-le-Street, including the Lumley, Pelton and Sacriston areas\nDerwentside, including Consett and Stanley\nCity of Durham, including Durham city and the surrounding areas\nEasington, including Seaham and the new town of Peterlee\nBorough of Sedgefield, including Spennymoor and Newton Aycliffe\nTeesdale, including Barnard Castle and the villages of Teesdale\nWear Valley, including Bishop Auckland, Crook, Willington, Hunwick, and the villages along Weardale\nThe Borough of Darlington: before 1 April 1997, Darlington was a district in a two-tier arrangement with Durham County Council.\nThe Borough of Hartlepool: until 1 April 1996 the borough was one of four districts in the relatively short-lived county of Cleveland, which was abolished.\nThe part of the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees that is north of the centre of the River Tees. Stockton was also part of Cleveland until that county's abolition in 1996. The remainder of the borough is part of the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire.\n\n\n=== Civil parishes ===\nThe county is partially parished.\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\nDurham Constabulary operate in the area of the two unitary districts of County Durham and Darlington. Ron Hogg was first elected the Durham Police and Crime Commissioner for the force on 15 November 2012. The other areas in the ceremonial county fall within the police area of the Cleveland Police.\nFire service areas follow the same areas as the police with County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service serving the two unitary districts of County Durham and Darlington and Cleveland Fire Brigade covering the rest. County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service is under the supervision of a combined fire authority consisting of 25 local councillors: 21 from Durham County Council and 4 from Darlington Borough Council.The North East Ambulance Service NHS Trust are responsible for providing NHS ambulance services throughout the ceremonial county, plus the boroughs of Middlesbrough and Redcar and Cleveland, which are south of the River Tees and therefore in North Yorkshire, but are also part of the North East England region.\nAir Ambulance services are provided by the Great North Air Ambulance. The charity operates 3 helicopters including one at Durham Tees Valley Airport covering the County Durham area.\nTeesdale and Weardale Search and Mountain Rescue Team, are based at Sniperly Farm in Durham City and respond to search and rescue incidents in the county.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Anglian Kingdom of Bernicia ===\n\nAround AD 547, an Angle named Ida founded the kingdom of Bernicia after spotting the defensive potential of a large rock at Bamburgh, upon which many a fortification was thenceforth built. Ida was able to forge, hold and consolidate the kingdom; although the native British tried to take back their land, the Angles triumphed and the kingdom endured.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Northumbria ===\n\nIn AD 604, Ida's grandson \u00c6thelfrith forcibly merged Bernicia (ruled from Bamburgh) and Deira (ruled from York, which was known as Eforwic at the time) to create the Kingdom of Northumbria. In time, the realm was expanded, primarily through warfare and conquest; at its height, the kingdom stretched from the River Humber (from which the kingdom drew its name) to the Forth. Eventually, factional fighting and the rejuvenated strength of neighbouring kingdoms, most notably Mercia, led to Northumbria's decline. The arrival of the Vikings hastened this decline, and the Scandinavian raiders eventually claimed the Deiran part of the kingdom in AD 867 (which became J\u00f3rv\u00edk). The land that would become County Durham now sat on the border with the Great Heathen Army, a border which today still (albeit with some adjustments over the years) forms the boundaries between Yorkshire and County Durham.\nDespite their success south of the river Tees, the Vikings never fully conquered the Bernician part of Northumbria, despite the many raids they had carried out on the kingdom. However, Viking control over the Danelaw, the central belt of Anglo-Saxon territory, resulted in Northumbria becoming isolated from the rest of Anglo-Saxon Britain. Scots invasions in the north pushed the kingdom's northern boundary back to the River Tweed, and the kingdom found itself reduced to a dependent earldom, its boundaries very close to those of modern-day Northumberland and County Durham. The kingdom was annexed into England in AD 954.\n\n\n=== City of Durham founded ===\n\nIn AD 995, St Cuthbert's community, who had been transporting Cuthbert's remains around, partly in an attempt to avoid them falling into the hands of Viking raiders, settled at Dunholm (Durham) on a site that was defensively favourable due to the horseshoe-like path of the River Wear.  St Cuthbert's remains were placed in a shrine in the White Church, which was originally a wooden structure but was eventually fortified into a stone building.\n\n\n=== County Palatine of Durham ===\n\nOnce the City of Durham had been founded, the Bishops of Durham gradually acquired the lands that would become County Durham. Bishop Aldhun began this process by procuring land in the Tees and Wear valleys, including Norton, Stockton, Escomb and Aucklandshire in 1018. In 1031, King Canute gave Staindrop to the Bishops. This territory continued to expand, and was eventually given the status of a liberty. Under the control of the Bishops of Durham, the land had various names: the \"Liberty of Durham\", \"Liberty of St Cuthbert's Land\" \"the lands of St Cuthbert between Tyne and Tees\" or \"the Liberty of Haliwerfolc\".The bishops' special jurisdiction rested on claims that King Ecgfrith of Northumbria had granted a substantial territory to St Cuthbert on his election to the see of Lindisfarne in 684. In about 883 a cathedral housing the saint's remains was established at Chester-le-Street and Guthfrith, King of York granted the community of St Cuthbert the area between the Tyne and the Wear, before the community reached its final destination in 995, in Durham.\n\nFollowing the Norman invasion, the administrative machinery of government extended only slowly into northern England. Northumberland's first recorded Sheriff was Gilebert from 1076 until 1080 and a 12th-century record records Durham regarded as within the shire. However the bishops disputed the authority of the sheriff of Northumberland and his officials, despite the second sheriff for example being the reputed slayer of Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots. The crown regarded Durham as falling within Northumberland until the late thirteenth century. Matters came to a head in 1293 when the bishop and his steward failed to attend proceedings of quo warranto held by the justices of Northumberland. The bishop's case went before parliament, where he stated that Durham lay outside the bounds of any English shire and that \"from time immemorial it had been widely known that the sheriff of Northumberland was not sheriff of Durham nor entered within that liberty as sheriff. . . nor made there proclamations or attachments\". The arguments appear to have prevailed, as by the fourteenth century Durham was accepted as a liberty which received royal mandates direct. In effect it was a private shire, with the bishop appointing his own sheriff. The area eventually became known as the \"County Palatine of Durham\".\nSadberge was a liberty, sometimes referred to as a county, within Northumberland. In 1189 it was purchased for the see but continued with a separate sheriff, coroner and court of pleas. In the 14th century Sadberge was included in Stockton ward and was itself divided into two wards. The division into the four wards of Chester-le-Street, Darlington, Easington and Stockton existed in the 13th century, each ward having its own coroner and a three-weekly court corresponding to the hundred court. The diocese was divided into the archdeaconries of Durham and Northumberland. The former is mentioned in 1072, and in 1291 included the deaneries of Chester-le-Street, Auckland, Lanchester and Darlington.\nThe term palatinus is applied to the bishop in 1293, and from the 13th century onwards the bishops frequently claimed the same rights in their lands as the king enjoyed in his kingdom.\n\n\n=== Early administration ===\n\n\n==== Overview ====\n\nThe historic boundaries of County Durham included a main body covering the catchment of the Pennines in the west, the River Tees in the south, the North Sea in the east and the Rivers Tyne and Derwent in the north. The county palatinate also had a number of liberties: the Bedlingtonshire, Islandshire and Norhamshire exclaves within Northumberland, and the Craikshire exclave within the North Riding of Yorkshire. In 1831 the county covered an area of 679,530 acres (2,750.0 km2) and had a population of 253,910. These exclaves were included as part of the county for parliamentary electoral purposes until 1832, and for judicial and local-government purposes until the coming into force of the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, which merged most remaining exclaves with their surrounding county. The boundaries of the county proper remained in use for administrative and ceremonial purposes until the 1972 Local Government Act.\n\n\n==== The Early English and Norman period ====\nFollowing the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror appointed Copsig as Earl of Northumbria, thereby bringing what would become County Durham under Copsig's control. Copsig was, just a few weeks later, killed in Newburn. Having already being previously offended by the appointment of a non-Northumbrian as Bishop of Durham in 1042, the people of the region became increasingly rebellious. In response, in January 1069, William despatched a large Norman army, under the command of Robert de Comines, to Durham City. The army, believed to consist of 700 cavalry (about one-third of the number of Norman knights who had participated in the Battle of Hastings), entered the city, whereupon they were attacked, and defeated, by a Northumbrian assault force. The Northumbrians wiped out the entire Norman army, including Comines, all except for one survivor, who was allowed to take the news of this defeat back.\nFollowing the Norman slaughter at the hands of the Northumbrians, resistance to Norman rule spread throughout Northern England, including a similar uprising in York. William The Conqueror subsequently (and successfully) attempted to halt the northern rebellions by unleashing the notorious Harrying of the North (1069\u20131070). Because William's main focus during the harrying was on Yorkshire, County Durham was largely spared the Harrying. The best remains of the Norman period include Durham Cathedral and Durham Castle, and several parish churches, such as St Laurence Church in Pittington. The Early English period has left the eastern portion of the cathedral, the churches of Darlington, Hartlepool, and St Andrew, Auckland, Sedgefield, and portions of a few other churches.\n\n\n==== 11th to 15th centuries ====\nUntil the 15th century, the most important administrative officer in the Palatinate was the steward. Other officers included the sheriff, the coroners, the Chamberlain and the chancellor. The palatine exchequer originated in the 12th century. The palatine assembly represented the whole county, and dealt chiefly with fiscal questions. The bishop's council, consisting of the clergy, the sheriff and the barons, regulated judicial affairs, and later produced the Chancery and the courts of Admiralty and Marshalsea.\n\nThe prior of Durham ranked first among the bishop's barons. He had his own court, and almost exclusive jurisdiction over his men. A UNESCO site describes the role of the Prince-Bishops in Durham, the \"buffer state between England and Scotland\":From 1075, the Bishop of Durham became a Prince-Bishop, with the right to raise an army, mint his own coins, and levy taxes. As long as he remained loyal to the king of England, he could govern as a virtually autonomous ruler, reaping the revenue from his territory, but also remaining mindful of his role of protecting England\u2019s northern frontier.\nA report states that the Bishops also had the authority to appoint judges and barons and to offer pardons.There were ten palatinate barons in the 12th century, most importantly the Hyltons of Hylton Castle, the Bulmers of Brancepeth, the Conyers of Sockburne, the Hansards of Evenwood, and the Lumleys of Lumley Castle. The Nevilles owned large estates in the county. John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby rebuilt Raby Castle, their principal seat, in 1377.\nEdward I's quo warranto proceedings of 1293 showed twelve lords enjoying more or less extensive franchises under the bishop. The repeated efforts of the Crown to check the powers of the palatinate bishops culminated in 1536 in the Act of Resumption, which deprived the bishop of the power to pardon offences against the law or to appoint judicial officers. Moreover, indictments and legal processes were in future to run in the name of the king, and offences to be described as against the peace of the king, rather than that of the bishop. In 1596 restrictions were imposed on the powers of the chancery, and in 1646 the palatinate was formally abolished. It was revived, however, after the Restoration, and continued with much the same power until 5 July 1836, when the Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836 provided that the palatine jurisdiction should in future be vested in the Crown.\n\n\n==== 15th century to the modern era ====\nDuring the 15th-century Wars of the Roses, Henry VI passed through Durham. On the outbreak of the Great Rebellion in 1642 Durham inclined to support the cause of the Parliament, and in 1640 the high sheriff of the palatinate guaranteed to supply the Scottish army with provisions during their stay in the county. In 1642 the Earl of Newcastle formed the western counties into an association for the King's service, but in 1644 the palatinate was again overrun by a Scottish army, and after the Battle of Marston Moor (2 July 1644) fell entirely into the hands of the parliament.\nIn 1614 a bill was introduced in parliament for securing representation to the county and city of Durham and the borough of Barnard Castle. The bishop strongly opposed the proposal as an infringement of his palatinate rights, and the county was first summoned to return members to parliament in 1654. After the Restoration of 1660 the county and city returned two members each. In the wake of the Reform Act of 1832 the county returned two members for two divisions, and the boroughs of Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland acquired representation. The bishops lost their secular powers in 1836. The boroughs of Darlington, Stockton and Hartlepool returned one member each from 1868 until the Redistribution Act of 1885.\n'Durham Castle and Cathedral' is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Other attractions in the County include; Auckland Castle, North of England Lead Mining Museum and Beamish Museum.\n\n\n=== Modern local government ===\n\nThe Municipal Corporations Act 1835 reformed the municipal boroughs of Durham, Stockton on Tees and Sunderland. In 1875, Jarrow was incorporated as a municipal borough, as was West Hartlepool in 1887. At a county level, the Local Government Act 1888 reorganised local government throughout England and Wales. Most of the county came under control of the newly-formed Durham County Council in an area known as an administrative county. Not included were the county boroughs of Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland. However, for purposes other than local government, the administrative county of Durham and the county boroughs continued to form a single county to which the Crown appointed a Lord Lieutenant of Durham.\nOver its existence, the administrative county lost territory, both to the existing county boroughs, and because two municipal boroughs became county boroughs: West Hartlepool in 1902 and Darlington in 1915. The county boundary with the North Riding of Yorkshire was adjusted in 1967: that part of the town of Barnard Castle historically in Yorkshire was added to County Durham, while the administrative county ceded the portion of the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees in Durham to the North Riding. In 1968, following the recommendation of the Local Government Commission, Billingham was transferred to the county borough of Teesside, in the North Riding. In 1971, the population of the county\u2014including all associated county boroughs (an area of 2,570 km2 (990 sq mi))\u2014was 1,409,633, with a population outside the county boroughs of 814,396.In 1974, the Local Government Act 1972 abolished the administrative county and the county boroughs, reconstituting County Durham as a non-metropolitan county. The reconstituted County Durham lost territory to the north-east (around Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland) to Tyne and Wear and to the south-east (around Hartlepool) to Cleveland. At the same time it gained the former area of Startforth Rural District from the North Riding of Yorkshire. The area of the Lord Lieutenancy of Durham was also adjusted by the Act to coincide with the non-metropolitan county (which occupied 3,019 km2 (1,166 sq mi) in 1981).In 1996, as part of the 1990s UK local government reform, Cleveland was abolished and its districts were reconstituted as unitary authorities. Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees (north of the River Tees) were returned to Durham for the purposes of Lord Lieutenancy. The change in area for Lord Lieutenancy purposes to reflect the abolition of Cleveland was confirmed by the Lieutenancies Act 1997. Cleveland was adopted as a postal county in 1974 and by the time of its abolition, the Royal Mail had abandoned the use of postal counties altogether. Since 1996 the use of a county address line is permitted but not mandatory and can be however a writer wishes.In 1997 Darlington became a unitary authority and was separated from the shire county.\nAs part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England initiated by the Department for Communities and Local Government,\nthe seven district councils within the County Council area were abolished. The County Council assumed their functions and became a unitary authority. The changes came into effect on 1 April 2009.\n\n\n=== Modern national government ===\nSee List of Parliamentary constituencies in County Durham\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Bishop Auckland ===\nAn October 2019 article in The Guardian referred to Bishop Auckland as a \"rundown town ... since the closure of the mines\" but predicted that the re-opening of Auckland Castle would transform the area into a \"leading tourist destination\". After renovations by the Auckland Project, the castle re-opened on 2 November 2019, operated by the Auckland Castle Trust, started by the owner of the castle, Jonathan Ruffer. In 2012 Ruffer had purchased the property and all of its contents, including the artwork, with works by Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n.Other projects in the town include the Mining Art Gallery, which opened in 2017 (thanks to support provided to the Castle Trust by Bishop Auckland and Shildon AAP and Durham County Council), a viewing tower, an open-air theatre show (Kynren) depicting \"An Epic Tale of England\", and the Bishop Trevor Gallery at the Castle (which started displaying the National Gallery's \"Masterpiece\" touring exhibit in October 2019). In a few years, other attractions were expected to open at or near the Castle: a display of Spanish art, a Faith Museum, a site that will feature the works of Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n, a boutique hotel and two additional restaurants. \n\nReports suggest that the revival of the area, dubbed \"the Auckland Project\", will eventually cost a total of about \u00a3150m. According to The Guardian, \"The aim is to make the town \u2013 the heart of the abandoned Durham coalfields \u2013 a tourist destination that holds people for a day or two rather than just a couple of hours. The scheme will create hundreds of entry-level jobs in a county that suffers high unemployment and has some of the most deprived areas in northern Europe\".\nA Financial Times report in early November 2019 stated that \"Kynren [theatre] has attracted 250,000 people and the Auckland Project, even with the castle closed, welcomed 35,500 visitors in the past year\" to this community.A September 2019 report identified Bishop Auckland as one of the towns designated to receive up to \u00a325 million in funding from a new Towns Fund intended \"to improve industrial areas that have not benefitted from economic growth in the same way as more prosperous areas\". Durham County Council's Cabinet member for economic regeneration said that the funds would help the partners in Bishop Auckland to regenerate the town center area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nCounty Durham is underlain by Carboniferous rocks in the west. Permian and Triassic strata overlie these older rocks in the east. These sedimentary sequences have been cut by igneous dykes and sills.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe following climate figures were gathered at the Durham weather station between 1971 and 2000.\n\n\n=== Green belt ===\n\nCounty Durham contains a small area of green belt in the north of the county, surrounding primarily the city of Durham, Chester-le-Street and other communities along the shared county border with Tyne and Wear, to afford a protection from the Wearside conurbation. There is a smaller portion of belt separating Urpeth, Ouston, Pelton, and Perkinsville from Birtley in Tyne and Wear. A further small segment by the coast separates Seaham from the Sunderland settlements of Beckwith Green and Ryhope. It was first drawn up in the 1990s.\n\n\n=== North Pennines ===\nThe county contains a sizeable area of the North Pennines, designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, primarily west of Tow Law and Barnard Castle. The highest point (county top) of historic County Durham is the trig point (not the summit) of Burnhope Seat, height 746 metres (2,448 ft), between Weardale and Teesdale on the border with historic Cumberland in the far west of the county. The local government reorganisation of 1974 placed the higher Mickle Fell south of Teesdale (the county top of Yorkshire) within the administrative borders of Durham (where it remains within the ceremonial county), although it is not generally recognised as the highest point of Durham.\nThe two main dales of County Durham (Teesdale and Weardale) and the surrounding fells, many of which exceed 2,000 feet (610 m) in height, are excellent hillwalking country, although not nearly as popular as the nearby Yorkshire Dales and Lake District national parks. The scenery is rugged and remote, and the high fells have a landscape typical of the Pennines with extensive areas of tussock grass and blanket peat bog in the west, with heather moorland on the lower slopes descending to the east. Hamsterley Forest near Crook is a popular recreational area for local residents.\n\n\n== Biology ==\n\n\n=== Birds ===\n152 species of birds are recorded as breeding; however, not all are considered regular breeders.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nThe Office for National Statistics estimated in 2016 that the Durham County Council area had a population of 522,100, the Borough of Darlington a population of 105,600, the Borough of Hartlepool a population of 92,800, and the part of the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees in County Durham (the other part being in North Yorkshire) a population of 137,300. This gives the total estimated population of the ceremonial county at 857,800.\n\nAt the 2001 Census, Easington and Derwentside districts had the highest proportion (around 99%) in the county council area of resident population who were born in the UK. 13.2% of the county council area's residents rate their health as not good, the highest proportion in England. This table shows the historic population of the current remit of Durham County Council between 1801 and 2001.\n\nCounty Durham has 96.6% of residents come from a White British ethnic background, with other white groups making up a further 1.6% of the population. The largest non-white ethnic group is formed by those of Chinese descent, at around 1,600 people (0.3%) - most of these live in and around Durham itself, and many study at the university. Around 77% of the county's population are Christian, whilst 22% have no religion, and around 1% come from other religious communities. These figures exclude around 6% of the population who did not wish to state their religion.\n\n\n=== Settlements ===\n\nSince the Local Government Act 1972, some settlements within the historic county boundaries now lie within other administrative counties. These include:\n\nHowever a small number of settlements, such as Startforth, are now included within County Durham as opposed to Yorkshire.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nThe proportion of the population working in agriculture fell from around 6% in 1851 to 1% in 1951; currently less than 1% of the population work in agriculture. There were 15,202 people employed in coal mining in 1841, rising to a peak of 157,837 in 1921.\nAs at 2001, Chester-le-Street district has the lowest number of available jobs per working-age resident (0.38%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Economic history ===\n\nCounty Durham has long been associated with coal mining, from medieval times up to the late 20th century. The Durham Coalfield covered a large area of the county, from Bishop Auckland, to Consett, to the River Tyne and below the North Sea, thereby providing a significant expanse of territory from which this rich mineral resource could be extracted.\nKing Stephen possessed a mine in Durham, which he granted to Bishop Pudsey, and in the same century colliers are mentioned at Coundon, Bishopwearmouth and Sedgefield. Cockfield Fell was one of the earliest Landsale collieries in Durham. Richard II granted to the inhabitants of Durham licence to export the produce of the mines, the majority being transported from the Port of Sunderland complex which was constructed in the 1850s.Among other early industries, lead-mining was carried on in the western part of the county, and mustard was extensively cultivated. Gateshead had a considerable tanning trade and shipbuilding was undertaken at Sunderland, which became the largest shipbuilding town in the world \u2013 constructing a third of Britain's tonnage.The county's modern-era economic history was facilitated significantly by the growth of the mining industry during the nineteenth century. At the industry's height, in the early 20th century, over 170,000 coal miners were employed, and they mined 58,700,000 tons of coal in 1913 alone. As a result, a large number of colliery villages were built throughout the county as the industrial revolution gathered pace.\nThe railway industry was also a major employer during the industrial revolution, with railways being built throughout the county, such as The Tanfield Railway, The Clarence Railway and The Stockton and Darlington Railway. The growth of this industry occurred alongside the coal industry, as the railways provided a fast, efficient means to move coal from the mines to the ports and provided the fuel for the locomotives. The great railway pioneers Timothy Hackworth, Edward Pease, George Stephenson and Robert Stephenson were all actively involved with developing the railways in tandem with County Durham's coal mining industry. Shildon and Darlington became thriving 'railway towns' and experienced significant growths in population and prosperity; before the railways, just over 100 people lived in Shildon but, by the 1890s, the town was home to around 8,000 people, with Shildon Shops employing almost 3000 people at its height.However, by the 1930s, the coal mining industry began to diminish and, by the mid-twentieth century, the pits were closing at an increasing rate. In 1951, the Durham County Development Plan highlighted a number of colliery villages, such as Blackhouse, as 'Category D' settlements, in which future development would be prohibited, property would be acquired and demolished, and the population moved to new housing, such as that being built in Newton Aycliffe. Likewise, the railway industry also began to decline, and was significantly brought to a fraction of its former self by the Beeching cuts in the 1960s. Darlington Works closed in 1966 and Shildon Shops followed suit in 1984. The county's last deep mines, at Easington, Vane Tempest, Wearmouth and Westoe, closed in 1993.\n\n\n=== Boosting tourism ===\nAn October 2019 article in The Guardian referred to town of Bishop Auckland as a \"rundown town ... since the closure of the mines\" but predicted that the re-opening of Auckland Castle would transform the community into a \"leading tourist destination\". The castle re-opened on 2 November 2019 after renovations by the Auckland Project, operated by the Auckland Castle Trust, started by the owner of the castle, Jonathan Ruffer.The interior had been fully restored, including the bishops' \"palatial\" apartments. The Faith Museum of world religion and a huge glass greenhouse were under construction.Other attractions already operating include the Mining Art Gallery which opened in 2017,  an open-air theatre, Kynren, depicting \"An Epic Tale of England\", and the Bishop Trevor Gallery at the Castle; the latter started displaying the National Gallery's Masterpiece touring exhibit in October 2019. In a few years, other attractions were expected to open at or near the Castle: a display of Spanish art, the Faith Museum (already being built), a site that will feature the works of Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n, a boutique hotel and two restaurants, in addition to the Bishop's Kitchen caf\u00e9. According to The Guardian,\nThe aim is to make the town \u2013 the heart of the abandoned Durham coalfields \u2013 a tourist destination that holds people for a day or two rather than just a couple of hours. The scheme will create hundreds of entry-level jobs in a county that suffers high unemployment and has some of the most deprived areas in northern Europe\n\n\n=== Economic output ===\nThe chart and table summarise unadjusted gross value added (GVA) in millions of pounds sterling for County Durham across 3 industries at current basic prices from 1995 to 2004.\n\n\n=== Post markings ===\nPostal Rates from 1801 were charged depending on the distance from London. Durham was allocated the code 263 the approximate mileage from London. From about 1811, a datestamp appeared on letters showing the date the letter was posted. In 1844 a new system was introduced and Durham was allocated the code 267. This system was replaced in 1840 when the first postage stamps were introduced.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Mining and heavy industry ===\n\nA substantial number of colliery villages were built throughout the county in the nineteenth century to house the growing workforce, which included large numbers of migrant workers from the rest of the UK. Sometimes the migrants were brought in to augment the local workforce but, in other cases, they were brought in as strike breakers, or \"blacklegs\". Tens of thousands of people migrated to County Durham from Cornwall (partly due to their previous experience of tin mining) between 1815 and the outbreak of the First World War, so much so that the miners' cottages in east Durham called \"Greenhill\" were also known locally as \"Cornwall\", and Easington Colliery still has a Cornish Street. Other migrants included people from Northumberland, Cumberland, South Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Coal mining had a profound effect on trade unionism, public health and housing, as well as creating a related culture, language, folklore and sense of identity that still survives today.The migrants also were employed in the railway, ship building, iron, steel and roadworking industries, and the pattern of migration continued, to a lesser extent, up until the 1950s and 1960s. Gateshead was once home to the fourth-largest Irish settlement in England, Consett's population was 22% Irish  and significant numbers of Irish people moved to Sunderland, resulting in the city hosting numerous events on St. Patrick's Day due to the Irish heritage.\n\nThe culture of coal mining found expression in the Durham Miners' Gala, which was first held in 1871, developed around the culture of trade unionism. Coal mining continued to decline and pits closed. The UK miners' strike of 1984/5 caused many miners across the county to strike. Today no deep-coal mines exist in the county and numbers attending the Miners' Gala decreased over the period between the end of the strike and the 21st century. However recent years have seen numbers significantly grow, and more banners return to the Gala each year as former colliery communities restore or replicate former banners to march at the Gala parade.\n\n\n=== Art ===\nIn 1930, the Spennymoor Settlement (otherwise known as the Pitman's Academy) opened. The settlement, initially funded by the Pilgrim Trust, aimed to encourage people to be neighbourly and participate in voluntary social service. The settlement operated during the Great Depression, when unemployment was widespread and economic deprivation rife; Spennymoor was economically underprivileged. The settlement provided educational and social work, as well as hope; this included providing unemployed miners with on outlet for their creativity, a poor person's lawyer service, the town's first library and the Everyman Theatre. The output included paintings, sewing, socially-significant plays, woodwork and sculptures. Several members went on to win adult scholarships at Oxford University  when such a route would normally be closed to the underprivileged. Former members include artists Norman Cornish and Tom McGuinness, writer Sid Chaplin OBE and journalist Arnold Hadwin OBE. The Spennymoor Settlement at its home in the Everyman Theatre (Grade 2 listed) is still operating, administered by the current trustees, offering community events and activities, including Youth Theatre Group, an Art Group and various classes, as well as offering community accommodation facilities.\nSeveral Durham miners have been able to turn their former mining careers into careers in art. For example, Tom Lamb, as well as the aforementioned Tom McGuinness and Norman Cornish. Their artworks depict scenes of life underground, from the streets in which they lived and of the people they loved; through them, we can see, understand and experience the mining culture of County Durham.\nIn 2017, The Mining Art Gallery opened in Bishop Auckland in a building that was once a bank. Part of the Auckland Project, the gallery includes the work of artists from within County Durham and beyond, including such other North-Eastern mining artists as Robert Olley, as well as contributions from outside the region. It features three permanent areas and a temporary exhibition area; the gallery's Gemini Collection includes 420 pieces of mining art.  \n Much of the artwork was donated, by Dr Robert McManners and Gillian Wales, for example.In 2019, 100 years after his birth, a permanent tribute to the work of the artist Norman Stansfield Cornish MBE was opened within the Town Hall, and a Cornish Trail around the town was established to include areas of the town depicted in Cornish's artwork.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nAs with neighbouring Northumberland, County Durham has a rich heritage of Northumbrian music, dating back from the Northumbrian Golden Age of the 7th and 8th centuries. Bede made references to harp-playing, and abundant archeological evidence has been found of wooden flutes, bone flutes, panpipes, wooden drums and lyres (a six-string form of harp). North-East England has a distinctive folk music style that has drawn from many other regions, including southern Scotland, Ireland and the rest of northern England, that has endured stably since the 18th century. Instruments played include, in common with most folk music styles, stringed instruments such as the guitar and fiddle, but also the Northumbrian smallpipe, which is played and promoted by people including the Northumbrian Pipers' Society throughout the North East, including County Durham, with the society having an active group in Sedgefield. Contemporary folk musicians include Jez Lowe and Ged Foley.\nIn 2018, The Arts Council funded the Stories of Sanctuary project in the city of Durham. The project aims to assist people living in the city to share their stories about seeking sanctuary in the North East through photography, stories, poetry and music. The art is based on a history of sanctuary in Durham, from St Cuthbert's exile, through to the miners' strike of 1984, and to refugees escaping civil war in the Middle East. The music produced as part of the project includes contributions from singer-songwriter Sam Slatcher and viola player Raghad Haddad from the National Syrian Orchestra.Other notable performers/songwriters who were born or raised in the county include Paddy McAloon, Eric Boswell, Jeremy Spencer, Alan Clark, Martin Brammer, Robert Blamire, Thomas Allen, Zoe Birkett, John O'Neill, Karen Harding and Courtney Hadwin.\n\n\n=== Flag ===\n\nCounty Durham has its own flag, registered with the Flag Institute on 21 November 2013.Katie, Holly and James Moffatt designed the flag and entered their design into a competition launched by campaigner Andy Strangeway, who spoke of the flag as \"free, public symbol for all to use, especially on 20th March each year, which is not only County Durham Day but also St Cuthbert\u2019s birthday.\u201d The flag consists of St Cuthbert's cross counterchanged with the county's blue and gold colours.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nDurham LEA has a comprehensive school system with 36 state secondary schools (not including sixth form colleges) and five independent schools (four in Durham and one in Barnard Castle). Easington district has the largest school population by year, and Teesdale the smallest with two schools. Only one school in Easington and Derwentside districts have sixth forms, with about half the schools in the other districts having sixth forms.\nThe University of Durham is based in Durham city and is sometimes held to be the third oldest university in England.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\nApollo Pavilion, Peterlee, controversial piece of concrete art designed by Victor Pasmore in 1969.\nAuckland Castle, Bishop Auckland \nBarnard Castle   \nBeamish Museum, in Stanley   \nBinchester Roman Fort \nBowes Museum, in Barnard Castle  \nCastle Eden, a castle with adjoining village, famous for the Castle Eden Brewery.\nCastle Eden Dene, Nature reserve with coal mining heritage.\nCausey Arch, near Stanley\nCounty Hall\nCrook Hall and Gardens\nDurham Cathedral and Castle, a World Heritage Site\nDurham Dales\nDurham Light Infantry Museum, Aykley Heads, Near Durham \nEscomb Saxon Church, near Bishop Auckland\nFinchale Priory, near Durham city \nHamsterley Forest\nHardwick Hall Country Park  near Sedgefield\nHigh Force and Low Force waterfalls, on the River Tees \nIreshopeburn \u2013 oldest Methodist chapel in the world to have held continuous services.

          "My boyfriend and I visited this place to give us something to do, it definitely exceeded our expectations! There was a variety of things to do including: mini golf, arcade games, go karts, etc!! The mini golf was my absolute favorite, the course was different than previous ones",
          "Visited Frankie's last night while in town for the NC state fair. While the kids were spending all my money in the arcade, hubby and I visited the Chilling Lounge. Our bartender was Stella, she was AWESOME!! She made great suggestions and even better drinks. We will be back to",
          "In the area where we live there is nothing like Frankie's. We live in our local bubble most of the time and rarely go to that side of town. We've definitely missed something. Frankie's arcade area is impressive! Variety is the word. Outside there are amusement style rides and",
          "Updated games. Multiple go kart tracks. Super nice mini golf course. Great place to go with family or friends. I'm 28 years old and had an absolute blast!",
          "This site was amazing, they have lots of arcade games. There are simulation games and use of VR in one game. Also they have go karts outside which was really cool. Most activities are suitable for all. Their bumper cars are so cool, never seen any like them before.",
          "Had a night out with my friends and enjoyed the variety of virtual games they had.There was fun for both adults and kids. Only thing I disliked was the customer service. Staff need to be more approachable and friendly. Other than that, loved it!",
          "Frankie's Fun Park was amazing! It was like Dave and Buster's but much better. I went with family ranging in ages between 15 to 32. We did laser tag, virtual shooting, go carts, and an air obstacle course. They had other things to do as well including arcade games and a thrill",
          "It was a fun place to go! Everyone was very nice, there are 2 18 hole putt putt courses,as well as a water park and batting cages as well as go carts and a driving range to boot! What a blast I had there with my wife.we place on revisiting this fun park again soon",
          "I have visited on multiple occasions with various groups of people. Its a place for anyone. It can be used as a date, family outing, or an outing for a group of friends. I like that there are other things to do besides just the arcade. I would recommend to anyone and will",
          "We used to love Frankie's and our friend group (all late 20's to mid 30's) loved going there to play around, have some drinks and a lot of fun. Our group would go several times a year for different birthdays or silly nights out. My biggest take away from my last experience -",
          "Grand kids love this place-- plenty to do and it is all fun. Great place to take kids for a birthday or any special event",
          "Took my kids here age from 6 to 13. Everyone had a great time we did Go Karts, played plenty of Games and rode the Dark Ride. Pretty Cool. A little pricey and now deals, other than that a nice family fun place.",
          "Went here for a fun date. Had a drink, food was good and well priced. Bit of silly ness and fun had on the golf and then bashed the arcades... fun",
          "Yes, this establishment has the noise, flashing lights, excitement, arcades and rides that the other places have, but it also has a relaxing upscale bar for adults, a restaurant with some healthier food choices, and is attractively landscaped. And, yes, it has skeeball, which",
          "Not impressed prices were high. Almost 40 bucks for 4 people to play putt put. Now if it was just a putt put place with awsome courses I would understand.The arcade games and batting cages were high as well. Was a good place to kill time just not a cheap place.",
          "This attraction park is great!! Even though there was limited parking and it was overflowing, this place turned out to great. The lines were not to long. The pricing can be expensive, because they charge by attraction. The go carts were a hit and so was the fun house. There is",
          "We went On Sunday and there was plenty of staff and plenty of parking. Prices are not crazy and the rides and games are unique. Kids will not want to leave and the adults will have fun as well. Great food choices as well and coffee and alcohol is always a plus.",
          "Frankie's fun park is a great place to take the grandkids. Weekends with good weather are normally crowded. Watch your walet, it is easy to spend more than you planned. The fun pass is a good purchase.",
          "Road both go-cart tracks and the sliders was by far the most fun I've have in 63 years. We also used the 3-D shooting game and it too was a lot more than I expected. Only issue I would say is get there early because parking is a premium.",
          "Lots of family fun, great time especially for my kids, ages nine and twelve. Games were up to date and no waiting in line.",
          "I was looking for a new place to take the kids and wow I find the perfect, spot now my younger kid is really happy with me now because he can drive his own car now. The track are longer and is really nice atmosphere and the golf course is big too. I think we are going go there",
          "Came by to kill some time before heading to the airport. Played different games, but some things were broken and there were hardly any $0.50 and $1.00 games. There weren't any traditional arcade games, like pinball. There were a ton of grabber games though. It was a cold",
          "We took the kids to Frankie's for a fun Saturday of games. It was not my first time at Frankies, but I was struck again at the lack of organization, specifically when it comes to waiting in line. There is no structure for lines at the card kiosks or any of the desks where you",
          "On business travel in Raleigh last week, our leadership team went to Frankie\u2019s For an afternoon of team bonding and fun. Luckily the sun came out and the temperatures rose in the mid to late afternoon. We began with a round of laser tag \u2013 had a blast. Then we played a whole host",
          "This is perfect for young teens ball groups to have some where to go when finished with games and need to throw back some hours. For families that can keep a watch on their children that are younger they should have lots of fun.",
          "My grandchildren LOVE going here. If tou\u2019re Into jumping and mega trampoline type activities then you have found your spot. Great for fun with the kids!",
          "This is a big place on the outskirts of Raliegh, do you would have the room to add more. There is nothing you can't get at another \"fun park\" or anything that really sets it out from the rest.",
          "My son and I enjoyed Frankie\u2019s Fun Park for the second time this year yesterday. Laser Tag, Go Cart racing to Putt Putt we had a blast!! Everything is clean and the staff was very friendly. Only thing to be careful about is watch your kid playing games! They can get swipe happy",
          "Fun mini golf, 3 different courses, lots of friendly staff. Good food and treats at the Johnny Rockets next door.",
          "Great place for family & friends! Lots of games to play from carnival like to adventure rides! Besides just in door games there's plenty of outdoor games like batting cages, go-carts, boats & miniature golf. There's also a good variety of food from a concession to sit-down",
          "It is a fun place for kids but for me it is a bit loud and not quite big enough. I would love it if I were the kid....lol",
          "Great place to drive go carts. Tons of games and laser tag great prizes and activities for adults also",
          "While there is a little bit of everything here, it comes at a cost. There are plenty of arcade games, go-carts (7$ a ride), a lounge (bar) for adults, miniature golf, laser tag, some amusement-park type rides, food, and ample parking. It is clean and well-maintained, and is to",
          "Good place to do corporate team outings. The restaurant adds a nice touch to food and bonding with your friends and teams.",
          "Not to be missed...A great number of things to do and enjoy: arcade, 3 putt putt golf courses, go carts, laser tag, etc....Nice and well kept establishment....The frozen cokes are not to be missed as well. They also have a very nice lounge area to sit and enjoy the atmosphere",
          "We went twice, Saturday Night it was packed with all ages and Sunday Morning right when it opened. Lot's of different arcade games, mini golf, 3 go-cart tracks etc. We went for the slick track with the go-carts. Yeah, the back of the carts say \"No Bumping\" yeah right...You",
          "We had a great day hitting balls at the batting cages, racing and then a few indoor games. It cost about $30 for the two of us to race once, batting cages once and three indoor games.",
          "A fun morning at Frankie\u2019s was enjoyed by all. The cart are great fun as is the batting cage but more difficult that it looks.",
          "A great place to spend the day out with your kids. However some of the rides and games were old and did not work and the staff was not that attentive to your needs",
          "There\u2019s so much to do here. They have mini-golf (3 courses I believe), batting cages, go-karts, water bumper carts, and an amazing arcade. They also serve beer too. Always a great time.",
          "We celebrated my Niece\u2019s Birthday here and had a fun time. My sister ordered pizza and the dining room was nice and big. They had an area outside where you could eat also. The facility had a numerous batting cages, mini goft corses, different go cart racing courses, a rope",
          "I took my daughter and 4 of her friends here for her birthday. It had been torrential raining off and on for the last couple of days but that didn't stop some of the attractions outside being open. Some of the games inside were not working correctly but majority of them were and",
          "Frankie's Fun Park is just that - lots of fun! For the young and the young-at-heart, this is a place with something for everyone. I have tried the games, water boats, go karts, climbing apparatus, and mini golf. The place is large enough that you can experience the",
          "This past weekend was our 1st time at Frankie's. We were a little hesitant as we read several reviews that people had gotten sick from Frankie's food. We are planning for our boys birthday party so we figured we would try it ahead of time. There is lots to do inside and",
          "Me, the wife and kids had a blast at Frankies! But don't expect to go there and not pay a decent amount of money. I feel it was worth it though for all the fun we had.",
          "This place is for the kids, and there are plenty of things for them to do. However, eat before you go, and spend your money here on the games for the kids.",
          "Stopped by with a 7 and 10 year old (girl, boy). Pretty much like an upscale ChuckE Cheese inside. The go carts outside were the big hit. Both children had a lot of fun there. It is nice that it is easy to take pictures at the finish line. We went last summer and are",
          "Enjoyed the awesome rides . Love the collection of good games . Enjoyed the restaurant and bar ,,who does not want a cold beer..some great wings . Love it",
          "Frankie's Fun Park is a great place for the whole family. You could end up spending the whole day here and not realise it. They have an 18-hole miniature golf course (you can select from 3 different paths) with cute little sea-themed decor. They have a huge laser tag arena,",
          "Lots of activities for kids of all ages but a bit on the expensive side when you are a party of seven",
          "We got to Frankie\u2019s early Sunday morning before it got too crowded. My son, who is 10, was so excited to learn that he fit the criteria to be able to drive a go cart by himself (where we live you must be 12). The go carts were very safe- not too fast and brakes soft to prevent",
          "We had spent the weekend in Durham visiting Duke University. We had an early Monday morning flight back home so we went to Raleigh Sunday afternoon. My son and I were looking for something to do after lunch and found Frankie's by chance. Being big mini putt fans we decided to",
          "Took my daughter here a couple days ago and we had a blast. There are sooooo many fun games and rides that it was hard to leave. A little pricey but absolutely worth it every once and a while for a good time.",
          "I took my kids to try out a new mini-golf course on \"National Miniature Golf Day\" last fall. We were impressed with how clean and new the course was and the theming was excellent. That day we didn't have time for the arcade, but they had many multiplayer games and my kids are",
          "Did not care for this place, very expensive for a couple hours, food was awful mad very pricey!! Will not be going back, ever!",
          "My three teens and their younger cousins had a blast here! They drove race cars, played games, climbed to the top of the world, crashed bumper boats, and had tons of fun. I would recommend it to a family who wanted to get out and do something fun!",
          "This is a great place to go when the kids are driving you crazy but be mindful that you can quickly spend a week's worth of groceries. Rides, go carts, mini golf, huge arcade. Pretty well kept, mostly run by students.",
          "Spent a few hours as a family at Frankie's Fun Park. We live very close so it was convenient. Extremely crowded and a bit on the pricey side.",
          "Super activity park. Great rides, gaming machines, crazy golf etc. Just the thing for kids of all ages (8 to 70 !).",
          "Large amusement center with games inside, a restaurant, batting cages, miniature golf, go karts and rides outside. My 10 year old was able to drive go kart by himself and ride lasted around 5 minutes. It's very expense here we spent around $100 ($70 for rides and games and $30",
          "Been here multiple times over the years. Had an excellent nine year old birthday party. It is on the expensive side but extremely fun. Love the laser tag. Food isn't the greatest, but on par with this type of place.",
          "Yes, my entire family including myself simply enjoyed this place so much that we went back everyday that we were on vacation which we never do. We found that it was better to go at night especially for the outdoor activities due to the extreme heat during the day. Arcade games",
          "We went for a 30th. Birthday celebration party with all adults in our group and everyone had lots of fun. Just walking around and watching all of the activity is interesting, especially the water activities.",
          "We accidentally found Frankie's and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. There is something for everyone. My son's and I enjoyed to go-karts especially the Shamrock which lets you draft making it more of a challenge than racing on a figure eight. The indoor arcade has games for all",
          "Frankie's has something for everyone. We have done many of the indoor games including the climbing structure. We have also enjoyed the go karts, mini golf, and bumper boats. It is a bit pricey but it is a great time with the kids.",
          "We hosted my son's 9th birthday party here. We had a blast!! They loved the go carts, fun house, arcade games, and side winder. The birthday package prices were decent since they were able to do 2 attraction rides, $5.00 arcade money, unlimited play in the fun house, 1 pizza,",
          "The BEST Fun Park In the triangle.. One of the finer points about this place is, do your research, set and budget, and bring cash(instead of credit card). THEN STICK TO YOUR BUDGET. I see so many folks not plan properly for a visit here. Decent for a simple outing, they",
          "Took the grandkids there and they went through $100 in less than an hour. An inexpensive bracelet for smaller children should be offered, since most of the rides are geared towards teenagers.",
          "Frankie's has many activities that people of all ages can engage in. It is a fun filled experience that can be costly very quickly.",
          "I've been here several times, most recently in June 2017 and did the go carts with my nephew (my 1st time ever) and it was a blast!",
          "Another great visit!! Kids love this place...tried the amusement park rides and were pleasantly surprised at both cost per ride and enjoyment of kids",
          "Went here for our daughters birthday and we all had a blast. Lots to do for all ages. Unfortunately it rained the whole time we were there so we didn't get to experience the outdoor attractions. We will be back in the near future.",
          "My Family Comes Here Weekly And Is Great For Family's! From Indoor Games, To A Indoor Climbing Place! And The Outside Has Amazing Views! The Golf Is Beautiful And Relaxing. The Go-Carts Are Fast And Fun! My Daughter Loves The Obstacle Structure Outside! They Love Earning Points",
          "We brought our nephews to Frankie's fun park this afternoon and it was great!! They played laser tag, went on the rope course, and the bumper boats and they had a blast!! I recommend doing the bumper boats early so you can dry off..the whole place was a blast..even for the",
          "We enjoy going here for the outside mini golf, they have 3 different course which are really good. The games inside are always broke and a waste of money, asking the attendants to get your coins back on a game you just lost them on because the games are broke is always awkward",
          "We go here quite regularly to go putt-putt. I enjoy all 3 courses and they have spent lots of money keeping up the courses. The go carts and other stuff are fun too. Its surprising how much fun adults can have here. But we have never eaten there until recently. The food is",
          "Kid version of Dave and Busters. Had so much fun first night in town, we went back again second night.",
          "Brought my kids here and they can run and play while I sit and have a cocktail or two. When they get hungry we order food which is really good. We love coming here!",
          "We went here with family for dinner which their hamburgers were great and their cheese pizza was great too! A little bit expensive but it was nice to eat there and walk to the other side and start playing games. My kids loved the games! It was a little sad that some of them",
          "I took my god-children here for an afternoon out and we had the best time. There's plenty to do and so much to keep the children busy. They are ages 3 and 12, so needless to say, I was busy between the two. I will say that it's not a budget friendly place. Be sure to bring",
          "This was a big arcade with everything from outdoor go kart tracks and mini golf to boat bumper cars. Fun inside also. Just expensive.",
          "a lot of fun things to do. like go karts amazing different games for all ages groups and adults as well.",
          "This was a good way to spend the day with our 9 year old son. I'd rate it as above average expense wise however there are attractions are worth doing plus unique. We don't have a Frankie's in Lynchburg, VA. There is indoor and outdoor fun. The food was pricey but very tasty. We",
          "We have been bringing our grandchildren here whenever we visit as a special treat. They are now old enough to do the big go-karts, so racing them is a real treat. We love how each child can get money put onto a reloadable card and they can swipe to their hearts content - or",
          "First time going - went with my daughter's school field trip group. The facility was spacious. Rides and games were in overall very good condition. Restaurant food very tasty. Love the variety of ices drinks. It is not cheap, so bring plenty of money $50+ if you really want to",
          "Miniature golf was a lot of fun, but the arcade games were a rip off. Some of the games charged $2-$2.50 per game and ended within 15 seconds if you were killed. For $2-$2.50 I was expecting my kids to at least get a couple of minutes of game play. Very disappointing. If we come",
          "Been here a couple of times. I must say Laser Tag is my favorite. I like it when its every man for himself. I dont like the team thing. Its lots of small children there, so be on the lookout for them. Doesnt bother me, but just be on the lookout for it. This is definitely a",
          "From the food to mini go carts....all members of your family can find something fun to do here! A bit pricey, but worth it for a place everyone can enjoy!",
          "I spent some time here on a team building excursion, and we all had a great time. I loved the 4D ride/game, and the go carts were fun as well. They have 4 different mini golf courses, which gives plenty of variation. I know the kids love it, but our group of adults had just as",
          "Like all of these fun park places, the cost of the good time is higher than one would like. My little girl loved just spinning the wheel for tickets, but it was 1.50 or 2 dollars per spin. It was her vacation and she loved it though. Each of my crew won fairly big at at least",
          "We love going to Frankie's Fun Park! We had friends with kids in from out of town and we all went to Frankie's... what a blast! Parents could sit and chat, kids could play, we all sat and had a nice meal.. just a great go to for fun with kids!",

          "We visited here in September 2016 with friends and family. Lots of activities (we did Go Kart, Laser Tag, Slick Track and indoor games) and all were really fun. The Laser Tag was a bit short in length (only 5-6 minutes). They have a nice bar area for adults who want to relax",

          "We went with a group of adult guy friends for some good laughs and fun. It was great, go carts, laser tag, batting cages. Although I had been many times for kids, this was unique and a lot more fun than some thought it would be. A bar in the back provided a good break in",

          "There is nothing special about this place. While there an ok amount of games/attractions to keep you busy, after about an hour or so I was done and board with what was there. I wouldn't suggest eating there. Typical mediocre food for a place of this caliber.",
          "We would definitely go back here again. There is plenty of stuff to do for all ages. However be sure that if you plan on spending very long here at all, that you take plenty of money. We found that we had to keep adding money to our card over and over . We a ate the",
          "Of course my kids loved this place. But it's easy to spend $30 per kid in an hour. We did have fun but going to Carowinds would have been a much better choice and lasted all day for the same amount of money.",
          "While visiting with family in North Carolina, we all journeyed to Frankie's Fun Park. The first thing my nephew wanted to play was a round of miniature golf. He certainly had the right idea. This fun packed facility has something for every member of the family to enjoy. For",

          "We stopped here passing thru, we stayed for about 2 1/2 hours and didn't even get done with everything inside, needless to say, we never even got started on the outside. This place is awesome!!!! I can't wait to go back when we have more time to do it all. They have a grill",
          "There is a jungle gym inside, machines, archade so the kids can get tired! And also food is available",
          "Great place to take the kids. They love all the games go karts bumper cars and more. Keep in mind they are a little on the pricey side so plan on dropping cash when you go. Great place for birthday parties as they are always accommodating. Parents have fun too as I alway have to",
          "We found this place by accident. Great places for kids and adults of all ages. Our 3 year old was in arcade heaven and when he was done playing games he played in the jungle gym thing. The coolest part of the jungle gym is that parents sit underneath it with large screen tvs to",
          "We have taken our 3 kids here multiple times over the years and have had a blast! Although this place is expensive, it's worth it for several reasons... they keep the place well staffed, clean and updated. There is still a large indoor play/climbing structure that is literally",

          "Big place with more than 3 zone to play (exercise).. Main trampoline on ground very nice and easy...a lot of mat , then a sort of parcour with rope, or bridge to pass, or the diving place..i mean..you can fall with no problem you ate caught up by thousand of hi-density foam",
          "In the area to celebrate my Nieces birthday and we ended up at Frankie's. It was really slow on the evening of the 29th of Nov but the weather was great. They rode the go carts several times and it was nice to only have about 10 carts on the track and they didn't have to wait",
          "Best place in town to take your kids. Lots of fun games. Pizza was excellent. My grandson hit the jackpot on his first attempt.",
          "My Kids had soo much fun and so did I. The lasertag and Go Carts were a hit. Then the batting cage was cool as well.",
          "We took our grandchildren there and they had a lot of a fun!!! Seems kept up well and the staff was generally helpful. They have things to do for almost any age. Don't go there without being ready to drop some money. As with most amusement places it is a little pricey.",
          "We were visiting family in Raleigh and my cousin told me she passes this place on her way to work. I checked out the website and suggested we go. It was very warm and not raining so the attractions outside were going. We had a great time especially on the go karts. I enjoyed",
          "I've been to Frankie's many many times and it's such a fun place to go! When you go in, you go to the front desk and they give you a little 'credit card' for the games. You load it with your own money, ($10,$15,$20+), and then with just that little card, you can play every game",
          "We went to the slip and slide go kart track. Arrived and was on the track within 5 minutes! The karts were pretty quick but it was just the two of us on the track which means this wasn't a 5 star review. Reasonably priced and lasted about 10 minutes.",
          "We had a great time! Everything is priced reasonably. The only thing that we didn't like was the baseball cages. The helmets are in horrible condition and there aren't many size options at all. It seems everything about the cages have been neglected. My husband and son both",
          "What a great place to go with friends and enjoy video games, laser tag,skee ball, and more. You get a card and put money onto it which is used for the activities. I love Frankie's. HOWEVER, I don't suggest eating anything there.",
          "This is a great place to come to when you want to have fun with your family and friends. The rides are awesome. The games are awesome. The food is awesome. There something for everyone to do and participate in. I encourage everyone to go out to Frankie's and have a good time!",

          "Mini golf and the go karts were fun for a mixed age group. We were able to get a group rate (10 or more) that made the cost reasonable (~$22 ea) for about 2 hours of play outside. If you do indoor games you will run through your Frankie cash card quickly. We were there on a",
          "I brought my buddies here after a long day of driving. We had a lot of laughs and overall it was a good night. Frankie's is an arcade with a lot of outdoor activities, but have the credit card handy. You need to get a Frankie's Card and load that up. Most games were at least",
          "Love the additional games and rides and they aren't too overly priced but I do wish there was some way to do an unlimited package deal. I almost wanted to grab four random people and split the cost on a party instead of paying for each thing separately. The arcade is crazy huge,",

          "I only recently discovered Frankies - wish I had discovered it sooner. They have all the games and fun stuff of course - they also have a (family) restaurant. What I like is that they also have a grown up bar for the big kids - best of both worlds! :)",
          "I've been to Frankie's twice this year on visits to Raleigh. It always proves to be a fun time (water boats, go-carts, batting cages, laser tag, arcade, etc.) Each time there were no lines at any ride. Although, this is likely due to the a la carte pricing. $5-$7 per 5",
          "I had the displeasure of bringing my boys and their 2 cousins here a few weeks ago. You need to BUY a Frankie's gift card and then load it with real dollars using cash or a credit card. We put $20 on each card and they used all that money in about 30 minutes. The first ride",

          "Be prepared to spend money - even if you only do the arcade games. Actually my family has only done the arcade games, we've never had time to try the outdoor activities, though they look fun. We always enjoy an outing here and winning prizes with our electronic tickets we earn.",
          "I absolutely love the laser tag at Frankies. Amongst the games and other rides, you can spend a few hours and a few hundred if you are not careful but the kid at heart will love it!",
          "We went on a day during drizzle, therefore most of the outdoor attractions were unavailable. The indoor attractions were fun. The one ride that repeatedly lifts and drops is thrilling for young and old kids alike. Nice separate eating area overlooking floor.",
          "The go karts is all we go for. My husband's company had their Christmas party here & it was great. The food was also delightful.",
          "Went to Frankie's with my family and we had a blast. Fun for all ages and even has a restaurant inside. Indoors they have arcades, a small alley, air hockey, laser tag and way more games that my younger one loves. Outdoors they have a rope climbing (that we all did and love),",
          "Took 2 kids there and got a $50 card. They did 3 things each (mini golf, jungle gym, and one game of laser tag) and money was gone. We were barely there any time at all.",
          "Folks they do not have enough staff to man all of the attractions. We were told we would have to wait 30 min for someone to eat their lunch. The manager reported no one else could man the sky rail . This is poor planning on their part and poor customer service. If you want to",

          "My Husband and I went. We decided to grab something to eat first.The good was good but expensive. Hint: You can easily share the Italian sub and fries with your friend/partner. They require you to get \"fun cards\" (no tokens) but charge you 25 cents to activate it?!? The games",
          "Very clean and up-to-date place, but game prices are steep, decent prizes are unattainable unless you have stupid amounts of tickets. Really nice cafeteria area renovation!",
          "Great for a fun date or spending time with family. You cant go wrong with spending a few hours here.",
          "We took our 6 and 8 year old boys there but saw older kids there as well. There are so many things to do! We did the arcade games, mini-golf, and playhouse. But they also have laser tag, go-carts and bumper boats. You could spend a serious amount of time there! The arcade",

          "We went here on our weekend. I was shocked at the prices of the games. Most were $1.00 or more. We also did the batting cages. The bats and helmets all need replacing. Two of the machines didn't work correctly.",
          "My husband brought me out to Frankie's and we had a great time. Lots of arcade games, go-karts, golf, laser tag. Great time for kids or adults. They also have a restaurant on site.",

          "My husband and I went here to waste a few hours and had a good time, way more fun than we expected to have. The outside area has 3 mini golf courses which was nice. Batting cages had multiple speeds and had both baseball and softball pitches which was nice. Did not have to wait",
          "This is a fun place for both kids and adults. Bring $300 for about 2 people a piece between the age of 6 and older to get the full Frankie's experience. Otherwise, $50 will last about 30-45 minutes for one person. Enjoy.",
          "Held my hubby's 40th bday here as had a bar, first time for several folks and had a blast!!! Great drinks, food was good but the atmosphere was perfect, was at night when less kids so had time to enjoy the games we wanted to play.",

          "For average families the cost is out of their range, it's like the cost for planning a vacation, it's small, so they try to get all the money they can up front, incase you don't come back, if you can't afford it, they don't want you back, the bar food & drinks are top hotels",

          "The arcade, mini-golf course, and go-carts are all amazing! The food was also great! I used to go to Frankie's more frequently when I was younger, but I will never forget how amazing it is. Very fun place for families since their kids can blow off all their steam with all of the",
          "OK - my husband and I took our grandchildren to this fun park to celebrate our grandson's 5th birthday. We live 2 hours away and are not accustomed to such large amusement places. I suppose the pricing is average for the area - personally I found .75, $1.00 and $2.00 per play",
          "We need more Frankie's in other States. I moved to Maryland and there's no Frankie's! This would help the population (low-med income families) that cannot afford to get in the gate at the big amusement parks for one and it help give more jobs especially since the unemployment",
          "We love this place for treating the kids on special occasions. Expensive but worth the money. Clean, great variety of attractions for all ages over 5, both indoors and out. Favorites are go carts, ropes course, indoor Fun House, and a great mini golf course. Great to have an",
          "Having an 11yo, wanted to find something \"fun\" for him to do on our trip to Raleigh. Frankies was the perfect spot. He drove go carts, so did my husband. We played a round of family mini golf with many laughs. Love that you can put money on one \"credit card\" and they slide",
          "Frankie's is very expensive! Be prepared! The go cart tracks and options are great and there is a lot to do here, but you will pay for it. Each time you ride a go cart it is $6, the ropes course, $7, small amusement ride $4, spider crawl $5 (for the day on this one), laser tag",
          "My grand kids came to town for a visit and looking for activities for them, we went to Frankies. It pleased me to see the kids having a ball! I'm tempted to return with an adult group after a nice dinner and a couple of cocktails :) I just need to save up a little extra spending",
          "We visited our friends in NC and I had looked up different places to go while there that the kids will enjoy. One of them that stood out is Frankies. Coming from FL where Orlando is only a 3 hr drive from us, we are used to big places with all the rides and services you can",
          "Very expensive, not a lot of game inside kids enjoyed but outside made up for it. Putt putt makes a nice end to the day driving go karts, bumper boats and sky walking was nice.",
          "A cooler summer's evening spent with family who've emigrated to Raleigh. Great selection of things to do keeping kids, adults and families of all kinds entertained. We loved the rides and mini golf with a choice of three courses (I think)! A great treat but I imagine it",
          "Took my grandkids to Frankie's fun park and they had a great time. Each game was a different amount. You can put $25 on a fun card but depending what the child wants to do won't last long. We stayed an hour and a half that was enough for my wallet. The kids had a ball lots",

          "The Go-Karts, laser tag and inside games are fun to do and with us being right down the road, you would think we would go all the time. The issue is that is cost around 50.00 or more every time just to do a few of the activities. The facility is nice and the staff is",
          "I wouldn't pay for the arcade games they seemed over priced, however, the other activities seemed worth the money and my eight year old had a blast especially in the tower. Much better place than chuckie cheese or anything like it. More activities for the whole family. Would go",
          "While most arcades let you play a game for around a quarter, Frankie's charges anywhere from $1 to $3. (Most are a buck fifty to two dollars.) The attractions (Including go-carts and laser tag) range for $6 to $8 dollars. The attractions are very short. A round of laser tag is",

          "families by day, adults by night...this place is awesome. if you dont mind the \"amusement park\" crowds and some lines you will enjoy this venue. Friday-sunday is the busiest time of the week so expect huge crowds. the earlier in the day the better atmosphere for small children.",
          "Love this place! There are so many fun things to do and since they've revamped the inside area a bit it's even better. The restaurant is pretty good with some great diversity in what they offer. Pretty well priced, it's perfect for a date night or for kids.",
          "This arcade park has both inside and outside play areas. The staff do a great job of being friendly, helpful and available. Frankie's is always updating the games and removing or quickly repairing the games that are old or break. They keep it fresh. Also, no more paper",
          "The place is very clean and well run but you need to be a king to spend much time there. They offer no discounts or package deals. Kids have fun if you can afford to let them play for more than 2hrs.",
          "Scheduled my son's 7th birthday party at Frankie's recently. The service in the food area was atrocious and the manager cut the birthday cake and served it to my son's friends even before we sang Happy Birthday and lit the candles. For a group of 16 kids and approx. 8 parents,",
          "Every summer when we take the trip to Durham for family time we stop a Frankie's at least twice. It has become sort of a tradition. Our kids love it. The games are great for every age group so the adults are not bored, it's safe and the staff are always helpful. The food is",

          "Loved the combination of old school and new games and activities. Did care much for the rule that you couldn't play games with a cocktail...but I get it. Also, why did you sell me tickets to the outdoor activities when they are shut down and will remain shut down 1 hour after it",
          "This place was awesome!! My kids loved the karting tracks and video games. It was really expensive though so we could never do it on a regular basis. We gave each child $5 and it lasted 2-3 video games.",
          "My kids LOVE Frankies. LOVE it. I can't say I enjoy going there personally - it can get expensive pretty quickly, it's sprawling so easy to lose sight of someone, and it is chaotic when it's busy. That said, the fact that my kids have so much fun there and that there IS a wide",
          "Frankie's is a great place, not only for kids, but for the adults too! My husband and I try to visit every time we are in the Raleigh-Durham area. Our last visit was in October, we were out celebrating my birthday. We had the best time! We spent most of our time in the arcade",

          "Frankie's is an awesome place for kids and teenagers...and adults. It has several rides that you can do, but they each cost between $6-$7. The go carts are excellent and so is the Skywalk. The arcade games are fun, but add up very quickly...watch out, you can spend $20 in a",
          "My kids loved this place, but I found it a bit pricey. There are a lot of activities, both inside and outside, so we did both. It's good for a day when you have nothing to do - but be prepared to spend money on the attractions. It's adds up quickly!",
          "Met some friends out here for a birthday gathering! Had a blast! Give it a try - its close - its fun - its inexpensive - and your kids will love it! Everybody wins!",
          "seriously, everything you want, but be prepared to have the kids keep coming back for more moola. Stuff for everyone, and everything is well done. Just don't come expecting to get away for less than $100 overall.",

          "We've been to Frankie's a few times with the kids and always have a great time. W love their boat game where you spray which other with water and the go carts are fun and mini golf has lots of courses. It isn't too too expensive but once you let the kids hit the arcade forget",
          "The group had fun, especially with the outside activities. Food was surprisingly good. High end bar food but fun. Service for beverages was slow and hard to find staff when you needed them. Inside games were limited.",

          "Good staff, kind of noisey..but overall it was a good experience. Although it can get a little pricey. Kids will love you for taking them there but won't want to leave when you're broke. Haha",
          "First I have to say my children have a great time when they go here. But my pocket book always seems to suffer. The putt putt is well maintained and one of the nicest in the area. Go carts for all ages are available. Indoor and outdoor attractions are great but when it rains it",
          "I take my kids to Frankie's for birthdays or just to have fun. The outdoor and indoor activities are really good and fun for tweens and teens. Arcade games are pricey. The place has a nice restaurant.",

          "Frankie's is alright. It's exactly what one would expect from those fun plexes that all cities seem to have now with the go carts and miniature golf. It's good for days where the family wants to play without thinking too much. However it's hit or miss with the staff and other",

          "Frankie's is always a fun filled ruckass for our family. We load up the cards and head out, usually one of the kids goes straight for the spider web or the drop zone. Thankfully the fun cards can be used for these, since they cost $5 extra. The batting cages were a little",

          "Mostly geared toward kids, but still enough for us grown-ups to do! :-) Be sure to try the go-carts (we drove the full road course). We liked the \"green\" card system - no piles of paper tickets to carry around nor pockets full of tokens; you simply purchase ($0.25) a plastic",
          "This place is great for kids. The place is nice and well kept. It's well worth the trip compared to the other place in Raleigh. The price is a little bit more than I expected but it's good for a half day of fun.",

          "Had my son's bday get together there. We actually had a blast. We didn't eat the food there, but enjoyed all the games and attractions. It was rather pricey so be sure to bring enough $$. Our age range was 4 to 14, so there was plenty enough for each to do, including myself. Us",

          "It's expensive for a family to visit, with each attraction costing $6-8 per person... but the venue is clean, bright and well maintained. It's perfect for families with kids from 5-16 years old (nothing for kids under 5 really). 3 nice go-cart tracks with different levels,",
          "A fun park for the whole family. There's golf and go-karts and arcade games a-plenty. It can get pricey, but if you don't get food, it's not terrible for a family outing.",

          "This was my first time here. It was very fun even though I cam with little funds in my pocket. I enjoyed my self along with my children especially. Playing the coin games that were 3-D, interactive, and animated. My stay was short about 1-2 hours. I am surely going back to stay",
          "It's a good place to take kids, but as an adult I have gone there with just a few friends. Don't expect a lot of variety it's small and money goes a little faster, no coins just swiping. There is a restraunt in house that has a fancy feel and family friendly casual dress",
          "had a great time with my young cousins in the arcade, bumper boats and go carts. great for a rainy day but more fun seeing the kids getting tickets and trading them in for silly stuff.",
          "Very big place, but if your a teenager or adult looking for a adrenline rush on the race track your out of luck, the cars are slow and for the record me and my bf were not on the rookie track.Also make sure you watch where you put your hands there is sharp metal from edges to",

          "Went on a Sunday afternoon (I think), and it was extremely crowded. While I like fun parks and such, I can't stand it when they let so many people in you practically can't move. The mini-golf courses were fun, that's all we ended up doing because that was the least crowded.",

          "OK, admittedly, this place gets loud and busy, but it's a great place to take your kids and grandkids for dinner and fun. Just make sure you decide how much each one can spend before you go! Believe us, they will always want to spend more here!",
          "It is a nice, clean family park but it is pretty spendy. To take 2 kids it cost over $75.00 for them to take part in 5 activities each.",
          "Always have a lot of fun here. I love their go carts, especially the slick track. The miniature golf courses (three) are nice as well. I have never done any of the indoor activities but they seem like a lot of fun. There are many good places to eat nearby as well.",

          "Frankie's rocks! You can go in, visit the full bar and restaurant, have a good meal, not just junk food, and play all afternoon!! It is crazy inside but there seems to be enough room to get around. Great for birthday parties",

          "We love Frankie's and often go here with kids for birthdays or just fun afternoon. The put-put courses are fun as are the different go cart/race tracks. The tall tower outside (forgot the name) is too scary for me, but friends love going waaay up in their harness and walking on",
          "My daughter loved the laser tag and the go carts in particular, but like most similar places it is expensive by the time they did everything they wanted to do and had snacks. It was safe and well managed, and she plans to go again next weekend for another field trip!",
          "Me, 40 (something) with my daughter 19 and son 15 had a blast! We were on vacation and went to Frankie's twice! Laser tag, mini golf (gorgeous), all the games, it was a great time!!!!!!",
          "Came here on an end of year field trip with my son's school. It was a lot of fun but you better have A LOT of money with you. We got a deal because it was with the school for the \"rides\". But the school made us bring our own lunch because it was too expensive to eat there.",
          "The fun park was nice - the indoor arcade and the outdoor Go-Karts and the mini-golf. I've eaten there twice and both times the food was good, and the selection was what you would expect to find at a decent American style restaurant, but the food was not cheap, even for an",
          "We went to Frankie's for my husband's 30's birthday, and had a good time. However, it was PACKED, and we had to wait a long time for our table at the restaurant (even though we called ahead). There were also tons of obnoxious teens, but we know that isn't the establishment's",

          "The go-carts and mini golf are fun and probably worth the money. The indoor games can get pricey fast. If you're trying to win tickets figure each will cost 10cent. Made that 7000 ticket plastic toy pretty expense for my nephew.",

          "Collection of video games doesn't change out often. Overall it can be a pretty expensive afternoon. Laser tag is well done however. Food is surprisingly good.",
          "My first reaction was that the place was pretty pricey. However, all of the attractions are kept in very good condition, everything appeared to be operated in a safe manner, and we had a good time. The mini-golf was done very well and it's probably the most reasonably priced",
          "This place is so much fun! It has a little bit of everything for all ages! The food in the restaurant is really good too! My daughter had her birthday party here and the staff was absolutely amazing! Highly recommend!",

          "Frankie's is loud, obnoxious, and expensive . . . So of course, my boys love it. I love the on sight restaurant. Every time I go to Frankie's I eat there. Initially, you will think . . . Ah, typical bar/chain restaurant food but that assessment couldn't be further from the",
          "I went here with family aged 56-28. Everyone had a great time. We did a few rounds of go carts. It was $6 per person for each ride which lasted about 5 minutes. They were a lot of fun. We also tried the batting cages-not as fun. The balls didn't come out & they had to keep",
          "Your kids will love this place & the adults too. The attractions add up pretty fast though when it so much you want to do. I say go in with a set price & place on Frankie's Fun Card. Once your money runs out on card, you're done. It'll teach you to spend wisely.",
          "We always have a great time here. We especially enjoy the miniature golf and skee-ball, the children love the Fun House. The place is rather noisy (which is to be expected) and needs more staff members for adequate supervision, in my opinion.",
          "just another expensive mini-theme park. very expensive for what you get. too many pre-teens running wround screaming",
          "We visting Frankies and was really pleased with the amount of options including 3 different mini golf courses. Great place for a night out. The property includes batting cages, go cart racing, mini golf, laser tag and a full arcade.",
          "My fiance took my son and I to Frankie's for our weekend family time. We all enjoyed. My son age 11 was super excited. Just about everything we done we done together. From batting cage, bumper boats to laser tag. Then inside we enjoyed many great games. It was a little costly",
          "This was our first time to Frankie's fun park and we are so glad we went! There is something for everyone, young to old. Lots of people were having birthday parties. My 2 year old and 4 year old had plenty and loved every bit of it!",
          "Great place for a B-Day experience. But, it can get a little pricey.",
          "To be fair, a visit to Frankie's is like hell for me. But I understand that some folks like video arcades, sensory bombardment, cheap prizes, and overpowering fumes from the go-carts.",
          "My kids had a wonderful time-the rides and games were wonderful. The downside was there were very few places for adults to sit. They have a restaurant inside, but frown on people sitting inside, unless you are dining.",
          "I liked that it had activities for my teens and my husband and I to enjoy!",
          "Not too many places you can go play putt putt, drive cars, shot people, bowl and have a beer.",
          "I love it here. We even had our 3 year old birthday party here over the summer. So much fun and so much to do! Its indoors and outdoor fun! Mini golf, go karts, tons of arcade games, bowling, and jungle gym! And so much more!",
          "We have visited 3 times and just love it each time. There is so much to do! We like to play on the dance game as well as the indoor bowling and shoot some hoops. The laser tag is a must do! We had a blast and it is well worth the $6 and wait. A little hint, get a big",

          "I have never heard of this place but now every time im near im dying to go.. This place was amazing. Kids can have fun and adults can find their inner child. I cant wait to go again.",

          "We did the go-carts, spider web, video games, and laser tag. Liked that they had fun cards so that you did not have to worry abou the kids carrying around money or tokens. There was a restaurant and a snack bar for different quality food. There is no admission price so you can",
          "My Husband took me here for my Birthday and we had a blast. We played all three of the awesome putt-putt courses, raced on the go cart track and played in the arcade. We won enough tickets to get a set of memorable glasses. It was the best birthday ever.",

          "We have held three birthday parties at Frankie's over the years, and every time has been a huge success. It is clean, very well organized, and the kids have a lot of fun. Favorites at the party have been laser tag, bumper boats, go carts and the fun house. We will be going",
          "This was our first time going here. At first you don't know where to go first so much hits you at once. But the place to go first is to get your Frankie Fun Money at the opposite wall from the front door. There is where you decide; \"Does Johnny want to golf or hit a baseball?\",",
          "When my husband first told me he wanted to go to Frankie's, I thought we'd play mini golf and head home. I was a little dubious because we don't have kids (and don't actually want to be around hundreds of screaming kids, usually!). Frankie's, as it turns out, is fun enough to",
          "We celebrated my nephew's 5 year old birthday party just as Hurricane Irene had passed, so we couldn't do the outside activities (which looked really fun). There were plenty of inside activities for both kids and adults to enjoy. Their machines take their own play cards that",

          "I like Frankie's much much more than Adventure Landing. There are more games and bigger variety of games. There is also more than go-cart track. The bumber boats, putt-putt, batting cages, and laser tag are lots of fun too. There is also a nice restaurant there too. What I like",

I loved watching my grandson beat this older guy who thought he was going to race by him because he was younger, lol.\nI'd give it 5 stars if the concession stand had a better food selection.",

          "My family of four thoroughly enjoyed this place very much. They have 3 go kart rides. The arcade us one of the best I've been in with loads of games for all to enjoy. Grateful that we found this place and had some good family fun.",
          "Its a great place to take a girl out to play and have fun or take your family or kids to have fun win some prizes for a good amound of tickets.",
          "Machines Broke.  Had to find attendants for help.  Cashiers didn't want to explain how to redeem tokens (said to read the machine). Horrible prizes for the money spent.   Horrible experience for a BIRTHDAY.",
          "This place is fun and has a lot of variety to offer. The crowd was a little much to handle. We visited from out of town and may be back. Our only complaint was the prices. Sometimes, arcade games were upwards of $2 and $3. I would say you need about $100 to visit this place to really do anything longer than 20 minutes.",
          "My kids love the tandem go carts..as does dad. One of the nicest mini golf places I've been too. Also have pretty good bar and restaurant.",
          "We have been looking for a place to take the kids since moving down from NY Frankie\u2019s is great. The arcade has a great mix of ticket challenge games and traditional arcade cabinets. They also have some higher end VR and 4D games. The mini \u2026",
          "From an arcade perspective, its relatively expensive but much cleaner and better kept than a chuckie cheese",
          "I had soo much fun. The food was terrific. Bar was excellent and I loved the rides.",
          "Good place for a work outing or kid's birthday party.  Mini golf is actually not bad, and the slick track is really fun.",
          "Absolutely a great place for kids AND adults! We spent hours there! Prices are great & they have a full bar attached to a eatery! Definitely will be back!",
          "Family fun! Why did I not know about this fun zone?!?!? My family and I had a great time! Lots of things to do & play for all ages! Did I mention that my young adults 19 & 17 enjoyed themselves \ud83c\udfa4",
          "It was a very nice experience, really fun and the staff it's very friendly, I had a wonderful time playing and eating here!",
          "From what I seen and experience so far is that this amusement park is very nice and well keep. The people who work there are beautiful and well mannered. I would recommend this park to anyone who have young children. It's a nice place to go for anyone of all ages. This park has something for everyone.",
          "A great place for the whole family, a couple or just for friends hanging out! Great fun from laser tag, go cart racing, bumper boats to mini golfing and much more! Plan for a day trip and go have some fun! Plenty of fun for kids and adults! Food at reasonable prices and a fully stocked bar.",
          "Fun place. Grandson had a blast and so did the grandparents.",
          "My son loves this place!!! We have so much fun!",
          "Frankie's fun park...more like Frankie's awesome park. Games are a little pricey but eh worth it.",
          "Something for everyone, from kids to geezers. Indoor and outdoor games and rides. Decent food menu and alcohilic drinks.",
          "Customer service was horrible!! This was our first time going to Frankie\u2019s and not one staff member greeted us. We go in line to pay for put putting and nobody spoke to us just each other. Same for getting the balls and putts. When my \u2026",
          "We had a great day here. Played a round of mini golf. Grabbed some icees then we walked around. My grandson rode the \ngo carts and bumper boats and had a blast.\nWe will be back.",
          "My kids having fun on the go-carts!",
          "The family played golf and spent about an hour in the arcade. It's a nice mixture of kids and adult games. About 5 games were out of order, but otherwise no other issues.",
          "Good place to take your kids. Went for a team outing there, which was fun\ud83d\ude1c",
          "Wanna try Tokyo drift from 2F2F, this is the place to go!!! Had fun on race tracks, 3D game, laser tags and much more",
          "Weekend getaway to Raleigh. We enjoyed the go karts! Great selection of games inside. Easy process to load cards for my girls. Hubby and I were at the bar. Nice set up for everyone! No complaints.",
          "Nice fun place really for kids and families. Go karts were a blast",
          "The mini golf is super fun. The course is well made and clean. Its 9$ per person which is extremely cheap for a fun filled afternoon. They also have batting cages my husband tried it and found it good too. The batting cage are 2$ per round.",
          "Great place to celebrate your birthday because there's fun for all ages. Nice environment, had a great time!",
          "Lots of fun stuff to do here. Every one is nice, but not super informative. It was my friend's first time, and it has been about 6 years since my last visit. The customer service was friendly, but lacked details. After taking our card the \u2026",
          "Had a great time staff was amazing..  only reason I rated a 4 star is because it's ALOT of money. And the ropes course needs to be replaced and upgraded.",
          "There was a lot to do here and the diversity of activities was convenient to have. However, there are a lot of gimmicks to take your money in the arcade area and the putt putt golf course was really boring and homogeneous. Check out the \u2026",
          "I've been going to this place since the early-mid 2000's with my now wife. We took our kids there last weekend and they loved it. Excellent place to bring kids.",
          "I love it so much! It makes me happy! \ud83e\udd29",
          "Such a cool place for family fun!! Go karts, indoor jungle gym and arcade, bumper boats, virtual reality games, a few carnival style rides, mini golf course, concession food plus a restaurant lounge with full bar. They had something for \u2026",
          "Kids love it, but money leaves your wallet quickly here. Overall a great way to spend a few hours if you're looking to get out of the weather.",
          "My son loved his racer car experience. Although my son is 3yrs old, they provide to steering wheels which made him think he was actually thr driver. Great family place. Some of the games were out of order but overall fun time.",
          "Their internal card reader system kept failing so you had to wait in line longer for everything. The people behind the counters were less than helpful. The slick track was not even staffed.",
          "One of my favorite stores to shop at. Everyone here is very friendly & provide excellent customer service. I can get what I need for a great price.",
          "Something for everyone. A little pricey but it was worth it overall. Would have preferred better prizes in the arcade like Dave&Busters but that's a personal thing I guess. Great for kids. Also they have like 15 slushie flavors which was random and really cool---try the watermelon flavor it was awesome!",
          "A great local entertainment venue. Lots of activities for kids, whether they be small to large. Note that food took a long time to come to us at the counter service location.  Other than that the prices are relatively low.  Overall, I want to (and plan to) come back soon!  I would highly recommend it!",
          "typical arcade and fun center however had three awesome go-kart tracks and a large half putt golf course that was super cool lots of laughs on go-karts made the cost very worthwhile about $140 for four people three children one adult road the go-karts 3 x laser tag one time each and played arcade games",
          "A very family friendly and fun arcade and small theme park. We have visited multiple times but not ventured to the theme park yet, however there are always queues of families to get out there so I assume it must be as entertaining as the \u2026",
          "Always a bang for your buck never disappoints",
          "Expensive food and its mostly serve yourself. One soda was out of ice and the other out of almost all soda....and it was crazy busy. Condiments were out. Ppl talking orders were slow. Tables weren't cleaned off. \nThe games of course are fine, kids had fun. \nWe likely won't eat there again tho.",
          "The games, food and drinks are great but I think there should be definitely some training on the customer service there. If you have any questions they are very short, and you get ignored a lot. I understand that there are teens working there but I\u2019d say the my need customer service training like chick-fila.",
          "This place is so amazing! There is go-kart racing, Golf, and a great arcade! I definitely reccomend you to go here!",
          "Pretty cool place. Lots of outdoor stuff to do fit kids and adults. Batting cages are horrible though and don't work.",
          "Great place for family & friends! Lots of games to play from carnival like to adventure rides! Besides just in door games there's plenty of outdoor games like batting cages, go-carts, boats & miniature golf. There's also a good variety of \u2026",
          "Initially thought it was a great place until 2 min after my daughter left her phone in the restroom it was STOLEN! The staff came across unbothered and not concerned at all. One young lady didn't even check behind the desk or assist my \u2026",
          "Kids love it here, so much for them to do all day.",
          "This place used to be ok but we went today and found out they tore down our kids favorite attraction.   The big 3 story Jungle Gym.  I guess they figured kids were spending too much time in there and not enuf on their arcades. And we all \u2026",
          "The staff was not friendly at all. You pay to do something and they don't even tell you which way to go. They just walk off. The putt putt and fun house were both fun and that's about all. The food was expensive and burnt. Not worth the money.",
          "The outside rides are open today.",
          "Lots to do. It\u2019s like a huge Dave & busters/chuck e cheese for all ages. But way better and cheaper prices. The go kart racing was fun and wasn\u2019t short. Food was cheap. Only thing is there was a ton of people. Some lines were long but to be expected. I will definitely visit the charlotte location next.",
          "I always enjoy Frankie's even though I'm a grown up :) my son gets to have fun as well as adults. He loves laser tag and putt putt and I quite enjoy the arcade games. Drop zone was a blast! Only issue I has was waiting to redeem our \u2026",
          "The pros: lots (and lots. And even more) of game options- from giant spinning wheels to basketball and bowling. The games my kiddos played have a decent amount of tickets (in the 30-75 range). If you don\u2019t like the arcade, there is still a \u2026",
          "This place was awful...some of the attractions were not working, the employees were ALL young teenagers and most of them that we came in contact with had bad attitudes, I saw no supervision over the employees nor over the outside \u2026",
          "Although this place is extremely popular in the Triangle area, this was my first time going. I played through two courses on the putt putt courses. It had been a long time since I've played putt putt and it showed. The course was fun with plenty of hole in one opportunities. With a few courses it never felt too busy.",
          "Great location to take kids for any event",
          "It was awesome. Great place to go on a date or take the family. If a game does not work call an attendant for assistance.",
          "Prices keep going up and the service keeps getting worse. After waiting about 5 minutes, literally had to wave my hands to get the attention of the FOUR employees chit chatting behind the counter. When one finally asked what we needed, we got serious attitude. So disappointing as Frankie's has always been a favorite date night spot.",
          "Great family spot!  Reasonable priced games and a full bar for adults.",
          "So much fun lots of people.",
          "Love the Go Karts! Food is good and staff were very accommodating.",
          "This place used to be something I would love. Unfortunately they got rid of one of my faviorte things to do (the spider web) and also they always close down the wind glider. \nThe food on the other hand is expensive but it was very good! \u2026",
          "I've been going to the Frankie's in Charleston since I was a kid. After I moved to Columbia, I've grown to like this one. Compared to the Frankie's in Charleston, this one is bigger so they have more selection with the video games and have \u2026",
          "Fun is in the name. The kids always love it.  So much to keep everyone entertained.",
          "Great family fun.Celebrated my daughter's birthday.Has a lot going on everywhere!! It was quite busy going the day before Easter.I particularly enjoyed the Rabbit game.First virtual ride/game so much fun!!This is right inside the entrance \u2026",
          "Nice enough place, but really overpriced. $8 per person on the go karts, etc. Games are all $1-$4. $32 for four people to ride go karts for 3 minutes?? Not a bad place to spend some time if it wasn't so expensive.",
          "Nice fun place. Lots of nice attractions. In serious need of a bigger location, they've pretty much maxed out the limited space they have. Inadequate parking, good luck finding a free spot.",
          "Real fun place for the whole family",
          "The best of the frankies I've been to.  Been to all of them just about and this location is the better one by far.  Haven't been to the newest one in Charlotte yet but i have a feeling this one is still the better one.",
          "I love go karts!!! And the rope course was awesome too! This is a great place to go for adults and kids. Be prepared to spend a small fortune.",
          "Best places to have Family fun night!",
          "I liked the place and it was really fun, but there were some down sides. Some rides outside were either too packed or were temporarily shut down so I didn't get to ride that much. Inside it was nice but it was very crowded. Also some of the \u2026",
          "Very Good Place to have fun with kids",
          "Our visit was disappointing.  The staff tried their best to avoid the customers.  On several occasions we asked for help and the staff seemed to scatter and go out of their way to not help us.  It wasn't any one or two people it was EVERY \u2026",
          "I love Frankie's all the stables of a family amusement park. Go karts, putt putt, batting cages, bumper boats and more. The prices are acceptable and the facility is always clean.",
          "Good time for everyone. Kids and adults can enjoy themselves here.",
          "Such a fun place for kids and adults!",
          "It was a lot of fun for a rainy day",
          "Go karts was so fun",
          "Awesome place for kids n family..",
          "Money trap! Go during the week if you don't want a crowd. On the weekend people come out of the woodwork to partake and the abundance of activities. Benefit of going during the wekend is you could easily play multiple rounds of minigolf and nobody would know any better.",
          "Park is great, lots to do and always have a great time here. Only issue is the staff is MISERABLE. I get it, its summer, work stinks, but it's not hard to pretend to be nice to a customer....right?",
          "Nice place. Took my 4 yr old grandson one weekend. He couldnt redeem his ticket s because only one person working. We decided to come back.",
          "Good place to take the kids for a day.",
          "Lots of fun!  Went here with coworkers and we battled it out at Lazer tag and speed it out at the go karts. The wings are really good and the drinks are on point!  Much recommended.",
          "Drove 10 miles on Saturday morning with my child to have some fun. These folks didn\u2019t even bother updating their google information to say they were closed for a private corporate party. They didn\u2019t put any signs out or anything. We were \u2026",
          "Need to be bigger and more park in space",
          "Go spend some bucks and enjoy the time and who you're with while there. Go get soaked and soak others while boating ! Clean and safe with caring employees.",
          "Took my wife and daughter. We had fun on the Road Course race track and Mini Golf. It was our first time going and will be going back soon. I recommend going. It is a good outing for the family.",
          "Its  so fun but when it's time to leave you never want to",
          "We had a great time. Our son drove his 1st go-cart. It is a great place to spend time with our family and have some fun.",
          "Very fun place for kids and adults alike but wish they would come up with some sort of deals like Galaxy fun park and Adventure Landing because we go those places often but since Frankie's is so expensive it's gonna be more like an annual \u2026",
          "This amusement park had terrible service and absolutely rude.  We had bought tickets and were going to go karts when it started to rain.  They decide to close the slick track and said the road track is open still.  We went over to the road \u2026",
          "Great for the Kids. Not too expensive either.",
          "My grandson, 3 years old, goes to pre school across of Frankie\u2019s.\nI take him to Frankie\u2019s at least once a week.  Today we went there along with my niece, 9 years old and my husband.  We took several rides and ate there, the amount of money \u2026",
          "I enjoyed the go karts very much. We also got to enjoy alcohol beverages at the bar. This fun park Can be on the costly side but you can definitely make it work",
          "It wad fun but it needed more games",
          "Customer service could be better!",
          "Great fun! multiple miniature golf courses that are kept in great shape. The entire place is clean and safe as they keep a good security staff.  The food is pricy but pretty good too.",
          "My family visited and we had a great time, skip the arcade games they are pricey and ticket payouts were a joke! Also avoid visiting the kids play area the big jungle gym thing. The TV's play nothing but QVC and they employees treat it as a \u2026",
          "It was fun it was my cousins birthday so it was great but the ticket prizes are trash",
          "Good security. Adequate parking.",
          "Loud and crowded at the best of times, and expensive, but it's what my kids wanted to do on a rainy cold day. Plenty to do outside as well, when the weather is good.",
          "This is the place to take the kids and let them burn off some extra Energy. They have indoor jungle gym for the younger kids, video games arcade for the older ones and adults+ basketball games, inside restaurant, miniature golf....etc, just too many attractions. Check it out for yourself.",
          "Its like a kids casino, i enjoyed the place...... but you better carry some bucks with you though.",
          "Kids absolutely loved this place.",
          "Had fun but a lot of machines didn't work and a few employees had major attitudes when asked a question about how things worked. Our First time there so wasn't sure what we needed to do. Didn't deserve attitude.",
          "We all had a great time! Staff was friendly. We ate at the food court. Food was okay. Stayed there close to 5 hours! Even all of us adults had a fun time.",
          "Frankie's fun park is fun for families I have a really fun mini golf they got bumper boats a very fun arcade they got good food and drinks and it really fun bumper boats drift cars you got rides he was a very fun place to be play mini-golf \u2026",
          "Was ok alot of construction wish we would have known that",
          "A little busy but a lot of fun. The Chill Lounge even made for a nice oasis, away from the kids and the noise. I only wish there had been some sort of shop to get a t-shirt.",
          "Love this place. Can have fun with my kids grandkids or my friends.",
          "You would think with all the reviews talking about the rude service that it would have been addressed by now. This was our second visit to the park. Our first experience almost everyone we came into contact with was very unwelcoming and \u2026",
          "So much fun as a big kid. Very fun VR activities as well as go carts and drinks that you are able to walk around with!",
          "Best place for family and couple date",
          "Came here for the go karts and was disappointed. Tracks are interesting and could have enjoyed the big track but it's downfall is the karts themselves. Engine sounds as though their either underpowered, governed or not tuned right. Batting \u2026",
          "This place is just all around great for families ! The staff is amazing, especially the guys who work out on the go-kart tracks ! I would highly recommend anyone to visit Frankie\u2019s Fun Park if they\u2019re in the area !",
          "Nice for all ages had fun",
          "Place had a lot to offer, but you blow through money. I was disappointed to see a dollar charge for some games that only gave you one try. My kids died instantly and 2 bucks done in 5 seconds. We did not go to the outside amusements, so I can only comment on the arcade.",
          "Go carts are great but if your a couple per one of the go cart operationers it is 16.00 to ride . therefore your paying 8.00 just to sit down in  the double carts if you are over 54 inches tall. \"He stated it was posted inside the building as policy\" even though its not posted out at the go cart station\".",
          "My daughter enjoyed this place with her friends last weekend. Will come back soon!",
          "Very fun place! Just the rides are kinda expensive wish they were a little cheaper. $40 didnt last to long.",
          "Fun place but way too crowded and the parking isn't equipped to handle it. The games are fun. Go karting is not as fun for adults due to the low speed of the karts.  Mini golf course and laser tag stands out from the rest.",
          "I would give these folks a better review if they could understand the value of disinfection... my goodness... hundreds of filthy kids touching everything and no purell stations. When the great plague kicks off... frankies... ground zero",
          "Pros were there were lots of staff, lots of variety of food, drinks, attractions.  Cons outwighed though.  Very expensive.  Staff stood around talking to each other not customers.  Filthy tables, floors, chairs in both dining areas.",
          "Had a great time. Great for families and people of all ages. Was way more than I expected and my son had a great 12th birthday.",
          "The kids can go play and I can have a drink. Can't go wrong with that.",
          "Let me start by saying we had tons of fun with my granddaughter. Would have given 5 stars if the staff would have controlled the teenagers a bit more. I just don't think a public place is where we should be making out and getting to 3rd \u2026",
          "Me and my 6 year old daughter love to ride the go carts and the games aren't that bad either just a little expensive but within the price of the competition for what it is. Haven't tried the mini golf but looked to be decent",
          "Very beautiful place to come with your family and have a great time with the kids",
          "Nice arcade 4 all ages",
          "It can get rather hot so earlier is better in the summer but take some extra change of clothes if you have younger ones. There are lots of fun of activity\u2019s w the heat that the summer heat",
          "Had a blast with my sons. Will go back for laser tag. Fun for all ages... Didn't eat there but food smelled good.",

          "Great selection of things to do and the go karts are really cool.",
          "Lots of fun games! The mini golf course was surprisingly well-maintained and looked really nice, though this didn't help my game any.",
          "Need more actual games. Parents don't want to spend money on ticket machines.",
          "A cool place to hangout  fun for the whole family . Have theme park rides such as the freak out amusement  ride",
          "It is such  a great  place  my kids  are  having  fun",
          "We had a blast.  Gocarts,  minigolf, arcade machines, laser tag, and food.  Oh yea, the kids were very thankful when we started our journey home.  All smiles!!!",
          "Spent over 590 bucks , too many smart mouth young kids working ...... that need more customer service training but it\u2019s good family fun if you set Aside the smart mouth lil youngsters working .",
          "The prices of the acarade games are over priced.Some $2.00 and some were $3.00 spent $40.00 on games and \nwon small prizes. Staff looked clueless! Not going back again my first visit was a disaster",
          "Great place for families with kids. Went there with my boyfriend and still had so much fun.",
          "Great place  for either date nite OR to take the kids and have fun. Food isnt the best but reasonable. Lots of fun",
          "My family and I had a very great experience here. It was very fun for the kids as well as the adults. We will definitely be going back!!!!!",
          "Went there for my grandchild\u2019s birthday,the place was great. The food was affordable, and the bathrooms were clean, we enjoyed ourselves.",
          "Went to ride go carts for my kids birthday and after being asked to get off and wait because their cart wouldn't run.. twice btw.. they refused to refund the three tickets.. what a waste of time and money we will not be back and I would recommend avoiding this poorly run joke of a  business",
          "Mostly friendly and competent staff, clean, all arcade games were working. The pizza is surprisingly solid. Can't wait to go back and try the golf and go karts when it's not raining!",
          "The rides was and activities for the children are great. The customer service is very poor. Customer service gives more of an attitude like your bothering them. Other than that my kids had a wonderful time.",
          "Super fun I loved the indoor ride it was so fun and the view of the arcade just so beautiful.",
          "Nice place to take the kids. Kids ages 7-17 would really enjoy it. The day we went it got rained out. So they had to cancel outside activities. The go karts were fun. Things are kind of high priced. But overall everything was ok.",
          "Great fun even in the rain!",
          "Had a great time and the servers at the bar were awesome.",
          "Always amazing the kids love it fun for the whole family",
          "8 year old grandson had a blast! Buy a card for any amount. It works on all the attractions and video games. Helps stay in budget. Great staff, friendly and helpful",
          "there chicken tenders are greasy and there bread is soggy......but the games and rides are fun",
          "Love it! So much to do inside and out! Prices aren't too bad!",
          "Very fun for the entire family from infant up. The Only negative is that the wait line for food can get really long",
          "Awesome place to go with friends, family or as part of a date. Plenty of room to enjoy yourself and the company of whom you're with. I've never eaten here so I cant speak to the quality of the food.",

          "Always fun and entertaining,  had the best Bartender ever",
          "Great place to distract the kids for a while. It can get a little expensive. Go-Karts are safe. But the games need more variety. Most of the prizes costing 100+ tickets are flimsy toys. Getting 100 tickets requires a lot of tokens and that \u2026",
          "It's a really fun place to take your family. We actually just left. However the people at the counter that cash in your tickets are the rudest people I've ever dealt with in my life. The African american young lady with the long hair and \u2026",

          "Kids loved it adult friendly",
          "Rip off big time. Not even in International Drive Florida (which is super expensive) is as expensive as this place. Is ridiculous. Everything is new, clean and it looks awesome but I think this place is for super rich people because Franky \u2026",
          "At the time of writing this I am 32 years old. A (34 year old) friend insisted on coming here... I can see the appeal for younger kids, they all seemed to be having a blast. There is a full service bar area fully stocked, which is pretty \u2026",

          "Great place for a family day. Lots of activities, but it is pricey though.",
          "Will not be back. Frankie's use to be a decent place games started at a $1.00 now everything has jumped to 1.50 seems greedy a lot of these games are short 1-3 mins . Places like BoxCar offer more games and some start at 0.25 and up. \nI \u2026",
          "Fun for the whole family! Preferably if you have children that are at least 5+ to be able to really enjoy!",
          "Great place to take the kids for a little something different. Up to date games for the kids and they constantly add on. Lots of games and food is good. *The drinks are overpriced and flooded with ice. Bartenders had very nasty attitudes.",
          "Nice place, good food. Had lots of fun with my little one. Games... rides... Expensive. We were there 2.5hrs. Blew 300 bucks. My daughter had fun and that was really the point. Can't visit this place often for that reason though.",
          "Fun and amazing place for families. My children did not want to leave! My only issue was parking. I guess Saturday must be their busiest day!",

          "I traveled home to NC for a family reunion and afterwards 13 of us from age 6 to 42 came to frankie to enjoy the remaing of rhe night. We then decided to ride the slick track go carts. After waiting 4 rounds we had our first incidnet when \u2026",

          "We had a blast on a Friday evening and was amazed at just how many things we could do. From bumper cars to arcade machines, our large group left with a sense of satisfaction at the end of the evening. Quality fun at wonderful prices. Thanks for a  great night!",
          "Arcade was decent but management really needs to implement a no cell phone policy on their employees.  You have to \"bother\" employees to get them to even acknowledge that you are standing in front of them waiting for service.",
          "My kids and I went here for my sons birthday, and he loved it. My daughter and I did too. They have rides and games for everyone. They also have a good selection of prizes too. I highly recommend going here. You'll have as much fun as your kids.",

          "On a weekend or rainy day this place is super packed and the lines are really long. It's a great place for a family outing or a date night. The staff is very young and unprofessional though.",
          "I had a wonderful time and at a very reasonable price my kids had a ball and the food was delicious i will definitely be back once i relocate to the area",
          "Great place to have fun",
          "Nice friendly staff, they were very helpful but I guess the cleaning staff took the day off because it was pretty bad in the dining area but I don't know if that's just the usual thing with all the kids being there it's kind of hard to keep it clean.",
          "Clean and friendly service. The food is actually really good as well.",
          "Frankie's is a nice place to spend the day, with frds n family,I do feel as they could lower the amount to play some of there GM's, and also have more  than 3 rides on the outside for adults to enjoy as well,n larger go karts,also it would \u2026",
          "Fantastic fun! And I didn't even get to do most attractions, lol. 18 holes, laser tag and a few arcade games with the family and I'm gravy. \n\nFour stars because service could be better, and inside dining area needs attention. \n\nAlso, drove \u2026",
          "Cheap prices and fun to go to. Only issue is that most outdoor rides were closed",

          "It was so much fun bringing all of the kids in our family here! One of the best \"Daycation\" spots in our area.",
          "Fun place.  Rides are expensive considering the length of time one is on a ride. But otherwise a fun spot to take kids too.",
          "Outdoor activities are great. Putt putt, batting cages, several go cart tracks. Laser tag is fun on the inside. \n\nLittle disappointed in he arcade. I didn\u2019t love many of the games. Seemed like an odd assortment. Most games are $2 each. They \u2026",

          "I was very pleased with my experience. I have been looking for a nice mini golf place to take the kids and I finally found it! The restaurant has a variety of menu items and is reasonably priced.  The kids playhouse was the best. $8 and they have unlimited playtime.",
          "Great place for kids and adults",
          "I love Frankie's Fun Park. There's always a lot to do for anyone and the games and services are well maintained.",
          "I like Frankie's but the changes are bad. I miss some of the old games.",
          "The games are enjoyable even tho half were down.. However the staff is not. Me and my husband got many dirty looks. We didnt get greeted at the service counter, the lady literally dropped my game card on purpose, smacked her lips and \u2026",
          "Very expensive and very fun. I would like to see an unlimited wrist band. We would come more often if a wrist band was a choice.",

          "Overall experience was really good. Good food and fun atmosphere!",
          "Frankie's is a neat amusement park located in Durham, just across the Wake county line. Located near Route 70 near Brier Creek. There is no entrance fee or cover charge, but bring your wallet, it gets expensive. The upside is they have \u2026",
          "Fun place had a good time",
          "Go cart was awesome and they give u quite a bit of time on the track... the games inside are cool and you get quite a bit of tickets per game for free stuff ... additionally the games are not super expensive so if you are on a budget and want to take the fam out for fun you dont have to break the bank!

          "Fun games and attractions.. friendly staff.  The Food is Chuck-e-cheese quality.

          "Customer service is average. The machine to get the card for the arcade was not working the day of our visit so we had to go the front counter to purchase it.   The games are average not too much to do for adults or for children under 3. \u2026",
          "The place was okay .. but the staff were so annoying they acted like they didn\u2019t want to help anyone . Hello you are getting paid to work not to stand there and be talking with your co workers this is a business",
          "Great place to take kids.",
          "One of the better fun parks in raleigh in my opinion. Frankies has so many different fun things to do, a wide variety of go kart tracks, mini golf, lazer tag and much more! Their shamrock track is my go to go karts! But like any fun park you spend money quick. So just make sure your willing to spend money when you come.",
          "Great place for adults and kids. Food is good as well pricey but good. Love the outdoor activities as well, batting cages, go kart, and golf. The lines are not long and the staff is great when we go. Worth the two hour drive.",

          "Way overpriced. Some of the same games are one token (0.25) at chuck e cheese while it is $2.25 each time at Frankie's. One minute of play for a 4 year old at 2.25 is rediculous. Birthday party prices range from $32- $44 per person. People can have a simple/basic wedding event catered at close to those prices!!",
          "First time as I'm visiting from Florida. My fiancee had as much fun as the kids running thru the place.  It rained upon arrival so we didn't get to the kart racing. Overall, I loved it and will definitely visit again.",

        "wiki": "Durham (/\u02c8d\u028cr\u0259m/) is a city in and the county seat of Durham County in the U.S. state of North Carolina. Small portions of the city limits extend into Orange County and Wake County.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population to be 278,993 as of July 1, 2019, making it the 4th-most populous city in North Carolina, and the 79th-most populous city in the United States. The city is located in the east-central part of the Piedmont region along the Eno River. Durham is the core of the four-county Durham-Chapel Hill Metropolitan Area, which has a population of 542,710 as of U.S. Census 2014 Population Estimates. The Office of Management and Budget also includes Durham as a part of the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area, commonly known as the Research Triangle, which has a population of 2,037,430 as of U.S. Census 2014 Population Estimates.A railway depot was established on land donated by Bartlett S. Durham in 1849, the namesake of the city. Following the American Civil War, the community of Durham Station expanded rapidly, in part due to the tobacco industry. The town was incorporated by act of the North Carolina General Assembly, in April 1869. The establishment of Durham County was ratified by the General Assembly 12 years later, in 1881. It became known as the founding place and headquarters of the American Tobacco Company. Textile and electric power industries also played an important role. While these industries have declined, Durham underwent revitalization and population growth to become an educational, medical, and research centre.Durham is home to several recognized institutions of higher education, most notably Duke University and North Carolina Central University. Durham is also a national leader in health-related activities, which are focused on the Duke University Hospital and many private companies. Duke and its Duke University Health System, in fact, are the largest employers in the city. North Carolina Central University is a historically black university that is part of the University of North Carolina system. Together, the two universities make Durham one of the vertices of the Research Triangle area; central to this is the Research Triangle Park south of Durham, which encompasses an area of 11 square miles and is devoted to research facilities.\nOn the Duke University campus are the neo-Gothic Duke Chapel and the Nasher Museum of Art. Other notable sites in the city include the Museum of Life and Science, Durham Performing Arts Center, Carolina Theatre, and Duke Homestead and Tobacco Factory. Bennett Place commemorates the location where Joseph E. Johnston surrendered to William T. Sherman in the American Civil War. The city is served, along with Raleigh, by Raleigh\u2013Durham International Airport.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-establishment ===\nThe Eno and the Occoneechi, related to the Sioux and the Shakori, lived and farmed in the area which became Durham. They may have established a village named Adshusheer on the site. The Great Indian Trading Path has been traced through Durham, and Native Americans helped to mold the area by establishing settlements and commercial transportation routes.\nIn 1701, Durham's beauty was chronicled by the English explorer John Lawson, who called the area \"the flower of the Carolinas.\" During the mid-1700s, Scots, Irish, and English colonists settled on land granted to George Carteret by King Charles I (for whom the Carolinas are named). Early settlers built gristmills, such as West Point, and worked the land.\nPrior to the American Revolution, frontiersmen in what is now Durham were involved in the Regulator movement. According to legend, Loyalist militia cut Cornwallis Road through this area in 1771 to quell the rebellion. Later, William Johnston, a local shopkeeper and farmer, made Revolutionaries' munitions, served in the Provincial Capital Congress in 1775, and helped underwrite Daniel Boone's westward explorations.\nLarge plantations, Hardscrabble, Cameron, Lipscomb, and Leigh among them, were established in the antebellum period. By 1860, Stagville Plantation lay at the center of one of the largest plantation holdings in the South. African slaves were brought to labor on these farms and plantations, and slave quarters became the hearth of distinctively Southern cultural traditions involving crafts, social relations, life rituals, music, and dance. There were free African-Americans in the area as well, including several who fought in the Revolutionary War.\n\n\n=== Antebellum and Civil War ===\nPrior to the arrival of the railroad, the area now known as Durham was the eastern part of present-day Orange County and was almost entirely agricultural, with a few businesses catering to travelers (particularly livestock drivers) along the Hillsborough Road. This road, eventually followed by US Route 70, was the major east\u2013west route in North Carolina from colonial times until the construction of interstate highways. Steady population growth and an intersection with the road connecting Roxboro and Fayetteville made the area near this site suitable for a US Post Office. Roxboro, Fayetteville and Hillsborough Roads remain major thoroughfares in Durham, although they no longer exactly follow their early 19th century rights-of-way.Durham's location is a result of the needs of the 19th century railroad industry. The wood-burning steam locomotives of the time had to stop frequently for wood and water and the new North Carolina Railroad needed a depot between the settled towns of Raleigh and Hillsborough. The residents of what is now downtown Durham thought their businesses catering to livestock drivers had a better future than a new-fangled nonsense like a railroad and refused to sell or lease land for a depot. In 1849, a North Carolina Railroad depot was established on a four-acre tract of land donated by Dr. Bartlett S. Durham; the station was named after him in recognition of his gift. A U.S. post office was established there on April 26, 1853, now recognized as the city's official birthday.Durham Station, as it was known for its first 20 years, was a depot for the occasional passenger or express package until early April 1865, when the Federal Army commanded by Major General William T. Sherman occupied the nearby state capital of Raleigh during the American Civil War. The last formidable Confederate Army in the South, commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, was headquartered in Greensboro 50 miles (80 km) to the west. After the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee at Appomattox, Virginia on April 9, 1865, Gen. Johnston sought surrender terms, which were negotiated on April 17, 18 and 26 at Bennett Place, the small farm of James and Nancy Bennett, located halfway between the army's lines about 3 miles (4.8 km) west of Durham Station.\nAs both armies passed through Durham, Hillsborough, and surrounding Piedmont communities, they enjoyed the mild flavor of the area's Brightleaf Tobacco, which was considered more pleasant to smoke or chew than was available back home after the war. Some began sending letters to Durham to get more.\n\n\n=== Reconstruction and the rise of Durham tobacco ===\n\nThe community of Durham Station grew slowly before the Civil War, but expanded rapidly following the war. Much of this growth attributed to the establishment of a thriving tobacco industry. Veterans returned home after the war with an interest in acquiring more of the tobacco they had sampled in North Carolina. Numerous orders were mailed to John Ruffin Green's tobacco company requesting more of the Durham tobacco. W.T. Blackwell partnered with Green and renamed the company as the \"Bull Durham Tobacco Factory\". The name \"Bull Durham\" is said to have been taken from the bull on the British Colman's Mustard, which Mr. Blackwell mistakenly believed was manufactured in Durham, England. Mustard known as Durham Mustard was originally produced in Durham, England, by Mrs Clements and later by Ainsley during the eighteenth century. However, production of the original Durham Mustard has now been passed into the hands of Colman's of Norwich, England.\n\n\n=== Incorporation ===\nAs Durham Station's population rapidly increased, the station became a town and was incorporated by act of the North Carolina General Assembly, on April 10, 1869. It was named for the man who provided the land on which the station was built, Dr. Bartlett Durham. At the time of its incorporation by the General Assembly, Durham was located in Orange County. The increase in business activity, land transfers etc., made the day long trip back and forth to the county seat in Hillsborough untenable, so twelve years later, on April 17, 1881, a bill for the establishment of Durham County was ratified by the General Assembly, having been introduced by Caleb B.Green, creating Durham County from the eastern portion of Orange County and the western portion of Wake County. In 1911, parts of Cedar Fork Township of Wake County was transferred to Durham County and became Carr Township.\n\n\n=== Early growth (1900\u20131970) ===\n\nThe rapid growth and prosperity of the Bull Durham Tobacco Company, and Washington Duke's W. Duke & Sons Tobacco Company, resulted in the rapid growth of the city of Durham. Washington Duke was a good businessman, but his sons were brilliant and established what amounted to a monopoly of the smoking and chewing tobacco business in the United States by 1900. In the early 1910s, the Federal Government forced a breakup of the Duke's business under the antitrust laws. The Dukes retained what became known as American Tobacco, a major corporation in its own right, with manufacturing based in Durham. American Tobacco's ubiquitous advertisements on radio shows beginning in the 1930s and television shows up to 1970 was the nation's image of Durham until Duke University supplanted it in the late 20th century.\nPrevented from further investment in the tobacco industry, the Dukes turned to the then new industry of electric power generation, which they had been investing in since the early 1890s. Duke Power (now Duke Energy) brought in electricity from hydroelectric dams in the western mountains of North Carolina through the newly invented technology of high voltage power lines. At this time (1910\u20131920), the few towns and cities in North Carolina that had electricity depended on local \"powerhouses\". These were large, noisy, and smoky coal-fired plants located next to the railroad tracks. Duke Power quickly took over the electricity franchises in these towns and then electrified all the other towns of central and western North Carolina, making even more money than they ever made from tobacco. Duke Power also had a significant business in local franchises for public transit (buses and trolleys) before local government took over this responsibility in the mid- to late 20th century. Duke Power ran Durham's public bus system (now the Durham Area Transit Authority) until 1991.\nThe success of the tobacco industry in the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged the then-growing textile industry to locate just outside Durham. The early electrification of Durham was also a large incentive. Drawing a labor force from the economic demise of single family farms in the region at the time, these textile mills doubled the population of Durham. These areas were known as East Durham and West Durham until they were eventually annexed by the City of Durham.\n\nMuch of the early city architecture, both commercial and residential, dates from the period of 1890\u20131930. Durham recorded its worst fire in history on March 23, 1914. The multimillion-dollar blaze destroyed a large portion of the downtown business district. The fire department's water source failed during the blaze, prompting voters to establish a city-owned water system in place of the private systems that had served the city since 1887.Durham quickly developed a vibrant Black community, the center of which was an area known as Hayti, (pronounced HAY-tie), just south of the center of town, where some of the most prominent and successful black-owned businesses in the country during the early 20th century were established. These businesses \u2014 the best known of which are North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and Mechanics & Farmers Bank \u2014 were centered on Parrish St., which would come to be known as \"Black Wall Street.\" In 1910, Dr. James E. Shepard founded North Carolina Central University, the nation's first publicly supported liberal arts college for African-Americans.\nIn 1924, James Buchanan Duke established a philanthropic foundation in honor of his father Washington Duke to support Trinity College in Durham. The college changed its name to Duke University and built a large campus and hospital a mile west of Trinity College (the original site of Trinity College is now known as the Duke East Campus).Durham's manufacturing fortunes declined during the mid-20th century. Textile mills began to close during the 1930s. Competition from other tobacco companies (as well as a decrease in smoking after the 1960s) reduced revenues from Durham's tobacco industry.\nIn a far-sighted move in the late 1950s, Duke University, along with the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in Raleigh, persuaded the North Carolina Legislature to purchase a large tract of sparsely settled land in southern Durham County and create the nation's first \"science park\" for industry. Cheap land and a steady supply of trained workers from the local universities made the Research Triangle Park an enormous success which, along with the expansion resulting from the clinical and scientific advances of Duke Medical Center and Duke University, more than made up for the decline of Durham's tobacco and textile industries.\n\n\n=== Civil Rights Movement ===\n\nAs a result of its substantial African-American community, including many courageous activists, a prominent civil rights movement developed in Durham. Multiple sit-ins were held, and Martin Luther King, Jr., visited the city during the struggle for equal rights. The Durham Committee on Negro Affairs, organized in 1935 by C.C. Spaulding, Louis Austin, Conrad Pearson, and James E. Shepard, has been cited nationally for its role in fighting for Black voting rights. The committee also has used its voting strength to pursue social and economic rights for African-Americans and other ethnic groups. In 1957, Douglas E. Moore, minister of Durham's Asbury Temple Methodist Church, along with other religious and community leaders, pioneered sit-ins throughout North Carolina to protest discrimination at lunch counters that served only whites.\n\nWidely credited as the first sit-in of the Civil Rights Movement in North Carolina, on June 23, 1957, Moore and six others assembled at the church to plan the protest. The young African Americans moved over to the segregated Royal Ice Cream Parlor and took up whites-only booths. When they refused to budge, the manager called the police who charged them with trespassing. Unlike the Greensboro Four, three years later, the Royal Seven were arrested and ultimately found guilty of trespassing.\n\nThe six-month-long sit-in at a Woolworth's counter in Greensboro, NC, captured the nation's attention. Within a week, students from North Carolina College at Durham and Duke University staged a sit-in in Durham. About a week later, Martin Luther King Jr. met Moore in Durham, where King coined his famous rallying cry \"Fill up the jails,\" during a speech at White Rock Baptist Church. Advocating non-violent confrontation with segregation laws for the first time, King said, \"Let us not fear going to jail. If the officials threaten to arrest us for standing up for our rights, we must answer by saying that we are willing and prepared to fill up the jails of the South.\"\nThis community was not enough to prevent the demolition of portions of the Hayti district for the construction of the Durham Freeway during the late 1960s. The freeway construction resulted in losses to other historic neighborhoods, including Morehead Hills, West End, and West Durham. Combined with large-scale demolition using Urban Renewal funds, Durham suffered significant losses to its historic architectural base.\n\n\n=== 1970s \u2013 present ===\n\nIn 1970, the Census Bureau reported city's population as 38.8% black and 60.8% white. Durham's growth began to rekindle during the 1970s and 1980s, with the construction of multiple housing developments in the southern part of the city, nearest Research Triangle Park, and the beginnings of downtown revitalization. In 1975, the St. Joseph's Historical Foundation at the Hayti Heritage Center was incorporated to \"preserve the heritage of the old Hayti community, and to promote the understanding of and appreciation for the African American experience and African Americans' contributions to world culture.\" A new downtown baseball stadium was constructed for the Durham Bulls in 1994. The Durham Performing Arts Center now ranks in the top ten in theater ticket sales in the US according to Pollstar magazine. Many famous people have performed there including B.B. King and Willie Nelson. After the departure of the tobacco industry, large-scale renovations of the historic factories into offices, condominiums, and restaurants began to reshape downtown. While these efforts continue, the large majority of Durham's residential and retail growth since 1990 has been along the I-40 corridor in southern Durham County.Major employers in Durham are Duke University and Duke Medical Center (39,000 employees, 14,000 students), about 2 miles (3.2 km) west of the original downtown area, and companies in the Research Triangle Park (49,000 employees), about 10 miles (16 km) southeast. These centers are connected by the Durham Freeway (NC 147).\n\n\n=== Downtown revitalization ===\n\nIn recent years the city of Durham has stepped up revitalization of its downtown and undergone an economic and cultural renaissance of sorts. Partnering with developers from around the world, the city continues to promote the redevelopment of many of its former tobacco districts, projects supplemented by the earlier construction of the Durham Performing Arts Center and new Durham Bulls Athletic Park. The American Tobacco Historic District, adjacent to both the athletic park and performing arts center, is one such project, having successfully lured a number of restaurants, entertainment venues, and office space geared toward hi-tech entrepreneurs, investors, and startups. Many other companies have purchased and renovated historic buildings, such as Measurement Incorporated and Capitol Broadcasting Company.\nThe American Underground section of the American Tobacco Campus, home to successful small software firms including Red Hat, was selected by Google to host its launch of the Google Glass Road show in October 2013. The district is also slated for expansion featuring 158,000 square feet of offices, retail, residential or hotel space The Durham County Justice Center, a major addition to downtown Durham, was completed in early 2013.\nMany of the historic tobacco buildings elsewhere in the city have been converted into loft-style apartment complexes. The downtown corridor along West Main St. has seen significant redevelopment including bars, entertainment venues, art studios, and co-working spaces, in addition to shopping and dining in nearby Brightleaf Square, another former tobacco warehouse in the Bright Leaf Historic District. Other current and future projects include expansion of the open-space surrounding the American Tobacco Trail, new hotels and apartment complexes, a $6.35-million facelift of Durham City Hall, and ongoing redevelopment of the Duke University Central Campus.\nIn 2013, 21c Museum Hotels announced plans to fully renovate the Hill Building. The renovations added a contemporary art museum and upscale restaurant to the historic building. Additionally, a boutique hotel was built in this major renovation effort in downtown Durham. Skanska Construction is responsible for managing this project.In 2014, it was announced that downtown Durham would be the site of a brand new 27 story high building, tentatively named \"City Center Tower\", titled \"One City Center\" as of 2018. Along with other new buildings in downtown Durham, it was under construction in 2018. Construction has already started, and the building will be at the corner of Main St. and Corcoran St. It will be directly across from Durham's current tallest building, but once completed, will be the new tallest building in downtown Durham and the 4th largest building in the Triangle. Originally scheduled for a 2016 opening, the building was then expected to open in May 2018. This is an ambitious, $80 million project.In October 2014, a major new development, the Durham Innovation District, was announced. The development will span 15 acres and comprise over 1.7 million square feet of office, residential, and retail space.On April 10, 2019, a gas explosion rocked Kaffeinate, a coffee shop in Bright Leaf Historic District. The blast destroyed a city block and killed Kong Lee, the owner, as well as injuring 25 others.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nDurham is located in the east-central part of the Piedmont region at 35\u00b059\u203219\u2033N 78\u00b054\u203226\u2033W (35.988644, \u221278.907167).

A few successful local soul groups from Durham also recorded on national labels like United Artists or on regional labels in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nDurham is home to the nationally known Scrap Exchange, the largest nonprofit creative reuse arts center in the country, and the Nasher Museum of Art as well as a plethora of smaller visual arts galleries and studios. As a testament to the arts, downtown Durham sponsors an organically grown celebration of culture and arts on display every third Friday of the month, year round. The event has come to be known as 3rd Friday.\nA selection of locally renowned galleries remain in business throughout the city.

Durham County is the most liberal county in North Carolina, measured by the percentage of voters aligning with the Democratic party in the last several presidential elections 2008 United States presidential election in North Carolina#By county. The shifting alliances of the area's political action committees since the 1980s has led to a very active local political scene. Notable groups include the Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People, the Durham People's Alliance, and the Friends of Durham. The first two groups tend to be affiliated with Democratic party progressive activists, while the third group tends to attract Republican activists. Compared to other similarly sized Southern cities, Durham has a larger than average population of middle class African-Americans and white liberals. Working together in coalition, these two groups have dominated city and county politics since the early 1980s.\nDurham operates under a council-manager government. The mayor, since 2017, is Steve Schewel, who was elected with 59.45% of the vote.

Naturally, a merger of Durham City Schools (several inner city neighborhoods) and Durham County Schools in the early 1990s has not been without controversy. More recently, the Durham City Council's 2018 statement opposing militarized policing that mentioned Israel has drawn its third lawsuit [4]. In 2018, Durham appointed its first Latinx council member Javiera Caballero. Durham has had majority female county boards since the 1980s, and in 2020, Durham elected, for the first time, an all female Durham County Board of Commissioners and the first Muslim-American woman to win elected office in the history of North Carolina [5].\nFederally, Durham is split between North Carolina's 1st congressional district and North Carolina's 4th congressional district.

A city council resolution mandates that police officers \"...may not request specific documents for the sole purpose of determining a person's civil immigration status, and may not initiate police action based solely on a person's civil immigration status ...\" Since 2010, the Durham police have accepted the Mexican Consular Identification Card as a valid form of identification.In 2006, racial and community tensions stirred following allegations of a sexual assault by three white members of the Duke University lacrosse team in what is now known as the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case. The allegations were made by Crystal Gail Mangum a young, female African-American student and mother of two young children. She and another young woman had been hired to dance at a party that the team held in an off-campus house. In 2007, all charges in the case were dropped and the players were declared innocent.

A new Amtrak station was built in 2011 in a former tobacco warehouse. Some of the downtown streets cross the tracks at grade level, while other intersections have grade separation. One downtown railroad underpass has attracted national media coverage, because it provides only 11 feet-8 inches of clearance, and has damaged the roofs of many trucks. As of October 26, 2019, the underpass was closed down to both automotive and train traffic in preparation for raising it to 12 feet and 4 inches, so as to provide clearance underneath to reduce large vehicle damage.National bus service is provided by Greyhound and Megabus at the Durham Transit Station in downtown Durham, which opened in 2009.

GoTriangle also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nFrom 1995, the cornerstone of GoTriangle's long-term plan was a 28-mile (45 km) rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles (11 km) to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program. Government agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.The region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Duke University also maintains its own transit system, Duke Transit operates more than 30 buses with routes throughout the campus and health system.

          "You find these kinds of developments in most cities now - what's odd about this place is that there's very little inside the pretty brick buildings. Few shops, a few reataurants, that's it (including no people). Yes, it felt like the surface of the sun outside so no surprises",

          "It's a cute little square with restaurants with patios and some shops, converted from a tobaco storage house. Nice atmosphere. We went for patio dinner on the day they had a free jazz concert in the square and was a wonderful dinner date night with great live music.",
          "The shops are a bit on the artsy side, but there are fun places to browse through, and a few decent places to eat. A few of the restaurants have changed recently, and nothing has really gelled there in the few years I've been in the area, other than Satisfactions and El Rodeo,",

          "You'll find a variety of restaurants with indoor and outside seating. There are boutiques and a very pretty walkway right down the center of Brightleaf. Holiday lights are pretty too.",
          "We stopped in and walk around for a bit. With kids, we hit the bathroom! Love this area. We would have loved to see it at night all lit up with the lights in the trees and above the walkways. Some great shops and restaurants too.",
          "Have been to a few restaurants here and what I like is that they aren't chains. They are local spots. Also, a couple cool shops to check out. Cool little spot in Durham.",

          "This campus is nice to just walk around and walk around the gardens and chapel. The architecture is beautiful so if you enjoy looking at interesting architecture, you'll enjoy this campus. It's a private school, so it's pricey and difficult to get into, if you're considering",

          "Our first time to Duke University and the stadium for a football game. People were friendly and told us about a few things to see. We enjoyed the basketball Hall of Fame museum. Pretty place and nice signs placed on our way out of the game to help us find our parking area, in",
          "I was in Durham and decided to just walk around the campus. I was impressed by how beautiful the university is. It was nice to be able to walk around while classes were in session. It is a lively campus and everyone seemed happy. I would like my future kids to go here.",
          "I have been to a lot of colleges and Duke by far is the best. So much history here, very very well maintained. If you are wanting your child to attend Duke, just bring them for a visit because once they step on the campus grounds they will become a blue devil right then. You",
          "Hope my granddaughter will follow in my grandfather's footsteps and go here. Very impressive layout and very well maintained. The school has an excellent reputation and seeing it makes you understand why. Highly recommend to anybody.",
          "Whether a student or not, Duke University is a wonderful place to visit for a tour. There is a lot of history to enjoy. Be sure to see the Chapel, the Gardens nearby, the Memorial wall of soldiers, and take a short walk over to the hospital if you should do want to see someone",
          "Not on a college tour but a spectator tour. The campus is so beautiful. The campus chapel is a must to see. I would call it more a cathedral than chapel. The stain glass windows were beautiful. Be sure to take a a history brochure as you enter. The history is amazing. The",
          "We visited the college with the kids. The college is located in a huge area. The surroundings are beautiful. I wish I could have studied there. But, it too late. I really wish my kids could get the admission. In terms of sports, Duke does not need an introduction.",
          "This campus has it all. From Cameron Indoor to Duke Gardens to the Lemur Center. If that was not enough, the gorgeous architecture, the University Chapel and Nasher Museum are top quality. It is rather clear that Harvard is the Duke of the north. They do everything right from",
          "We received a diagnosis no one ever wants to get. Our local hospital scheduled the surgery and we waited. During that time, we picked up the telephone on Thursday and called Duke for a 2nd opinion. Much to our surprise they had a cancellation for Monday. We arrived and",

          "Today we went to Duke University and it was beautiful. The school had tons of lawns and old buildings made of brick. It also had tons of commons areas. I highly recommend this place!",
          "Duke is ranked No. 8 in the nation\u2019s university ranking, and I think its campus should be equally high-ranking with many mature trees, immaculate lawns, and beautiful Gothic architecture. If you are on campus during lunch or dinner time, try one of the cafes and restaurants. You",

          "I recently visited Duke University with my son, who is a rising senior looking at potential colleges. It was our 25th and final campus visit on a journey that has taken us from Chicago to some of the best universities around the country. We have been impressed with a number of",
          "The old buildings with modern updates were beautiful. The grounds were lovely. After walking around campus I would find it hard to stay indoors and studied here. I would just wander the campus in awe and try to imagine how these buildings were built and the time it took.",
          "DUKE UNIVERSITY is a very special place of learning. The campus is a dream and so well kept. It is a perfect size - not too big and not too small. The students are nice kids and the faculty are very approachable. This university should be on the list of IVY LEAGUE schools.",
          "The grounds of the campus are like a huge Botanical Gardens, I was reminded very much of Edinburgh in Scotland with the difference being scale. Laid out in different sections we were particularly drawn to the Asian section with its woodland walks. There is plenty of shade",
          "If all you see is the Sarah P Duke Gardens which belong to the University, it's worth the trip from anywhere. Based on what I saw and what I read on Tripadvisor, the Gardens are the jewel of the University. I saw photographs of Duke Chapel online and didn't feel it was worth",
          "I have visited a couple of times, once for a football game, and once to just walk around. The campus is a little reminiscent of Cambridge or Oxford in the UK. The chapel is beautiful, similar to the chapel at West Point. Love the stone work and the gardens.",

          "I was referred to Duke by my Neurologist here in Augusta GA in 2016. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the staff in my physicians office at Duke. I love the fact Duke has \u201cMy Chart\u201d and so my physicians in Augusta can communicate with Duke and vice versa.",

          "We spent almost a week in Durham and did spend an afternoon exploring the campus. Parking for visitors was challenging, and I'm not sure we quite got it right but at least did not receive a ticket. The campus itself, is beautiful, with the cathedral being a highlight.",

          "After graduating from Dukes Business School \u201880 (Fuqua), and subsequently retiring at 56, the look back has been very satisfying. My professors were all very competent in their field, particularly Dan Laughan, Joel Huber, and Marian Burke. The school was modeled in theoretical",
          "Visited campus with my son and it was more than we expected. I expected campus to be old looking, but it's quite beautiful. The architecture is amazing. Brick and glass was such an interesting combination. So much more than expected. Beautiful campus. Definitely worth visiting",
          "Visit Duke.edu to find to vast variety of places to go as well as things to see and hear on this sprawling campus. Student food options are a grand bargain and reasonable pricing. Do remember that this is a place for learning.",
          "Duke is a beautiful campus, and always growing. I taught there part time at the Fuqua School of Business for 12 years, and we lived within walking distance of the West Campus for 25 years. Enjoy the grounds, the beautiful Chapel, the musical and theater offerings, and the",
          "My wife has been a Duke mens basketball fan for years so was thrilled to finally visit this campus. We thoroughly enjoyed the Cameron arena and actually got to walk on the court. We could imagine the Cameron Crazies cheering on Duke players.",

          "I turned down Stanford to go here. Dukies are warm, balanced, smart, kind, hardworking and care about the world. They have life skills, they aren\u2019t just brainiacs, although are super smart. I\u2019ve stayed in touch with more than 20 dukies. Highly recommend this amazing",
          "Campus has lots of walkways and is easy to navigate. Currently has construction, but can get around easily.",
          "Fantastic parents weekend once again, Duke! Best decision our daughter made was to go to this school. Beautiful campus, great professors, knowledgeable staff and a degree that is far more than a piece of paper! We look forward to her graduation in May with bittersweet",
          "This campus is beautiful, I love the beautiful garden and enjoy the scenic area. Please take the racist things down.",
          "Beautiful campus and students did a great job with tour. Admissions office was extremely helpful. Love!",

          "If you are in the area and have kids preparing to think about colleges, this is a must see. The campus is incredibly beautiful. We self toured; however would recommend a guided tour to get a flavor of the history and background of the campus and quality of life at Duke. Be",
          "This is actually my oldest daughter's alma mater, which she began visiting overnight in the 9th grade. When she was finally accepted, I popped up on campus for her dance performances, football games, or for no reason at all! Now that she has graduated, I MUST get to the",
          "We purchased tickets for the NCCU game via the Duke Alumni association. The good and bad was the pre game party actually could have been purchased at the event, and though the food was good, there was NO seating at all, meaning you ate standing up. The tickets that were",
          "We go to Duke every couple of years for alumni events (so I'm biased...) and we love it every time. This time we toured the Nasher Art Museum on campus and enjoyed it. We always make our way to the Chapel and this time the organist was practicing for an upcoming wedding.",
          "One of the best medical facilities in the US. In addition is one of the most beautiful college campuses. The buildings are like castles. I could spend the day walking around.",
          "the university has three campus in the town, making it one of the largest I have known. The shuttle bus is quite convenient.",

          "Once you drive into the campus, I felt like I\u2019ve been transported in one of the European countries. The architecture is so amazing !",
          "We're biased, because our son and daughter-in-law were married in the Duke Chapel, a stunning structure in its own right, and worth the trip just to take the tour. Duke University is recognized for many academic, science, technology, and medical functions, and deserves every",
          "The campus at Duke is beautiful! The architecture is incredible! If you visit in the Spring or Summer, be sure to see the Sara Duke Gardens, a beautiful place for pictures and perfect venue for weddings. A must see is the Duke Chapel. My son was married in the Chapel and it",
          "Fantastic early 20th century investment by the Duke family. The \"new\" campus is a beautiful gothic fantasy that just reeks of American money (in this case well deployed) and ambition. Say what you will about the faculty's politics, but this is an important institution and",
          "We went on a guided tour of campus that lasted 1-1.5hrs. Lovely campus even on a hot and humid summer day. Student tour guide was smart enough to duck into various buildings for much of the tour so we could benefit from the air conditioning. Showed a typical dorm room at the",
          "I was taken aback by Duke's beauty and quiet feel despite its reputation for sports. Driving down a long, wooded driveway, my friends and I were able to find parking and begin our self guided tour for only a few dollars. The paths are Duke are not exactly the best labelled and",
          "The Duke gardens are amazing and we were blown away. There is a koi pod with oversized Lillie\u2019s, sculptures and plenty photo options. The Chapel is beautiful. Campus student center is cool and welcomes diversity.",
          "We saw the campus today and it is a lot of walking. More than that.....you have to find a place to park WITHOUT getting towed. There is a lot of construction going on so that was a problem. The campus is top notch! My highschooler is considering DUKE as an option for his",
          "Even though I am from CT and a loyal UConn fan, I will admit that the Duke University campus is gorgeous. Smaller then I thought. Great to walk around. Fantastic student union building. Beautiful cathedral in the center of the campus as well as botanical gardens.",
          "In most of the Triangle, parking in the evening for events such as the American Dance Festival has a minimum to no charge. But at Duke, whether it's for an event, the hospital, or one of its clinics, you will pay by the hour. For a recent event, we paid $8.00 for a few hours.",
          "I was there for less than 24 hours but I made time to visit this beautiful campus. It is definitely breathtaking. It's walkable. I really enjoyed the gardens, I spent a lot of time there. The Chapel was beautiful and of course had to get my Duke gear at the campus store. If",
          "There was rain and construction when we visited so it took a while to make our way around. It was nice visiting the campus though and the students we encountered were very friendly. Make sure to visit when the campus store is open. I would visit again.",

          "My wife reads the travel books and picks things for us to visit. Our first stop was the Duke Chapel. It is so impressive. It reminds both of us of the National Cathedral in Washington, DC, albeit on a smaller scale. We went into a side chapel and shared a prayer thanking God",
          "Very attractive campus with many attractive heritage buildings. We found the campus a little difficult to navigate. Poor signage indicated to us that the university does not encourage vehicular traffic. Decent, but not great bookstore.",

          "Since we were in the area we couldn't pass up visiting Duke University campus. It was super hot outside so we toured the campus quickly but did spend time in the amazing church. I'd recommend taking a tour of the campus anytime... but try for a day when it isn't 98 degrees.",

          "If you go to Duke, go to the chapel. It is a very beautiful place. The chapel has a wooden mouse hidden in its very beautiful architecture. From the wood to the stone, it is just a wonderful place to visit. Visit the gardens too. I have visited them year round and they are",
          "Pretty average cafeteria. There is a open/buffet style salad bar. With a hospital setting and over 100+ people at lunch time it's pretty sketchy. There is a sushi bar if you chose to spend half your break in line. Not too many other fresh healthy options",
          "This was our second visit to Duke, but our first official visit with the information session and guided tour... The info. session was good, giving us most of the information we wanted to know... The guided tour, led by a student, was a disaster... We had a girl who was either",

          "Went on a college visit with my daughter. The campus is nothing short of beautiful. Reminiscent of the United States Military Academy. The Chapel was amazing and looks like many of the cathedrals in Europe. My only complaint was lack of parking. Be prepared to walk a lot.",

          "We just love the campus and stayed close by for ease of walking to the ballgame. Very pedestrian friendly!",
          "There is not much more to say about Duke, besides it is incredibly beautiful. Walking about campus felt like you were walking around a gorgeous mansion. The reason we traveled there was to tour the Physical Therapy area of campus, which was all so gorgeous and the staff was SO",
          "Visited the campus because I had a few hours to kill and because well I am a doctoral student so I always wanted to visit this campus having heard awesome things about it. The day I visited, it was raining like anything and it was below freezing... and yet I fell in love with",

          "If you like college basketball, there is no better venue in America than Cameron Indoor Stadium on the Duke University campus. There is not a bad seat in the house, the atmosphere is electric, and the place oozes history and success. This is truly a \"bucket-list\" item for any",
          "We decided to take a walk around the university to kill some time and it was well worth it. Finding a good parking spot for doing this was the biggest challenge, and we ended up parking a bit off campus at the Duke University hospital. It was the cheapest and convenient option",
          "We were lucky enough to enjoy a tour of Duke University by a current student. The University looks like they took a chunk of Edinburgh, Scotland and plunked it right down in Durham! The chapel is, of course, the most prominent structure, but a tour of the athletic department",

          "What an impressive university campus! The chapel alone will take your breath away. I've never visited Europe, but from all the pictures I've seen, the Gothic architecture seen at Duke will satisfy my longings for Europe for quite some time. The stonework, the slate roofing,",
          "The Chapel and Cameron Indoor Stadium are worth the price of admission alone but the gardens and quad are also exquisite. If you have the opportunity to spend 2+ hours at the university you will be happy that you did. The landscape, well-kept integrity of the buildings, and",

          "The campus of Duke U, is a great excursion even if you don't have a would-be student. It's a very large campus - you can drive if you just want to get an idea of the different buildings. There's visitors parking for $2 and a very efficient visitor center. Her you can eat, shop",
          "If you are a Duke fan, this is a must see. The campus is beautiful and the chapel is fantastic. We were so lucky to bump into Coach K as he was coming out of his office during our visit.",

          "I have to admit I am prejudiced. I graduated from Duke fifty years ago and just returned for my 50th reunion. Early April and spring was in full bloom. Though the campus has grown they have maintained the heart of both the old East and West campuses. It looks almost exactly",
          "The college visit was very informative. It is a quality school in an intensive medical area. Not much in the area to visit.",

        "wiki": "The Research Triangle, commonly referred to as simply The Triangle, is a region in the Piedmont of North Carolina in the United States, anchored by three major research universities: North Carolina State University, Duke University, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as well as the cities of Raleigh and Durham and the town of Chapel Hill. The nine-county region, officially named the Raleigh\u2013Durham\u2013Cary combined statistical area (CSA), comprises the Raleigh\u2013Cary and Durham\u2013Chapel Hill Metropolitan Statistical Areas and the Henderson Micropolitan Statistical Area.\nA 2019 Census estimate put the population at 2,079,687, making it the second largest combined statistical area in the state of North Carolina behind Charlotte CSA. The Raleigh\u2013Durham television market includes a broader 24-county area which includes Fayetteville, North Carolina, and has a population of 2,726,000 persons.The \"Triangle\" name was cemented in the public consciousness in the 1950s with the creation of Research Triangle Park, home to numerous tech companies and enterprises. Although the name is now used to refer to the geographic region, \"the Triangle\" originally referred to the universities, whose research facilities, and the educated workforce they provide, have historically served as a major attraction for businesses located in the region.Most of the Triangle is part of North Carolina's first, second, and fourth congressional districts.\nThe region is sometimes confused with The Triad, which is a North Carolina region adjacent to and directly west of the Triangle comprising Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and High Point, among other cities.\n\n\n== Counties ==\nDepending on which definition of the Research Triangle region is used, as few as three or as many as 16 counties are included as part of the region. All of these counties when included hold a population of over 2,167,000 people.\nThe three core counties of Wake, Durham and Orange are the homes of the three research universities for which the area is named.\nThe 2019 members of the Research Triangle Regional Partnership are:\n\nChatham\nDurham\nFranklin\nGranville\nJohnston\nLee\nPerson\nWake\nWarren\n\n\n=== NC Regional Councils of Governments Definition ===\nAll counties in the State of North Carolina are in one of 16 regional councils which provide programs and services to local governments.  The Triangle J Council of Governments includes Chatham, Durham, Johnston, Lee, Moore, Orange, and Wake Counties.  The northern Triangle counties of Person, Granville, Franklin, Vance and Warren are part of the Kerr-Tar Regional Council of Governments.\n\n\n=== Office of Management and Budget Definition ===\n\nAs of September 14, 2018, the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineated the Raleigh-Durham-Cary Combined Statistical Area as consisting of two metropolitan and one micropolitan statistical areas.  Those three statistical areas in turn are defined as consisting of a total of nine counties.  The MSAs and their constituent counties are:\n\nDurham-Chapel Hill Metropolitan SA\nChatham County\nDurham County\nGranville County\nOrange County\nPerson County\nHenderson Micropolitan SA\nVance County\nRaleigh-Cary Metropolitan SA\nFranklin County\nJohnston County\nWake CountyPrior to September 2018, the OMB had used the name Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area and it included several additional counties. The Dunn Micropolitan Statistical Area (Harnett County) and Sanford Micropolitan Statistical Area (Lee County) were moved to the Fayetteville-Sanford-Lumberton Combined Statistical Area, while the Oxford Micropolitan Statistical Area (Granville County) was folded into the Durham-Chapel Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Raleigh Metropolitan Statistical Area was also renamed the Raleigh-Cary Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nThe table below outlines the populations of the constituent counties of the Raleigh\u2013Durham-Cary Combined Statistical Area as of July 1, 2019.\n\n\n== Cities ==\n\nThe Triangle region, as defined for statistical purposes as the Raleigh\u2013Durham\u2013Cary CSA, comprises nine counties, although the U.S. Census Bureau divided the region into two metropolitan statistical areas and one micropolitan area in 2003. The Raleigh-Cary metropolitan area comprises Wake, Franklin, and Johnston Counties; the Durham-Chapel Hill metropolitan area comprises Durham, Orange, Chatham, Granville, and Person Counties; and the Henderson micropolitan area comprises Vance County.\nSome area television stations define the region as Raleigh\u2013Durham\u2013Fayetteville. Fayetteville is more than 50 miles (80 km) from Raleigh, but is part of the Triangle television market.\n\n\n=== 15 largest municipalities ===\n\n\n== Education ==\nPublic secondary education in the Triangle is similar to that of the majority of the state of North Carolina, in which there are county-wide school systems (the exception is Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools within Orange County but apart from Orange County Schools). Based in Cary, the Wake County Public School System, which includes the cities of Raleigh and Cary, is the largest school system in the state of North Carolina and the 15th-largest in the United States, with average daily enrollment of 159,949 as of the second month of the 2016\u201317 school year. Other larger systems in the region include Durham Public Schools (about 33,000 students) and rapidly growing Johnston County Schools (about 31,000 students).\n\n\n=== Institutions of higher education ===\n\nCampbell University\nCentral Carolina Community College\nDuke University\nDurham Technical Community College\nLouisburg College\nMeredith College\nNorth Carolina Central University\nNorth Carolina State University\nPiedmont Community College\nShaw University\nSoutheastern Baptist Theological Seminary and The College at Southeastern\nSt. Augustine's College\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nVance-Granville Community College\nWake Technical Community College\nWilliam Peace University\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== College sports ===\nWith the significant number of universities and colleges in the area and the relative absence of major league professional sports, NCAA sports are very popular, particularly those sports in which the Atlantic Coast Conference participates, most notably basketball.\nThe Duke Blue Devils (representing Duke University in Durham), NC State Wolfpack (representing North Carolina State University in Raleigh), and North Carolina Tar Heels (representing the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) are all members of the ACC. Rivalries among these schools are very strong, fueled by proximity to each other, with annual competitions in every sport. Adding to the rivalries is the large number of graduates the high schools in the region send to each of the local universities. It is very common for students at one university to know many students attending the other local universities, which increases the opportunities for \"bragging\" among the schools. The four ACC schools in the state, Duke, North Carolina, North Carolina State, and Wake Forest University (the last of which was originally located in the town of Wake Forest before moving to Winston-Salem in 1956), are referred to as Tobacco Road by sportscasters, particularly in basketball. All four teams consistently produce high-caliber teams. Each of the Triangle-based universities listed has won at least two NCAA Basketball national championships.\nThree historically black colleges, including recent Division I arrival North Carolina Central University and Division II members St. Augustine College and Shaw University also boost the popularity of college sports in the region.\nOther colleges in the Triangle that field intercollegiate teams include Campbell University, Meredith College, and William Peace University.\n\n\n=== Professional sports ===\n\nThe region has only one professional team of the four major sports, the Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL, based in Raleigh. Since moving to the Research Triangle region from Hartford, Connecticut, they have enjoyed great success, including winning a Stanley Cup. With only one top-level professional sports option, minor league sports are quite popular in the region. The Durham Bulls in downtown Durham are a AAA Minor League baseball affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays, and the Carolina Mudcats, based in Zebulon, 10 miles east of Raleigh, are the Advanced-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. In Cary, North Carolina FC plays in the second-level United Soccer League, and the North Carolina Courage began play in the National Women's Soccer League in 2017 after the owner of North Carolina FC bought the NWSL franchise rights of the Western New York Flash and relocated the NWSL franchise to the Triangle.\n\nThe area also had a team in the fledgling World League of American Football \u2013 however, the Raleigh\u2013Durham Skyhawks, coached by Roman Gabriel, did not exactly cover themselves in glory; they lost all 10 games of their inaugural (and only) season in 1991. The team folded after that, being replaced in the league by the Ohio Glory, which fared little better at 1\u20139, ultimately suffering the same fate \u2013 along with the other six teams based in North America \u2013 when the league took a two-year hiatus, returning as a six-team all-European league in 1995.\n\n\n== Commerce ==\nAnchored by leading technology firms, government and world-class universities, medical centers and schools, the area's economy has performed exceptionally well. Significant increases in employment, earnings, personal income, and retail sales are projected over the next 15 years.\nThe region's growing high-technology community includes such companies as IBM, Lenovo, SAS Institute, Cisco Systems, NetApp, Red Hat, EMC Corporation, and Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to high-tech, the region is consistently ranked in the top three in the U.S. with concentration in life science companies. Some of these companies include GlaxoSmithKline, Biogen Idec, BASF, Merck & Co., Novo Nordisk, Novozymes, and Pfizer. Research Triangle Park and North Carolina State University's Centennial Campus in Raleigh support innovation through R&D and technology transfer among the region's companies and research universities (including Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).\nThe area fared relatively well during the late-2000s recession, ranked as the strongest region in North Carolina by the Brookings Institution and among the top 40 in the country.  The change in unemployment during 2008 to 2009 was 4.6% and home prices was 2%.  The Greensboro metropolitan area was listed among the second-weakest and the Charlotte area among the middle in the country.\n\n\n=== Major employers ===\n\n\n=== Major hospitals, medical centers and medical schools ===\n\nThe Research Triangle region is served by these hospitals and medical centers:\nHospitals of the Duke University Health System\nDuke Ambulatory Surgery Center (Durham)\nDuke Children's Hospital and Health Center (Durham)\nDuke Raleigh Hospital (formerly Raleigh Community Hospital)\nDuke University Medical Center (Durham)\nDuke Regional Hospital (formerly Durham Regional Hospital)\nPerson Memorial Hospital (Roxboro)\nHospitals of the UNC Health Care system\nChatham Hospital (Siler City)\nNorth Carolina Cancer Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nNorth Carolina Children's Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nNorth Carolina Memorial Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nNorth Carolina Neurosciences Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nNorth Carolina Women's Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nRex Hospital (Raleigh)\nJohnston Medical Center (Smithfield)\nHospitals of the WakeMed system\nWakeMed Raleigh Campus (formerly Wake Memorial Hospital and Wake Medical Center)\nWakeMed Cary Hospital (formerly Western Wake Medical Center)\nOther hospitals and medical centers\nCentral Regional Hospital,(Butner)\nDurham VA Medical Center (Durham)\nFranklin Regional Medical Center (Louisburg)\nHarnett Health System (Dunn)\nBetsy Johnson Regional Hospital\nAngier Medical Services\nGood Hope Hospital\nBetsy Johnson Cancer Research Clinic\nCentral Harnett Hospital\nMedical Schools\nDuke University School of Medicine\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine\nCampbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Freeways and primary designated routes ===\n\nThe Triangle proper is served by three major interstate highways: I-40, I-85, and I-87 along with their spurs: I-440 and I-540, and seven U.S. Routes: 1, 15, 64, 70, 264, 401, and 501. US Highways 15 and 501 are multiplexed through much of the region as US 15-501. I-95 passes 30 miles east of Raleigh through Johnston County, with I-87 connecting I-95 at Rocky Mount, NC to Raleigh via the US 64\u2013264 Bypass.\nThe two interstates diverge from one another in Orange County, with I-85 heading northeast through northern Durham County toward Virginia, while I-40 travels southeast through southern Durham, through the center of the region, and serves as the primary freeway through Raleigh. The related loop freeways I-440 and I-540 are primarily located in Wake County around Raleigh. I-440 begins at the interchange of US 1 and I-40 southwest of downtown Raleigh and arcs as a multiplex with US 1 northward around downtown with the formal designation as the Cliff Benson/Raleigh Beltline (cosigned with US 1 on three-fourths of its northern route) and ends at its junction with I-40 in southeast Raleigh. I-540, sometimes known as the Raleigh Outer Loop, extends from the US 64\u2013264 Bypass to I-40 just inside Durham County, where it continues across the interstate as a state route (NC 540), prior to its becoming a toll road from the NC 54 interchange to the current terminus at NC Highway 55 near Holly Springs. I-95 serves the extreme eastern edge of the region, crossing north\u2013south through suburban Johnston County.\nU.S. Routes 1, 15, and 64 primarily serve the region as limited-access freeways or multilane highways with access roads. US 1 enters the region from the southwest as the Claude E. Pope Memorial Highway and travels through suburban Apex where it merges with US 64 and continues northeast through Cary. The two highways are codesignated for about 2 miles (3.2 km) until US 1 joins I-440 and US 64 with I-40 along the Raleigh\u2013Cary border. Capital Boulevard, which is designated US 1 for half of its route and US 401 the other is not a limited-access freeway, although it is a major thoroughfare through northeast Raleigh and into the northern downtown area.\nNorth Carolina Highway 147 is a limited-access freeway that connects I-85 with Toll Route NC 540 in northwestern Wake County. The older, toll-free portion of the four-lane route\u2014known as the Durham Freeway or the I.L. \"Buck\" Dean Expressway\u2014traverses downtown Durham and extends through Research Triangle Park to I-40. The Durham Freeway is often used as a detour or alternate route for I-40 through southwestern Durham the Chapel Hill area in cases of traffic accident, congestion or road construction delays. The tolled portion of NC 147, called the Triangle Expressway\u2014North Carolina's first modern toll road when it opened to traffic in late 2011\u2014continues past I-40 to Toll NC 540. Both Toll NC 147 and Toll NC 540 are modern facilities which collect tolls using transponders and license plate photo-capture technology.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nA partnering system of multiple public transportation agencies currently serves the Triangle region under the joint GoTransit branding. Raleigh is served by the Capital Area Transit (CAT) municipal transit system, while Durham has the Durham Area Transit Authority (DATA) system. Chapel Hill is served by Chapel Hill Transit, and Cary is served by C-Tran public transit systems. However, Triangle Transit, formerly called the Triangle Transit Authority (TTA), works in cooperation with all area transit systems by offering transfers between its own routes and those of the other systems. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nPlans have been made to merge all of the area's municipal systems into Triangle Transit, and Triangle Transit also has proposed a regional rail system to connect downtown Durham, downtown Cary and downtown Raleigh with multiple suburban stops, as well as stops in the Research Triangle Park area. The agency's initial proposal was effectively cancelled in 2006, however, when the agency could not procure adequate federal funding. A committee of local business, transportation and government leaders currently are working with Triangle Transit to develop a new transit blueprint for the region, with various modes of rail transit, as well as bus rapid transit, open as options for consideration.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\n\n==== Raleigh\u2013Durham International Airport (RDU) ====\n (IATA: RDU, ICAO: KRDU, FAA LID: RDU)\n\nRaleigh\u2013Durham International Airport (RDU) has nonstop passenger service to 68 destinations with over 450 average daily departures, including nonstop international service to Canada, Europe, and Mexico. It is located near the geographic center of The Triangle, 4 1\u20442 miles (7.2 km) northeast of the town of Morrisville in Wake County. The airport covers 5,000 acres (2,023 ha) and has three runways.In 1939 the General Assembly of North Carolina chartered the Raleigh\u2013Durham Aeronautical Authority, which was changed in 1945 to the Raleigh\u2013Durham Airport Authority. The first new terminal opened in 1955. Terminal A (now Terminal 1) opened in 1981. American Airlines began service to RDU in 1985.\nRDU opened the 10,000-foot (3,000 m) runway, 5L-23R, in 1986. American Airlines opened its north\u2013south hub operation at RDU in the new Terminal C in June 1987, greatly increasing the size of RDU's operations with a new terminal including a new apron and runway. American brought RDU its first international flights to Bermuda, Cancun, Paris and London.\nIn 1996, American Airlines ceased its hub operations at RDU due to Pan Am and Eastern Airlines. Pan Am and Eastern were Miami's main tenants until 1991, when both carriers went bankrupt. Their hubs at MIA were taken over by United Airlines and American Airlines. This created a difficulty in competing with US Airways' hub in Charlotte and Delta Air Lines' hub in Atlanta, Georgia for passengers traveling between smaller cities in the North and South. Midway Airlines entered the market, starting service in 1995 with the then somewhat novel concept of 50-seat Canadair Regional Jets providing service from its RDU hub primarily along the East Coast. Midway, originally incorporated in Chicago, had some success after moving its operations to the midpoint of the eastern United States at RDU and its headquarters to Morrisville, NC. The carrier ultimately could not overcome three weighty challenges: the arrival of Southwest Airlines, the refusal of American Airlines to renew the frequent flyer affiliation it had with Midway (thus dispatching numerous higher fare-paying businesspeople to airlines with better reward destinations), and the significant blow of September 11, 2001. Midway Airlines filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 13, 2001, and ceased operations entirely on October 30, 2003.\nIn February 2000, RDU was ranked as the nation's second fastest-growing major airport in the United States, by Airports Council International, based on 1999 statistics. Passenger growth hit 24% over the previous year, ranking RDU second only to Washington Dulles International Airport.

          "Seems like a pretty sweet dog park",
          "The large park is great, can get very wet and muddy but otherwise a nice clean space for dogs. The small dog park usually has a very cliquey group of people who let's their dogs run the show including letting their dogs jump all over yours \u2026",
          "You owe it to your dog to bring him here Today, there were no other dogs, so Murray spent the time running full throttle. It's even more fun (for you and the dog) when there are more dogs there",
          "Just last week, I witnessed a dog fight and a woman, carrying a baby on her chest, tried to get in the middle of eat. As a result, she had a hand sized laceration on her arm. If your dog is aggressive, please dont go to a dog park. The city \u2026",

          "We love that Durham's dog parks have sandboxes for dogs to freely dig in. This park in particular gets a little (a lot) muddy after it rains, but beyond that, this is a great dog park",
          "Great park with great people.",

          "Converted baseball field with lots of room for doggies to run around. There are two different fenced areas for dogs to play. One area is for small dogs (under 30 pounds) and the other is for bigger dogs. Most of the people that go are friendly and do a good job of keeping an eye on their dogs.",

          "conveniently close to home. i enjoy coming here, but it's always so muddy. wish there were more trail options, too",
          "This dog park is probably going to be shut down because it is in a floodplain and cannot be adequately renovated. I believe another dog park will open up soon near here closer to Rock Quarry Park. At the moment in February 2018 there are a lot of muddy spots in the dog park. Nonetheless, the dogs love it and love to play it.",
          "Not the best of the dog parks in the area, but still nicely maintained area for your dog",
          "Can't give the park full marks because the water was out in both the big dog and little dog park. Kind of muddy, but that is usual for a dog park. Not a lot of tree coverage/shade but you could consider that a positive in that there's tons of open space for the doggies to run.",
          "Everyone is friendly and we all look out for each other's animals",
          "Go here often and isn't perfect but is still pretty good. Two dog parks and both a good size. Can be a bit messy after a rain. \n\nIt is not too bad but if you bring your dog to the park be sure to have the respect to clean up after them.",
          "Very small park, as long as it hasn't rained recently it's not too bad but plain dirt field so any rain turns the area into a mudslide. Fencing not well maintained. Do have two separate areas for small and large dogs and shelter in large dog area to get out of the sun plus a few plastic chairs to sit in and a picnic table. ",
          "A great little park! The location is perfect and I love the size, but being in  a floodplain makes it sooo muddy. I know there isn't too much of a solution, though, and my dog definitely isn't complaining.",
          "We go fairly often after work and reliably meet about a dozen dogs around 6 PM. People and dogs are nice; dogs are mostly medium to large. It gets quite muddy in wet weather and it takes a while to dry out. Parking is convenient and there are lights at night.",

          "This is an old recreational league baseball field that has been turned into a dog park. There is one area designated for big dogs, and another area designated for small dogs. The spaces are simple, with a watering station. Some seating is \u2026",
          "Reasonable people, and the only lighted dog park in the area.",
          "I love this park. All people and dogs are friendly. I've never witnessed an altercation between dogs at this location, which is pretty rare for a dog park \ud83d\ude09 I give 4 instead of 5 because of the fence damage in a couple spots.",

          "Love this park. Great shorter, easier disk golf course that's usually not very crowded.",
          "I would give 5 stars but the disc golf course is tight, wooded and its a short course. The rec center looks nice and kept up, it has a basketball ball court and a tennis court both covered. The climbing towers are off limits to non members, which sucks cause they look fun. All in all its a nice facility.",
          "Cute lil park - it has a disc golf course that's not very well maintained. A lot of construction going on but it has a small path for walking. Watch for snakes - there's at least one copperhead out there. It's a bit of a wild forest \ud83e\udd23",
          "The park is nice and has a disc golf course which was the main reason we visited it. It\u2019s not ideal to visit when the weather is very muggy and humid because the bugs are too much to deal with.",
          "Nice short disc golf course through the woods. Also have some covered basketball and tennis courts to use during any weather. Great park with a cool walking trail in the woods as well.",
          "Great course at a quiet park area in a neighborhood. Short and wooded, it\u2019s excellent for honing that driving putter and midrange game. Not much signage and mostly natural tees but it\u2019s fairly broken in so not too hard to find the next tee.",
          "Well maintained tennis courts times two, covered and lit until 9:30 at night. Same with basketball courts. Short 18 hole disc golf course is very good, but can be a little difficult to follow hole 11. Kudos to Durham parks and rec for this one",
          "It's a very nice quiet Park You can hear the children. Or inner children playing basketball and tennis no loud music no profanity. It's just a wonderful place to go for a walk or to take your children to play.",
          "I'm just rating it based on the disc golf course. Challenging to play but not necessarily in a good way. It was tough to find some tee boxes, compared with the 2 other courses I've played on the triangle. Holes were short on average.",
          "The sign for basket #1 was knocked down (We found it in the weeds and put it back up) and a lot of the course markings have been removed and/or vandalized. The second picture is where you go for the tee box on basket #2. \n\nOverall, great \u2026",
          "Nice range of facilities and not many people.  But there is a lot of litter on the ground.  Played disc golf there and the course is challenging for its size.  Bring a putter, couple midranges and a fairway driver.  Didnt see any water fountains.",
          "Nice place to play tennis!",
          "Short but challenging 18 hole wooded course perfect for a quick game right in the RTP (Easy to get to off of TW Alexander  or 147) Has been recently maintained,  there are easy to follow trails clearly marked from every basket to the next \u2026",
          "Very nice little park. Horrible for disc golf. Could be a fun course, but the makings are terrible. Difficult to find next hole. Felt like I was just wandering through the woods until I happened on a tee box. Which ter box? No idea. Which direction is catcher? No idea",
          "Fun disc golf course",
          "We went for a Birthday party and they have a High Ropes course that ends with a zip line. The DPR staff was caring and very helpful to ensure that everyone was safe. They allowed the party organizers to bring tents and chairs and it was nice. Definitely one of DPR's best kept secrets!",

          "The park is nice in that it offers so many things to do. From a basketball court to tennis, to a jogging/walking trail. To a playground, frisbee golf course and then one of those zipline obstacle courses. Its also pet friendly and I feel a \u2026",
          "Covered tennis and pickleball courts",

          "Rope course is awesome!",
          "This is a really great park.",
          "We played the disc golf course, and it was great! It's an amazingly well-marked and well-maintained course. There are enough trees to thread through that the holes are challenging, but the paths provide enough clearing to prevent it becoming frustrating. It's a real pleasure to find an 18-hole course that's so well kept up!",
          "We spent an hour or so here eating lunch (Cook Out take out is nearby) here with the family and kids. The park is nice has a small playground but other great amenities. We didn\u2019t do much other than chase kids around the playground and eat, \u2026",

          "Nice park and good basketball court",
          "Great small park with lots to do. The disc golf course is a great lunch-time play. You can get through the whole thing in about 30-40 minutes. Its fun and great for beginners.",

          "Great shaded basketball courts",

          "I went here to play disc golf because it was the closest park.  I will never go back here to play.  The first hole was not clearly marked and it took a while before I figured it out.  There needs to be better signage.  The tee pads are horrible and the holes need to be cleaned up with the overgrowth!",

          "There is 2 covered tennis courts with lights",
          "Visited this park to check out the disc golf course.  It was a confusing course.  Holes were poorly marked, many were unusually short (e.g. less than 40 ft), and there were few platforms indicating where to throw from.  There was a huge \u2026",
          "Walking paths, a disc golf course with short but varied holes, and what looks to be a neat ropes course. I came as caddy for my husband to play disc golf and for myself to play pokemon go. If you're looking for squirtles this is a good spot!",

          "Excellent park with great views of the Cathedral & City. Also has a very good basketball court which doubles as a five-a-side court. Two separate play parks for kids, an outdoor gym, cafe, community garden, and access to Durham Rail Station. Highly recommend this park for a",
          "Must have driven past this park 100 times and never bothered with it. Went in with a young relation on bank holiday Monday and was pleasantly surprised by how good it is. Good parking which you have to pay for but very reasonable. Lovely modern cafe and toilets and 3 separate",

          "Wharton Park is a lovely little park nestled away just behind Durham Train Station and just off Framwellgate Peth (A691). You can also enter it by foot from North Road or behind the Train Station. Its free entry but there is a charge if you're bringing in your car. Fifty pence",

          "There is a cafe (not open when I was there), a children\u2019s play area, community orchard and bird watching area. The park also has the sculpture by Hamish Horsley which frames the Cathedral in the distance. The view from the top of the battery over Durhamis great and you can also",

          "We spent a total of 4 1/2 hours here. Three hours were spent outside. We didn\u2019t even have time to ride the train. It is an extra cost. Our 2 &4 year olds really enjoyed everything outside. The treetops area and creek were their favorites. We didn\u2019t see the bears probably because",
          "I learned about bugs and butterfly\u2019s and dinosaurs! The train ride was fun! Oh yes, my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loved every minute too! It was hot but...... She was tired out by the return to the car!",

          "We took 3 two year olds and a baby, the two year olds are a little young to understand what they're doing, but they sure had a ton of fun! If it wasn't so hot, we would have explored outside a lot more, but there was enough to do inside for almost 3 hours.",
          "We were visiting family in Chapel Hill and they suggested we visit this location and we were very surprised about how well done it was. First let me say it is pricey. Two adults and two kids was almost $75.00. So that was a big kick. If I had thought ahead and had my zoo card",
          "We really enjoyed our visit. So much to see and do. The butterfly house was a great way to cool off on a hot day. The bear enclosure was gorgeous. Unfortunately, it was too hot for the bears to be visible. The red wolves were neat as were the lemurs. Make sure you spend",

          "This place is huge. Honestly, it should be enjoyed over many different visits. It seems to always be teaming with kids of all ages. There is so much to do both inside and out. It also seems to get a great variety of special exhibits. It has a very kid friendly and science",
          "Yes, it is a science museum at its heart but it is also the best park going if you have little ones. We would buy a yearly pass, write it off our taxes, and then go every single day to play. I can't speak highly enough of this place. We still go, even with teenagers, just not",
          "We visited the Museum of Life and Science in June 2018. This Museum is located in a very expansive area and requires a lot of walking. This Museum also offers very little shade outside of the walking paths to see the animals. The part of the Museum our kids (6 and 5) enjoyed",

          "The museum was a weekly trip when my children were small, but we still go now that they are teens. The butterfly house is an oasis as are the outdoor trails. No one would expect to have such beautiful park-like environment in the middle of the urban landscape.",

          "We only had part of a day to spend before driving 5 hours home, so we chose to come here. We were NOT disappointed, and could have stayed a full day and a half! Thankfully the weather was gorgeous and we only spent 4 hours exploring the outdoor exhibits. My 13 and 10 year old",
          "We had a great experience here yesterday. My daughter had a butterfly landed on her at the butterfly house. My son loves the Dino trail. The train is also a lot of fun.

          "We spent a couple hours here and had a great time, my wife and I (26 and no kids) had fun with the outdoor stops. The butterfly house was really neat and warm on a cold day! The animals were fun to see! It would be a lot more enjoyable with kids for sure",
          "First, the museum itself is great. However the employees need some customer service training. I tried to purchase an item and apparently it had the wrong price tag on it. The cashier acted as I had put the wrong tag on it. Not a way to engage with the public",
          "We visited here last April. We were just 2 adults but still enjoyed the exhibits. Most of the inside galleries where kid-oriented, but we walked through everything to check it out. Outdoors was more interesting to us, with a nice walkway through some natural habitats and animal",
          "The museum is a great venue for special events like science of wine. Knowledgeable volunteers. Clean restrooms. Food trucks arranged for the event provide a quick casual meal. Nice open spaces inside and out. I\u2019ve never been to the museum during the day.",

          "Short of a full-scale theme park, it would be hard to find an attraction more likely to satisfy children more than the Museum of Life and Science in Durham. To be certain, there are many things to interest adults as well, but the main focus is on the kids. The Museum offers",
          "I took my 3 year old for an afternoon and she loved it. So much to see and do that we had to rush to see it all. There was tons more to do but she set the pace. Sprout cafe was a good snack. Any kid who likes to learn can spend a day. We had a great time.",
          "The Museum is conveniently located in Durham. It has a large convenient parking lot and also has an overflow parking lot. We spent several mornings during our last few visits to Durham with my grandson who is 21 months old. There are so many interesting and fun exhibits",

          "My son and I visited the museum to see the area while my husband and daughter were on a college tour a Duke. At first, I was worried that my son wouldn't enjoy the park as it seemed from the outset to be geared toward younger children and he's a teen. We were both happily",
          "Brought my boys, ages 6 and 12. At first glance, my 12 year old was mortified that it seemed like only little kids here but both kids ended up loving it. It was a holiday and the line to enter was long so we did the outside first and let the inside clear out. We stayed all day",

          "Kind of tricky to locate, but if you follow the signs you will find it past the terminals. Kids liked it a lot. Something different. We had a snack up on the platform which was breezy and cool on a hot day. The planes were not using the runway in front of us, don't know if they",
          "This park is about the planes. The only play structure is a small climbing structure that is located in the sand pit. However, don't let this stop you from visiting. Kids love this park and enjoy seeing the planes land and take off. There are great views from the observation",

          "I own a limo business and take many executives, etc to RDU. I always reccommend they come out back with their kids to the observation deck. I guess since 9/11 the days of allowing civilians in the control towers is long gone, this is a decent alternative. They do pipe in some",

One of my things is if I have free time, order a pizza take it over and hangout with friends. \nSometimes it gets crowded, especially on weekends when people try and have birthday parties there (crazy). \nAlso a great \"cell phone lot\" as well if you are picking someone up.",

          "Love this place. And it\u2019s a great place to bring your family",
          "My all time favorite place to go plane Spotting.",
          "Was a lot of people around 4 on Thursdays. There is a little kiddie area for children to play at and still watch the planes. It's perfect for a mini date. You can bring snacks and watch in your car. It's a nice view but it's also a platform high enough to see planes coming down from the sky. Love the experience",
          "A great place/deck to watch airplanes take off and land. Most planes you see will be the regional jets operated by American, Delta, and United. The only B777 wide-body operator is the American Airlines that's scheduled for 19:25hrs to Heathrow. There are two runways, of which only RW23R one can be seen from the deck.",
          "It's nice to watch the planes takeoff, but then you cant see any of the planes land because there on the other side of the airport",
          "The most organized airport on the East coast...",
          "I love this place. I have been coming here since I was a child! Watching airplanes takeoff never gets old! Even for a 21 year old!!",
          "Love RDU Airport ! Staff is always friendly and airport is clean!!",
          "It was ok, but if you are going to just watch the planes I wouldn't waste a trip right now. They are doing construction at the moment on the runway this deck overlooks, meaning no planes are actually using the runway. I have been here \u2026",
          "Great place for airplane spotting. They have a nice little play area for kids.",
          "Fun place to visit for kids and adults! Great place for picnics and letting kids run off some extra energy!",
          "Nice place to spend some time with kids. The RDU is not very busy airport, so do not expect too many takeoffs and landings.",
          "Awesome place to take kids. Came with my niece and she had a blast!",
          "Kids have loved this place for years. Also interesting watching the planes.",
          "We go here often. Nice place to watch the planes land and take off or to catch some fresh air. My son loves to come and just run around . We often pack some lunch or snack and eat on the lawn.",
          "The construction on the runway kept the runway from being used which disappointed us. We used the General Aviation deck instead and paid to park for a short time. Fun to see the private planes and could see the regular flights as well.",
          "Great place to visit.",
          "A fun place to watch planned take off and land. There's also a small playground for children as well as picnic tables and restrooms.",
          "This is a great spot to have great views of sunset and also the planes coming in and landing. Also, when you need to pick someone up but the plane is late, you can hang out until you need to pick them up. Also, a cute spot for sunset.",
          "The UNC building blocks the view of the airplane touchdown, otherwise it is very nice.",
          "My son loves the observation deck.  We are here most weekends.",
          "It's good, they play the tower frequency over a speaker and have a miniature airport layout. The only thing is that you can only see half of one runway from the deck, which is really disappointing.",
          "Nice people an there's a lot of construction going on vary exciting to watch",
          "Not many ppl know it but decent view point.",
          "Great place to just chill. Wish they didn't take out the speakers to hear the tower talk to planes...kids loved that ..",
          "I think our visit coincided with runway construction, because we never saw a plane land or take off, which was a bummer. Nice observation deck and picnic area. Restrooms could be cleaner.",
          "Enjoyed the sunset and watching planes. Great place to wait on anyone who's arriving at the terminal. Also has stuff for the kids to do.",
          "So much fun to just go here and think about whatever is going on, have a good conversation, or just to get a good view of the planes. Great that the airport has a place for this that is open to public!",
          "It's small, but this park has great views of planes taking off and landing. There are tables and restrooms too, in case you feel like a picnic. ",
          "Good place for relaxing and enjoying sunset while waiting for flight to come in",
          "Good place to relax and see some planes. There is a giant building in front of your view which blocks a portion of your view. Wish it was bigger and that it has bathroom. At times, can get crowded with limited parking.",
          "As the other people said - It's facing the landing runway but even so we stayed there for almost two hours and no plane landed while meantime at terminal 1 about 20 planes took off already. And the UNC building is blocking the view. I'm \u2026",
          "Great airport. Too bad they close the upper departure level at night.",
          "Another one of my favorite places. Awesome free idea If you have small children or are just a grown up who loves planes",
          "They are currently doing construction so the runway near the observation deck is not currently open. So I'm sure it will be better once it reopens.",
          "This is a great way to kill some time. The playground could use some attention but is not bad. Occasionally when they are using the air strip closer to Terminal 1 you don\u2019t get to see anything.",
          "Cool spot. lots of information and place to relax before flight.",
          "Nice amenities on-site but you only get terminal 2 runway view, and partial at that.",
          "Nice view of the runway. Have met some nice people there. I'm an uber driver and I make a lot of trips to the airport and stop at the observation deck on occasions to take a break.",
          "It's a cool place to chill and look at the planes land and take off :)",
          "Been there two times over the last two weeks with my special needs son to watch planes, but each time the Delta side was closed to departing aircraft.   Don't why, but I bet I picked the two times in the last several years it was closed to departing aircraft. \n\nWill try again in a week or two, maybe the third time will be the charm.",
          "Fun park at the airport to watch the planes take off and land. There is an older playground and sand area for the little kids. Most of the kids like to run on the replica runways at the park. If your kids (or adults) love to watch airplanes, this is a great place.",
          "I am not very impressed with this particular location.\nThe development around the airport has caused this to be less of an observation point and more of a lucky sighting.\nThere should be a better location available with the vast spread of \u2026",
          "A semi hidden gem in RDU. You can come out get to relax or play and have a snack with your kids. You Can watch planned take off and land from terminal 2.",
          "Great place for kids to run about with free parking. Bathrooms arent the cleanest but otherwise nice outing for the family.",
          "Cool place to bring lunch and watch some planes take off!",
          "Very cool and definitely worth checking out if you have some time to kill before/after a flight, the deck overlooks one runway that planes take off and land on, as well as the taxiway(?) they use to get to the end of the runway. Mostly \u2026",
          "Great place to come and watch planes land and take off. The area has a nice layout; a raised deck for better viewing, space for kids to play, and benches and a few tables. There could be a few more tables for sharing a picnic. This area is kept beautiful and clean--thanks to the good work of grounds people.",
          "Hidden gem. Shouldn't even talk about how good it is.",
          "Great play area with a great deck to watch small planes take off. The stairs up to the deck are a little scary with a toddler, would prefer both entries to be a ramp instead. There's a shade tree or 2 near the play space, but doesn't cover \u2026",
          "Amazing view. Good place to relax and see airplanes. Family place!!",
          "Absolutely love this place!!! It\u2019s one of our family\u2019s staple play areas!! It\u2019s very simplistic in terms of basic play, but that\u2019s what makes it special!!! We had our son\u2019s 5th Birthday party there and it was a huge hit. The contact person \u2026",
          "I enjoy the observation deck. It's a nice place to relax while waiting to pick up someone from the terminals. I took my nephew during this visit. He enjoyed the small sand park. I wish they had more playground equipment.",
          "So relaxing to see flights' take off and landing. Place is very clean. Everyone from kids to senior citizens have fun.",
          "Nice place to watch planes take off & land on RDU's 10,000 foot runway (5L / 23R).  They have a speaker so you can hear some of what tower is telling planes to do.  Biggest drawback is there are a few buildings in the way, so you don't have \u2026",
          "A great place for kids and adults. There is a model runway setup, a small jungle gym, and picnic tables, not to mention the elevated deck for viewing runway 5L/23R. Check the RDU arrivals/departures schedule to maximize viewing.",
          "Great place to watch planes land and takeoff. Small sand Park for kids too.",
          "A very fun and safe place to take children. I felt very comfortable overseeing our grandchildren and it being their first experience with the outside of aircraft. The people who designed this airport themed playground did a first rate job. \u2026",
          "Nice view of the planes coming into Terminal 2, nice area to hang out with free parking!  Even has plaques to tell which type of plane is landing.  Good time on a cooler day like today was.",
          "My 2 year old LOVES it here! Great place to entertain your kids for free. When the air traffic is slow, she enjoys the pretend runway and sandy play area.",
          "This is a hidden place, but is good to see some planes taking off. Unfortunately there is no good view of the main runway.",
          "Cool view.   Convenient to terminal 2, especially while awaiting arrivals.  Better than new fangled cell park and waits.",
          "The platform needs to be about 50 feet taller at this point. A building blocks the spot where planes actually touch down, and one can only see about a quarter of the whole airport. Still, it's cool that this place exists, and you never know when something interesting is going to fly by. Kids love it.",
          "Nice quiet place to hang out and watch airplanes when you go to airport too soon to pickup loved ones. Similar distance as cell phone lot, especially easier for people coming from north raleigh side",
          "Great place to visit once in a while and clear out the mind. Not the most clearest view of the runway but its free.",
          "The observation deck is facing the landing runway. Spent the whole time listening to my 6 year old ask when we were going to see a place take off. The playground is one piece of sad climbing equipment",
          "Difficult to see much of anything. Bathrooms unclean.",
          "Fun to watch the planes, need a better playground!",
          "So fun for the kids.  I really appreciate that there is a bathroom.  Only way it could be nicer is if they would plant more shade trees around the parking lot.",
          "Good place for the kids and plane lovers",
          "RDU Observation Deck is easy to get to without getting in airport traffic. It is a great place to take kids to see the planes. There is a building/hanger that blocks some of the view. Overall nice facility.",
          "Very nice, but the overgrown trees are blocking the view of runway 5L. Guess there is nothing you can do about that. Very nice place for families and plane watching.",
          "Best seat in the house for flights arrive and take off.  Cool to hear the tower communications",
          "Fun place to watch planes and let littles run around while waiting for a flight to arrive. Parking is limited, so not good for a big group.",
          "Very nice place to wait for arrival with kids.  Small playground with sandbox.  Play airport walkpath.  Elevated observation deck where you can see and hear the airplanes taking off.  Decent amount of parking and bathrooms",
          "Kid's loved this place. They spent most of their time \"flying\" on the runway.",
          "Nice Park for aviation fans and kids alike. I just wish that UNC building was not there. It's obstructing an interesting portion of the runway where smaller airplane lift off the ground.",
          "It was better back in the day when it was a fence and you could park your car there.",
          "This observation deck is located at the end of landing strip, so while you can't quite see the planes landing, you can see the of thelanding, then turning around, and taxiing to the terminal. Also due to its location you can see some of the \u2026",
          "Great day trip to spend a few hours.  You can take food and there are tables. There is a make shift run way for kids, a sand area, play structure, learning opportunities, a huge field and you get to watch places-the best part.",
          "Love the observatory dec",
          "Very cool.  Had not been here in many years.  Great addition of the tower audio!  Perfect view.",
          "They have a nice little observation deck that has not been updated you only get views of one of the  runway \n5  left 23 right \ndependent upon the wind \nit may be busy or it may not \nthere is also a small area for children\n if you enjoy watching planes it is worth the trouble",
          "Children wanted to see planes land and take off. Only landing planes and can hardly see them from the building obstruction.",
          "Fun place to take your kids to see the airplanes take off or land. The play runway is fun!",
          "First time visiting and my son loved it. We were there at night but thing day time would be better.",
          "Plaques were from the early 2000's. Normally a good spot to watch landings, but the traffic pattern was reversed today.",
          "Great place for the kids to see airplanes taking off!",
          "There is enough activity to satisfy the young ones and it's easy to get in and out. There is no charge to park or for the observe deck.",
          "Very nice place and very clean . Children's play area nice.",
          "For those interested in flight.",
          "Great place to wait while family is waiting on baggage claim",
          "Deck with audio of the control tower, but ALSO a sand box with a climbing structure (spider), some picnic tables, and mini runways for kids to run on.",
          "Excellent place to watch arriving and departing flrights at RDU, there's a small playground to the right side and there are small size replicas of the two runways for children. Picnic benches and bathrooms make it a fun way to spend an afternoon.",
          "Fun and free place. Playground for the kids as well.",
          "Great views! Water fountain doesn't work though which is inconvenient if you wanna hang out for awhile.",
          "Website did not say that the runways in front of the observation deck were under construction at this time the latest update was from June, four months ago.",
          "Great place to take kids to see airplanes landing and taking off. Free parking and a small play area.  The only thing I would like to see added is someway to listen to the air traffic controllers and pilots.",
          "As an aviation geek, this observation deck was among the best on the east coast to watch planes! Situated almost halfway down the runway, a few hundred feet away, this spot provides great views of arrivals and departures in and out of RDU!",
          "Good place to watch planes take off",
          "Fun trying to show my son the planes",
          "Fun park to visit when you find yourself at the airport!",
          "Terrible.. hardly any air traffic.. frustrating if coming with a toddler..",
          "Love that little park, and great place to watch planes take off n land. They have restroom facilities picnic tables benches. History on airplanes.  A great time.",
          "It's a peaceful place to relax, go on a date, or to take your kids to watch planes takeoff",
          "Did not see planes taking off. Disappointed",
          "Very entertaining for kids (and grown-ups!) Parking is easy",
          "It's neat for the kids but I feel like it could be a lot closer to the runway.",
          "Great spot to bring kids!",
          "Still Closed Though",
          "This is a great place to hang out while waiting for an arriving passenger. Great view of the incoming planes and an amazing view of sunsets.",
          "Free entry little park and observation deck next to the airport runways.  Took our daughter and she loved to play and watch planes land.  We will be back.",
          "Very nice place to air plane watch. I hate to say, but a couple of trees cut down to the left would give a better view of more runway and ground movement towards the terminal, since the building to the right front isn't going anywhere.",
          "Viewing deck was fun for watching planes landing but we weren't able to see planes taking off which was a big disappointment. Metal playground equipment was old and VERY hot. Overall it looked pretty rundown and sad.",
          "You cant really see planes taking off but you can see them landing and just moving around on the tarmac. Theres a play area for the kids, bathrooms, and the actual obersvation deck is covered. There are also educational bits about the planes on plaques throughout the observation deck.",
          "You have to go here it's great and they have a play area for kids, fin place!!!",
          "There are a few huge buildings in front of the observation deck which blocks the view of the touchdown point which is the whole fun of seeing aeroplanes land.\n\nOtherwise the idea to build such a place is really good. Could have been little \u2026",
          "Its a lovely place and had necerybseen flight landing and take off so close",
          "It is a cool place to relax and watch private jets, passenger jets, and more types of plane take off.",
          "Wow you can see Airplanes taking off and Landing upfront. My son loves seeing planes and it\u2019s a great family place.",
          "Pretty views, but if you are looking for playground equipment for your child to play on, this isn't the place to go.",
          "Great place to wait for arriving passengers. Bring the kids. Not so great for Southwest because it is after that point but otherwise a bit of calm and interesting fun before the crazy pickup thing.",
          "Every damn airport in the world should have a glorious location like this! It is a bit hidden, but when you have to pick someone up it's great to just sit at a nice little park and wait for the call. Driving around in circles or stopping along the road like a dumbass is frustrating for everyone.",
          "Fun for the kids to observe the planes land and take off",
          "Pretty well maintained area. Bathrooms, playground for kids, and a little runway they can mess around on. Just too far away from the runways/terminal to get the best views. Good places to visit once, but once you've done it no reason to return.",
          "Nice place to carry kids",
          "The observation deck is great for watching planes land. There are incorrect signs stating there is a restaurant and another observation area at general aviation.  They need to remove those signs.",
          "Concept is nice but why build the deck with major obstructions right at the point of touchdown. Defeats the purpose. Will the deck be moved with the RDU 2040 Plan?",
          "It's fun for the littles when there are planes taking off/landing. It would be nice if the huge building wasn't obstructing the view but what can you do?",
          "Nice breeze and cool under the shade of the deck even on a hot day. The area was nice and clean and there were bathrooms.",
          "Nice, but some obstructions have been added since it opened.  NCDOT and UNC hangar blocks the actual touchdown almost every time.  Also trees on either side have grown up and now block views of Terminal One and Cargo Ramp so not great \u2026",
          "Showed up at 3p and it was closed. First time there. Very disappointed. Husband said it could've been due to predicted thunderstorms.",
          "It would be a 5 if there wasn't a building right in front. Other than that this place is great! Bring the kids here often",
          "A good place to view aircraft landing and taking off, but runway view is partially blocked by some hangers. Good place to bring the kids.",
          "So much fun seeing planes take off and land!",
          "Good place. Trees has grown though up to the point the cover runway 35L",
          "Flying machines in action and room to run arround. What more does a toddler need?",
          "I worked in the building behind you. Pretty good view from deck. Hear the controllers. Closes at dusk.",
          "Love watching the plane's take off and land...while I wait for flight arrivels...I feel safe there!!",
          "Great place for kids to watch planes land and take off.  Also good sunset views!",
          "The kids have a great time watching the planes come in. On slower air traffic days or times the kids can get a little bored. I find it best to bring lunch and have a picnic while watching the planes.",
          "As the other reviews says the view is partial and can see only take off.  It has kids play area and place to sit and eat. Better to go there on peak time to see more flights, otherwise you have to wait for long. I wish there is one to cover landing area as well.",
          "Nice place to hangout and learn something about aviation",
          "Lovely place to wait for friends coming in the airport need a ride while you wait for them.",
          "Great family fun!",
          "Great place to take kids young and old to watch the planes.",
          "Great alternative to driving circles around the airport. Plus you get to watch planes land and take off.",
          "It's an observation deck. You can hear the ATC radio traffic and watch the planes. It was hot so I can't give five stars. Perhaps outside air conditioning is an unreasonable expectation, but I calls 'em as I sees 'em.",
          "Fun little spot to take the kids and watch planes take off and land.",
          "Just trying to figure out where the restrooms are",
          "Nice place to take the kids if you have to wait for an incoming flight",
          "OMG LOVE IT! So my bf has an aviation obsession. We have never passed an airport without checking it out. So of course after touring NC State we stopped by this observation deck. The views were awesome! I loved coming here and watching the planes take off, it was so fun and a great place to have a picnic tbh.",
          "Nice place but position of observation deck is not the best. You can see landing planes but not the ones that take off",
          "Fun spot to relax and unwind and fantasize about flying far,far away!.....lol.",
          "Awesome spot for saying good bye and taking photos of planes landing or taking off. I love it.",
          "I do not understand the great reviews this place receives. The idea of building an observation deck is wonderful. Placing it behind a large building so that you will not see touchdowns - this is just sloppy design. The acceleration part of \u2026",
          "Nice park and viewing area to watch the planes land. Great place to wait for a flight to come in during the day.",
          "Great place to watch aircraft.",
          "Such a great space for kids!",
          "Cool place to go watch the planes take off and land. Great place for the kids and there is a small playground.",
          "Great place to wait for arriving planes for the new terminal",
          "Could be better if it was closer oor you could see more of the runway",
          "Awesome place to take kids to watch planes landing at RDU Airport. They even have a little park area for younger kids.",
          "Provides good, long views of RDU's parallel runways under a permanent outdoor canopy. Parking is free and adjacent. Benches are plenty, and many visitors bring a snack to enjoy while watching the near constant flight arrivals.  ",
          "My husband LOVESSS coming to the observation deck. It is so cool and family friendly and we enjoy ourselves everytime we go. If you like planes, I'd highly suggest it!",
          "A good place to spend a few minutes before dropping off a Loved one.",
          "No planes on the runway, and not easy to get to!",
          "Parking space, grass and a few things for the kids to play on. It's all well maintained and clean.",
          "Nice place for waiting your family or just for fun.",
          "Always a great place to watch the planes landing..",
          "Nice covered deck to watch the planes take off, pretty cool place!",
          "You watch planes take off and land. WOOT WOOT \u2708",
          "Cool place to bring the kids",
          "Good, close place to park to wait for flights of friends to come in.",
          "Ok place to go and spend a lil time with fam, kids and or friends and have a picnic. Could be better if the building was not in front.",
          "Best place to wait for an arrival! Free parking and only minutes from the gate!",
          "Very cool attraction for children and families.  There are small runways for children to run around on, you can watch planes land and take off from the observation deck and you can hear the tower communicate with the pilots as they land and take off.  Definitely worth checking out!",
          "Couldn't hear the radio traffic over the speakers, one speaker not hooked up the other couldn't hear.",
          "Pointless. Boring. No planes taking off. Tourists love it. Nice park for kids tho",
          "Breathtaking experience for me since I've never flown. Really looking forward to flying now.",
          "Good place to wait for arriving pax.",
          "Great place to cool your heels",
          "Fun place to watch the planes...hard to hear the tower through the speakers",
          "Nice relaxing place to watch planes take off and land",
          "This is a very relaxing park. Nice for families...",
          "Parents shouldn't treat it like a regular kiddie park - family/friends of plane passengers need those parking places when there are flight delays.",
          "It is ok. Is a small space.",
          "Large UNC building obstructs the best parts of both take offs and landings.",
          "Nice view. Great time pass for young ones.",
          "Great place to watch the planes launch and land",
          "Fun place to take the family and watch the planes! Free!!",
          "Only thing that ruins the view ia the unc hangar. Other than that it could use an atc loudspeaker.",
          "Fun date location. Has sand area for kids too",
          "Great for kids and enthusiasts",
          "Good for watching palanes but beware the wall of doom.",
          "Stopped by here and enjoyed watching a few planes takeoff within about 30 mins or so. easy to get to with bathrooms that are clean, and seats on the deck to sit and watch the planes. I will return here another day as this day was very \u2026",
          "Vey cool summer idea w the kids it also has a small park for them to play nothing fancy. It was really neat to see the plans take off and land!",

          "Fun place to watch an exciting baseball game and eat great food! Seating is nice and tickets are not a terrible price either!",
          "This is a real gem in Durham and a really super facility. Looks and feels very new and modern. Recommended",
          "It is not the old ball park from the movie but it is a fantastic new stadium. Didn't plan the stop but it was well worth my time.",
          "New Durham Bulls ballpark is state of. The art. Very nice. No games going on when we were there. Watched the Duke baseball team scrimmage. Has the Bull from the Bull Durham movie in the outfield. Worth a visit.",

          "My son plays for NCCU and this is their home field. Incredibly maintained and manicured. It is surreal to be in this stadium, thinking about the movie Bull Durham and watching my son play. Super cool!",
          "We went to a few games this year and truly enjoyed the entire experience. So much that we are buying a 10 pack of tickets to next season\u2019s games. This is great fun for all ages but be sure to get seats behind the net if you have young children.",
          "My canadian husband always dreamed of seeing the Durham Bulls athletic park after watching the movie Bulls Durham. Since we could not go to Myrtle Beach because of Hurricane Dorian, we made a detour to Durham and attended to 2 games. It was a great experience.",
          "This is an adorable miniature of a fullsize big league stadium! It has the feel of a real neighbothood park. Awesome selection of food and drink vendors. Super reasonable prices on Everything!",
          "Whilst visiting from the UK we watched the Durham Bulls, it was great! First time for my husband and he really enjoyed it too, great atmosphere with lots to eat and see, would highly recommend if you are in the area.",
          "The Durham Bull Athletic Park is a beautiful park. The vendors are a little expensive, but a beer and hotdog is plenty for me to eat and watch a good baseball game.",
          "I invited one of my high school classmates to go with me to a Durham Bulls baseball game on the Sunday before Labor Day. The first pitch was at 5:05pm. It had been several years since I had been to a baseball game, so I was a bit unfamiliar with parking in downtown Durham.",
          "Good location; easy to get to; ample garage parking and handicapped can park for free. The sightlines in the park are great with no obstructed view seats. In really hot weather you may want to sit farther up in the stands under the overhang since they have cooling fans",
          "If you love baseball you need to go there we had an awesome time and loved every minute of it especially the kids who got to run the bases",
          "The Triple-A players of MiLB get a taste of the \"show\" if they get to play here. This is a GREAT ballpark!",
          "Although the Bulls lost we had a good time. We got BOGO tickets for presenting our Lowe\u2019s card $12 for section 209. Since there were not a lot of people present we just moved about the stadium trying out different views. Confessions are reasonable. The first aid office was top",
          "Absolutely love the bulls stadium and park. American tobacco trail and surrounding areas have been completely re done. There are so many restaurants and fun shops in the area. It's super safe and AMAZING FOR kids and families. We also do Bark In the Park and bring the dogs to",
          "Great family entertainment, good selection of food vendors. The staff is excellent and happy to answer questions. The fireworks on Friday are worth the price of admission.",
          "This ballpark knows how to treat fans and the game with respect. In a world of quasi-retro stadiums, the Bulls have a home that fits its urban neighborhood on the outside while being very fan-friendly, simple, and accommodating on the concourse. The combination makes this a",
          "Baseball, whAt more can you say. This is a convenient location, walking distance from most places. We were staying downtown and walked here and enjoyed an evening of fun baseball.",
          "How can you go wrong at a stadium that holds (I am assuming) 7,000 or so people? Every seat is fantastic. I sat on the lower level just past third base (row 10) for $14. At these prices, you can afford to take the whole family. The concessions have many choices and are",
          "We attended a Friday night game with a near sold out crowd due to Yankee players playing rehab games. The park was an easy walk from the hotel. The seats had a great view and were comfortable for a Triple A ballpark. The food was good and very affordable. Overall the fans were",
          "Not a fan of baseball in general, but the weather was amazing and we had tickets. It's a clean stadium and it doesn't take much for me to get caught up on beer and hot dogs. Intrested in baseball and in Durham, check it out. Plus, there are great restaurants in the area. And",
          "Such a thrill to see the Bulls. Great energy and food in the park and everything was affordable. Great selection of local brews and close to the action in all seats. Awesome",
          "Love this ballpark. Something about it just makes you feel like you're at home. Great selection for food and beer. Plan ahead to stay in the shade if you're going to be at a day game, though. It gets hot!",
          "Good evening attended the game thus evening vs Norfolk tide glad tickets were free would not spend a dime to buy there is a tiny bit of fan interaction if u want to watch a game stay home or watch high school the players are boring and game takes too long played ball all my life",
          "went here for the ACC tournament and was very impressed with the ball park the people were friendly and my grandson had a ball that is a pun as he did get 13 balls from the teams and one very special one FSU coach mike martin signed one for him he is a big FSU fan the foood was",
          "Our last year attending the ACC tourney as it's moving away from stadiums that support the International League. Too bad. This is a great ballpark. It checks off all the boxes and they do a great job supporting the ACC. Here are the boxes: Seating area - check (including",
          "I hadn't been back to this park since 2000 and the backdrop out in leftfield had changed dramatically, but for the good. Hidden, replaced are portions of the Lucky Strike facility. The famous bull and the rest of the facility are clean and great. What remains of the Lucky Strike",
          "What a great place and park to enjoy an affordable night with family. My first job was at a minor league ball park so my love for the minor leagues goes way back. We got a hotel room right next door so we were able to walk right over to park because we were from out of town.",
          "Great ballpark! If you like baseball, a minor league game is a joy.Take the kids , go with a group or just go by yourself.",
          "As a baseball fanatic I enjoy visiting minor league ballparks and Durham was no exception. We ate at Tobacco Road, a restaurant in the outfield, which is not inside the park, but you can watch the game from there. Watch out for flying balls, esp during batting practice, if you",
          "My first baseball game, good venue, parking slightly slow but not too bad. Stadium is very modern. Good seats with a great view of the action. Food was not bad, good price 2. I would increase the amount of beer you can buy to 4 per visit but that\u2019s only an idea. Loved the whole",
          "I work in Durham and try to go to at least one Bulls game a season. I had an especially great time this year - great weather and especially enjoyed Wool E. Bull and his antics...and watching a funny video of two of the players telling corny jokes!! I would highly encourage",
          "Great evening at the ball park. Lots of fun, food and drink in a great stadium. Good seats for a good price and lots of activity throughout the game. Best fireworks I've seen in years. Must go again!",
          "We had a blast. We are a family of 4 with two you boys (ages 3&5). We all had a wonderful time. Tre bathrooms were clean and the staff were wonderful!! We can\u2019t wait to go back. -The Wandering Walkers #thewalkerswanderon",

          "This park has it all in a beautiful setting: good baseball, a variety of foods, easy parking, friendly fans and it's a great value too. One of the best family/friend outdoor experiences in the Triangle.",
          "Great park for baseball! Wollys corner does charge extra for children. Their baseball camp is excellent and run efficiently.",
          "The park is very close to downtown so come early for dinner and stay for a baseball game. Check the schedule for ticket discount nights and weekend fireworks after the game. Parking deck nearby should be around $5 on game days.",
          "This is a fun place to visit.,Bring the kids and,make it a party. I like that they have mists of water periodically to cool you off",
          "It was February so we did not get a chance to get inside the stadium but it was still enjoyable to wander the perimeter and enjoy the beautiful architecture. It is located next to American Tobacco and the two blend in very well together.",
          "A big part of the new downtown Durham is the Bulls ballpark. Fun to visit. Good eats and drinks. Lots of good food and places to visit in the environs.",
          "If you want to have fun, the Durham Bulls Park is the place to go. I promise you will have a great time whether it is for a ball game or another activity going on",
          "My family enjoyed going to the park watching the Durham Bulls play, my kids loved the concession area, with the different foods.",
          "DBAP is one of the best venues to watch baseball in the USA. I prefer to sit in the first couple rows beyond the netting\u2014 rows 118 or 117 to get a great view and closeups of the bullpen. The Durham Bulls are at the top of AAA baseball and effectively are a taxi squad for the",
          "We just passed by and took some pictures but it is awesome. Clean, well organized, so much detail in the place. Worth to see it!",
          "We have been to the Durham Bulls Athletic Park many many times. The atmosphere is always quite pleasant. The crowds are quite family oriented. The games are great and there are some very good meals to be had besides hotdogs and burgers. The restrooms are clean and well kept.",
          "There are pay-to-park lots in the area. The stadium is nestled among office buildings. The staff was friendly and helpful--the usher actually took me to my seat. It is a well designed ballpark with good sight lines. It is a pleasant setting to watch a top level minor league",
          "We don\u2019t come often, but always find it enjoyable to visit the Durham Bulls. Wait! One time there was a special promotion of some kind and we couldn\u2019t get a parking place so we went home. Otherwise, it\u2019s made for a fun evening and parking has been easy. You don\u2019t have to",
          "Anyone who spends a few days in DURHAM, N.C. should try and get in a game at Durham Bulls Athletic Park. Great experience and atmosphere even if you aren\u2019t a big fan of the sport. Family friendly and affordable night out. Even better if you can catch a game with fireworks.",
          "We had a great time eating dinner with the family while watching the game . . . When the game went on too long the kiddos loved the bouncy space and meeting woolie bull! The adults loved the cold beers and everyone loved the evening fireworks! A great night all and all!",
          "We were here for USA Baseball and thought the boys would enjoy more baseball which they did. Sharing the joys of watching these boys enjoying themselves as well as seeing the stars in their eyes as they hope to earn a spot on the National Team! It's always a pleasure to see",
          "Good AAA park. Really for 9.99 tickets you cannot beat this price for entertainment. The team is good. The park is clean and the view is outstandingly m",
          "Our family enjoyed the Bull Durham ball games here. Stadium offers a variety of snacks and beverage options. We paid I think $5 to park in a grassy lot across the street. There are parking garages and spaces near the stadium which is very close to Rt 147.",
          "Love this place. I have been to many ballparks, both major and minor league. This place is fantastic. All eating has a great view. Concessions are reasonably priced and tickets are a steal. If you love baseball you will love this park.",
          "We really enjoyed the park, fans, employees and overall experience. We realize that concession food at ball parks is normally mediocre but our experience with hamburgers at the concession in the concourse was worse. The meat was bland and the lettuce, tomato and onion were",
          "This ballpark is very nice! The signs even tell you what kind of food and vendor is at each level and where it\u2019s lixated on that level. The \u201cblue monster\u201d is easy to see and doesn\u2019t have too many advertisements so you can see the statistics of each player easily. Highly",
          "Here for a game with a group of \"seniors\" from our community. Great seats undercover with fans to help when there wasn't a breeze (although being an evening game, we did get a few breezes too). Exciting game with lots of scoring from both teams, even though Bulls eventually",
          "Beautiful park, great times. However it was an early afternoon game and being from Michigan the sun and humidity was too much! Left in the 4th inning to give in the hotel pool.",
          "Not a bad seat in the house. Avoid the outfield if you can due to the setting sun. Bathrooms are very clean for a stadium. Beer selection is great. Service at the 42 Bar located on Jackie's Landing can be really slow.",
          "My family was in Durham for a few days and we love a good baseball game so we went to see the Bulls. The ballpark is very nice and there are plenty of food and beverage selections. The food is exactly what you would expect at a ballpark so if you want really great Durham food,",
          "Super easy ball park to navigate. Big enough but not too small! Good food available, very safe and clean. Very family friendly and with extra activities for kids (like a jump house, etc...). Local area is fairly easy to park and with family friendly restaurants in walking",
          "You can see some almost-major league baseball in this 10,000 seat stadium in the middle of Downtown Durham. The food selection is excellent (BBQ!); the women's rooms are plentiful; parking is not free but very easy. There is so much to do (eat/drink/stroll) before or after a",
          "We attended as a company activity when staff member was leaving. With a staff consisting of all ages, this was excellent choice. And it was $1 concessions night, one of numerous themed nights throughout the season. Ballpark allows people to put names on big board of those",
          "Great place to take family. Fireworks on weekends are explosive. The park has good food choices and really good beverage choices for adults. The play is as close as it can get to the majors.",
          "Awesome ballpark, tons of stuff for the little kids when they get bored with baseball. Great food, lots of options.",
          "My husband and I drove up for a game and had a fabulous time! Plenty of entertainment and a great evening at the ballpark!",
          "We had excellent seating. The refreshments were within budget for a family. The setting was lively. I am not a great fan of baseball but I had a good time.",
          "This ballpark is beautiful. So much better than most southern ballparks. It's got great atmosphere and energy. The team is good this year too so that helps with the enthusiasm within. Great food and beer selection. I highly recommend.",

          "Since we've never been to a Durham Bulls game before I went online and purchased tickets behind third base. The seats were great except for one very big drawback - it was a day game with a start time of 1:05 PM and it was a hot summer day. If you decide to attend a day game",
          "My wife and I attended a Durham Bulls game last night, as we have periodically since this park opened and even before in the old park. We've always made it an outing for food and fun. The weather was a little iffy, but the game and the entertainment between innings was",

          "Our family regularly visits the DBAP since we only live 4 miles away. It's geared toward a family atmosphere, but the die hard fan will still enjoy it. The Bulls are always competitive, which makes for good baseball. The organization engages the community well - our daughter",
          "We went as a field trip for my daughter's class. It was a nice time but parking is ridiculous so leave early before the game to find a space. This is baseball park food and not cheap but hey, its for the kiddos, right?",
          "We have been to DBAP several times and each time we are provided a great baseball experience. From the food and atmosphere to the promotions and activities staff, everything here is done well. Excellent place to watch a game. Enjoyed our visit on Saturday to catch some ACC",

          "Our family was visiting Durham (my wife had a conference at Duke) so my 5-month-old daughter and I ventured out into town for something to do. As luck would have it the Bulls were in town and had a perfectly timed 10:35am start on that Wednesday. I bought my ticket behind home",

The store is amazing. This is a great family or friends evening out. Parking is poor but pre-planning",

          "We went here while visiting Duke. This was a fun Sunday evening at a great price. I love that they serve local beers. Our $18 tickets 3 rows from first plate were great. We even got to run the bases after the game.",
          "Love the food stall which sells Italian sausages and hotdogs as what is a visit to a ballpark without indulging in hot dogs. There are condiment stations placed along the various food stall creating the ability to add your favorite toppings. There are stalls selling pizza,",

          "In baseball season, there is nothing better than to take in a game at the Durham Bulls Athletic Park. I am aware that my historical information may be faulty, but to me this is the cradle of baseball in the USA. This is the set of the Bull Durham film, after all. Did you know",
          "Small means good views from anywhere and a cozier atmosphere. Food options have lines that take way too long but overall a nice experience.",
          "We love seeing baseball games at the DBAP. It is just off 147 so it is easy to get to and there is a lot of pay parking. The place has lots of great restaurants around it and inside it. All of the seats are good views, but we like to get the ones that are covered when we can.",

          "Hint: pair this trip with dinner beforehand at Tobacco Road for an awesome time! My family really enjoys games at the park, but be prepared to pay. Almost everything in the park costs extra, even the kids playing zone. This a unique ballpark with a \u201cblue monster\u201d wall in left",
          "I didn't go to a game, but went to a meeting of the Durham Rotary Club at the park. The club meets in a lovely room overlooking home plate and it is a great venue. The lunch was catered, but I don't know by whom. It was a delicious buffet meal. The room has everything a meeting",
          "My daughter works for the Bulls. Great organization! My son, his friend and his friends mom and I had a blast at the game we attended. Can't wait until next season.",
          "It's a fairly typical baseball stadium, but with the advantage of being very family friendly (safe) and clean. Don't try to get a beer while interesting parts of the games are happening, because a large beer selection at some stands slows down the whole process.",

          "Great venue, for a good price. The team is usually in the playoff's or at the top of its division . So it is always a good game",

          "You don't have to like baseball to enjoy the DBAP. This is Durham's backyard -- where everybody goes to hang out, and eat funnel cakes, and run into old friends. There is a great play area for kids, and between innings there are kid-centered activities and regular antics from",

          "Attended a playoff game here and have always enjoyed the DBAP, despite the fact that I'm not a big baseball fan. The Bulls are fun and the stadium is well designed with great food selections at a reasonable price. Have a 4 year old who loves the kid's play area.",

          "Went to the Bulls game with my cousin. Very nice ballpark (just like Camden Yards in Baltimore but without the upper deck).. Reasonably priced, good quality AAA baseball. Parking was iffy. No real parking dedicated to the ballpark. Overall a very positive experience.",
          "In fairness, I was not here for a ballgame. I was with an out of town business group. We met and had lunch in the premium suite area overlooking the stadium from above home plate. The lunch for 130 was catered by the Bulls. Very good. Look forward to coming to a game.",
          "I've come here for a couple Bulls games before. I have no complaints about this place. There are many options for food and drinks and the prices aren't as high as they could he at some other event venues. Overall a great time with family, friends or even on a date!",

          "We had such a fun time at the Bulls game! Friendly staff, great atmosphere and the team is good too. Fun to see a win and the celebration after. They have a great Bulls gear store with various price levels. We bought hats and shirts too. We'll definitely go back on our next",
          "Relive Bull Durham just by sitting in the stands and gazing out to the field. This historic baseball park was built in 1926 and still in use. It's been upgraded with accessible seating. If you're a baseball fan and passing through Durham, this site is a must see!",

          "We decided to take a client to the game and had no trouble finding a block of tickets for a weeknight game. The park is clean and is easily accessible in the downtown area of Durham. There are also nice places to eat within walking distance to the park. The area is also safe",
          "Enjoyed the game- lots of places to eat surround the park. We're glad we ate before we went in as concession stands ran out of lots of items- probably due to being near end of season. Stadium is easy to navigate and visibility of field was good. Kids loved the bull and that",
          "Close to field seating. Good views and entertainment. Fun place to watch ball game. Generally affordable snacks and beer. Great fireworks after game",

          "Went to two Durham Bulls games within a couple of weeks of each other. Wonderful Triple-A baseball. Team is fun to watch, and the stadium is the best minor league park I've ever been in. The field dimensions and inside look are patterned after Fenway Park in Boston, though the",
          "This is a nice ball park. Traffic near and around the park can be a little crazy. If you are disabled( in a wheelchair) there are elevators to get you to the the seats at top. I would suggest planning ahead for seat selection. Also you may need to ask where elevators are as they",

          "Going to a Durham Bulls game remains a treat that harkens back to a simpler time before brutal theatrics and earsplitting musical tirades now seem mandatory (ie., basketball and football venues). Young children love coming to a game; there is room to run, children-friendly",

          "Built with a \"big-league\" mindset, it is no wonder that Durham's baseball park currently hosts AAA baseball. The brick walls and \"tucked in downtown\" architecture gives the yard a very old-time feel - yet the place is relatively new. Lots of concessions, extra things to do",

          "We went to a baseball game (Durham vs Atlanta) and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We live in Philly, and the large city stadiums are not as enjoyable. There was plenty of short entertainment between innings that made the night more exciting. The cost was the best part. Rarely",
          "I've been a mini plan ticket holder for several years but am just now writing a review. This is a baseball fan's ballpark, a family ballpark, and a social event ballpark. For a minor league franchise (albeit famous) this is an excellent place to watch a game. Great food, beer,",
          "My son was 4 months old for his first Bulls game 16 years later it's still a tradition. Go before it gets too hot. August games in the full sun (like down the baselines seats)can be almost unbearable. Try to get a seat under the cover. Protects from the sun and they have giant",
          "Not our first visit but always a fun visit. The entire park has a very intimate feel to it. It has the old time charm of the ball parks from yesterday-year. Anywhere you sit has a great view of the field. Great family fun. A must if you are visiting the area. They had a",
          "An institution long before Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon, the Bulls are a must during the summer. The stadium is great (really no 'bad' seats), the food and refreshments are varied and affordable, and there's even a playground for the little ones when their attention spans",

          "Fun for family and friends!!! Baseball and entertainment for kids! Highly recommend seeing the Bulls!",
          "Went to a game yesterday and was not disappointed. I did not like that the prices had increased so drastically since I last went to a game there, but the offset of a $5 off at the concession meant my kids at least got a refillable drink essentially free for the game. We got",
          "Decided about 30 minutes before the game to attend, tickets were easy and wicket staff were helpful. Recommend sitting on the side with odd numbers so you aren't in direct sun if you go in the evening. Beer was reasonable, but I'm used to very expensive beer at the park in",
          "Great way to spend an afternoon/evening. Enjoy watching sporting events, a Bulls game is inexpensive and you can get good seats. Looking forward to going to another game soon.",

          "What a perfect venue to watch a good professional baseball game. The place is purely delightful for a baseball fan. Food is little pricey but great seats are a steal. Tip: Sit on the first base side for more foul ball chances - I got one!\ud83d\ude01",

          "We thoroughly enjoying going to Durham for a Durham Bulls game. We are only 15 minutes away, so we oftentimes make spur of the minute decisions to go to a game. The ballpark is lovely and the staff there is great. The Bulls always give the opposing team a run for their money,",
          "This is a beautiful ballpark! We got there early and walked around the neighborhood. Everything is very nice with various options to suit your mood. The players were somewhat accessible before the game. There are many food and drink choices at \"usual\" ball game prices and I",

          "Hey, I am from a city with a Major League Baseball team but there is really nothing like this Triple A park and the Durham Bulls Team. The seats are inexpensive... $10 or less gets you a seat usually inside 1st or 3rd base. On some nights you can even get a hot dog for $1.",
          "I went to the opening day of the 2017 season of the Durham Bulls. The team put on a good show - with a variety of entertainment. The crowds were friendly. We sat in the outfield and had a superb view of the fireworks after the game. The fireworks were spectacular!",

          "Unfortunately the Bulls weren't in town when we were in Durham, but we were courage the check out the area by friends in NC. We're glad we did. The field is beautiful and accessible even when there's no game. It's located in the Tobacco Road section of town which is an old",
          "You don't even have to like baseball. The experience is in being there, the crowd cheering the home team, the wonderful food, Woolie Bull and his golf cart, cannoning shirts. Then, there's the fireworks. Money spent on attending is good investment in something you can't find",
          "This is a lovely ballpark with a great spirit. It's worth spending a summer evening here when you're in Durham, NC.",

          "One of my criticisms of many Amercian sports venues is that they're pretty generic - one out of town stadium looks much like any other. DBAP is a joyful exception to this rule - from the microbrewery inside to the 'Hit Bull Win Steak' sign, the place balances a proud history",

          "This is a great ballpark to go to a Friday night baseball game with family and friends and root for the home team. The park has excellent accommodations and good choices of food for the game. Access is easy to get to your gate and to your seat. Why Friday nights? - they have",

          "Great AAA ball park, If you want to take in minor league baseball this is as good as any park in the country. It is also in a great location with lots of good before and after eating locations nearby.",
          "Even if you're not that into baseball, this is such a great park surrounded by well planned downtown Durham!",
          "This is a great outing you can take the whole family to and it makes a great date. Cheap seats, great baseball, and great food.",
          "I often visit the park for games throughout the season for a good time. Win or lose they put on a good show although I miss the young man who yelled \"Peanuts.\" The fireworks display that was put on was nothing short of amazing. I expected a short show but they went above and",
          "The ballpark is nice. They have added many more food selections. But there is plenty of space to walk around and enjoy the game at the same time. Parking could be improved though.",

          "Great family event. Tickets are reasonable but the food is very costly. The individual sodas were also very expensive, so we got the free refills option, and that was worth it.",
          "Make some great memories at the ball park. Well kept and managed stadium. \"Wooly Bully\" keeps the crowd energized and enthusiastic. Plan a special occasion for a group and reserve a private area. Close to lots of other attractions in downtown Durham",
          "The Durham Bulls have done it right!!! Great ballpark and good food, drinks, and women. If you can't find a hot chicken in there on a Friday or Saturday night here.....well....well...",
          "Great place to visit with friends or family. Watching the Durham Bulls play is always a fun & enjoyable experience, but there's also plenty to do for those who want to enjoy the atmosphere without sitting through the game. Everything is kept up well.",
          "This is a beautiful minor leagues baseball stadium in the heart of Durham. It is right off of 147 and it is nice to see the stadium while driving by. I have been for games and most recently for the World Beer Festival and love how pristine and green the stadium is. The bull will",

          "Watching the Durham Bulls or Duke baseball play games here is always fun. There are activities for the kids, fun food, an in-house brewery & much more. Great place for groups, families & singles like me. I usually sit behind home plate but there is also a place in the outfield",

          "We are so lucky to have this incredible facility so close to our home. Lots of cities have minor league baseball, however very few have this level stadium to be so proud of. You get the major league feel with the home town feel of minor league baseball and affordable as well.",
          "Great time out for a meeting, family, friends, work mates. Just to relax and unwind. Really inclusive events and neat for kids of all ages even if they are 60+. Always a good time. peanuts, popcorn and cracker jack washed down with a few Barley Pops!",
          "This park is like a major league park but smaller. A safe park in that it has anet over parts of seating that catches foul balls from going into grandstands. And on a 90 degree nite it was bearable because of huge ceiling fans above the grandstands.",
          "The \"new\" DBAP has all of the amenities you would expect from a big league park. It was well done and is a very nice venue for a baseball game. I may be a bit jaded since I watched the Durham Bulls in the old stadium that they filmed Bull Durham in. The park is a HUGE step up",
          "Lots to do and choices to eat. Very clean stadium and great place to see a ball game. Don't miss the walk of fame with all the old time players and broadcasters.",
          "A value that can't be beat. They know that families are the core of who they attract and everything is very family oriented. Lots of things for kids to do as well as many concession options. Entertainment geared towards kids as well. Can't beat the price either, there's not much",
          "Great venue for minor league baseball. Parking can be a challenge, Durham has improved garages and parking near the athletic park, restaurants and performing arts center. Restaurants are plentiful near the park. Trip Advisor can help you find the right one for you. Or, just grab",
          "We have been going to the Bulls games for years. Two years ago the city and club gave it a face lift and added a lot of great features. Getting food is easy to get and the park flows well with people. There is easy parking around of the park for the game also.",
          "We have been going to the Bulls games for 18 years and it is great entertainment. It is so nice to have this team in Durham.",
          "we are season ticket holders for 9 years. Fun for the whole family, play area and photo opt with Wooly Bull. good food, new vendors, party venue and of course baseball. Durham Bulls are the minor league for Tampa Bay. Much friendlier then a pro ball park It does get crowed",
          "Great minor league stadium. No bad seats. Family atmosphere. Good food and local nightlife near the stadium.",
          "Nice park with good seating. Good family clean fun. Fireworks are great. Sorry the season is over already. Will return next year",
          "If you enjoy baseball, the Bulls games are fabulous. If you don't, then go for the people watching, the food and drinks, and the fireworks. This is a great location to be guaranteed a good spot for fireworks on the 4th of July! I've been several times, and my favorite game so",
          "Went to a game on the 4th of July and everything about this place impresses me! I have been around several minor league stadiums and the Bulls have it down to a science! So much fun! Well done Durham!",
          "The food was wonderful. We really enjoyed ourselves. Also the fan were a big help cause it was very humid outside.",
          "This was the very first time for us at the historic Durham Bulls Athletic Park. Can't beat the price for tickets and the atmosphere is really very nice. The game itself is quite slow and since they are a minor league team, the plays are a bit \"yawn inducing\". The wait times at",
          "We all really enjoyed catching a Bulls game on our trip to Raleigh. I would recommend that you sit on the first base side of you go to a day game. The third base side was full sun.",
          "During our trip to Raleigh, we were able to get a couple of tickets to attend a Bulls game. As we all know, the first thing we all think of is the movie but also knowing that stadium was knocked down a while back. Needless to say, what a gem. The ballpark fits right into",
          "First trip back to DBAP in a couple of years. Really enjoyed the experience for this game. The weather cooperated and the ticket office agent recommended some really great seats a bit off home plate and about halfway up. Couldn't have picked better seats myself! While $7 for a",
          "Great evening at the ball park with co-workers and our kids. Wonderful way to end the summer. Thanks.",
          "excellent place for family fun, cheap ticket prices and beautiful ballpark. Employees are nice, best fireworks show @ a ballpark I have seen in a long time. Any seat in the house has a good view. Parking is either $5 or free after a certain time on the street. Very safe area and",
          "I wish the game had been more exciting. The Bulls didn't make one run. Oh well. The parking was close and reasonably priced. Will Call was easy to find. The food selection was about what you'd expect at a sports venue: burgers, hotdogs, wings, bbq, pizza. Enjoyed Woolie Bulls",
          "I coordinated a Father's Day outing for family to the game. Ordering tickets was easy as was getting to our seats for the game. My one disappointment was that the concession stand I visited said they had veggie hotdogs but they did not actually have any.",
          "This is truly one of Durhams most popular spots. Bring the kids and enjoy a great evening with a good group of folks. Food is nice and won't cost you the moon. And yes enjoy a cold beer with your buddies. Clean, fun, easy access, and folks working there want you to enjoy",
          "My infant son is special needs and we were sitting in the handicap section due to his wheel chair and it was warm. He started to have a seizure and a lady employee called for help on her radio and employees came running to help. We were rushed to a cooler area while ambulance",
          "Best food for a ball park around, best beer by a brewery in a ball park, and great atmosphere. One of my favorite activities on a summer night! Love the DBAP!",
          "The Durham Bulls are a hallmark of the Durham experience. I've been going to games since I was a little kid, they're always fun, entertaining and there's a wholesome air of excitement. Plenty of good food and drinks. I recommend the barbecue sandwiches near the playground in the",
          "We took our friend and his 6-year old son to a game and by the second inning, his son asked to come back the next day. We did!! It's a great time for kids and adults. So much fun and the fireworks were awesome!!",

          "Great night at the ballpark! Seats were close to the action, very reasonably priced and comfortable. It was a hot night in NC but the atmosphere made up for it. Great food, great fans! Highly recommend for families!",
          "Love going to a game or twenty at the park. Beautiful ball park, reasonable prices, good food, good beer. With luck, maybe the Bulls will win! No, the Bulls aren't major league, but we have a good movie!!",
          "I always take my grandkids here several times per year and they always have a great time. The food is very good and a GREAT value -- especially compared to a Hurricanes game",
          "What a great ballpark. So much fun and tradition. Tickets are affordable and there isn't a bad seat in the park. The outfield seats were in the sun the first half of the game which would be rough on a 90 degree day. There is a large selection of food options including peach",
          "Baseball in the Summer is about as American as apple pie and one of the most exciting places to see baseball in the Carolinas is at the Durham Bulls Athletic Park, (the \"DBAP\"). The DBAP was built in the 1990's and it looks like a smaller version of Camden Yards, home of the",
          "This is our first visit to the area and would thoroughly recommend it. It was great entertainment (we were not bothered about who won, just the enjoyment of the game). As Brits we could follow the rules as it is slightly akin to rounders (I am sure the team would not agree).",
          "This is my favorite summer activity. Cheering for the Bulls is a joy. A beautiful stadium, a great baseball team, people-watching heaven, snacks and great beer. I love to go to a game on my birthday!",
          "Great family-friendly place to come for baseball games! I also love that I can now breastfeed my son in privacy and not get looked down upon by people or feel like I am doing something wrong! Thank you for installing a place for us moms to feed our little ones!",

          "Best to get the seating upgrade to be under the shade. We always walk around to the deck and stand under the moving bull that plays with every run. Super fun wouldn't miss a season.",
          "I'm not a huge baseball fan, but we live in Durham and love attending a game each Spring before it gets too hot. The stadium is really nice, always clean, and folks who work there are always helpful. Food options could be better - after all, Durham is (otherwise) a GREAT food",

          "We went to see the Durham Bulls play this weekend and let me say that I have been to a lot of Major League Baseball Games, but the Big Leagues can not compare to the Fun Family friendly atmosphere that Wooly Bully showed us, the kids/adults had a blast. the Food was affordable",
          "My family and grandma and grandpa went out on a Friday night to watch the bulls play. We had a wonderful time and the park food was really yummy! We love the facility and the food and the night life around after the game and fireworks ended. A really good family fun evening.",
          "I love going to Durham Bulls games! Minor league games have much more of an old-fashioned \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" feel than major league games. Additionally they are less expensive and great fun for kids. Good seats are almost always available, and we often find parking",

          "Cheap way to have a great outing and some fun! My boyfriend and I always find great deals on great seats and it's good cheap way to get out of the house. Ofcourse the only thing a little expensive is your concession stands, beer in particular!",
          "I would have to agree with Dan S. who said this is the best minor league ballpark. It's not the fanciest, though it is relatively new and has the modern amenities. It just has great sign lines, a lot of covered seating,and great atmosphere. And the snorting smoking bull sign",
          "My son and I had so much fun at the Bulls Baseball game! It was so hot and humid but the crowd was really into the game and the atmosphere was electric. If you are a baseball fan you definitely need to take in a game while you are in town.",

          "For baseball aficionados this AAA club is about as close to major league quality as it gets. Believe it or not we go for the food. Great selection from burritos to pizza - funnel cakes and oh yes, hot dogs and peanuts. Great fun atmosphere for entire family with the varied",

          "OK, if you like perfection in athletics, you'll probably prefer MLB. But I go to watch the future of baseball, for fun, and for value. You get all three at DBAP. And to boot, tickets are available, the seats are good, and you don't have to battle huge crowds to park and to",

          "I took my 2 children, ages 4 and 7, here on Sunday to have some playtime and they had a blast. The place is not very big and can get crowded on Sundays since it is free but it will keep your kids busy for an hour or two. This is really good if your kids are bored from walking",
          "We visited this museum on a Sunday because it is free on Sundays. I'm sure the free entrance is why the museum was so overcrowded. The exhibits and play areas were clean, colorful, and engaging for our 18 month old. The staff were friendly and informative about crafts being",

It\u2019s not too crowded or large so you don\u2019t need to worry about losing a kid! \n\nPerfect for the traveling family or a rainy day activity. $8.50 per person, $145 for an annual membership.",
          "Its located inside the mall, just so you don't get lost! My 5 and 1 1/2 yr old had a blast for hours. Lots of fun interactive play stations, things to climb and hide in and just use your imagination with! I was very happy with out visit, and if we are ever in NC again we'll be sure to visit again!",

          "Really small place for the price but it's nice. Honestly I would rather go to Marbles.  My 8 year old didnt see a lot of activities she enjoyed but my 5 year old had a ball. I would say this musuem is better for kids 6 and younger.",

          "Well set up, lots of activities for different age groups and reasonable yearly Membership fees.",
          "Super cute little museum. Thought it was a little pricey for the size, if you take advantage of the activities they offer it offsets the price a bit. I would go back but not frequent often. I didn't however look into memberships that they offer which may be a better deal.",

          "Small-ish but I actually think that's a good thing when running after a toddler. :)  Great place, nice staff, good location.  IMO best to go right at 10a or after 230p when it's not as crowded.",
          "Kidzu is sadly old and tired.  We hadn't taken our kids in about a year and were reminded why -- it is a small space and can become uncomfortably crowded and loud.  The lighting needs a boost.  The activity centers are just lacking.  Its \u2026",

          "They let kids play free for last 30 minutes they are open so you can get a taste of what they offer. If I lived in they area I would buy a membership for my children. Kids have a lot they can experiment with, play with, and build and learn with.",

        "wiki": "Horton Grove was an area of houses for enslaved African-Americans at the 30,000-acre (120 km2) Bennehan-Cameron plantation complex, which included Stagville Plantation in the northeastern part of Durham County, North Carolina.  The slaves who lived at Horton Grove were held by the influential Bennehan and Cameron families.  In 1860, 900 total slaves were held on the complex. The several structures still standing at Horton Grove are the only two-story slave residences remaining in North Carolina.The quarters at Horton Grove, which were constructed by slave craftsmen in the early 1850s, were the culmination of decades of gradual improvements at the plantation complex.  The dwellings at Horton Grove represented the pinnacle of slave house development and include shuttered windows, multiple stories, brick chimneys, and raised stone foundations.These structures were occupied continuously until as late as the 1970s.  After the American Civil War, many of the former slaves stayed on the property as sharecroppers and continued to live in these dwellings. Because of its historic and architectural significance, Horton Grove was listed in 1978 on the National Register of Historic Places.  Archaeological finds on the site have provided insight into continuing practices of African heritage at Stagville, including the presence of divining rods and communal cooking practices.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistoric Stagville Foundation - official site\nHistoric Stagville Foundation - Photos\nPhotos of Horton Grove",

It forms part of the South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, along with the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton. It caters for most specialties.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe hospital was built on the parkland of the former St Luke's Hospital, Middlesbrough. Opened in 1980 as a tertiary care centre called South Cleveland Hospital, it later became an extensive hospital with A&E. The hospital changed its name to the James Cook University Hospital in 2001.New facilities were procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract to replace Middlesbrough General Hospital, North Riding Infirmary and the neuro-rehabilitation unit at West Lane Hospital in 1999. These new facilities were designed by HLM Architects, built on the site by Mowlem at a cost of \u00a396 million and opened in August 2003.In May 2012, a \u00a335 million radiotherapy centre opened at the hospital, unveiled by Princess Alexandra.In November 2012, a new 3T MRI scanner was opened, in the Neurosciences department. This is a partnership between the hospital and Durham University and in addition to clinical work will undertake research into various aspects of cognition.In May 2013, the hospital became a major trauma centre for Teesside, County Durham, North Yorkshire and surrounding areas, participating in the wider Northern trauma Network.In March 2015, a new purpose-built IVF unit was opened (complete with its own theatre), it now brings all the reproductive medicine services together in one place.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nJames Cook University Hospital specialises in the treatment of cancer, heart conditions and neurosurgery as well as housing the regional neonatal intensive care and spinal injury units. More recent developments include the introduction of advanced cardiac mapping technologies for complex radio frequency ablation, and the development of a highly successful Transcatheter Aortic Valve Intervention programme for patients deemed unfit for conventional cardiac surgery.The hospital is used to teach clinical medical students from Newcastle University Medical School as well as pre-clinical students based at Durham University's Queen's Campus Stockton enrolled on collaborative course between Newcastle University Medical School and Durham University. The hospital also has strong teaching and research links with the School of Health at Teesside University.The hospital has a daylight hours landing pad for use by the Great North and Yorkshire air ambulances.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of hospitals in England\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSouth Tees Hospitals NHS Trust",

        "wiki": "Durham (/\u02c8d\u028cr\u0259m/) is a city in and the county seat of Durham County in the U.S. state of North Carolina. Small portions of the city limits extend into Orange County and Wake County.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population to be 278,993 as of July 1, 2019, making it the 4th-most populous city in North Carolina, and the 79th-most populous city in the United States. The city is located in the east-central part of the Piedmont region along the Eno River. Durham is the core of the four-county Durham-Chapel Hill Metropolitan Area, which has a population of 542,710 as of U.S. Census 2014 Population Estimates. The Office of Management and Budget also includes Durham as a part of the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area, commonly known as the Research Triangle, which has a population of 2,037,430 as of U.S. Census 2014 Population Estimates.A railway depot was established on land donated by Bartlett S. Durham in 1849, the namesake of the city. Following the American Civil War, the community of Durham Station expanded rapidly, in part due to the tobacco industry. The town was incorporated by act of the North Carolina General Assembly, in April 1869. The establishment of Durham County was ratified by the General Assembly 12 years later, in 1881. It became known as the founding place and headquarters of the American Tobacco Company. Textile and electric power industries also played an important role. While these industries have declined, Durham underwent revitalization and population growth to become an educational, medical, and research centre.Durham is home to several recognized institutions of higher education, most notably Duke University and North Carolina Central University. Durham is also a national leader in health-related activities, which are focused on the Duke University Hospital and many private companies. Duke and its Duke University Health System, in fact, are the largest employers in the city. North Carolina Central University is a historically black university that is part of the University of North Carolina system. Together, the two universities make Durham one of the vertices of the Research Triangle area; central to this is the Research Triangle Park south of Durham, which encompasses an area of 11 square miles and is devoted to research facilities.\nOn the Duke University campus are the neo-Gothic Duke Chapel and the Nasher Museum of Art. Other notable sites in the city include the Museum of Life and Science, Durham Performing Arts Center, Carolina Theatre, and Duke Homestead and Tobacco Factory. Bennett Place commemorates the location where Joseph E. Johnston surrendered to William T. Sherman in the American Civil War. The city is served, along with Raleigh, by Raleigh\u2013Durham International Airport.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-establishment ===\nThe Eno and the Occoneechi, related to the Sioux and the Shakori, lived and farmed in the area which became Durham. They may have established a village named Adshusheer on the site. The Great Indian Trading Path has been traced through Durham, and Native Americans helped to mold the area by establishing settlements and commercial transportation routes.\nIn 1701, Durham's beauty was chronicled by the English explorer John Lawson, who called the area \"the flower of the Carolinas.\" During the mid-1700s, Scots, Irish, and English colonists settled on land granted to George Carteret by King Charles I (for whom the Carolinas are named). Early settlers built gristmills, such as West Point, and worked the land.\nPrior to the American Revolution, frontiersmen in what is now Durham were involved in the Regulator movement. According to legend, Loyalist militia cut Cornwallis Road through this area in 1771 to quell the rebellion. Later, William Johnston, a local shopkeeper and farmer, made Revolutionaries' munitions, served in the Provincial Capital Congress in 1775, and helped underwrite Daniel Boone's westward explorations.\nLarge plantations, Hardscrabble, Cameron, Lipscomb, and Leigh among them, were established in the antebellum period. By 1860, Stagville Plantation lay at the center of one of the largest plantation holdings in the South. African slaves were brought to labor on these farms and plantations, and slave quarters became the hearth of distinctively Southern cultural traditions involving crafts, social relations, life rituals, music, and dance. There were free African-Americans in the area as well, including several who fought in the Revolutionary War.\n\n\n=== Antebellum and Civil War ===\nPrior to the arrival of the railroad, the area now known as Durham was the eastern part of present-day Orange County and was almost entirely agricultural, with a few businesses catering to travelers (particularly livestock drivers) along the Hillsborough Road. This road, eventually followed by US Route 70, was the major east\u2013west route in North Carolina from colonial times until the construction of interstate highways. Steady population growth and an intersection with the road connecting Roxboro and Fayetteville made the area near this site suitable for a US Post Office. Roxboro, Fayetteville and Hillsborough Roads remain major thoroughfares in Durham, although they no longer exactly follow their early 19th century rights-of-way.Durham's location is a result of the needs of the 19th century railroad industry. The wood-burning steam locomotives of the time had to stop frequently for wood and water and the new North Carolina Railroad needed a depot between the settled towns of Raleigh and Hillsborough. The residents of what is now downtown Durham thought their businesses catering to livestock drivers had a better future than a new-fangled nonsense like a railroad and refused to sell or lease land for a depot. In 1849, a North Carolina Railroad depot was established on a four-acre tract of land donated by Dr. Bartlett S. Durham; the station was named after him in recognition of his gift. A U.S. post office was established there on April 26, 1853, now recognized as the city's official birthday.Durham Station, as it was known for its first 20 years, was a depot for the occasional passenger or express package until early April 1865, when the Federal Army commanded by Major General William T. Sherman occupied the nearby state capital of Raleigh during the American Civil War. The last formidable Confederate Army in the South, commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, was headquartered in Greensboro 50 miles (80 km) to the west. After the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee at Appomattox, Virginia on April 9, 1865, Gen. Johnston sought surrender terms, which were negotiated on April 17, 18 and 26 at Bennett Place, the small farm of James and Nancy Bennett, located halfway between the army's lines about 3 miles (4.8 km) west of Durham Station.\nAs both armies passed through Durham, Hillsborough, and surrounding Piedmont communities, they enjoyed the mild flavor of the area's Brightleaf Tobacco, which was considered more pleasant to smoke or chew than was available back home after the war. Some began sending letters to Durham to get more.\n\n\n=== Reconstruction and the rise of Durham tobacco ===\n\nThe community of Durham Station grew slowly before the Civil War, but expanded rapidly following the war. Much of this growth attributed to the establishment of a thriving tobacco industry. Veterans returned home after the war with an interest in acquiring more of the tobacco they had sampled in North Carolina. Numerous orders were mailed to John Ruffin Green's tobacco company requesting more of the Durham tobacco. W.T. Blackwell partnered with Green and renamed the company as the \"Bull Durham Tobacco Factory\". The name \"Bull Durham\" is said to have been taken from the bull on the British Colman's Mustard, which Mr. Blackwell mistakenly believed was manufactured in Durham, England. Mustard known as Durham Mustard was originally produced in Durham, England, by Mrs Clements and later by Ainsley during the eighteenth century. However, production of the original Durham Mustard has now been passed into the hands of Colman's of Norwich, England.\n\n\n=== Incorporation ===\nAs Durham Station's population rapidly increased, the station became a town and was incorporated by act of the North Carolina General Assembly, on April 10, 1869. It was named for the man who provided the land on which the station was built, Dr. Bartlett Durham. At the time of its incorporation by the General Assembly, Durham was located in Orange County. The increase in business activity, land transfers etc., made the day long trip back and forth to the county seat in Hillsborough untenable, so twelve years later, on April 17, 1881, a bill for the establishment of Durham County was ratified by the General Assembly, having been introduced by Caleb B.Green, creating Durham County from the eastern portion of Orange County and the western portion of Wake County. In 1911, parts of Cedar Fork Township of Wake County was transferred to Durham County and became Carr Township.\n\n\n=== Early growth (1900\u20131970) ===\n\nThe rapid growth and prosperity of the Bull Durham Tobacco Company, and Washington Duke's W. Duke & Sons Tobacco Company, resulted in the rapid growth of the city of Durham. Washington Duke was a good businessman, but his sons were brilliant and established what amounted to a monopoly of the smoking and chewing tobacco business in the United States by 1900. In the early 1910s, the Federal Government forced a breakup of the Duke's business under the antitrust laws. The Dukes retained what became known as American Tobacco, a major corporation in its own right, with manufacturing based in Durham. American Tobacco's ubiquitous advertisements on radio shows beginning in the 1930s and television shows up to 1970 was the nation's image of Durham until Duke University supplanted it in the late 20th century.\nPrevented from further investment in the tobacco industry, the Dukes turned to the then new industry of electric power generation, which they had been investing in since the early 1890s. Duke Power (now Duke Energy) brought in electricity from hydroelectric dams in the western mountains of North Carolina through the newly invented technology of high voltage power lines. At this time (1910\u20131920), the few towns and cities in North Carolina that had electricity depended on local \"powerhouses\". These were large, noisy, and smoky coal-fired plants located next to the railroad tracks. Duke Power quickly took over the electricity franchises in these towns and then electrified all the other towns of central and western North Carolina, making even more money than they ever made from tobacco. Duke Power also had a significant business in local franchises for public transit (buses and trolleys) before local government took over this responsibility in the mid- to late 20th century. Duke Power ran Durham's public bus system (now the Durham Area Transit Authority) until 1991.\nThe success of the tobacco industry in the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged the then-growing textile industry to locate just outside Durham. The early electrification of Durham was also a large incentive. Drawing a labor force from the economic demise of single family farms in the region at the time, these textile mills doubled the population of Durham. These areas were known as East Durham and West Durham until they were eventually annexed by the City of Durham.\n\nMuch of the early city architecture, both commercial and residential, dates from the period of 1890\u20131930. Durham recorded its worst fire in history on March 23, 1914. The multimillion-dollar blaze destroyed a large portion of the downtown business district. The fire department's water source failed during the blaze, prompting voters to establish a city-owned water system in place of the private systems that had served the city since 1887.Durham quickly developed a vibrant Black community, the center of which was an area known as Hayti, (pronounced HAY-tie), just south of the center of town, where some of the most prominent and successful black-owned businesses in the country during the early 20th century were established. These businesses \u2014 the best known of which are North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and Mechanics & Farmers Bank \u2014 were centered on Parrish St., which would come to be known as \"Black Wall Street.\" In 1910, Dr. James E. Shepard founded North Carolina Central University, the nation's first publicly supported liberal arts college for African-Americans.\nIn 1924, James Buchanan Duke established a philanthropic foundation in honor of his father Washington Duke to support Trinity College in Durham. The college changed its name to Duke University and built a large campus and hospital a mile west of Trinity College (the original site of Trinity College is now known as the Duke East Campus).Durham's manufacturing fortunes declined during the mid-20th century. Textile mills began to close during the 1930s. Competition from other tobacco companies (as well as a decrease in smoking after the 1960s) reduced revenues from Durham's tobacco industry.\nIn a far-sighted move in the late 1950s, Duke University, along with the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in Raleigh, persuaded the North Carolina Legislature to purchase a large tract of sparsely settled land in southern Durham County and create the nation's first \"science park\" for industry. Cheap land and a steady supply of trained workers from the local universities made the Research Triangle Park an enormous success which, along with the expansion resulting from the clinical and scientific advances of Duke Medical Center and Duke University, more than made up for the decline of Durham's tobacco and textile industries.\n\n\n=== Civil Rights Movement ===\n\nAs a result of its substantial African-American community, including many courageous activists, a prominent civil rights movement developed in Durham. Multiple sit-ins were held, and Martin Luther King, Jr., visited the city during the struggle for equal rights. The Durham Committee on Negro Affairs, organized in 1935 by C.C. Spaulding, Louis Austin, Conrad Pearson, and James E. Shepard, has been cited nationally for its role in fighting for Black voting rights. The committee also has used its voting strength to pursue social and economic rights for African-Americans and other ethnic groups. In 1957, Douglas E. Moore, minister of Durham's Asbury Temple Methodist Church, along with other religious and community leaders, pioneered sit-ins throughout North Carolina to protest discrimination at lunch counters that served only whites.\n\nWidely credited as the first sit-in of the Civil Rights Movement in North Carolina, on June 23, 1957, Moore and six others assembled at the church to plan the protest. The young African Americans moved over to the segregated Royal Ice Cream Parlor and took up whites-only booths. When they refused to budge, the manager called the police who charged them with trespassing. Unlike the Greensboro Four, three years later, the Royal Seven were arrested and ultimately found guilty of trespassing.\n\nThe six-month-long sit-in at a Woolworth's counter in Greensboro, NC, captured the nation's attention. Within a week, students from North Carolina College at Durham and Duke University staged a sit-in in Durham. About a week later, Martin Luther King Jr. met Moore in Durham, where King coined his famous rallying cry \"Fill up the jails,\" during a speech at White Rock Baptist Church. Advocating non-violent confrontation with segregation laws for the first time, King said, \"Let us not fear going to jail. If the officials threaten to arrest us for standing up for our rights, we must answer by saying that we are willing and prepared to fill up the jails of the South.\"\nThis community was not enough to prevent the demolition of portions of the Hayti district for the construction of the Durham Freeway during the late 1960s. The freeway construction resulted in losses to other historic neighborhoods, including Morehead Hills, West End, and West Durham. Combined with large-scale demolition using Urban Renewal funds, Durham suffered significant losses to its historic architectural base.\n\n\n=== 1970s \u2013 present ===\n\nIn 1970, the Census Bureau reported city's population as 38.8% black and 60.8% white. Durham's growth began to rekindle during the 1970s and 1980s, with the construction of multiple housing developments in the southern part of the city, nearest Research Triangle Park, and the beginnings of downtown revitalization. In 1975, the St. Joseph's Historical Foundation at the Hayti Heritage Center was incorporated to \"preserve the heritage of the old Hayti community, and to promote the understanding of and appreciation for the African American experience and African Americans' contributions to world culture.\" A new downtown baseball stadium was constructed for the Durham Bulls in 1994. The Durham Performing Arts Center now ranks in the top ten in theater ticket sales in the US according to Pollstar magazine. Many famous people have performed there including B.B. King and Willie Nelson. After the departure of the tobacco industry, large-scale renovations of the historic factories into offices, condominiums, and restaurants began to reshape downtown. While these efforts continue, the large majority of Durham's residential and retail growth since 1990 has been along the I-40 corridor in southern Durham County.Major employers in Durham are Duke University and Duke Medical Center (39,000 employees, 14,000 students), about 2 miles (3.2 km) west of the original downtown area, and companies in the Research Triangle Park (49,000 employees), about 10 miles (16 km) southeast. These centers are connected by the Durham Freeway (NC 147).\n\n\n=== Downtown revitalization ===\n\nIn recent years the city of Durham has stepped up revitalization of its downtown and undergone an economic and cultural renaissance of sorts. Partnering with developers from around the world, the city continues to promote the redevelopment of many of its former tobacco districts, projects supplemented by the earlier construction of the Durham Performing Arts Center and new Durham Bulls Athletic Park. The American Tobacco Historic District, adjacent to both the athletic park and performing arts center, is one such project, having successfully lured a number of restaurants, entertainment venues, and office space geared toward hi-tech entrepreneurs, investors, and startups. Many other companies have purchased and renovated historic buildings, such as Measurement Incorporated and Capitol Broadcasting Company.\nThe American Underground section of the American Tobacco Campus, home to successful small software firms including Red Hat, was selected by Google to host its launch of the Google Glass Road show in October 2013. The district is also slated for expansion featuring 158,000 square feet of offices, retail, residential or hotel space The Durham County Justice Center, a major addition to downtown Durham, was completed in early 2013.\nMany of the historic tobacco buildings elsewhere in the city have been converted into loft-style apartment complexes. The downtown corridor along West Main St. has seen significant redevelopment including bars, entertainment venues, art studios, and co-working spaces, in addition to shopping and dining in nearby Brightleaf Square, another former tobacco warehouse in the Bright Leaf Historic District. Other current and future projects include expansion of the open-space surrounding the American Tobacco Trail, new hotels and apartment complexes, a $6.35-million facelift of Durham City Hall, and ongoing redevelopment of the Duke University Central Campus.\nIn 2013, 21c Museum Hotels announced plans to fully renovate the Hill Building. The renovations added a contemporary art museum and upscale restaurant to the historic building. Additionally, a boutique hotel was built in this major renovation effort in downtown Durham. Skanska Construction is responsible for managing this project.In 2014, it was announced that downtown Durham would be the site of a brand new 27 story high building, tentatively named \"City Center Tower\", titled \"One City Center\" as of 2018. Along with other new buildings in downtown Durham, it was under construction in 2018. Construction has already started, and the building will be at the corner of Main St. and Corcoran St. It will be directly across from Durham's current tallest building, but once completed, will be the new tallest building in downtown Durham and the 4th largest building in the Triangle. Originally scheduled for a 2016 opening, the building was then expected to open in May 2018. This is an ambitious, $80 million project.In October 2014, a major new development, the Durham Innovation District, was announced. The development will span 15 acres and comprise over 1.7 million square feet of office, residential, and retail space.On April 10, 2019, a gas explosion rocked Kaffeinate, a coffee shop in Bright Leaf Historic District. The blast destroyed a city block and killed Kong Lee, the owner, as well as injuring 25 others.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nDurham is located in the east-central part of the Piedmont region at 35\u00b059\u203219\u2033N 78\u00b054\u203226\u2033W (35.988644, \u221278.907167).

Other events include jazz festivals, plays, symphony concerts, art exhibitions, and a multitude of cultural expositions, including the American Dance Festival, Tobacco Road Dance, and the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival. A center of Durham's culture is its Carolina Theatre, which presents concerts, comedy and arts in historic Fletcher Hall and Independent and repertory film in its cinemas. Notable dining establishments are primarily concentrated in the Ninth Street, Brightleaf, and University Drive areas. There is a resurgence of restaurants in and around the downtown area, including several new restaurants in the American Tobacco District. The Nasher Museum of Art opened in October 2005 and has produced nationally recognized traveling exhibitions of global, contemporary art.\nDurham also boasts an outstanding history museum, the Museum of Durham History. In 2019, the museum hosted several exhibits, including one on journalist and civil rights activist Louis Austin, and in conjunction with the 150th anniversary of the city of Durham, an exhibit titled, \"150 Faces of Durham,\" which highlighted many of the women and men who influenced the history of Durham.\nThe Durham Association for Downtown Arts (DADA) is a non-profit arts organization located in the downtown area.

Durham was also home to ten recording labels that released soul music, though most of them only released one or two records apiece. A few successful local soul groups from Durham also recorded on national labels like United Artists or on regional labels in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nDurham is home to the nationally known Scrap Exchange, the largest nonprofit creative reuse arts center in the country, and the Nasher Museum of Art as well as a plethora of smaller visual arts galleries and studios. As a testament to the arts, downtown Durham sponsors an organically grown celebration of culture and arts on display every third Friday of the month, year round. The event has come to be known as 3rd Friday.\nA selection of locally renowned galleries remain in business throughout the city. Galleries include but are not limited to local spots such as the Pleiades Gallery, the Carrack Modern Art, and Golden Belt Studios. Supporting a variety of local, nationwide, and worldwide talent, these galleries often host weekly events and art shows. The Durham Art Walk is another annual arts festival hosted in May each year in downtown Durham. The Durham Art Walk features a variety of artists that come together each year for a large showcase of work in the streets of Durham. A secondary magnet school, Durham School of the Arts, is also located in downtown Durham. It focuses on providing education in various forms of art ranging from visual to the performing arts.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nCollegiate athletics are a primary focus in Durham. Duke University's men's basketball team draws a large following, selling out every home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium in 2009. The fans are known as the Cameron Crazies and are known nationwide for their chants and rowdiness. The team has won the NCAA Division I championship three times since 2001 and five times overall. Duke competes in a total of 26 sports in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nDurham's professional sports team is the Durham Bulls International League baseball team. A movie involving an earlier Carolina League team of that name, Bull Durham, was produced in 1988. Today's Bulls play in the Durham Bulls Athletic Park, on the southern end of downtown, constructed in 1994. One of the more successful teams in the minor leagues, the Bulls usually generate an annual attendance of around 500,000. Previously the Durham Athletic Park, located on the northern end of downtown, had served as the Bull's homebase. Historically, many players for the current and former Durham Bulls teams have transferred to the big leagues after several years in the minor leagues. The DAP has been preserved for the use of other teams as well as for concerts sponsored by the City of Durham and other events. The Durham Dragons, a women's fast pitch softball team, played in the Durham Athletic Park from 1998\u20132000. The DAP recently went through a $5 million renovation.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe area is predominantly Democratic, and has voted for the Democratic Party's presidential candidate in every election since the city's founding in 1869. Durham County is the most liberal county in North Carolina, measured by the percentage of voters aligning with the Democratic party in the last several presidential elections 2008 United States presidential election in North Carolina#By county. The shifting alliances of the area's political action committees since the 1980s has led to a very active local political scene. Notable groups include the Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People, the Durham People's Alliance, and the Friends of Durham. The first two groups tend to be affiliated with Democratic party progressive activists, while the third group tends to attract Republican activists. Compared to other similarly sized Southern cities, Durham has a larger than average population of middle class African-Americans and white liberals. Working together in coalition, these two groups have dominated city and county politics since the early 1980s.\nDurham operates under a council-manager government. The mayor, since 2017, is Steve Schewel, who was elected with 59.45% of the vote. The seven-member City Council is the primary budgetary and lawmaking authority.\n\nKey political issues have been the redevelopment of Downtown Durham and revival of other historic neighborhoods and commercial districts, ending cash bail, ending mandatory sentencing minimums, decriminalization of marijuana, raising minimum wage for city employees to $15, the fluoridation of public drinking water, a 45% reduction of crime, a 10-year plan to end homelessness, initiatives to reduce truancy, issues related to growth and development. Naturally, a merger of Durham City Schools (several inner city neighborhoods) and Durham County Schools in the early 1990s has not been without controversy. More recently, the Durham City Council's 2018 statement opposing militarized policing that mentioned Israel has drawn its third lawsuit [4]. In 2018, Durham appointed its first Latinx council member Javiera Caballero. Durham has had majority female county boards since the 1980s, and in 2020, Durham elected, for the first time, an all female Durham County Board of Commissioners and the first Muslim-American woman to win elected office in the history of North Carolina [5].\nFederally, Durham is split between North Carolina's 1st congressional district and North Carolina's 4th congressional district. The 1st district is represented by Democrat G.K. Butterfield, elected in 2004. The 4th district is represented by Democrat David Price, elected in 1996.\n\nSince 2003 the city has had a policy to prohibit police from inquiring into the citizenship status of persons unless they have otherwise been arrested or charged with a crime. A city council resolution mandates that police officers \"...may not request specific documents for the sole purpose of determining a person's civil immigration status, and may not initiate police action based solely on a person's civil immigration status ...\" Since 2010, the Durham police have accepted the Mexican Consular Identification Card as a valid form of identification.In 2006, racial and community tensions stirred following allegations of a sexual assault by three white members of the Duke University lacrosse team in what is now known as the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case. The allegations were made by Crystal Gail Mangum a young, female African-American student and mother of two young children. She and another young woman had been hired to dance at a party that the team held in an off-campus house. In 2007, all charges in the case were dropped and the players were declared innocent. Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong was dismissed from his job and disbarred from legal practice for his criminal misconduct handling of the case including withholding of exculpatory evidence. There have been several other results from the case, including lawsuits against both city and Duke University officials.\nThe new Durham County Justice Center was completed in early 2013.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nPublic schools in Durham are run by Durham Public Schools, the eighth largest school district in North Carolina. The district runs 46 public schools, consisting of 30 elementary, 10 middle, 2 secondary, and 12 high schools. Several magnet high schools focus on distinct subject areas, such as the Durham School of the Arts and the City of Medicine Academy. Public schools in Durham were partially segregated until 1970.\nThe North Carolina School for Science and Mathematics is a high school operated by the University of North Carolina in central Durham. The residential school accepts rising juniors living in North Carolina with a focus on science, mathematics, and technology.\nThere are several charter school options as well, including Research Triangle High School (a STEM school in Research Triangle Park), Voyager Academy (K-12), Kestrel Heights School (K-12), Maureen Joy Charter School (K-8), and most recently Excelsior Classical Academy (K-8).\nSeveral private schools operate in Durham, such as Durham Academy, Carolina Friends School, and Duke School. There are also religious schools, including Trinity School of Durham and Chapel Hill.In December 2007, Forbes.com ranked Durham as one of the \"Top 20 Places to Educate Your Child;\" Durham was the only MSA from North Carolina to make the list.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nDuke University has approximately 14,000 students, split evenly between graduates and undergraduates. Duke's 8600 acre campus and Medical Center are located in western Durham, about 2 miles (3.2 km) from downtown. Duke forms one of the three vertices of the Research Triangle along with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. The university's research, medical, and teaching efforts are all among the highest-ranked in both the United States and the world.North Carolina Central University is a public, historically black university located in southeastern Durham. It was ranked the number 1 Public HBCU in the nation by U.S. News & World Report in 2010 and 2011. It was ranked the 10th best HBCU overall. The university was founded by James E. Shepard in 1910 as the National Religious Training School and Chautauqua to address the needs of the region's black population, and now grants baccalaureate, master's, professional and doctoral degrees. NCCU became a university in 1969 and joined the University of North Carolina system in 1972.\nDurham Technical Community College is a two-year public institution that grants associate degrees.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe major daily newspaper in Durham is The Herald-Sun, which began publication in 1893. The Durham-based Independent Weekly, noted for its progressive/liberal perspective, provides political and entertainment news for the greater Research Triangle; it began publication in 1983. Duke's independent student newspaper, The Chronicle (Duke University), also provides local coverage.\nDurham is part of the Raleigh-Durham-Fayetteville designated market area, the 24th largest broadcast television market in the United States. ABC owned and operated WTVD is licensed to and based in Durham, while the studios for statewide public television service UNC-TV are based in Research Triangle Park. All major U.S. television networks have affiliates serving the region.\nThe city is part of the Raleigh-Durham Arbitron radio market, ranked #43 nationally. National Public Radio affiliate WUNC, based in Chapel Hill, has significant operations in Durham.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nMost travel in Durham is by private motor vehicle on its network of public streets and highways. Important arteries for traffic include NC 147, which connects Duke University, downtown, and Research Triangle Park, U.S. 15-501 between Durham and Chapel Hill, I-85, connecting Durham to Virginia and western North Carolina cities, and I-40 running across southern Durham County between the Research Triangle Park and Chapel Hill. The I-40 corridor has been the main site of commercial and residential development in Durham since its opening in the early 1990s. Over 95% of commuters use a car to get to work, with 14% of those people in carpools.Durham maintains an extensive network of bicycle routes and trails and has been recognized with a Bicycle Friendly Community Award. The American Tobacco Trail begins in downtown and continues south through Research Triangle Park and ends in Wake County. The city is also considering furthering the progress on the Triangle Greenway System.\nAir travel is serviced by Raleigh-Durham International Airport, 12 miles southeast of Durham, which enplanes about 4.5 million passengers per year. Frequent service (five flights a day or more) is available to Philadelphia, Atlanta, New York LaGuardia, New York Kennedy, Newark, Washington Reagan, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare, Dallas, Houston, Miami, and Charlotte. Non-stop daily service is provided to approximately 30 destinations in the United States and daily international service is also available to London Heathrow, Toronto-Pearson and Paris Charles de Gaulle.\nAmtrak operates a daily train between Charlotte and New York City (the Carolinian) which stops in downtown Durham. The State of North Carolina, in cooperation with Amtrak, operates three additional daily trains between Raleigh and Charlotte which also stop in Durham. A new Amtrak station was built in 2011 in a former tobacco warehouse. Some of the downtown streets cross the tracks at grade level, while other intersections have grade separation. One downtown railroad underpass has attracted national media coverage, because it provides only 11 feet-8 inches of clearance, and has damaged the roofs of many trucks. As of October 26, 2019, the underpass was closed down to both automotive and train traffic in preparation for raising it to 12 feet and 4 inches, so as to provide clearance underneath to reduce large vehicle damage.National bus service is provided by Greyhound and Megabus at the Durham Transit Station in downtown Durham, which opened in 2009. GoDurham provides municipal bus service.\n\nGoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Research Triangle Park and several of the region's larger suburban communities. GoTriangle also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nFrom 1995, the cornerstone of GoTriangle's long-term plan was a 28-mile (45 km) rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles (11 km) to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program. Government agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.The region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Duke University also maintains its own transit system, Duke Transit operates more than 30 buses with routes throughout the campus and health system. Duke campus buses and vans have alternate schedules or do not operate during breaks and holidays.\nIn an effort to create safer roadways for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians, drivers can enroll in Durham's Pace Car Program and agree to drive the speed limit, stop at all stop signs, stop at all red lights, and stop to let pedestrians cross the street.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Born in Durham ===\n\nErnie Barnes, artist/painter\nKara Medoff Barnett, theatre producer, arts director\nBetty Davis, funk and soul singer\nBen Brantley, The New York Times theater critic\nMic'hael Brooks, NFL player\nKelly Bruno, world-record holding amputee runner and athlete; contestant on reality TV show Survivor: Nicaragua\nShirley Caesar, pastor and gospel recording artist\nRoger Lee Craig, Major League Baseball pitcher and manager\nJames Buchanan Duke, industrialist, founder of The Duke Endowment and Duke University\nThe Duffer Brothers, creators of the Netflix series Stranger Things\nRick Ferrell, Major League Baseball catcher; member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame\nJohn Wesley Fletcher, pastor\nTate Fogleman, NASCAR driver\nPenny Fuller, award-winning actress in numerous Broadway, film, and television productions\nDavid Garrard, NFL (2002\u20132013) quarterback\nDavid Gergen, advisor to presidents Ford, Reagan, and Clinton\nJohn H.

          "To visit this famous place at its best, it takes a ticket to see a men's basketball game, which is virtually impossible to get. That said, it is worth the price of admission to see for yourself what all of the hoopla is about.",

          "If you are a college basketball fun you must come here because this is surely one of the Mecca's of college sports. Built in the early 1900's and it has changed very little. Holds about 10,000 with a low roof so the sound is compressed. The duke students are insane. if you",
          "This was on our bucket list, see Duke play a game at Cameron Indoor Stadium. I bought tickets for my son and I last fall as they sell out as soon as tickets are available. We arrived at Cameron 90 minutes before tip off so we could check out the basketball museum. Having been",

          "If you get a chance to see a basketball game here, GO! This is a Bucket List location for any college basketball fan. Staff are friendly, seats are pretty comfortable. The temperature in the concourse area can be very warm during games. Really really loud when the Crazies are",
          "My thirteen year old Duke fanatic and i attended the Duke- Syracuse game ( Feb 2018)- a Christmas gift ! The experience of a game, especially a WIN, at Cameron is incredible. The tour of the stadium along with the Basketball Museum are truly a gift of a lifetime.",
          "Been planning this trip for 6+ months... definite bucket list just to go to Cameron, but to go for the Duke and NC game... well that\u2019s just even better. Decided to Uber there Friday night and get the K\u2019ville tent experience .... took a cooler and enjoyed having a few adult",
          "Watch a game . The atmosphere is sooo exciting.lots of fun . This is a must visit while here at durham",
          "Cameron Indoor Stadium is THE place to watch a basketball game. The Crazies and the band are part of the experience, too. Usually good weather in Durham and many good restaurants.",
          "My wife has been a die hard fan since pre-laettner. And I have been a basketball fan since I was 4. So this was a wonderful trip for both of us! Our breath was taken away the moment we walked through the doors. The history in there is mind-boggling. The atmosphere is electric.",
          "Can't describe the energy, passion and honor that this place embodies. Bigger than words can describe. I am a long time Duke Basketball fan, finally was able to make it to my holy ground. It exceeded all of my dreams and expectations. We are from just outside of New Orleans, so",
          "Fist off it was way smaller than I thought. It was not game day, and we kind of just snuck in and walked on the court and took pictures. Just the sheer history of it is pretty great. If you are at Duke, you should pop in for a visit. Next door is also a great museum.",
          "Wow!!! My wife has been a Duke fan all her life I wanted to surprise her with the number one item on your bucket list. She turns 50 in April so this is the perfect gift for her. We were so excited you finally be able to go to Cameron Indoor Stadium. I personally was not a Duke",

          "We took our 7 year old to a women\u2019s basketball game for his birthday. He and my husband are HUGE Duke fans. Wow- I\u2019m not even a Duke fan and Cameron Indoor is magical. If you are a college basketball fan this is a MUST see!!! I would absolutely LOVE to see a men\u2019s game here-",
          "We have had the same seats at Cameron since the 1981-1982 season. We have seen it all, and it never gets old. Go if you get a chance.",
          "This was our first time to Durham. Made the most of it and Attended a Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s game on back to back nights. We wanted to spend as much time in Cameron as we could. I worried that I build this trip up too much but it did not disappoint. The feeling of being in Cameron",
          "Caught a basketball game here and I did not like several things: the \"oldness\" of the building, the lack of seating capacity, the cramped seating, and the overall heat inside the arena --- BUT... I will say that this is certainly an iconic basketball venue, and it was good to go",
          "O don't see this attraction after my February game. So, here goes my review of one of the iconic basketball stadiums in the USA! Going to watch a Duke basketball game is like going to a huge rock concert so wear your ear plugs and look around at this \"small\" arena! Even the",
          "I'm a huge DUKE fan and came and watched a game. If you like college basketball this place is a must to visit. The atmosphere is totally different than any other. The students and fans makes this place. I will be going back. The Cameron Crazies is something to experience.",
          "First time there, not a bad seat in the building. If you a Duke fan put this on your bucket list. We stayed at JB Dukes hotel, it is right across from the football field and a 10 minute walk to Cameron so no need to worry about parking. Doors open a hour before top off. Cameron",
          "Go Duke, undefeated basketball team at this writing. WooHoo! Cameron has an impressive awards museum to visit, well worth a visit",
          "Taking in the first basketball game of the year. Such a great time experience. One of the top sporting venues of all time. So much better than the usual huge arenas.",
          "Hot. Small. Old. Filled with large egos of privileged youngsters. Don\u2019t bother. Go to the dean dome instead.",
          "If you like sports, especially basketball this is the place to see if you are in the area. Walk the outer corridor and take in all the history. Arena itself is beautiful with wood and brass highlights. Great venue, not great audio though",

          "Once in a lifetime experience. A must for any & all college basketball fans! Not easy getting tickets but glad we did. Absolutely beautiful campus and amazing stadium",
          "A very unique setting to watch a game in, as the smallest stadium for college basketball. Hard not to be totally energized! Buy a ticket at the beginning of the season. expensive tickets but worth going at least once in your life!!",
          "There is nowhere else in the country like Cameron Indoor. If you are a college basketball fan, a basketball fan, or a sports fan in general, you must make a pilgrimage here for a game at some point. It is so much smaller than you would expect from seeing it on TV. It is like a",
          "This was my second visit in 25 years, and this one was even more special. I love that this stadium is so intimate and small. I got chills imagining the greats that played there as I walked on the gym floor. We were there for Duke Basketball Camp, which was amazing!",
          "What a great place to see a basketball game! I started attending games as a student in the early 1980s. It's been a consistently fun arena for Duke students and fans, but not so much for opponents! Renovations over the years have been welcome (like air conditioning), but it's",
          "Always enjoy going here for a basketball game or just to walk around and view the memorabilia. It's loud, it's close quarters, it's hot.. but that is Duke Basketball!",
          "Cameron is a great place to experience ACC Basketball. The Duke fans stay in a frenzy the entire game. Being a small stadium definitely adds to the energy.",
          "All seats with good views of court. The size and crowd intensity makes you feel like you are part of the action. VERY tough to get a ticket.",

          "Tickets to Duke Men's Basketball games are exceptionally hard to come by. For students, there are a number of mechanisms, and if you know a grad student, they can help you out for certain games. For the rest of the world, you're left to scalp tickets in person, online, or buy",
          "Whether you love college basketball or not, you'll enjoy a game at Cameron Indoor. It's a very small arena that the university has chosen to keep that way. Not a bad seat in the house, if you can score a ticket. They are super hard to come by. It's a family friendly venue with",
          "Cameron offers an amazing opportunity to watch amazing college basketball with a small gym feel. There are no bad seats. My son and I sat almost at the top in a corner and had a great view. Even if Duke's not your team, if you love college basketball, this is one place you",
          "Attending a basketball game at Cameron is a sports religious moment. The students are much better than previous years - better synchronized cheers and fewer snarky comments. They are loud as are the loyal Duke fans. It's small and at times hot. Very crowded. Pure basketball",
          "We were lucky enough to watch a BB game here against Clemson. What an experience, electrifying. Great fans, players, and of course the legendary Coach K. I have always admired Duke Basketball but never thought I would have the opportunity to watch them in their own environment.",
          "This is literally smaller than a high school gym and has the coolest feel to it. It is a must for any sports fan. I was lucky enough to go back a few years ago when Duke beat a #1 ranked Syracuse team at the time.",
          "I'm not big into duke athletics but cameron is an experience for any true sports fan! You are right on top of the players! It is the smallest venue I have been in and it's not air conditioned inside the actual arena itself!! It is pure madness! If your a college fan, it is a",
          "This definitely is the smallest place that I have even been that can fit 9,314 people very tightly. Funs are amazing and watching game there is very special.",
          "If you ever get the opportunity to be a part of a Blue Devils home game the feeling is awesome. Not only are you going to see some top class basketball, the show that the fans put on is something to see. Be prepared though, it gets hot and loud but worth every minute of it.",
          "My father wanted a trip to a Duke home game for Christmas so I had a very helpful friend that is a member of the Iron Club and we got tickets behind the scorers table five rows up on center court. Our seats could not have been better. That being said, the ushers, the ticket",
          "One of the great smaller indoor arenas to watch college basketball! Still the intimate and intimidating place I remember from my student days!",
          "Even if you're not a Duke fan this place is a must go for every college basketball fan. The Hall of Fame next-door to Cameron indoor arena is worth the time to browse The space is more like a high school gymnasium rather than a top notch college basketball program the",
          "Been here for graduations and sporting events. Works well for both. Parking at a stadium always requires a bit of walking. Wasn't too bad. Once inside, you're able to enjoy your event regardless of your seating assignment/selection. Great venue.",
          "Unbelievable for someone coming from a college where national level sports is not a consideration. If I was a high school kid on a recruiting visit, I would just ask \"where do I sign?)",
          "As life long DUKE fans, my wife and I have been waiting our whole lives to make a trip here from CT. And I can honestly say it was more than we expected. It feels like a high school game on steroids based on how small it is. We stood in the student's section when the men's team",
          "Well I am a Duke fan and I've been liking them for 10 years. They have great atmosphere because of the Crazies. Even though its small, its still better than Dean Smith Center. Lets Go DUKE",
          "We went for Countdown to Craziness and it was the best! Great everything and awesome environment. Go Duke!",
          "Yes, i'm a Duke fan so I'm biased, but this place is amazing. The students are clear and classy with their chants. If you like college basketball and you can get tickets, you should go there just to have a better idea what it's like to play here.",
          "I have been to Cameron many times, and I've seen Duke play in most of the road venues they frequent. I've seen badly failed attempts to copy the environment down to stealing 100% of the cheers. Nothing beats the real thing. The stadium is designed to be a sports antique like",
          "Cameron is the best place in College Hoops to see a game! It's also a great spot to visit anytime from 8-5 to see the special place that Duke plays, the Championship Banners and the Sports Hall of Fame which includes Duke Basketball! It's about an hour tour reading the history,",
          "We tried to call many places to see if Cameron would be open on football day. No one on the whole University could take the time to do that. So, we went because some of the answers on here said they usually keep the stadium open, well it wasn't open. Bottom line, just take",
          "The energy in Cameron is electrifying. The stadium has never been enlarged so it feels like you are part of the action and there are no bad seats. If you are lucky enough to get tickets to a Blue Devils' game be prepared to scream and sweat for 2 hours straight!",
          "So like any die hard college basketball fan, I may not like Duke but going to Cameron Indoor is certainly on my bucket list. Went there in February to visit my friend who goes there, got in line for grad student tickets to the UVA game and was given a wristband which is",
          "I'm a graduate of nearby Carolina so am not a Duke sports fan, but my husband is and we were able to attend a Duke Women's Basketball game against Carolina at Cameron and both really enjoyed it. It's small an intimate with understandable appeal - definitely try to get in to see",
          "Yeah, it's not what it used to be in the 1980s. But still, the best and most intimate place to watch basketball as God intended it.",
          "This is the best basketball venue in the world. It's hot. It's loud. The seats are small. You do not have to get a second mortgage to buy a ticket, unless you want to see a Carolina (UNC) game. The cheapest way to see a game at Cameron is to wait until the students are on",
          "We were at Duke for an awards ceremony held in Cameron. For my Blue Devil loving child being in Cameron was a dream come true! I was surprised that it was open and we were allowed to just walk around even outside of the ceremony. There's a wonderful Hall of Fame area in the",
          "You can't be at Duke and not go into Cameron Indoor! The stadium is very small compared to most places, but when you step on the court you feel powerful and unstoppable. We have season men's basketball tickets and love going to the games. Any seat in Cameron is valuable so it is",
          "If you are lucky enough to get tickets to see the Blue Devils at home for any game. YOU SHOULD GO!!!!!! But everyone should have the Duke vs Carolina game on their bucket list \ud83c\udfc0\ud83c\udfc0 get there early and stay late. Nothing like it anywhere else in sports.",
          "You won't see too many of this type of stadium around any more so if you can take in a Duke game, and stomach the price of tickets, this is a classic place to watch a basketball game. Small arena. No bad seats, and the choreographed chants and cheers of the students is",
          "Have been a Duke fan for a very long time. Love Coach K. It was a dream come true and a Bucket List thing to visit Cameron. We were able to walk right in and walk around. Make sure and visit the museum up on the top level. So cool.",
          "Tool my son to Duke camp with coach K and was impressed with this gym. Displays a lot of history of their accomplishments. You know you are in the house of greatness.",
          "Had to visit historic Cameron Indoor Stadium. Beside being a Basketball fan a must see when in campus. Also, got to see Coach K. Sweet!!",

          "Able to play on Cameron Indoor was a dream come true. This stadium is the mecca of college basketball. The tradition, banners, and the history makes this a must visit for anyone.",
          "Attended a high school graduation there and this looks like a 50's high school gym that hasn't been kept up. It was hot and really did smell bad. The sight lines were also very bad and the acoustics almost non-existent. Cramped and hard to get in and out of.",
          "My husband wanted to stop here, and Im glad I came along. The Duke atmoshpere is really something special. You can almost feel the roar of the crowd when you walk onto the basketball court. We had a tour guide, very knowledagable. He took our picture on half court. Took us",
          "We had perfect timing during our visit to Cameron...Coach K Academy was in progress so many Duke players were there hanging out and helping at the tournament. We were able to see Coach K and my boys got a picture with Grayson Allen which made the day awesome. The stadium is",

          "It was hard to believe you can walk in and stand center court. This is a legendary arena and can see why the Blue Devils are so dominate at home. Walking buy you would never know this is where they played. The museum adjacent to stadium was great and very informative but when",
          "lovely stadium, my son always wanted to see this. We will return for the Duke basketball games. Durham has grown a lot in the last few years.",
          "My daughter's Graduation was in this stadium. It was very nice, comfortable seats, lots of parking and bathrooms.",
          "Attended the Duke Law School Graduation here Saturday. I agree with previous reviewer that it is an oversize high school gym. Haven't seen wooden slat seats since old Connie Mack Stadium in Philly. That said, I can only imagine the atmosphere here during a basketball game. My",
          "Cameron Indoor Stadium is the Ultimate home court advantage. It literally is an oversized high school gym. The gym is a cozy confine for less than 10,000 people. Which makes the opponent have limited opportunity for fans there. It is hard to rate this arena because the",

          "I've been to Cameron Indoor Stadium for Duke Men's Basketball games and Duke Basketball camp with my kids. The intensity of the game environment with Coach K in the house is work experiencing at least once. The historic significance of the building is evident and there is a",
          "I never understood why people prefer to attend sports games when you can see the game so much better at the comfort of your home. But seeing a game at Cameron changed my mind about this. The energy in the building is fantastic. Great ambiance. The people watching is even more",
          "I was lucky to have had a chance to see the court on our visit to campus this past weekend. I'm a longtime Duke fan so having a peek and be able to set foot on that historic court was a great moment for my wife and I. My parents being alums - this trip was certainly memorable.",
          "Cameron Indoor. How to describe it? Intimate - check. Hot - check. Loud - check, check. Filled with Crazies. Absolutely. One of the most amazing basketball venues in the country. Without a doubt. Hard to get a ticket, even if you are a student. Yep. That's part of the",

          "The most exciting sports venue there is. Period. It never disappoints. The creativity of the cheers is great.",
          "I enjoy going to Cameron for a game. You can see the court from any seat. The atmosphere is electric. I wish the construction was done and I hate they had to add a scanner screening machine",
          "As a Duke alum, I'm biased, but there is no experience like a basketball game at Cameron Indoor. I love Cameron Indoor and would go to a Duke game anytime, in a heartbeat.",
          "We went on a non game day but loved the Duke Basketball hall of Fame and Museum connected to Cameron. What was really awesome is that Duke allows you to enter the basketball court area to see the banners and watch the practice activity. We saw a Lady Blue Devil and her coach",
          "The atmosphere is electric and the basketball game was intense. The crowd is completely focused on the game it was awesome!",
          "Returned for a game and got to relive my student days (though not in the student section). This is, hands down, the best place to see a college basketball game. It is like being in a high school gym!! Every seat is amazing. So much fun, so much energy, amazing basketball, and",
          "As a huge college basketball fan attending a Duke game was an amazing experience. Cameron is to college basketball as Fenway is to baseball. Every seat in this venue is fantastic and the place feels like you're watching a game from a bygone era with bench seating below and",
          "If ever there's a chance to see a men's or women's game in Cameron, do it! We spoke with fans from Utah and from PA who have no kids in college - just lifelong DUKE fans who flew to Durham to experience Cameron, the game, and to see Coach K and his team. Really the best in",
          "This from a game last year. When students are in this 9300 capacity building, and Coach K is there, history is being made. Try to go when students are on campus. Can't believe K has been there since 1980. While being Olympics coach since 2006.",
          "My family and I traveled by car from Texas, to be a part of this unique and great experience. The very best place in the U.S. to watch a college basketball game. High intensity from start to finish, the Cameron Crazies are exactly that, they never sit down or shut up, and the",
          "Big arenas may be the way college sports is headed but Duke has not followed that trend. Nothing compares to the ambience of Cameron. I have traveled to Atlanta, San Antonia, Indy, etc. for games. I will take Cameron any day of the week.",
          "If you're a college basketball fan, then you've heard of the Cameron Indoor Stadium. It's the home of the Duke Blue Devils, a powerhouse in college basketball for many, many, years! It's considered one of the hardest places for the a visiting team to play, just because of the",
          "Finally got here for a basketball game recently, and wasn't disappointed. The crowd is chock full of energy, and the tiny stadium magnifies that energy. Tickets are quite expensive, but the free student lines are really helpful to get students in on a budget. Get ready to learn",
          "I love Cameron Indoor Stadium ! It is currently being renovated, as well as Wallace Wade Stadium. Once completed in 2016, the historical home of Duke Basketball and Football will be ready for the public to review. What has been done to date is impressive, with hopes we can share",
          "Attended game vs. Georgia Southern on 12/15/15. Awesome experience. Would have chosen reserved seating if I had to do it over again. Stood in student section and probably a smidge too old to enjoy that long standing. OVERALL it was a great experience. Hope to go back",
          "The stadium is smaller than I expected - they were doing some renovations when we went there. Cool to be in the stadium with so much basketball history - my son is a big duke basketball fan so he loved it.",

          "A truly amazing place. This stadium has remained essentially the same since it was built. It is small by today's standard, not even air conditioned, locates broadcasters and commentators in the rafters [where some probably belong], and contains the championship banners that",
          "Fantastic venue to see a game. Be prepared to stand and shout. Energy is amazing and experience is breathtaking",

          "It is always fun to attend live sporting events and this was no exception. Parking was \"reasonably\" easy with a $10 charge, a short walk to the stadium and plenty of staff in hand to assist. We had standing only but still had a great view of the game from section 17. Great",
          "I had the opportunity to attend a game and see the new team in action that went on to win the 5th NCAA Championship with Coach K. It is always great to be in the Indoor stadium for basketball especially to watch a men's game.",

          "This was our first trip to Cameron Indoor and it is nothing like you might think. It is a classic, \"old school\" college gym with all the charm that comes with it. It has not been updated (intentionally), so you are close to the action and the atmosphere is great.",
          "My brother and I had the opportunity to visit Cameron Indoor Stadium while touring the Raleigh/Durham area. I had read that you can go into Cameron and was actually surprised that we were able to walk onto the court. There was going to be a volleyball match later that",
          "For college basketball fans, this is the Valhalla or arenas. There is not a more exciting venue for a college basketball game than Cameron Indoor. I had a client visit from Chicago and he specifically requested that we try to visit Cameron. We got lucky yesterday and got in",
          "My wife and I got lucky when we went to the Duke Basketball Hall of Fame. I befriended one of the guys who manned the doors and he gave us a guided tour of the area without anyone else being there. Saw the whole stadium when it is empty and it looked rather small compared to",

          "Brought my kids from Indiana to show them the campus. So much had changed since I was there in the 80s, but Cameron Indoor still is amazing. Like the rest of the campus, construction is going on here too, but we were able to get inside and experience it. Awesome!",
          "Nothing beats Cameron Indoor Stadium for a basketball game. The building is beautiful with brass railings, wood paneling and old-school charm. It's small and intimate, which makes it really unique among sporting venues. The Cameron Crazies add to the ambiance, their clever signs",

          "The mother church of college basketball. The building looks like a Duke classroom building from the outside but inside, sports history comes alive. Even the Coach K youth basketball camps are electric with excitement.",

          "Truly a special place! On this visit there were graduations taking place so we could not go in, but the museum was open and filled with nostalgia. Enjoyed the display from their big victory over Wisconsin this year. Lots of construction going on around campus this summer. I",
          "Becky and I walked over to the arena on our recent visit to Duke University. It was a hot late May afternoon, and when you see the arena from the exterior it looks like another classroom building instead of one of the premier venues in college basketball. The arena is nicer",
          "I know the place has a lot of history, but it was very disappointing to go to a game here for the first time. The seats are awful and hard to get through the rows and it is not at all \"handicap friendly\" (not uncommon for places this old) It is understandable why the students",

          "If you can get a ticket you'll love the energy of all the Duke students and fans - it's amazing, entertaining, fun and refreshing. While it's an older and not very large space, that's not what's important. This is college basketball as it was meant to be!",
          "Tickets to Duke games are passed down from one generation to another. Even non-conference games are sold out. Tickets are expensive now if you can find someone selling one - good luck on that. But it is so much fun to go to one of their games. At least they have air",
          "It is difficult to see a men's basketball game here, but you can see a women's game easily. It is worth it just to take in the atmosphere. This is the way college basketball should be played - in a small, traditional gym on campus!! I hate these schools that play in big",

          "Great seats. Team still developing talent and chemistry. Miami played out of their minds and embarrassed the eventual 2015 NCAA Champs. I'm sure it helped Duke, but it was a painful evening. What else can you say?",
          "I paid a recent visit to Duke for my 40-year reunion. Registration was at the back end of Cameron. The building is not only a shrine to Coach K, it also comtains some great memoriabilia dating all the way back to the nascent stirrings of Duke basketball. Great photos are hung",
          "If you are a basketball fan, there is no better basketball experience than watching the Blue Devils play inside Cameron Indoor Stadium. The small size of the arena almost gives it the intimacy of a high school gym. The students camp out -- sometimes days in advance of a game",
          "A very, very cool place for anyone who appreciates Duke athletics. The basketball memorabilia is incredible, and brings many memories to mind, of conquests and great players. If you are NOT a Duke fan, stay away because this place heralds all things Duke and it does it really,",
          "This was our first trip and it was what we expected. We went in February the weekend ND was in town and the fans were camped out and full of life. The place is truly full of history by just looking around and seeing all the banners, famous pictures of great games and players.",

          "I've been to Cameron for men's and women's basketball games and concerts. It's a small and very intimate arena, and you're remarkably close to the court no matter where you sit. For basketball, the atmosphere is electric, with \"Crazy Towel Guy\" and the justly-famous Cameron",
          "We have always wanted to visit Duke University and see Cameron Indoor Stadium. We walked there from the visitor center and found it open and women's team practicing. Then Pete Merrill showed up and made our day. He is a volunteer guide who lives nearby. He asked where we",
          "There is nothing quite like a mens basketball game at Cameron Indoor Stadium. This is a must see place on any basketball fans bucket list. The Cameron Crazies earned their name. The vibe inside is incredible.",
          "Small venue, close to action, loud and exciting. Would 10/10 visit again. I can't even think of a downside. Fans were passionate, We were seated right at the top and still had great view.",
          "It is a small arena, so there is not a bad seat in the house! It is super fun to walk around before the game and tour the Hall of Fame and see all of the memorabilia. Nothing beats the Cameron Crazies, and when I was there I was lucky enough to see the leftovers from when the",

          "If you are a sports fan, love NCAA basketball, and collegiate spirit, definitely make the trip to attend a men's basketball game in Cameron. It is an electric, exciting, historic, happy atmosphere. Small and intimate for all fans, yet loud and electrifying. Get in early and go",
          "Nothing like going to a Carolina game at the Dean Smith Center then sitting with only 8,500 at Cameron. Fans are louder and so close to action. Make sure you go to the Attached Duke Hall of Fame and spend at least half an hour. Make Sure you walk all the way around the",
          "So great to see this Stadium. So iconic, like something out of Hoosiers. Particularly cool to be there on UNC game day.",

          "Tickets to a Duke basketball game are next to impossible to get during the ACC season, preseason when the students are gone (Christmas Break) you might be able to see a game. Otherwise seeing Cameron when it is empty isn't quite the same unless you are a devoted fan.",
          "Even if you're not a hardcore sports fan, a night at Cameron Indoor is a bucket list experience. How any team can ever beat Duke in this temple to home court advantage is beyond me. You go to most big time sporting events and you're sharing it with 20 or 30 thousand people.",
          "Cameron is usually easily accessible for visitors and has a museum right next door so it is worth a visit if you are in Durham and have time to spare. Unfortunately, Duke is not the most friendly university when it comes to visitor parking so you may have to park far away (look",

          "If you are a Duke fan or even just a college basketball fan, this has to be on your bucket list! I would get there though before coach K retires to make the experience even more memorable. I have been to many sporting events and this atmosphere is second to none. The chants",
          "If you love NCAA D1 basketball played at the highest level in a legendary environment, then Cameron is for you. Tickets are hard to come by but often around the holidays when students are gone, you can score through the ticket office. Good luck and GO DUKE!",
          "IF you can get tickets, do it! Being in this historical building with the amazing Coach K and his team... it is electrifying! The stadium is old, so be prepared for less than perfect treks up to most seats, tight quarters and difficult maneuvers once seated... the lower levels",

          "Every bit as good a bball venue as advertised. Virtually every seat is good and the crazies add volume.",

          "I went to Duke and saw games there in the late 60's when you didn't have to stay in a tent to get a good seat. And we played intramural games, cross court, on Cameron's floor. What is really fun is that the venue, although updated a little about 20 years ago, still feels like",

          "There's nothing like the energy and excitement of attending a Duke men's basketball game at Cameron Indoor. Just watching the Crazies and the band and the grad students all standing throughout the entire contest is sheer fun. But the best thing, of course, is seeing the Blue",

          "We went to see the crazies in action. It was exciting and fun. We will travel every year to go to this event. We are die-hard fans and just to be there, was fantastic. Love it and there is no other place that can compare. One and only !!!!!!",
          "We have been coming to most Duke home games for 25 years. Of all the athletic venues we have visited over the years, none has the excitement and atmosphere of a Duke basketball game at Cameron. Almost every seat has a great view of the court (except a few behind the baskets,",

          "I was a Carolina fan until I met my husband who went to Duke. He gets season tickets and has turned me into a Cameron Crazy. For some reason they don't like to turn on the a/c so it gets very hot during a game. The stadium is small and there are no bad seats. Many people",

          "There is no better place to watch basketball then Cameron. There's a great atmosphere, super sweet service if needed, and easy parking. The tickets are %100 worth the price. Duke is regularly a great team on top of that. I recommend walking around the Duke campus before the",
          "There is no arena better than Cameron Indoor--it is beautifully maintained but they are never tempted to increase its size or destroy its intimacy. You can see the sweat on players' faces and the home Duke crowd put the \"fan\" in fanatic. This is a noisy, partisan arena where",

          "It is filled with excitement, history, passion, and fun. The Crazies are crazy, full of the Duke spirit, and fun to watch. It is small and very loud. Get there early and go to the Hall of Fame museum next door. Then paint some blue and white on your face and enjoy the atmosphere",

      "name": "Cameron Indoor Stadium",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Cameron Indoor Stadium is an indoor arena located on the campus of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. The 9,291-seat facility is the primary indoor athletic venue for the Duke Blue Devils and serves as the home court for Duke men's and women's basketball and women's volleyball. It opened in January 1940 and was known as Duke Indoor Stadium until 1972, when it was named for Eddie Cameron, who served at Duke as men's basketball coach from 1928 to 1942, football coach from 1942 to 1945, and athletic director from 1951 to 1972. The arena is located adjacent to its predecessor, Card Gymnasium, which opened in 1930.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe plans for the stadium were drawn up in 1935 by basketball coach Eddie Cameron. The stadium was designed by Julian Abele, who studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, France. The same architectural firm that built the Palestra was brought in to build the new stadium. The arena was dedicated on January 6, 1940, having cost $400,000. At the time, it was the largest gymnasium in the country south of the Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania. Originally called \"Duke Indoor Stadium\", it was renamed for Cameron on January 22, 1972; that day the Blue Devils beat archrival North Carolina 76-74. The first nationally televised game took place on January 28, 1979 against Marquette, it was broadcast by NBC and won by Duke 69\u201364.  Regionally televised games in the Atlantic Coast Conference, including from the (then) Duke Indoor Stadium, had begun in the late 1950s.The building originally included seating for 8,800, though standing room was sufficient to ensure that 9,500 could fit in on a particularly busy day. Then, as now, Duke students were allocated a large number of the seats, including those in the lower sections directly alongside the court. Renovations in 1987\u20131988 removed the standing room areas, added an electronic scoreboard and display over center court, wood paneling, brass railings and student seats, bringing capacity to 9,314, though now there is sufficient standing room to ensure 10,000 could fit. For high-profile games, students are known to pack in as many as 1,600 into the student sections, designed for a maximum of 1,100. Prior to the 2002\u20132003 basketball season, air conditioning units were installed in Cameron for the first time as a response to health and odor concerns for players and fans alike. Prior to the 2008\u201309 season, a new video scoreboard replaced the electronic board over center court. Before the 2009\u201310 season, additional changes were made, including installing LED ribbon boards to the front of the press table and painting the upper seats Duke blue.  Cameron is one of the few major arenas that uses backboards suspended from the ceiling instead of anchored on the floor.\n\n\n== Atmosphere ==\nThe students and fans are known as \"Cameron Crazies\" for their support of the team and loud cheering that has been recorded as high as 121.3 dB, which is louder than a power saw at 3 feet or a jackhammer.For access to major games, including those against the University of North Carolina, students reside in tents for months in an area outside of Cameron known as \"Krzyzewskiville\", named after legendary head coach Mike Krzyzewski. The hardwood floor was dedicated and renamed Coach K Court in November 2000.\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nSports Illustrated ranked it fourth on its list of the top 20 sporting venues of the 20th century, and USA Today referred to it as \"the toughest road game in the ACC.\"\n\n\n== Milestone games ==\n\nAdditionally, the facility hosted the Southern Conference men's basketball tournament from 1947 to 1950 and the MEAC Men's Basketball Tournament in 1972 and 1973.\n\n\n== Home court advantage ==\nRecords at Cameron Indoor StadiumAll-Time: 832\u2013154 (.844)Coach K: 474\u201359 (.889)Since 1997\u201398: 266\u201317 (.940)Duke is 179\u201312 (.937) at home since the 2004\u201305 season, second only to Allen Fieldhouse in winning percentage at home.\n\n\n=== Non-conference win streaks ===\nOn November 26, 2019, the Duke men's team non-conference home winning streak of 150 games ended with an overtime loss to Stephen F. Austin, 85\u201383. It had been at that point the longest active non-conference home winning streak in college basketball, with Duke's last non-conference home loss coming against St. John's almost 19 years earlier on February 26, 2000, when the then #2 Blue Devils lost 83\u201382.\nThe streak was the longest non-conference home win streak in Duke men's basketball history, breaking the previous record, which lasted 95 games, from February 2, 1983 to December 2, 1995, beginning with a 73\u201371 win over William & Mary and ending with a 65\u201375 loss to Illinois.\nDuke is now 274\u20134 in non-conference home games since 1983, starting with the win over William and Mary, having gone 32\u20133 in home non-conference games between the original and last winning streak. The only loss other than the Illinois and St. John's losses during that span coming at the hands of Michigan 61\u201362 on December 8, 1996.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCarolina\u2013Duke rivalry\nDuke\u2013Maryland rivalry\nList of NCAA Division I basketball arenas\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCameron Indoor Stadium official page\nCameron Indoor Stadium men's basketball statistics",

          "To visit this famous place at its best, it takes a ticket to see a men's basketball game, which is virtually impossible to get. That said, it is worth the price of admission to see for yourself what all of the hoopla is about.",
          "Game was excellent. They need to do something about parking spaces closer to facility. As a single woman walking many many blocks on a Saturday night was a little scary.",
          "If you go when there's not a guided tour, it's not very exciting. There are sometimes other teams practicing in there, such as youth basketball teams.",
          "There is no place like Cameron if you are a college basketball fan. The best players have played on this court. The greatest of all time coaches is a fixture here. There is a museum next door and definitely worth a visit.",
          "The storied history of this court along with the attached museum of Duke basketball makes this a must visit while on campus. Students \u201ctent\u201d it to get tickets to see them play rival UNC. This place was here way before Coach K but he has built it into the toughest place to play",
          "When in Durham, plan a visit to Cameron Indoor Stadium. Even if you are not a Duke fan, basketball\u2019s history runs through this building. While clearly Duke centric, basketball fans will find a visit entertaining. Possible exceptions would be U.K. and UNC fans.",

          "If you are able to go inside for a game or when nothing is going on, it is truly special. So many great players have played on this court. Seeing it on TV and being there in person are two totally different things. Make sure to visit if you are in the Durham area!",

          "A visit to this campus must include the historic gymnasium. It is vintage and gives you the impression you've gone back in time. The various tributes to the men's and women's basketball teams are all around. There is a museum as well highlighting the various sport teams of Duke",

          "This place is part of college basketball history. It is the equivalent to Fenway Park in baseball, Lambeau Field in football, and Madison Square Garden in basketball. Put it on your sprots bucket list even if you are a Carolina fan.",
          "This is a beautiful building and an asset to the campus, which has been renovated several times and had a recent facelift to the entry section. But the edifice itself is hardly the whole story, it is this venue's rich history and of course its intense fans, known as the \"Cameron",

          "This was on our bucket list, see Duke play a game at Cameron Indoor Stadium. I bought tickets for my son and I last fall as they sell out as soon as tickets are available. We arrived at Cameron 90 minutes before tip off so we could check out the basketball museum. Having been",

          "Fist off it was way smaller than I thought. It was not game day, and we kind of just snuck in and walked on the court and took pictures. Just the sheer history of it is pretty great. If you are at Duke, you should pop in for a visit. Next door is also a great museum.",

          "This was our first time to Durham. Made the most of it and Attended a Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s game on back to back nights. We wanted to spend as much time in Cameron as we could. I worried that I build this trip up too much but it did not disappoint. The feeling of being in Cameron",
          "Caught a basketball game here and I did not like several things: the \"oldness\" of the building, the lack of seating capacity, the cramped seating, and the overall heat inside the arena --- BUT... I will say that this is certainly an iconic basketball venue, and it was good to go",
          "O don't see this attraction after my February game. So, here goes my review of one of the iconic basketball stadiums in the USA! Going to watch a Duke basketball game is like going to a huge rock concert so wear your ear plugs and look around at this \"small\" arena! Even the",

          "Once in a lifetime experience. A must for any & all college basketball fans! Not easy getting tickets but glad we did. Absolutely beautiful campus and amazing stadium",
          "A very unique setting to watch a game in, as the smallest stadium for college basketball. Hard not to be totally energized! Buy a ticket at the beginning of the season. expensive tickets but worth going at least once in your life!!",
          "There is nowhere else in the country like Cameron Indoor. If you are a college basketball fan, a basketball fan, or a sports fan in general, you must make a pilgrimage here for a game at some point. It is so much smaller than you would expect from seeing it on TV. It is like a",
          "This was my second visit in 25 years, and this one was even more special. I love that this stadium is so intimate and small. I got chills imagining the greats that played there as I walked on the gym floor. We were there for Duke Basketball Camp, which was amazing!",
          "What a great place to see a basketball game! I started attending games as a student in the early 1980s. It's been a consistently fun arena for Duke students and fans, but not so much for opponents! Renovations over the years have been welcome (like air conditioning), but it's",
          "Always enjoy going here for a basketball game or just to walk around and view the memorabilia. It's loud, it's close quarters, it's hot.. but that is Duke Basketball!",
          "Cameron is a great place to experience ACC Basketball. The Duke fans stay in a frenzy the entire game. Being a small stadium definitely adds to the energy.",
          "All seats with good views of court. The size and crowd intensity makes you feel like you are part of the action. VERY tough to get a ticket.",
          "There is nothing like being at a Duke game!!! There is not a bad seat in the house. The only problem is getting your tickets! Always a packed house.",
          "Tickets to Duke Men's Basketball games are exceptionally hard to come by. For students, there are a number of mechanisms, and if you know a grad student, they can help you out for certain games. For the rest of the world, you're left to scalp tickets in person, online, or buy",
          "Whether you love college basketball or not, you'll enjoy a game at Cameron Indoor. It's a very small arena that the university has chosen to keep that way. Not a bad seat in the house, if you can score a ticket. They are super hard to come by. It's a family friendly venue with",
          "Cameron offers an amazing opportunity to watch amazing college basketball with a small gym feel. There are no bad seats. My son and I sat almost at the top in a corner and had a great view. Even if Duke's not your team, if you love college basketball, this is one place you",
          "Attending a basketball game at Cameron is a sports religious moment. The students are much better than previous years - better synchronized cheers and fewer snarky comments. They are loud as are the loyal Duke fans. It's small and at times hot. Very crowded. Pure basketball",
          "We were lucky enough to watch a BB game here against Clemson. What an experience, electrifying. Great fans, players, and of course the legendary Coach K. I have always admired Duke Basketball but never thought I would have the opportunity to watch them in their own environment.",
          "This is literally smaller than a high school gym and has the coolest feel to it. It is a must for any sports fan. I was lucky enough to go back a few years ago when Duke beat a #1 ranked Syracuse team at the time.",
          "I'm not big into duke athletics but cameron is an experience for any true sports fan! You are right on top of the players! It is the smallest venue I have been in and it's not air conditioned inside the actual arena itself!! It is pure madness! If your a college fan, it is a",
          "This definitely is the smallest place that I have even been that can fit 9,314 people very tightly. Funs are amazing and watching game there is very special.",
          "If you ever get the opportunity to be a part of a Blue Devils home game the feeling is awesome. Not only are you going to see some top class basketball, the show that the fans put on is something to see. Be prepared though, it gets hot and loud but worth every minute of it.",
          "My father wanted a trip to a Duke home game for Christmas so I had a very helpful friend that is a member of the Iron Club and we got tickets behind the scorers table five rows up on center court. Our seats could not have been better. That being said, the ushers, the ticket",
          "One of the great smaller indoor arenas to watch college basketball! Still the intimate and intimidating place I remember from my student days!",
          "Even if you're not a Duke fan this place is a must go for every college basketball fan. The Hall of Fame next-door to Cameron indoor arena is worth the time to browse The space is more like a high school gymnasium rather than a top notch college basketball program the",
          "Been here for graduations and sporting events. Works well for both. Parking at a stadium always requires a bit of walking. Wasn't too bad. Once inside, you're able to enjoy your event regardless of your seating assignment/selection. Great venue.",
          "Unbelievable for someone coming from a college where national level sports is not a consideration. If I was a high school kid on a recruiting visit, I would just ask \"where do I sign?)",
          "As life long DUKE fans, my wife and I have been waiting our whole lives to make a trip here from CT. And I can honestly say it was more than we expected. It feels like a high school game on steroids based on how small it is. We stood in the student's section when the men's team",
          "Well I am a Duke fan and I've been liking them for 10 years. They have great atmosphere because of the Crazies. Even though its small, its still better than Dean Smith Center. Lets Go DUKE",
          "We went for Countdown to Craziness and it was the best! Great everything and awesome environment. Go Duke!",
          "Yes, i'm a Duke fan so I'm biased, but this place is amazing. The students are clear and classy with their chants. If you like college basketball and you can get tickets, you should go there just to have a better idea what it's like to play here.",
          "I have been to Cameron many times, and I've seen Duke play in most of the road venues they frequent. I've seen badly failed attempts to copy the environment down to stealing 100% of the cheers. Nothing beats the real thing. The stadium is designed to be a sports antique like",
          "Cameron is the best place in College Hoops to see a game! It's also a great spot to visit anytime from 8-5 to see the special place that Duke plays, the Championship Banners and the Sports Hall of Fame which includes Duke Basketball! It's about an hour tour reading the history,",
          "We tried to call many places to see if Cameron would be open on football day. No one on the whole University could take the time to do that. So, we went because some of the answers on here said they usually keep the stadium open, well it wasn't open. Bottom line, just take",
          "The energy in Cameron is electrifying. The stadium has never been enlarged so it feels like you are part of the action and there are no bad seats. If you are lucky enough to get tickets to a Blue Devils' game be prepared to scream and sweat for 2 hours straight!",
          "So like any die hard college basketball fan, I may not like Duke but going to Cameron Indoor is certainly on my bucket list. Went there in February to visit my friend who goes there, got in line for grad student tickets to the UVA game and was given a wristband which is",
          "I'm a graduate of nearby Carolina so am not a Duke sports fan, but my husband is and we were able to attend a Duke Women's Basketball game against Carolina at Cameron and both really enjoyed it. It's small an intimate with understandable appeal - definitely try to get in to see",
          "Yeah, it's not what it used to be in the 1980s. But still, the best and most intimate place to watch basketball as God intended it.",
          "This is the best basketball venue in the world. It's hot. It's loud. The seats are small. You do not have to get a second mortgage to buy a ticket, unless you want to see a Carolina (UNC) game. The cheapest way to see a game at Cameron is to wait until the students are on",
          "We were at Duke for an awards ceremony held in Cameron. For my Blue Devil loving child being in Cameron was a dream come true! I was surprised that it was open and we were allowed to just walk around even outside of the ceremony. There's a wonderful Hall of Fame area in the",
          "You can't be at Duke and not go into Cameron Indoor! The stadium is very small compared to most places, but when you step on the court you feel powerful and unstoppable. We have season men's basketball tickets and love going to the games. Any seat in Cameron is valuable so it is",
          "If you are lucky enough to get tickets to see the Blue Devils at home for any game. YOU SHOULD GO!!!!!! But everyone should have the Duke vs Carolina game on their bucket list \ud83c\udfc0\ud83c\udfc0 get there early and stay late. Nothing like it anywhere else in sports.",
          "You won't see too many of this type of stadium around any more so if you can take in a Duke game, and stomach the price of tickets, this is a classic place to watch a basketball game. Small arena. No bad seats, and the choreographed chants and cheers of the students is",
          "Have been a Duke fan for a very long time. Love Coach K. It was a dream come true and a Bucket List thing to visit Cameron. We were able to walk right in and walk around. Make sure and visit the museum up on the top level. So cool.",
          "Tool my son to Duke camp with coach K and was impressed with this gym. Displays a lot of history of their accomplishments. You know you are in the house of greatness.",
          "Had to visit historic Cameron Indoor Stadium. Beside being a Basketball fan a must see when in campus. Also, got to see Coach K. Sweet!!",
          "A great place to see a college basketball game the best way to explain the feeling is like being in the middle of a heart beat with the excitement during the game.",
          "Able to play on Cameron Indoor was a dream come true. This stadium is the mecca of college basketball. The tradition, banners, and the history makes this a must visit for anyone.",
          "Attended a high school graduation there and this looks like a 50's high school gym that hasn't been kept up. It was hot and really did smell bad. The sight lines were also very bad and the acoustics almost non-existent. Cramped and hard to get in and out of.",
          "My husband wanted to stop here, and Im glad I came along. The Duke atmoshpere is really something special. You can almost feel the roar of the crowd when you walk onto the basketball court. We had a tour guide, very knowledagable. He took our picture on half court. Took us",
          "We had perfect timing during our visit to Cameron...Coach K Academy was in progress so many Duke players were there hanging out and helping at the tournament. We were able to see Coach K and my boys got a picture with Grayson Allen which made the day awesome. The stadium is",
          "It's 1981, and my dad is recovering from surgery and cancer treatments at Duke University Medical Center. We were huge basketball fans in West Virginia. That evening, my mom and I were visiting in his hospital room after a long drive. My dad tells me that he noticed that Duke",
          "It was hard to believe you can walk in and stand center court. This is a legendary arena and can see why the Blue Devils are so dominate at home. Walking buy you would never know this is where they played. The museum adjacent to stadium was great and very informative but when",
          "lovely stadium, my son always wanted to see this. We will return for the Duke basketball games. Durham has grown a lot in the last few years.",
          "My daughter's Graduation was in this stadium. It was very nice, comfortable seats, lots of parking and bathrooms.",
          "Attended the Duke Law School Graduation here Saturday. I agree with previous reviewer that it is an oversize high school gym. Haven't seen wooden slat seats since old Connie Mack Stadium in Philly. That said, I can only imagine the atmosphere here during a basketball game. My",
          "Cameron Indoor Stadium is the Ultimate home court advantage. It literally is an oversized high school gym. The gym is a cozy confine for less than 10,000 people. Which makes the opponent have limited opportunity for fans there. It is hard to rate this arena because the",
          "The Indoor Cameron is one of the best stadiums to watch college basketball because of the great atmosphere, excellent seating and has one of the best college basketball teams in the nation, the Blue Devils!! Even cheapest seats in Cameron are on par with with seats in bigger",
          "I've been to Cameron Indoor Stadium for Duke Men's Basketball games and Duke Basketball camp with my kids. The intensity of the game environment with Coach K in the house is work experiencing at least once. The historic significance of the building is evident and there is a",
          "I never understood why people prefer to attend sports games when you can see the game so much better at the comfort of your home. But seeing a game at Cameron changed my mind about this. The energy in the building is fantastic. Great ambiance. The people watching is even more",
          "I was lucky to have had a chance to see the court on our visit to campus this past weekend. I'm a longtime Duke fan so having a peek and be able to set foot on that historic court was a great moment for my wife and I. My parents being alums - this trip was certainly memorable.",
          "Cameron Indoor. How to describe it? Intimate - check. Hot - check. Loud - check, check. Filled with Crazies. Absolutely. One of the most amazing basketball venues in the country. Without a doubt. Hard to get a ticket, even if you are a student. Yep. That's part of the",
          "If you like or love college basketball, then a trip to Cameron must be on your bucket list. Awesome venue, get there earlier and tour the museum to all Duke sports teams.",
          "OK- don't know what I was expecting but to see a men's b'ball game here was COOL. Only ~7000 seats but the history of the place was what won me over...On non-game days there is very open access to walk around the gym- my daughter was able to snag a picture with some of the",
          "The most exciting sports venue there is. Period. It never disappoints. The creativity of the cheers is great.",
          "I enjoy going to Cameron for a game. You can see the court from any seat. The atmosphere is electric. I wish the construction was done and I hate they had to add a scanner screening machine",
          "As a Duke alum, I'm biased, but there is no experience like a basketball game at Cameron Indoor. I love Cameron Indoor and would go to a Duke game anytime, in a heartbeat.",
          "We went on a non game day but loved the Duke Basketball hall of Fame and Museum connected to Cameron. What was really awesome is that Duke allows you to enter the basketball court area to see the banners and watch the practice activity. We saw a Lady Blue Devil and her coach",
          "The atmosphere is electric and the basketball game was intense. The crowd is completely focused on the game it was awesome!",
          "Returned for a game and got to relive my student days (though not in the student section). This is, hands down, the best place to see a college basketball game. It is like being in a high school gym!! Every seat is amazing. So much fun, so much energy, amazing basketball, and",
          "As a huge college basketball fan attending a Duke game was an amazing experience. Cameron is to college basketball as Fenway is to baseball. Every seat in this venue is fantastic and the place feels like you're watching a game from a bygone era with bench seating below and",
          "If ever there's a chance to see a men's or women's game in Cameron, do it! We spoke with fans from Utah and from PA who have no kids in college - just lifelong DUKE fans who flew to Durham to experience Cameron, the game, and to see Coach K and his team. Really the best in",
          "This from a game last year. When students are in this 9300 capacity building, and Coach K is there, history is being made. Try to go when students are on campus. Can't believe K has been there since 1980. While being Olympics coach since 2006.",
          "My family and I traveled by car from Texas, to be a part of this unique and great experience. The very best place in the U.S. to watch a college basketball game. High intensity from start to finish, the Cameron Crazies are exactly that, they never sit down or shut up, and the",
          "Big arenas may be the way college sports is headed but Duke has not followed that trend. Nothing compares to the ambience of Cameron. I have traveled to Atlanta, San Antonia, Indy, etc. for games. I will take Cameron any day of the week.",
          "If you're a college basketball fan, then you've heard of the Cameron Indoor Stadium. It's the home of the Duke Blue Devils, a powerhouse in college basketball for many, many, years! It's considered one of the hardest places for the a visiting team to play, just because of the",
          "Finally got here for a basketball game recently, and wasn't disappointed. The crowd is chock full of energy, and the tiny stadium magnifies that energy. Tickets are quite expensive, but the free student lines are really helpful to get students in on a budget. Get ready to learn",
          "I love Cameron Indoor Stadium ! It is currently being renovated, as well as Wallace Wade Stadium. Once completed in 2016, the historical home of Duke Basketball and Football will be ready for the public to review. What has been done to date is impressive, with hopes we can share",
          "Attended game vs. Georgia Southern on 12/15/15. Awesome experience. Would have chosen reserved seating if I had to do it over again. Stood in student section and probably a smidge too old to enjoy that long standing. OVERALL it was a great experience. Hope to go back",
          "The stadium is smaller than I expected - they were doing some renovations when we went there. Cool to be in the stadium with so much basketball history - my son is a big duke basketball fan so he loved it.",
          "Visiting Cameron Indoor Stadium was beyond amazing. The electricity indoors and watching the students and fans was so much fun and exciting. The Duke indoor museum was so awesome. To view all of the past GREAT performances and wins of the Duke Blue Devils basketball team as well",
          "A truly amazing place. This stadium has remained essentially the same since it was built. It is small by today's standard, not even air conditioned, locates broadcasters and commentators in the rafters [where some probably belong], and contains the championship banners that",
          "Fantastic venue to see a game. Be prepared to stand and shout. Energy is amazing and experience is breathtaking",
          "Try hard to get tickets to a basketball game. At some unpopular games, there are sometimes season ticket holders selling their tickets in front of Cameron. Try hard. You'll enjoy it. At least visit the basketball museum.",
          "If you are anywhere near Durham head to Duke University and attend a basketball game at Cameron. It is a small , older but updated stadium. So you have a great seat to view the action in the arena. Listening to the students cheers and watching the players is something that",
          "It is always fun to attend live sporting events and this was no exception. Parking was \"reasonably\" easy with a $10 charge, a short walk to the stadium and plenty of staff in hand to assist. We had standing only but still had a great view of the game from section 17. Great",
          "I had the opportunity to attend a game and see the new team in action that went on to win the 5th NCAA Championship with Coach K. It is always great to be in the Indoor stadium for basketball especially to watch a men's game.",
          "This is the home of the Duke Blue Devils. Cameron Crazies will appear at the home Duke games and the fun is so great. Cameron is small but it holds so much basketball history. Coach K has done a wonderful job. Go Duke !",

          "I graduated here in 2006 from Hillside High School. I am also a fan of the Duke basketball team. great place to visit",
          "We wanted to see this historic stadium since we a huge Duke Basketball fans, but being able to see the opening practice of the 2015-2016 team was just icing on the cake. It was a once in a lifetime experience and well worth the walk in the rain.",
          "There's nothing better than an opportunity to take in a basketball game at Cameron Indoor Stadium. I've been fortunate to have gone several times and it's always thrilling. It helps to be a Duke fan, but even if you're not, you will be when you leave! The facility is kept in",
          "This was our first trip to Cameron Indoor and it is nothing like you might think. It is a classic, \"old school\" college gym with all the charm that comes with it. It has not been updated (intentionally), so you are close to the action and the atmosphere is great.",
          "My brother and I had the opportunity to visit Cameron Indoor Stadium while touring the Raleigh/Durham area. I had read that you can go into Cameron and was actually surprised that we were able to walk onto the court. There was going to be a volleyball match later that",
          "For college basketball fans, this is the Valhalla or arenas. There is not a more exciting venue for a college basketball game than Cameron Indoor. I had a client visit from Chicago and he specifically requested that we try to visit Cameron. We got lucky yesterday and got in",
          "My wife and I got lucky when we went to the Duke Basketball Hall of Fame. I befriended one of the guys who manned the doors and he gave us a guided tour of the area without anyone else being there. Saw the whole stadium when it is empty and it looked rather small compared to",
          "The museum is one of the best for hands on activities inside and outdoors. The butterfly exhibit was very nice. They also had a nice variety of insects on display.",
          "After seeing it on TV for the past 25 years I had to see it in person. Very cool building right in the middle of campus. Check it out if you are in the area. Right next to Football and Baseball stadiums.",
          "I attended a basketball game many years ago in Raleigh at The Cameron Indoor Stadium. Since we had bad seats (\"Nose-bleed\" seats), we could not really enjoy the game. The facility was new and there were two large screens at each end of the court. Jane H.",
          "Yes loved it. Go camery crazies what an experience. I enjoyed myself on campus and cant wait to return go devils",
          "Historic and amazing, museum section is accessible from Cameron. You will always remember the visit, so take several friends or your kids, all will find interesting, except of course if they are UNC, or NCSU fans. haha",
          "Best collage basketball venue in America. See any game and absorb the history. Great Duke sports memorabilia museum on the concourse level. Tickets, even for conference basketball games, are often available outside the stadium.",
          "Got our kids to sit in seats overlooking Coach K court...there was a basketball camp going on! What a storied place it is, and a joy for this Duke alum to show her children!",
          "Brought my kids from Indiana to show them the campus. So much had changed since I was there in the 80s, but Cameron Indoor still is amazing. Like the rest of the campus, construction is going on here too, but we were able to get inside and experience it. Awesome!",
          "Nothing beats Cameron Indoor Stadium for a basketball game. The building is beautiful with brass railings, wood paneling and old-school charm. It's small and intimate, which makes it really unique among sporting venues. The Cameron Crazies add to the ambiance, their clever signs",
          "If you are a die hard basketball fan, college basketball, college sports fan in general this is a must do no matter where your seats are!",
          "The grands loved this place!! From the hall way with all the flags, to the museum, the stadium itself...the stores...it was great! The bigger University store is better than the very small one near the stadium. And there is a lot of construction, so lots of walking. But well",
          "The mother church of college basketball. The building looks like a Duke classroom building from the outside but inside, sports history comes alive. Even the Coach K youth basketball camps are electric with excitement.",
          "visited here on our drive through NC. Loved getting to see the court and the hall of fame on the second floor.",
          "There is no single sports venue, anywhere, any sport, pro or amateur, that is even in the same league with Cameron! I had the incredible opportunity to spend 4 years here as a student. I saw the Tarholes come into this building 4 times (with Dean Smith, no less). I felt",

          "We visited here this past weekend. First time here. Great place to visit. The museum is pretty neat as well which is located in the building too. There was a girls camp going on so we couldn't go on the court but it was very nice to see the place. My husband loved it. His first",
          "Truly a special place! On this visit there were graduations taking place so we could not go in, but the museum was open and filled with nostalgia. Enjoyed the display from their big victory over Wisconsin this year. Lots of construction going on around campus this summer. I",
          "Becky and I walked over to the arena on our recent visit to Duke University. It was a hot late May afternoon, and when you see the arena from the exterior it looks like another classroom building instead of one of the premier venues in college basketball. The arena is nicer",
          "I know the place has a lot of history, but it was very disappointing to go to a game here for the first time. The seats are awful and hard to get through the rows and it is not at all \"handicap friendly\" (not uncommon for places this old) It is understandable why the students",
          "A fun place to see Duke basketball. If you can't afford tickets to see the men play try a women's game - especially the Duke UNC game. You can always get tickets and they are cheap.great games to watch too.",
          "If you can get a ticket you'll love the energy of all the Duke students and fans - it's amazing, entertaining, fun and refreshing. While it's an older and not very large space, that's not what's important. This is college basketball as it was meant to be!",
          "Tickets to Duke games are passed down from one generation to another. Even non-conference games are sold out. Tickets are expensive now if you can find someone selling one - good luck on that. But it is so much fun to go to one of their games. At least they have air",
          "It is difficult to see a men's basketball game here, but you can see a women's game easily. It is worth it just to take in the atmosphere. This is the way college basketball should be played - in a small, traditional gym on campus!! I hate these schools that play in big",
          "Went there for games, and for the commencement. It is an essential memory of being a blue devil. There are winning and losing, but always fun.",
          "The seats are older version seats. If you are on the bigger side you'd probably have a hard time with the seats. There is a sport museum that you should visit. It's very informative and has great displays. Duke is proud of their alumni and all they've accomplished. There are 2",
          "this is an iconic place from what you see on TV have been there for a game a couple of years ago when we were invited to play duke but this time was quite our grand son got to see on over the great place to visit also you must see the hall of sports as it is amazing place our",
          "Great seats. Team still developing talent and chemistry. Miami played out of their minds and embarrassed the eventual 2015 NCAA Champs. I'm sure it helped Duke, but it was a painful evening. What else can you say?",
          "I paid a recent visit to Duke for my 40-year reunion. Registration was at the back end of Cameron. The building is not only a shrine to Coach K, it also comtains some great memoriabilia dating all the way back to the nascent stirrings of Duke basketball. Great photos are hung",
          "If you are a basketball fan, there is no better basketball experience than watching the Blue Devils play inside Cameron Indoor Stadium. The small size of the arena almost gives it the intimacy of a high school gym. The students camp out -- sometimes days in advance of a game",
          "A very, very cool place for anyone who appreciates Duke athletics. The basketball memorabilia is incredible, and brings many memories to mind, of conquests and great players. If you are NOT a Duke fan, stay away because this place heralds all things Duke and it does it really,",
          "This was our first trip and it was what we expected. We went in February the weekend ND was in town and the fans were camped out and full of life. The place is truly full of history by just looking around and seeing all the banners, famous pictures of great games and players.",
          "Was fortunate enough during a short visit to Durham to see a Duke vs NCU womens basketball game at Cameron stadium. The seat was comfortable by stadium standards and the atmosphere was amazing - particularly when Duke won.",
          "I've been to Cameron for men's and women's basketball games and concerts. It's a small and very intimate arena, and you're remarkably close to the court no matter where you sit. For basketball, the atmosphere is electric, with \"Crazy Towel Guy\" and the justly-famous Cameron",

        "wiki": "El Capitolio, or the National Capitol Building (Capitolio Nacional de La Habana) is a public edifice and one of the most visited sites in Havana, capital of Cuba. The building was commissioned by Cuban president Gerardo Machado and built from 1926 to 1929 under the direction of Eugenio Rayneri Piedra. It is located on the Paseo del Prado, Dragones, Industria, and San Jos\u00e9 streets in the exact center of Havana.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Havana Capitol was built on land that was a railroad terminal and used to belong to the Villanueva Railway.\nThe project began on April 1926, during the Gerardo Machado administration. Construction was overseen by the U.S. firm of Purdy and Henderson. Prior to the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the Congress was housed in the building, the Congress was abolished and disbanded following the Cuban Revolution in 1959 and the building fell into disrepair.\n\"El Capitolio\" has a size of 681 by 300 ft. Although its design is often compared to the United States Capitol, it is not a replica. \"It is similar to that in Washington D.C, but a meter higher, a meter wider, and a meter longer, as well as much richer in detail. To finish its construction they needed more than 5000 workers, 3 years, 3 months and 20 days; as well as approximately 17 million  American dollars\". Completed in 1929, it was the tallest building in Havana until the 1950s. It houses the world's third largest indoor statue.\nAs of 2013, the Government of Cuba has been slowly restoring the building for use once again as the home of Cuba's National Assembly.[1]\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nAccording to its architect, Eugenio Rayneri Piedra, the inspiration for the cupola came from the Panth\u00e9on in Paris by way of Bramante's Tempietto in San Pietro in Montorio.\nThe cupola, which is stone clad around a steel frame that was constructed in the United States, is set planimetrically forward on the building to allow for the apse that contains La Republica, the \"Statue of the Republic\". At almost 92 m (302 ft) high, the dome was the highest point in the city of Havana until 1956 when the FOCSA Building was built reaching a height of 121 meters (397 ft). The Capitolio had the third highest dome in the world at the time of its construction.\nThe gardens, based on the designs of European gardens consisting of areas of lawn bordered by paths and highlighted by Royal Palm trees, were designed by French landscape architect Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier who also designed the Paseo del Prado. \nThe 56 steps leading to the main entrance, La Escalinata, is flanked by 6.5 m (21 ft) statues by the Italian artist Angelo Zanelli. To the left is Work (El Trabajo) and to the right The Tutelary Virtue (La Virtud Tutelar). The steps lead up to the central portico, which is 36 m (118 ft) wide and more than 16 m (52 1\u20442 ft) tall. There are 12 granite columns in the ionic order arranged in two rows and each over 14 m (46 ft) tall. Beyond the portico, three large bronze doors with bas-reliefs by Zanelli allow access to the main hall.\n\nThe inside of the main hall under the cupola is the Statue of the Republic (La Estatua de la Rep\u00fablica). The statue, also by Zanelli, was cast in bronze in Rome in three pieces and assembled inside the building after its arrival in Cuba. It is covered with 22 carat (92%) gold leaf and weighs 49 tons. At 15 m (49 1\u20444 ft) tall, it was the second highest statue under cover in the world at the time, with only the Great Buddha of Nara being taller. The statue stands on a plinth 2.5 m (8 1\u20444 ft) high bringing the total height to 17.54 m (57 1\u20442 ft). A Creole Cuban, Lily Valty served as the model for the body for Zanelli, and the inspiration for the statue came from Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom.\n\nEmbedded in the floor in the centre of the main hall is a replica 25 carat (5 g) diamond, which marks Kilometre Zero for Cuba. The original diamond, said to have belonged to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and have been sold to the Cuban state by a Turkish merchant, was stolen on 25 March 1946 and mysteriously returned to the President, Ram\u00f3n Grau San Mart\u00edn, on 2 June 1946. To either side of the main hall is the Sal\u00f3n de Pasos Perdidos (Hall of Lost Steps), named for its acoustic properties. These halls, with inlaid marble floors and gilded lamps, lead to the two semicircular chambers that formerly housed the Parliament and Chamber of Deputies. The Parliament chamber to the right of building is backed on to by the President's office which has a door opening directly onto the dais.\nA range of different lamps are seen throughout the building. These were all designed specifically for the building by Cuban designers and the majority of them manufactured in France.\nIn the centre of the building are two patios which provide light and ventilation for the offices of first (ground), third and fourth floors. The north patio features another statue The Rebellious Angel (El \u00c1ngel Rebelde) which was donated to the building after the inauguration. There is a small fifth floor, and a sixth floor which gives access only to part of the cupola.\n\n\n=== Central portico ===\nA wide granite staircase of 56 steps, 36 meters wide and 16 meters high, leads to the portico of the building. There are two rows of 6 columns of the Ionic order. The pillars stand out with a diameter of 1.55 meters and a height of 14.10 meters. Reasons for the hall, located in all the doors and the lateral panels, are the Boticcino marble squares sculpted by Angelo Zanelli.\nOn both sides of the end of the staircase are two bronze sculptural groups with granite pedestal by the Italian Angelo Zanelli, one male, and the other female, have a height of 6.70 meters and represent the first progress of human activity and the second the tutelary virtue of the people.\n\n\n=== Statue of the Republic ===\n\nLocated in the apse, the Statue of the Republic is the figure of a young woman standing, dressed in a tunic, with a helmet, shield and lance; it weighs 30 tons, is 14.60 meters high, and rests on a marble pedestal of 2.50 meters.  It was sculpted by Angelo Zanelli, author of the Altare della Patria, part of the monument to King Victor Emmanuel II, in Rome. It is the third largest indoor statue in the world, surpassed only by the Buddha of Nara, Japan and the Abraham Lincoln statue in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.

          "Beautiful restoration of this capital building. English guide was very good. Interesting history in this building.",
          "You can now enter the Capitol. The tours are about 45 minutes for a reasonable price (10 cuc I think) in both English and Spanish. The tour ticket office is to the right of the entrance stairs. It is kinda hard to find. It is said that by Nov 2019 (for the 500th anniversary)",
          "It looks quite a bit like the White House in Washington DC, but the surrounding area is very open and the public can freely wander about. You are right next to central Habana, so it's easy to make a short detour. Renovation works are taking place but this hasn't ruined the place",
          "Well they said the place was the residence of Batista before the revolution but now it hosts the national assembly. No doubt security is high but even if you don't want to go in you can spend some time on the front stairs and watch people and colorful cars passing by. One point:",
          "The Kapitol is so huge you can see it from all over Havana. It\u2019s and must when you are here. It also from here many old car tours begin( 20-30 CUC for 1h don\u2019t pay more! As 60-80 CUC they want you to pay",
          "This is the last thing you expect to see in a Caribbean island. It is very impressive on the outside. The surrounding space is also gorgeous. It is a short walk from Teatro Colon and a very enjoyable one.",
          "Gorgeous building but it has now been under construction for over tree years. Looks like a smaller version of our capitol in the United States.",
          "While we were there, there was evidence of continued renovations of the capital. The dome was still under construction but the exterior looks like it was nearly brand new. The contrast however between the capital and other nearby buildings is quite stark as attention is paid",
          "We laughed to find out that the Cuban El Capitolio was designed to look like our Capitol Building. There are ornate beautiful statues made by Italian sculptures in French gardens.",
          "Nice area and stunning buildings. You will find below El Capitolio the \"cake\" building. It's fabulous! Nice street for photos, for shopping from the local stores and street food places and relaxing in the square in the opposite side. Must see it.",
          "People recommended that we took a tour inside. We didn\u2019t but I\u2019ll regret it. It\u2019s beautiful on the outside. If you have time, try to visit the Capit\u00f3lio.",
          "As you wander the old city make your way here to the Capital. A replica of our capital and few feet taller (which Cubans are proud to state) its a stately building in the process of being restored. Nearby are some great parks and directly behind is the place to buy your cuban",
          "This building is something else, an impressive building that is well kept and worthy of viewing. I wish we had more time so that we could go inside as we heard it was magnificent architecture.",
          "Restoration works are almost finished with dome only part now under scaffolding after years of renovation The imposing white of the stone can now be seen and is a very impressive replica of the capitol in Washington",
          "We came here and the hotel was next door. We got on the bus in this area the bus took us all over the city for $10. We enjoyed the views and this was part of the tour for three hours.",
          "This impressive building currently has its dome covered up for some rework but it is still mighty impressive and a real must see on any city trip to Havana",
          "If El Capitolio is one of most prestigious building in whole Cuba, than you can recognize how poor is whole country. Government building is surrounded by homeless, sick dogs and no one cares about them. It\u2019s sad and shows how local people treat their city and nature - without",
          "What a incredible site. It is architecture from the glory days of Havana. Everything in Havana apperars to be under renovation for the big 500 year anniversary",
          "First impression ? Omg... White House ! Nice neighborhood, full of old American cars that are spinning around...",
          "We rented a 1958 Edsel and did a 2 hour tour of Havana. That's the way to see Havana. The Capitol dome was under construction but it's still beautiful. Found out it's the same architect that did the US Capitol. Beautiful architecture in this neighborhood.",
          "FANTASTIC...must visit, undergoing renovations at this time. a lot of things in Havana are being renovated and repair for its 500th year celebration happening in November 2019. great photo opportunity.",

          "This impressive National Capital building, located in the centre of Havana, is presently under construction so we did not go in, but did drive around it. On our next visit we hope to be able to see the interior.",
          "Impressive building - compares well with Capitol building in Washington. Well worth taking the tour. Stunning interiors beautifully restored. Unfortunately the Statue of the Republic is currently under restoration which means I will have to return. Yippee",
          "a beautiful historical building. when we visited we couldn't enter as construction was taking place.",

          "An impressive structure and history. The building is being renovated so tour encompasses only about half. Tours at set times with pleasant English-speaking guide.",
          "Not such a big deal this time as the dome was being redone. I recall how grand it was all li at night when I stayed across st the Hotel Atlantic in \u201805.",
          "Amidst a technicolor cluster of vintage automobiles and a constant stream of pedestrian that make up the chaotic hustle of Havana's city center, sits El Capitolio. Equal parts inspiring and imposing in its palatial opulence, it is an iconic part of Havana's skyline. The Capitol",
          "Well worth the visit. Architecture is beautiful. We were able to watch workmen restoring the beautiful rooms of this historic building. Very impressive.",
          "My guide is also a guide for tours at the Capitol, so I got a great personalized tour. It is a remarkable building and is undergoing a tremendous restoration. The parts that are finished are just gorgeous and worth the visit.",
          "For 10Cuc, this 45 minute tour is a little on the pricey side for Habana, but hey, they have to pay for this opulent, lavish restoration somehow. High point was seeing the original legislative chamber, and the special door that provided access for the president. The chamber is",
          "This is a replica of its namesake in Washington, but 3m taller. It stands proud and dominates the skyline.",

          "This is a gem equal to the on in Washington D.C in the US, however, it was always closed. It its worth the visit once the renovations are completed",
          "Stunning building surrounded by many many buildings that are in a state of disrepair. El Capitolip is currently under renovations (dome has scaffolding around it) but the building and grounds are well maintained and worthy of a walk up the stairs to the top for a view of",

          "It is a massive building. The dome is still under restoration, but that does not take away from how impressive it is.",
          "Spectacular. A must see from directly outside. Regal, powerful and magnificent. An incredible structure.",
          "Visually striking inside and out, this is more an edifice than a government building. Another sparkling monument to the revolution, it is worth a visit for the architectural details alone.",
          "This copy of the US Capitol building (scaled down) is awesome. The building is very well maintained (for Cuba) and only a tour will open corridors to see the beautiful marble floors and ceilings, the upholstered furniture, the meeting rooms, the first Parliament room. There is",

          "An old oldie but goodie Can be seen all through Habana Remember it well when I was living there Needs some up keeping",
          "I think this is my favourite building in Havana. Huge, impressive and great design. It was under renovation which is has been for a while when we went but still worth seeing from the outside.",
          "After 12 trips to Cuba I finally got to see the Capital building. It is beautiful. Make sure you get your 10 CUC tickets at the side of the building first before climbing all the stairs.",
          "A great building that is worth a visit. Climb the steps and just sit and watch the world go by. Good to walk around and view from all angles - still in the process of being cleaned but only the top part now.",

          "I guess mini might not be there right description, this is a large building. It looks very much like the US White House. Havana is such a mixture of era's, style's and types of buildings, so its interesting to see something that closely related to a US landmark in Havana. It",
          "My husband and I were touring Havana with Cubaoutings and this was one of our stops for a history lesson and picture opportunity. According to available information, \"El Capitolio or National Capitol Building in Havana, Cuba was the organization of government in Cuba until",

          "If this was in the US we probably could not come so near to this place due to high security. But they are very relaxed. Mind you it is not as important as it once was. You get a nice view from the top of the stairs where you can sit and just relax. We did not realize that there",
          "Entry price of 10 Cuc certainly worth it. Only a guided tour inside given every hour. Check the opening hours before you go: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday open from 10:00 am till 4:00pm. Wednesday and Sunday open from 10:00 to 12:00 pm The guided tours are given in",
          "If in Havana, definitely go by the Capitol! They are working on it now, but the building is very beautiful. You don\u2019t see that architecture everywhere. We were absolutely amazed by the city.",
          "Wonderful walk to Capitol building everyday, Havana just fabulous. Iconic building, steeped in history",
          "One of the nicest buildings in Havana! we didn't go in but go the chance to get a close look on it when heading to the Cigar shop.",
          "A massive structure with architecture that is beautiful. We walked all around it which took awhile however it was worth it.",
          "The Capitol, which is of remarkable resemblance to the capitol found in D.C., truly is a magnificent and for quite outlandish structure, when one is to take into account its Caribbean location. The building is currently being renovated for the city 500th birthday next year, so",
          "We took a tour of the Capitulo as they have almost completed the rennovations for a huge anniversary next year. It has been restored wonderfully holds much history. Our guide spoke excellent english.",
          "Extremely impressive from the outside and when all the repairs are finished the inside will be even more so. Can\u2019t imagine that this building has been used for anything other than the seat of government, although it has. What in the heck were they thinking? The facade alone says",
          "Under renovation for many years. What has been completed is stunning. Worth a visit for sure. The whole area of old Havana is lovely",
          "Our apartment was overlooking the Capitol Building it looked grand and impressive. We didn't get the chance to go inside as it wasn't opened but we did plenty of pictures outside of it. When you seat on the steps leading up to it you have nice view of the colourful buildings",
          "This was my first time to visit El Capitolio. I really enjoyed the 50-minute English tour. The long hallways are spectacular. It cost 10 CUC to enter the building. You can purchase a ticket on the side of the Capitol. We arrived at 9:45 and had to wait for doors to open at",
          "Restoration continues but almost all of the interior spaces are available to been toured and they are spectacular. The exterior is largely finished but scaffolding remains on the dome - don't let that deter you.",
          "it just near with with Gran Teatro de La Habana, we dont go inside but just take some photos of the appearance which got no special but still good for picture on it.",

          "Arrived at El Capitolio and were lucky enough to arrive at just the time tours were going to start. We were told to buy tickets at the bottom of the stairs at the left which we quickly and easily did for 10 CUCs each. There was a large Spanish speaking tour and a very small",

          "Still under renovation but able to see its exterior and interior. Beautiful interior floors and detailed ceilings. Statutes outside are beautiful and walking the steps is amazing. The lamps in front of and around the Capitolio on the sidewalk are just beautiful.",
          "This was nice to see however there were restorations. The ticket office is at the bottom of the stairs to the Captiol we didnt know this and walked to the top then was asked to go back down to get a ticket however we didnt bother as we had seen the view anyway.",
          "You can see it from the outside. Nice replica of US Capitol building. It\u2019s now a museum, but has been in renovations for the last 6 years. You can\u2019t visit.",
          "This looks like a capital building. It was undergoing renovations so we were not able to go inside. Nice photo opportunity of an important Havana building.",
          "We tried to visit the Capitolio, when we got to the top of the stairs 'a sitting down in the corner security guard' blew his whistle at us and we had to go to him. He wanted to see our tickets which we didn't have, thinking you pay at the door, he informed us in Spanish that we",
          "I have been to Havana many times and this past trip I was finally able to tour the Capital as it had been closed for renovations. As with any government entity in Cuba, you are only able to see what they want you to see.",
          "Another of many fantastic buildings in Havana.It looks very similar to the Capitol Building in Washington and is where the Government used to sit prior to the Revolution.When we visited it was undergoing some much needed refurbishment bit even the scaffolding cannot diminish",
          "If you think Washington DC is amazing, go and visit this Capital building. Iconic, historic and simply breathtaking.",
          "The capital building. Organised tours only - security guard with whistle controls those wanting to just take a peak. Rising the stairs, you enter the central hallway to be greeted by a 30m high female statue which is quite impressive. The vaulted ceilings of the two wings",
          "Excellent tour of the Capitol, the guide spoke great English and was very knowledgeable about the history, the art and artefacts, and how the building functions today.",
          "The Capitol of Havana is in a straight line just a few blocks from Hostal Casa Vieja 1840 where we stayed, it is an interesting place for its architecture and interior beauty!",
          "Done as part of tour very big place lots to see here lots photos and tourists bring camera you will enjoy",
          "The attitude while queuing for tickets and waiting for the English guide was really bad. We almost gave up !! We had a very nice guide , she knew a lot , spoke good English and really compensated for the bad start",
          "We saw a lot of Havana but this building is an outstanding work of Architecture. A most see it is being rehab ed, reminds me a bit of the Capitol Building in Washington.",
          "Just stand across the street and note the beautiful architecture. Many classic cars pass here and offer nostalgic pics. Note that although the building restoration is complete, there is still scaffolding around the top portion.",
          "While its dome is slightly taller this is a near perfect replica of the United States Capital. It is currently being refurbished but it is an amazing structure.",
          "Building is copied from american Capitol in Washington. Being reconstructed during my visit. You can see a lot of classic american cars around. Many of them is in very good shape.",
          "4 years ago this building was under restoration and today its almost completed.It is amazing to see the great work done.The building is beautiful and majestic.",

          "When you stand here and look at this building, yes, it is beautiful. Heads up, turn around.... Take a look at the private buildings across the street that look shelled out with people nearly starving inside. The government steals their money and builds buildings like this, while",
          "We were informed that this is a replica of the Washington. I never have been there but this one in a architect gem. I even saw a Chinese president during our visit. Take tour camera ready",
          "I decent attempt to copy the Wahington DC building. One of the few tall buildings in Havana to make the skyline. A nice area to walk round.",
          "After our formal organized tour, we drove past the Capitol and when we had free time, opted to walk back to explore Old Havana on our own. Although we did not tour the Captiol, we did walk around and visited several shops and bars along the streets surrounding the Capitol.",
          "Not sure if the fence is down around it but would be great to go in this structure. So strange see a rough copy of our wedding cake capitol. Very beautiful. Wish they would clean the grounds up and do some serious landscaping.",
          "This is a must see if you have the chance. The building is breathtaking. We had an excellent guide and enjoyed the 1 hour tour. WARNING: the information you can get even from the guards is quite loose, so here it goes for you to not have to climb those stairs a couple of times",
          "Not necessarily a must see stop but its generally incorporated into most city tours. Mirrored after Washington DC, only on a much smaller scale. Exterior was being renovated so we did not get to go inside.",
          "This is a magnificent capitol building very reminiscent of a similar one in Washington no longer easily accessible to the public. Our guide proudly noted it i",
          "Go inside for real history and experience. It is lovely outside but you really must see what has happened here! Good shopping area to the right of the Capitolia past the opera/music building and past Hotel Inglaterra",
          "El Capitolio, one of the must see historical buildings from Old Havana, very representative of Cuban Patrimony!!",
          "Looks much better now than it did a few years ago. Still slowly being cleaned and renovated. You can see the US influence on the design.",
          "When I was there they just finished modernizing the capital. We were the first people to be allowed inside because our guide knew the guard and the chambers are exquisite.",
          "El Capitolio rennovation finished on June 2018. I visited the building just 9 days after it opened doors to the PUBLIC and it worths its expensive entrance (10 euro). The dom , the statue the Parliament and all the side exhibits give a taste that is not familiar with what you",
          "I been trying for 1 year but the building is not ready yet to visits, you can only see it from outside,",
          "It is currently under construction. It was still nice to visit the area, see the capital and learn a little of its history from our tour guide. It's a bit larger than the Washington DC Capital building.",
          "With the assistance of the German Government, this building has undergone a massive restoration. It is beautiful, particularly it's gardens. Kudos to the Cubans. They should be very proud.",
          "When you first see it, you realize it is modeled after the US Capital building (and its slightly taller than ours too). We didn\u2019t have the opportunity to tour the inside, but were able to see it from our classic car. It was under construction and our tour guide mentioned it has",
          "El Capitolio stands out as an impressive building in Havana. Our guide told us that it is bigger than the Capitol in DC. It is under rehab for the 500 year anniversary of Havana next year, 2019.",
          "The El Capitolio was under renovation when we visited Havana, and so we didn't get to take any good photos or see it properly, which was a pity.",
          "The contrast of the capitol and the streets of run down housing are quite the contrast. It is a national treasure and historic building worth the renovation. And it makes you think about how we allocate resources. $5CUC worth the money and waiting. Fabulous interior with guided",
          "The area where the capitol sits is really nice, the building is currently being remodeled. Very similar to the bldg in Washington D.C.",
          "Former place of parliament turned museum! Though a replica it is bigger than the white house in the USA. Fun times lots of stories. No regrets",
          "Take the trouble to take the guided tour. The restored sections are jaw-dropping in their opulence and one wonders while the current regime still insists on sitting elsewhere after all this money has been spent here. The woodwork is incredible and there is a reasonable",
          "Most of the Cuban architectures are not maintained. El Capitolio however is beautifully renovated. Go to the left side of the building, instead of going up the steps, there are two ticketing booths for tours. Foreigners pay CUC 10 for an one hour guided tour. The inside is",
          "I have been there in May 2018. It was during renovation period so we were not able to visit it fully but anyway very nice building raising between old damaged houses.",
          "Looks at the same in Puerto Rico.It is been renovated, beautiful if you walk from el paseo del prado here clean streets and side walks.",
          "Our tour guide joked about them copying our Capitol Building (and making sure that it is slightly taller than the one in America). Interesting photo opportunity.",
          "This is truly a great building and a good reminder of\u2019 the good old days!\u2019 Opposite here you will find a very good restaurant too called Nardos. Beware of the old car taxis. They can cost a fortune",
          "So very fortunate to have chosen to travel to Havana again this year, as the last time we visited, the Capitolio was still under renovation. The majority of the outside has been restored except for a section at the back. Rather than walk up those giant steps, go around to the",
          "This capitol building is quite large, about 2-3 city blocks. Currently under some re-construction which is a nice thing to see as most of Havana is falling apart.",
          "Another really impressive site in Havana. This is a huge building, MUCH bigger than it seems. We had to stand two streets across the street to really get a good look at it.",
          "El Capitolio what can we say, this is a beautiful building. Walking up the steps is breathtaking. It cost to go in 5cuc. Not much and the entrance is beautiful. You can see this building from anywhere in old Havana. We were on an escorted tour of the many rooms one being",
          "This was a good anchor spot to go in any direction. They were doing some construction on it but still beautiful ( looked kinda familiar) . Remember to bring TOILET PAPER if you are going to explore hole-in-the- wall type places.",
          "I\u2019d recommend visiting early in the morning, as there are less people around and you can get the pic on the grand staircase with no one in the shot. You buy your ticket on the left side of the building, from what I recall it was about 10/15 CUCs (CUC almost equaled Euro at the",
          "Fabulous building inside and out, when it is fully renovated. Bit pricey entrance fee to actually see not a lot because of the renovation but we did have an excellent guide who knew 'his stuff'.",
          "One of the major attractions outside of the Old Havana. It is a beautiful building similar to Washington's DC, but 6 inches taller. There is 2 lines to get in for locals and foreigners. I didn't have the patience to wait, and didn't need a guide to waste time walking around the",
          "This is a stunning building, the grounds are immaculate and we were fortunate enough to see a couple who had just got married having their photos outside here. Only thing that made me uncomfortable was you just had to look across the street to see horrific housing conditions for",
          "Prior to our arrival in Havana we were told how the Cuban people were so proud of their capitol building in the sense that it is taller than the US capitol in DC. Unfortunately, although maybe a foot taller, it is not nearly as grand in stature and architecture in my opinion.",
          "This majestic construction, located in the Habana Center, is similar to that in Washington D.C, but a meter higher as well as much more rich in detail. An attractive building that with its beauty enticing views. The El Capitolio Nacional (National Capitol of Cuba) is one of the",
          "Four years later and the work on the capitol building is still underway and scaffolds still surrounds the dome. Much of Havana is in a state of improvement and progress is coming, ready or not. The building is a copy of the US capital so that may enter into the equation.",
          "If you do nothing else in Havana, do go on the tour here. Excellent English speaking guide. The most amazing interiors in a stunning building. Built before the revolution it stands as a real Beacon as to what this country can do.",
          "Although there was construction scaffolding surrounding the Capitol building's rotunda wen we visited, the beauty of the building was still obvious. It was raining when we were there and the well maintained lawn surrounding the building glistened with water droplets. Lots of",
          "El Capitolio was just down the street from our hotel, so we passed it many times during our stay. Previous posts stated that it was closed for renovations, but we found out that they had just opened it back up for tours the month before we got there. We actually took a tour the",
          "Apparently it's a copy of the Capitol Building in Washington but they say it's 1cm taller. Whether or not that's true, it's one of the few really well-maintained buildings in Havana.",
          "Monumental building just renovated and looks impressive. Great for outside pictures - post card ones.",
          "The area near the Capitol is the heart of Havana, you\u2019re not far from anything in the city. Just outside the bustling Habana Vieja and the neighborhood of Vedado",
          "The place is under renovation and therefore not open to visitors, you can only look from the street. What was a shame was that the steps afforded some good photo opportunities, however the security guards kept chasing people off them. If you do go here for photos, then do look",
          "looks amazing from outside. we couldn't enter because was in repair and they only were doing guided tours 2 days in a week. you can take really good pictures from the stairs, the architecture is impressive. I saw pictures from inside and it was a petty that we couldn't go inside.",
          "We came across the capitol while walking in old Havana. It is quite an impressive building indeed. Currently it is undergoing extensive renovations inside & out. We wish we could have gone inside to see more but were running short on time. If it looks as nice inside as it does",
          "We initially thought the building was closed due to the refurbishment, but fortunately for us it was open. You have to take a tour, which costs 10 CUC each and lasts about an hour. The interior is even more impressive than the outside, with ornate ceilings and decor, and an",
          "Being around the El Capitolio building is very atmospheric, impressive building and lots going on around the streets and squares nearby, people in authentic Cuban costumes and even a Che Guevara lookalike, also the old classic cars touring by made this a great experience.",
          "After extensive renovation works by a german company the capitol is partially reopened and can be visited only with a guided tour. Tickets are sold at the left side of the stairs. 10 pesos for locals, 10 CUC for tourists. Everything looks shining and new.",
          "The capitol interior was closed for renovation but the one interior section that was open was the Tomb of the Unknowns which has been recently restored and is in fantastic shape. The exterior of the capitol looks very American as if it should be in a U.S. State Capitol except",
          "By walking by this incredible arcitechture of a government building, you start to feel and think about the mixed influence of Cuba. El Capitolio is a true copy of the White House in USA and there fore the even bigger experience in a country like Cuba. Don't miss that great",
          "fantastic building ...beatifully renovated...interesting to see just across from it the dilapadated buildings...",

          "Catch the real Havana watching the cars and people near El Capitolio! A truly picturesque part of the city!",

          "Beautiful building and would have given a 5 except for the repairs underway. Sure looks like the Washington, DC one",
          "You can go inside between 9-4pm. It's a stunning building but modern. Worth a short visit but nothing more.",
          "When I last visited the Capitol (Capitolio) around 15 years ago, it was like stepping back into a dusty forgotten time capsule. Completed in 1929 and designed by Cuban architects Govantes and Cabarrocas with more than a passing nod to its namesake in Washington DC, it was only",
          "I went there accidentally and it turned out to be a great visit. Until the first of April 2018 is free entrance and you have one hour guided tour during which they explain with a lot of details the history and the architecture of the building. Definitely recommended if you are",
          "We had the pleasure of being able to tour inside over 13 years ago, you can no longer tour inside as they will be going back to goverment operations. But still worth a visit, especially to see the old cars parked outside. A very cool (and often seen) photograph.",

          "The Capitol building in Havana is currently under construction but that doesn't detract from the fact it's such a beautiful building and the surrounding square (where our Airbnb sat) is full of colourful houses and vintage cars.",
          "This was built to replicate The American Capital Building in Washington DC. But they built it 3 feet taller in Cuba. LOL",
          "We felt very lucky to have been in Habana about 10 days after the building was opened after a very long renovation. You get in line and get a ticket and they let 60 people in per entry at the specified times...4 groups of 12 people based on language. If you miss the cut off you",
          "The visit of the capitol took us valuable time of our holiday that was not worth to spend. First of all the \"organisation\" is the worst. You have to wait between 1-2 hours to get a free ticket. But there is no real queue and it is no where a written sign how it works. So",
          "El Capitolio is one amazing building, grand and impressive, the restoration of the building is bringing this majestic building back to life. Is a must to take the free guided tour, you learn so much about the history and the meaning of all the symbols use in all of the",
          "The Capitolio building is a good point of reference if you're making your own way around Havana, close to the famous La Saratoga hotel you can also use your Wi-Fi cards nearby too, there are a few nice places to eat or drink nearby. The stunning building is lit up at night.",
          "Great building in the style of US and it separates Habana Vieja from Centro Habana. Nice building, surrounded by old american cars. Nice to see and make great pictures.",
          "Definitely a walk by, was closed for visitors but would\u2019ve wanted to see it. Would put it on my list.",
          "Very similar to the on in DC, but the architectural shape fits sooo much better in Havana. Take a walk down the street to get a better view. It's still under construction so we were not able to go inside. But makes for great pictures.",
          "You can't miss it, it's the National Capitol Monument, used for various government institutions. A grand landmark located at the start of Old Havana, in a massive open space, right next to Parque Central. The boulevards around offer some great views of the beautifully coloured",
          "This is very easy to see as its right in downtown Havana. It is well maintained unlike most other buildings around. I stronlgy suggest taking the inside visit if available as it is even more beautiful inside. Takes about 1.5h but its well worth, and its air conditionned!",
          "As many people mentioned visitors are not allowed to go in. It is a huge building in the middle of the Havana. Wherever you are in the Havana center you can see the building. Since our Airbnb was next to the Capitolio, it was essy for us to find the way back.",
          "Out Americaing the Americans, El Capitolio is bigger than the actual Capitol in Washington, apparently. It's so imposing and grand but under renovation and covered in spiky looking scaffolding at the moment. You can't go in at present but I'm sure it would be amazing! It's in a",
          "They say the Capital building is taller than the one in the states and the Cubans are rightly proud of it. Unfortunately, the place was under renovation so we couldn't get in to see it up close. Might impressive all the same.",
          "A lovely building to view whilst visiting Havana, resembling the United States Capitol building, and a beautiful example of neo-classical structure.",
          "This is a great area for a walking tour with a knowledgeable guide. The history is an important component of this area. Definitely a good part of seeing and learning about Old Havana",
          "We could not go inside, but wow, this is one example of the many phases of Cuba's evolution and architecture. The US influence here is almost funny, because according to our guide, Cuba's capitol rotunda is larger and wider than the one in Washington, DC. They also have a",
          "I mean, the building is beautiful, just like the Washington DC one, but since it is closed I'm not even sure if it is worth the visit.",
          "Closed until next year I believe = so covered in scaffolding. Pity it looked impressive. It's difficult to rest easy seeing such grand buildings and then the run down apartment blocks that the population live in.",
          "Beautiful, under renovation, good for a photo with many places for cocktails near by. best to visit on a walking tour.",
          "Modelled on an exact replica bar a few feet of the American White House. Restoration has been going on for many years and is nearly complete. It can be seen from all corners of Havana",
          "Very similar to the U.S. Capital, and still under construction. Carefully guarded and our access was limited.",
          "The building has been under construction for a while however it is great seeing the progress of the work. Love seeing the building renovated in the same classic style. Most tours drive you by the capital and point it out however after three visits I have yet to go inside.",
          "What a beautiful building in the heart of Havana. It is currently undergoing restoration and not open for another 2 years.",
          "It is a replica of the US Senate Capital in Washington DC. It is really amazing to learn about the Cuban history and appreciate the old architecture.",
          "Huge building, it's the symbol of the Habana city centre. It's amazing, we haven't been inside it but from outside we walked all around, the square is huge, the building has been restored a few times. It's the symbol of stateliness. The architecture is amazing, it's represents",
          "El Capitolio has been under repair for years, well the scaffolding has been up for years, don't know if they are actually doing a lot of repair work. I was so disappointed in El Capitolio and Havana, as it could be really special with a bit of maintenance and hard work. The",
          "You must stroll past and admire the architectural beauty of this government edifice. It has been restored to once again be the seat of the legislature.",
          "It's an amazing building but half of it is in reconstruction. You can have great pictures there and it's near everything.",
          "It took three years to build, and now five years to renovate. It is nothing special. Keep on walking.",
          "The building in the heart of Havana is truly impressive, built to be 1 meter larger and taller than its cousin in Washington. It stands proud and once its renovation is finished in a few years, it will be great to visit as well. The interior is also very impressive - just like",
          "We walked buy this building just to take a look as it resembles the US capital building. Interesting to see currently part of the facade is being repaired.",
          "Impressive looking building but under renovation during my visit in Nov/Dec 2017 so not sure what the inside looks like. Built in the 1920's and was the site of the Cuban Congress pre-Castro now is the Cuban Academy of Sciences but may revert to a Cuban House of Assembly when",
          "Although the Capitolio is closed due to restoration, I had the opportunity a few years ago to tour the Capitolio when it was open to the public. First, the cupola (dome) was NOT designed to mimic the U.S. capitol building's cupola. The cupola of the Capitolio was inspired after",
          "We had hoped to visit the former parliament building that resembles Americas Capitol in DC, but unfourtunatly it was still under renovation, so we had to be content with walking around the perimeter taking photos. Hopefully when it opens as the museum of Cuban Academy of",
          "This is a very impressive building! i dont know how long it has took so far it looks a while! but when this is finished it will be an amazing building that will house the government!",
          "A super beautiful building that looks magnificent on a sunny day. We were not able to enter because its under renovation. You are able to walk through the right side garden. Constant foot and car traffic in front of the building.",
          "Currently under renovation, the Capitol building is nonetheless an impressive building. You can\u2019t go inside, but the outside views are worth a photo, particularly when some of the 50\u2019s cars are passing in front.",
          "The building is beautiful. I liked most that its higher than and suits Havana definitely much better the US copy:)",
          "the design was to mimic the U.S. Capitol (this was built before 1959). Looks good but it only takes a minute to walk around and see. Not much else.",
          "This will be a beautiful building when the renovations are finished. As of Dec 2017 it is surrounded by scaffolding and has a construction fence around most of the building",
          "Under renovation for the last seven years,nothing is fast in government renovations. Similar to our capital. Just need a quick view.",
          "El Capitolio is such a beautiful building. I\ufe0f saw it for the first time during my 3 hour car tour of Havana. The next I\ufe0f walked to see it up close and it was absolutely stunning. It is currently closed due to construction. It is very similar to the building in Washington DC.",
          "El Capitolio is currently undergoing refurbishment but it is worth a walk/ drive past. There are 5ft railings but the beautiful dome of the building rises about these to dominate the skyline.",
          "we drove by this building on a guided tour in a 1954 red convertible. the highlight of this building was that it was a few feet taller than the capital building in Washington DC. an expression of Fidel Castro\u2019s own importance",
          "Part of the renaissance of historical Havana. Many beautiful buildings have been and are being restored here in an effort to celebrate the various stages and phases of Cuban history and not to destroy it or let it get run down.",
          "We drove past this building on our classic car tour of Havana and were quite impressed, it is under refurbishment but we still enjoyed the view.",
          "A good stop in such an eclectic city! I like history so this was a good fit! Did not have a lot of time, but was worth the stop in",
          "Beautiful building, being fully renovated now. Seat of Cuba's Parliament (ational Assembly). They are reopening new spaces inside the room until full reopening (which should take place this year/early 2018). definitely a must in Havana!",
          "The Capitol was in view from our hotel. It was beautiful to view, but was not visited during out visit due to the construction. It is beautiful to view at both day and night. However, I am unsure if you are able to enter while it is under construction or not. We did not",
          "capitolio is located in the middle of the city of havana. there are doing some renovations but you still have access where you can take pictures of the monument",
          "Was being renovated at the time of my visit, a huge building in havana, can't visit cuba without seing this.",
          "Truly a magnificent building in Havana. You can walk around the building and sometimes gain limited access. When finished and open it will again be one of the highlights of Havana.",
          "Was able to take some great photos, prior to renovation. Located very near/adjacent to Parque Central; which is the best place to see/hire a classic car ride ($25 - $30CUC negotiate). The park is also the place to catch the T1 Red Double Decker Havana City Tour Bus ($10CUC) and",
          "We drove and walked past the capital several times, it was fun to watch all the old American cars and horse drawn carriages near the park.",
          "Although still under works, the Havana Capitol is one of the city's landmarks and it's most suntuos building. Fortunately, along with the Capitol renovation all the area, the most attractive of the city is coming back to its glorious days.",
          "The Capitol is just an amazing structure in the center of Havana. It is a must to see when you visit Havana. You'll also find the most beautiful classic cars in the center of Havana.",
          "This is a huge complex, and gorgeous design all at the same time. The building is massive, eye-catching from a distance, and worth simply taking the time to walk around it's huge setting. It would be interesting to hear of the incredible investment the Cuban government has",
          "I gave it the score I gave it cause it's under construction right now. Perhaps by the time you go it won't be under construction",
          "We did not go inside & at our visit it was undergoing construction. It is modeled after our own Capital in the USA; so it looks very good.",
          "A familiar looking building at the gates of Havana centrum is El Capitolio. A building build during the roaring 20\u2019s and it\u2019s supposed to be a replica of the US White House. Fun fact: they intended to make it bigger than the original. Unfortunately for the Cubans, the architect",
          "This large structures command all of Havana. It is currently being restored- but still it is quite nice. Large- I could even see it from Hemingway's house, 10 miles outside of the city. Worth getting pics. Entry prohibited.",
          "It was incredible to see especially as we walked around to see the areas reconstructed and those still being repaired",
          "We could only walk around the building, but there is no possibility to enter. Partly under reconstruction. We would enjoy to have a guided tour inside. It is shocking how old, riuned buildings are just 100 meter behind the parlament",
          "Beautiful, magnificent building. We did not go inside, don\u2019t even know if we can. We did not see people entering/exiting at any of the times we walked by. However, it is worth visiting just to see the outside.",
          "Looks familiar, only rebuilt a tiny fraction taller, when it reopens someday. Obviously modeled after the Capital Building in Washington DC, it did house their own governmental Congress until the communist revolution of 1959 disbanded government with representation of the",
          "Unfortunately it was under construction - but it is amazing - even it is a Little bigger than the one in Washington!",
          "Nice place to wander around even if you have children . I went with both my 4 and 12 years old kids and we had a nice walk admiring the nice structure, not far from it it's the Tabaco factory store because it was moved if you want to see how they were done",
          "When I recently experiences Cuba I was overwhelemed by many aspects of the trip. The heat is unbareable, the air quality is horrific, the buildings (although highly photographic) are falling apart, there is garbage everywhere, and the food is quite hard to find.",
          "Very impressive from outside. The all complex is under restoration, we can't be sure when they will open it to the public again. It is difficult to miss it.",
          "With all the struggling in Cuba over the years, its amusing to see the government was irritated with passers-by making noise on a cobble stone street so they had all the cobblestone replaced with sanded wood tiles to make for a quiet pass.",
          "We were looking forward to revisiting the beautiful building. To say that we were a little disappointed that it was closed. But as they are renovating it we can accept that. It has just been added to the list for our next visit. It will be interesting to see what they have",
          "This building have been having renovations that are taking forever. I think the scaffolding has been up around the bell for at least 4 years. It looks like they are about half finished but I am not sure if tourists are allowed in yet.",
          "We only drove by and took took some pictures, but the building is impressive and it has a future.The building is similar to the US Capital Building and was constructed in the 1920s. It was the home of the Cuban Congress until the revolution in 1959. It is now the home of the",
          "looking great outside, this is a very impressive buliding and a landmark of Havana, you can see many old cars around",
          "This was closed down as a house for the elected representatives after the1959 revolution but is being refurbished and the plans are for it to be used again. No visitors allowed inside during the refurbishment but the building is pretty and impressive.",
          "El Capitolio looks like a smaller version of the US Capitol building in Washington DC. Very interesting architecture from the outside. I walked passed it on a Sunday and have no idea if the public is allowed in, or if tours are offered. Easy to walk to in Old Havana and a great",
          "You must take a tour where you also drive by the old Capitol building. So much history here to learn about. The building was under renovation when we were here but does not block to view of the greatness of the structure. Also, cool to see the old 50's & 60's cars that hang",
          "Adds so much to the charm and excitement of Old Havana. You can get there by walking 15 minutes from where the cruiseship docks. Its very large and beautiful building well worth seeing. We saw it several times during our three trips to Havana.",
          "I only viewed the exterior of the El Capitolio; it was under repair in areas, but still stunning. Having said that, I could only think of the history held within the walls ... the entire purpose of visiting such a stunning country.",
          "Ironically, given the long-standing hostility between the United States and Cuba, the Capitol building in Cuba is intended to look like the Capitol building in the United States! The building in Havana is under renovation now with scaffolding all around it, so at the moment,",
          "Was being refurbished while I was there, but still a beautiful building! Some of my favorite buildings in Havana were across the street, so the whole block was the perfect area to stop in for an espresso and to take some pictures (look out for bright, colorful buildings!)",
          "This is the original capital for the country of Cuba. It was the capital until the Revolution and now serves as a beautiful reminder of another era. If you are in the Old Havana area be sure to take a picture.It was under re-construction in May 2017 but still a great site to see.",
          "A flashback to the American influence on Havana and Cuba. Sits to the east of Old Habana with China Town just behind it. Well worth a visit. Plenty of classic cars around to get some great photos.",
          "El Capitolio was the seat of government in Cuba until after the Cuban Revolution. The building is currently being worked on, but is still significant.",
          "Very attractive government building modelled on the White House in Washington DC. There was no internal access so only available for viewing externally but wrth a look.",
          "Sadly, when we visited (mid May 2017) the Capital Building was still being refurbished so you couldn't enter the building or grounds The hugely impress facade though really is a centre piece of the city and will no doubt feature as a brilliant back drop to photos of old 1950's",
          "We stopped really quickly to take pictures and our driver said this is a replica of the Capitol building in DC. Sure did look like it! Good restaurant across the street... Los Nardos.",
          "Unfortunately when I traveled to Havana the Capital was closed for renovations. There was a fence around the property so you could not go inside. However, you can still check out the huge building. It is worth stopping by.",
          "I personally like it it's without doubts one of the most beautiful spots you can see in Havana...now it's hies through reconstruction.",
          "It is a beautiful piece of architercture modeled after the U.S. Capital in Washington D.C. They are currently doing maitenace on the dome.",
          "Located in Central Havana. The building is under construction, so you can't go inside. We were in the building a few years ago, it very nice. The restoration work should be completed soon. I hope!",
          "It's a little surreal since it's a replica of the US Capitol in Washington DC. They were doing a large-scale renovation to the outside when we were there but you could still appreciate the architecture. Very impressive and in an interesting part of town.",
          "But there are no tours or entrance to visitors. It's interesting to see. It would be nice if we could have entered.",
          "This building was surrounded by barriers as work was being carried out when we were in Havana. However you could see what a beautiful building it is. Wide street in front and lots of old cars in the vicinity.It is a very grand building.",
          "Busy down town with old bars and new international shopping opening up- some really cool old hotels- and if you look closely you can find some gems of music..",
          "Being under renovation it is currently not possible to go inside which was a bit disappointing, but it is still an absolute must-see while in Havana. There is some scaffolding around the top of it but the sheer scale of the building is very impressive. Once the restoration is",
          "i wish they pick up a pace and complete endless remodel of capitolio. i like show old cabriolets (taxi) lined up near by to check out. China town around the corner",
          "The outside looks a bit like the USA Washington DC capitol building but I am told the inside is different. It has been under repair for a few years and it looks like it is getting ready to be finished. Always lots of old vintage cars in the area. Entry inside is not allowed",
          "One can tell when this is finished it will be amazing ! It is currently under construction so it is not accessible at the moment - but it is stunning none the less.",
          "Very photogenic. Besides the capital building, the ballet is next to it. The park across the street had a long lineup of 50's cars.",
          "Such a grand regal building in a beautiful location where you can walk and drive right around it. Great photographic backdrop for the colourful parade of classic cars that crawl around it. All distances in Cuba are calculated from the centre point below the dome. Was closed when",
          "when visiting Havana make sure you take time to enjoy the wonderful Capital Building that is modeled after the Capital Building in the USA in Washington DC..It appears to be a bit larger and is under being updated and renovated..take time to walk around all sides and be sure to",
          "Amazing historic building, actually finishing the restauration... Thats the main spot were you can get clasical car tour around the havana. Would recomend getting a convertible for the best views.",
          "This is similar to our Capitol building with the exception being that this one is larger than our own. Didn't go inside, but if you find this you'll also find seemingly unlimited 50's vintage cars passing by one after another, some even appearing to be racing each",
          "Restoration almost complete, El Capitolio is once again looking impressive, as are many public buildings in Havana. We weren't able to get in but this is a well-known symbol of Havana so it's worth a walk round the exterior.",
          "This building is impossible to miss if you are touring Old Havana. It is modeled after the US Capitol bldg. and it is quite daunting especially next to the surrounding buildings and the area which is somewhat run down.",
          "Very beautiful building. It is the center, you can start from there your ride to discover Havana, in a old car is very nice, you get a good view of the city that way.",
          "Centrally located, like many buildings downtown it was under renovations. It is a replica of the White House and an amazing site as you walk by it. You can take all the pictures you want but unable to view from the inside.",
          "I don't think this is open to the public and it is going under extensive restoration at the moment including the surrounding area so maybe if you are visiting in the Autumn you maybe ok but at the moment it's a giant building site.",
          "El Capitolio is in a very central location. The building is the same of White House but a few meters higher which most of the Cubans are proud of. It was under restoration so that we could not find a chance to enter but it was about to finish.Behind El Capitolio you can find The",
          "The Capitol can only be seen from the outside. It is supposed to be a replica of the white house and is still under maintenance (they tried to get it ready for the visit of Obama but couldn't) due to things being stolen and sold to the black market (that's how Cuban people live,",
          "What a great building! it's of course modeled after the US capitol building, its very very close to it for sure. It could use a little remodeling I'm sure.",
          "We couldn't get over how much the Cuban Capital building looks like the Capitol in Washington DC. The DC one is in better shape, but the Cuban Government must have realized the impoirtance of the building and is refurbishing it. The government has a lot of work to do",
          "Currently closed for restoration (March 2017) Magnificent building which can be seen from many vantage points around Havana including from the sea when approaching by ship. Wish I could have viewed inside and its splendour.",
          "The capitolo was closed when we were there, which is why the three stars, we couldn't go inside. The outside is worth seeing on its own however and is near a central park in Habana.",
          "So disappointed it is still being renovated, apparently now won't be open until 2018 (sometime). However, the scaffolding and fences can't hide what will be a magnificent building and eventual home to the Cuban government. The building looks very like the Washington DC capital",
          "In over 3 years this very accurate copy of the Capitol in Washington was built by 5000 persons. Now under major renovation but a must see for all visitors.",
          "The Capital is beautiful but is under construction right now so we did not get to see much of it. Also, be aware that there are men around here who claim there is a \"Cigar Festival, one day only!\" and will lead you behind the Capital into a room where they seem to sell legit",
          "There is scaffolding around the building and it is not lit at night because it is undergoing renovations.",
          "They are changing the building from a museum back to being the capital of Cuba. They tour guide had to point out that it was a few feet taller then the Capital in Washington, DC",
          "This is undergoing renovation. It reportedly (via our tour guide) had a bunch of broken windows it was so beaten down. There is scaffolding around the structure and I'm sure it's going to look great when it's done. It was modeled after the US Congress, only the one",
          "Impressive structure and plaza. Very busy traffic wise. Events going on here and there and access to the hop on hop off tour bus.",
          "Loved the history and the culture of El Capitolio. Def a must see while visiting Cuba. Some may not enjoy the idea of learning history while on vacation, but it will be worth it. There are always cars parked right in front which make great photos!",
          "This is a beautiful structure and so well maintained - the sandblasting has restored original colors - one of the best in town and convenient to Old Havana and Parke Central.",
          "Stunning architecture, on both sides of the road. In front of the building is the row buildings probably most photographed in Havana.",
          "This building was obviously inspired by the Capitol building in Washington DC. It's not as big or as impressive, which you can tell despite the scaffolding. When we visited, it was being worked on and was behind a high wall. I'm sure it will be great when finished, as the",
          "Take a walk around this building, but don't get too close. This building is currently under restoration.",
          "Can only be seen over the top of a large fence. Do not expect to see it open until at least 2018. So not a place to add to the to do list at the present time.",
          "It's a good landmark that makes getting oriented in Havana easy but currently it's being renovated so you can only view it from the outside.",
          "Heard awesome reviews about how el capitolio must be seen, once the renovations are finished. will have to go back to see that. It was really useful for orientation tho. Interesting history and the dome still looked legit in pictures from a distance, so the scaffolding was",
          "It sure looks like it! the Capitol was under construction while I visited and I didn't go in but you can't miss this building, with central park across the street, the theater next door, and there are some perfect buildings that are very photogenic right in front of the capitol.",
          "While my photos were a bit obstructed by the construction barriers in front and the scaffolding on the dome, you can still get a sense of the lovely architecture of this classic building. It is situated in a nice area of Havana with a lot of old hotels that have been well",
          "To bad it is still being renovated for 10 years new now, but still a pretty awesome building which makes you think you are in Washington.",
          "Currently shrouded with scaffolding the exterior is being renovated. Very impressive building near Central Park.",
          "Havana's capitol building is quite impressive and is currently covered with scaffolding as it is being renovated.",
          "It's a beautiful building situated near Central Park. Under renovation and in use, we were unable to go inside although it's extremely impressive from the outside.",
          "Currently under construction but still very impressive. I guess I need to come back when the refurbishment has been finished.",
          "The capitol is still under renovation but about half of it is done and it is a beautiful building. Worth taking a walk and stopping for pictures.",
          "This building is strikingly similar to the US Capitol. In fact, it was modeled after it! It is said to be slightly higher. The interior is said to be beautiful but it has been under renovation for quite some time. I don't expect that it will open any time soon. When it",
          "Really nice to pass by. With a government place like this you can see Cuba had a lot of money back in the day. Really nice downtown.",
          "It looks surprisingly similar to the Capitol of a small country to the north of Cuba, but it's cool to see. Unfortunately, as others have mentioned, the construction impedes an actual visit, but it's one of the main structures and you can't miss seeing the dome as you're",
          "Well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the interior is currently closed for restoring and refitting as a centre of government so cannot be seen. Built by a Cuban dictator as recently as 1930 it copies in some respects the capitol building in Washington. Poor Havana",
          "El capitolio is a grand building, inspired by the White House, but MUCH larger. It was under restoration while I was there so they were not allowing tours at the moment, but it is a gorgeous building which gives good photos right next to the Teatro Nacional!",
          "the Capitolio building is all closed off at the moment for work to be carried out.... you can still get pictures... but has a lot of scaffolding around it. you will see this building as you are walking around the main square.",
          "Great to see from the street but note that it is no longer possible to visit inside. Still worth to discover this area.",
          "I did not go inside but from outside its huge. There are major repairs being done but it still very beautiful to look at and take pictures. At night when it's lit - the area looks amazing. I was also beautiful taking pictures when the old cars drove by it.",
          "Currently under construction and from what I was told you can not enter. IT looks exactly like the Washington Capital building only bigger! shame I couldnt get any good photos.",
          "The Capital build was under renovation. You could see the portion of the building that has been completed was very nice. Would have loved to be able to go in but the entrance was closed at the time of our visit. Should be beautiful when it is completed.",
          "Interesting location -- building is bigger and better (so they say) than US Capitol building -- didn't get to go inside because it was under major renovation -- but the theater next door.....Theater of Havana, was stunning!",
          "Center of Old Habana. Good landmark for taxis and staring your walk around the old city. Very busy and interesting.",
          "Interesting centerpeice of central Havana. Is being updated and remodeled as with a number of icons of Havana.",
          "It's very similar to the one in the states, but snaller. You can go and visit it and take a picture.",
          "This building, which was closed due to extensive renovatioin, was the seat of government in the late '20s comissioned by the dictator Geraldo Machado and modeled on the US Capital building in Washington and the Pantheon in Paris. It was built between 1926 and 1929 and remained",
          "Currently undergoing renovation that will soon be complete. No access to the interior at present but that will change shortly. Amazing looking building modelled on Capitol Hill in Washington DC.",
          "Very impressive from outside . Like in US. Nice copy. Now under renovation. Looks amazing. Worth seeing.",
          "Very impressive yet, I was quite annoyed because I did not know that this building is closed to the public for many years now.",
          "The El Capitolio is obviously patterned after the Washington DC Capitol. It is under renovation and covered in scaffolding (which it has been for the last four years.) It is still worth a look see from the outside. Very nice building.",
          "this is my 3rd time to visit the capitolio and is in repairs, you may not take good pictures there. Not accessible. also the views in front of this place are ugly old building no well maintained.",
          "Unfortunately, the Capital is currently under renovations and so there's not much to see or take pictures of due to all the scaffolding on the exterior.",
          "under construction, so we did not go inside and tour around, but this is a pretty impressive building and will look even better when the supporting structures are removed!",
          "As this is written the Capitol of Havana is under restauration - so not much to see for an eager tourist. But it's beautiful, impressive - and it's said to be a little larger than the Capitol of the United Steaks.",
          "The capital building looks like the one in Washington DC they are restoring it and it will look clean and sparkling",
          "I really recommend a visit to this historical place. It's a wonderful construction so I believe it's worth seeing it.",
          "We did not visit anything but the outside that was remarkable. It shows how big and strong was the self image of this little country some decades ago",
          "A very impressive building, especially with all the traffic passing by, the old cars. However, it was under construction during our visit, would love to see it without the construction site build around it.",
          "In old Havana this is the area that most people look at although it is very close to the Grand Theatre. This venue has a wonderful dome on it and the venue is currently being refurbished. We were told there is a diamond inside and all the measurements are measured from there",
          "This shot was from the rooftop of the Hotel Saratoga. Has bar, pool and lounge areas. Great for looking down at road with old cars. Wonderful location for sunset viewing and photographing. Just buy a drink or two if not staying there.",
          "Stunningly elegant, sophisticated place the El Capitolio in heart of Havana. Excellent building to see but now they have a renovation. Some classicist style in the vibrant, colourful Havana. You must see this and get amazed.",
          "The capital building was undergoing renovation while we were in Havana. It's exactlly like our capital, only larger.",
          "Worth seeing at any time of day or night (especially when it is floodlit). Currently under renovation and covered in scaffolding but that doesn't take away from the classic and beautiful architecture. The dome looks very much like the Washington DC capital building.",
          "Covered by scaffolding and large fence so was not able appreciate the beauty but it was lit up at night.",
          "Looks like they are going to have it ready in mid 2017. Worth a visit once the repairs are completed.",
          "Hard to say if it is a nice building because it was under renoavtion during our visit. Looks like a copy of the DC one though.",
          "Located on the western edge of Old Havana, where it merges into Central Havana, is the landmark building known as 'El Capitolio'. It was built in the 1920's to serve as the new presidential and governors palace and resembles the design of the Capitol building in Washington DC,",
          "This \"copy\" of our USA capital's dome is impressive. The neighborhood has some very impressive buildings.",
          "The building is absolutely impressive from the outside. However, it was a pity that we couldn't visit the inside since it was under restoration. We were told that some groups were allowed to enter, so if you are really interested in this building please try to arrange something",
          "actually it is a museum, represent the place where the government before the revolution was allocated, now is possible to access to almost all areas, it's one of the most iconic places of havana and Cuba, a must to visit.",
          "This Cuban White House is across from my hotel and really like to look at the buildings even tho under construction",
          "Lost in the streets, rain time, the time the sun and the view of the dome led us to the right path ... lovely building, we regret that the renewed and we could not get in ...",
          "Capitolio is the same to Havana as what Eiffel tower is to Paris! You have to see it! Your visit to Havana is not complete if you didn\u00b4t see it.",
          "The Capitolio clearly is a landmark building on the border between Havana Vieja (old town) and Havana Centro. Regrettably however currently closed for renovations. So the most we could do was go to the rooftop of the nearby Saratoga hotel and take a few snaps (and a swim!).",
          "The is a landmark in Havana. Looks a lot like the US capital. We used it as a beacon when we walked around Havana do we always knew where our hotel was.",
          "Looks like something from Washington but much more interesting buildings adjacent than in the US Capital. The place to see the best restored old cars in Cuba.",
          "Must be hard for the Cuban people to be reminded of their past quasi-colonial dependence of the US. Unfortunately it is under construction at the moment.",
          "Would've given a better review if it was open. By my pictures once can see that it's under renovation which is odd for anything in Cuba. Made for breathtaking pictures from any angle and for lots of history. If those walls could talk.",
          "Nice to take some cool pics. Stand across the street and see tons of old cars pass by. It is currently under construction so you wont be allowed inside.",
          "It is worth visiting El Capitolio just to see the size of it but as of Sept 2016 is still undergoing restoration so sadly you can't go in. Worth standing across the road to get a shot with one of the old cars going past in the foreground.",
          "The Capitol is undergoing major and expensive renovation and reconstruction (Sept 2016). It's a fabulous building and will look awesome when fully restored. The politicians will have a beautiful centre in the middle of the most beautiful area.",
          "It seems to be under construction for a while and might take another long while to finished. But you can already imaging how its going to be beautiful when finished",
          "El Capitolio was under renovation when I went, but from it looked absolutely beautiful. It is very large. You definitely can't miss it. It's centrally located so definitely head over to look at it.",
          "I may be wrong, but i've seen pictures for a couple of years now where the capitol building is under constant repair and covered in scaffolding. It was like this during my visit, walking round the rear of the building, there were windows removed and considerable work being done.",
          "This large white building can be seen from all over Havana. Shame it was being renovated when we visited but still beautiful. Just over the road from the old parliament building is a long taxi rank with vintage American cadillacs often seen in guide books.",
          "The El Capitolio is a unique display of the architecture and craftmenship built by true professional and dedicated people .The way it was built and the details is just awesome. The El Capitolio at present is under going very serious and extensive renovations of which is the",
          "This iconic building is the old Parliament house built in 1930s, under the era of USA intervention. So the outlook was really a copy from the White House in D.C. Washington. After revolution, it housed the Department of Science and Technology but now it was renovated to",
          "A distinct copy but a well constructed tribute to Cubas neighbor albeit a bit fractious. Well worth the photo opportunity however the dome is covered with scaffold at the moment so check first.",
          "No entrance, as it is under construction. It is an impressive building modeled after the US Capital.",
          "Current home of the Cuban Academy of Sciences and former seat of government until the 1959 revolution, the Capitolio has been under renovation for quite a few years purportedly in order to reassume its one-time status as home to the parliament. Until that time, it seems to be a",
          "Such a beautiful building. A must see if your in Havana then again, you can't miss it if you walk around Old Havana and its environs.",

          "In under restauration,can Not go inside, But THE building Outside still looks nice, need to have your picture taken It Is a must in your trip to Havana.",
          "Looks like exactly like it's counterpart in Washington DC. Very impressive and grand from the outside especially when you compare it to the condition of most buildings in Havana. Place was undergoing renovations so there is plenty of scaffolding up. As its in the old town worth",
          "In front of the building which was not open when I was there- under renovations I think. Outside are many 1960/70 cars beautifully restored Do take a look and chat to the owners who all speak English",
          "Modeled after the U.S. White House worth a visit or at least photo opt from outside It is being refurbished Near Habana Vieja, El Floridita, Parque Central, El prado and Teatro Alicia Alonso",
          "El Capitolio is being restored for quite a while, so it' s not possible to visit it, yet. However, if you choose to tour the nearby Havana Ballet Theatre you could get some very good close- ups of the Capitol. Both buildings are magnificent examples of Eclectic Spanish Colonial",
          "Very impresiv building. The Capitolio and streets around was under renovation. But despite of that it doesn't look like it is ruined. It is almost replica of the American Capitol. We couldn't get in until it get repair.",

          "We were in Havana for 10 days and this must have been the only one that looked like it was properly taken care of. We didn't go inside but walked around it a few times. It is also a good landmark when you wander of to the side streets and need to know where you are. The dome is",
          "This is exactly the same as in Washington DC but here in La Habana, it was under renovation but the building is very well preserved.",
          "Beautiful structure and undergoing renovation and should be a super star place when completed. Well worth a few pictures!",
          "stunning building but like so many in Havana needs looking after, you have this worry that if nothing happens some of them will collapse",

          "We found vert interesting than is almost a replica of the American Capitol, anyway is downtown and you can't miss it, worth taking your picture. By the way, if you are planning to buy cigars, there is an authentic store behind it.",
          "El Capitolio Nacional is similar to the Washington DC Capitol building but marginally taller and much richer in detail.It's covered in scaffolding at the moment,but will be even more stunning when the scaffold is eventually removed. All road distances from Havana are measured",
          "Sadly this (larger) replica of the US state capitol is undergoing major rebuilding. Only the right hand side is currently being used by the government.",
          "In English, Russian and Spanish the tour guide told about the number of civilians killed during friendly fire was about 50,000",

          "This was the seat of government and is now the Cuban Academy of Sciences. Visitors are welcome for a nominal fee and is worth the visit. An imposing building in Old Havana it is a centre point for tours in and around Havana. Its design is similar in construction to United States",
          "A must see if ever in Havana, stunning !!! The architecture is breathtaking,be aware that most of the tourist buses stop here so can get hectic !!!",

          "The place of the Cuban government is almost identical to that of the US government which has a strange irony about it, especially with embargo that was put in place. Fabulous looking and worth a look.",
          "The building is under renovation (May 2016) so we could not go inside but look forward to seeing the excellent work once it is complete. Resembles the Capitol in Washington DC.",

          "but note, under renovation when visiting in April 2016, so could not get in. It's certainly an elegant & grand looking building and one can see it from miles around if trying to gain a sense of direction (as this writer often does).",
          "When Fidel Castro assumed power in Cuba after the revolutions in 1959, American cars and parts were prevented from importing to the country. As a result, for the last almost 60 years, Cubans have played the role of Doctor Frankenstein, tinkling and repairing their old Fords,",

          "Since it is under restoration, I was unable to go inside. One can, however, walk around the exterior, and this is recommended to see the amazing amount of scaffolding set up for this purpose. It reminds me of our Capitol here in the U.S., but a bit smaller. Nonetheless, it is",

        "wiki": "Havana (; Spanish: La Habana [la a\u02c8\u03b2ana] (listen)) is the capital city, largest city, province, major port, and leading commercial center of Cuba. The city has a population of 2.1 million inhabitants, and it spans a total of 781.58 km2 (301.77 sq mi) \u2013 making it the largest city by area, the most populous city, and the fourth largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean region.The city of Havana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century and due to its strategic location it served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas, becoming a stopping point for treasure-laden Spanish galleons returning to Spain. The King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City in 1592. Walls as well as forts were built to protect the old city. The sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana's harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish\u2013American War.The city is the center of the Cuban government, and home to various ministries, headquarters of businesses and over 90 diplomatic offices. The current governor is Reinaldo Garc\u00eda Zapata of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC). In 2009, the city/province had the third highest income in the country.Contemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado and the newer suburban districts. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Mari melena, Guanabacoa and Antares. The sluggish Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.The city attracts over a million tourists annually; the Official Census for Havana reports that in 2010 the city was visited by 1,176,627 international tourists, a 20% increase from 2005. Old Havana was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is also noted for its history, culture, architecture and monuments. As typical of Cuba, Havana experiences a tropical climate.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nMost native settlements became the site of Spanish colonial cities retaining their original Ta\u00edno names.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Colonial period ===\n\n\n==== 16th century ====\n\nConquistador Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar founded Havana on August 25, 1515, on the southern coast of the island, near the present town of Surgidero de Bataban\u00f3, or more likely on the banks of the Mayabeque River close to Playa Mayabeque. All attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed. However, an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of this river.Between 1514 and 1519 the Spanish established at least two settlements on the north coast, one of them in La Chorrera, today in the neighborhoods of Vedado and Miramar, next to the Almendares River. The town that became Havana finally originated adjacent to what was then called Puerto de Carenas (literally, \"Careening Bay\"), in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, which now hosts Havana's harbor, warranted this change of location.\nP\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez gave Havana \u2013 the sixth town founded by the Spanish on Cuba \u2013 its name: San Crist\u00f3bal de la Habana. The name combines San Crist\u00f3bal, patron saint of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities, the island served as little more than a base for the Conquista of other lands.\nHavana began as a trading port, and suffered regular attacks by buccaneers, pirates, and French corsairs. The first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the French corsair Jacques de Sores in 1555. Such attacks convinced the Spanish Crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities \u2013 not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs, but also to exert more control over commerce with the West Indies, and to limit the extensive contrabando (black market) that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n of Seville (the crown-controlled trading house that held a monopoly on New World trade).\nShips from all over the New World carried products first to Havana, in order to be taken by the fleet to Spain. The thousands of ships gathered in the city's bay also fueled Havana's agriculture and manufacture, since they had to be supplied with food, water, and other products needed to traverse the ocean.\nOn December 20, 1592, King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City. Later on, the city would be officially designated as \"Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies\" by the Spanish Crown. In the meantime, efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued.\n\n\n==== 17th century ====\n\nHavana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly wood, combining various Iberian architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from Canarian characteristics.\nIn 1649, an epidemic of the often fatal Yellow fever brought from Cartagena in Colombia affected a third of the European population of Havana.\n\n\n==== 18th century ====\n\nBy the middle of the 18th century Havana had more than seventy thousand inhabitants, and was the third-largest city in the Americas, ranking behind Lima and Mexico City but ahead of Boston and New York. During the 18th century Havana was the most important of the Spanish ports because it had facilities where ships could be refitted and, by 1740, it had become Spain's largest and most active shipyard and only drydock in the New World.The city was captured by the British during the Seven Years' War. The episode began on June 6, 1762, when at dawn, a British fleet, comprising more than 50 ships and a combined force of over 11,000 men of the Royal Navy and Army, sailed into Cuban waters and made an amphibious landing east of Havana. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the Peace of Paris was signed by the three warring powers thus ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain Florida in exchange for the return of the city of Havana on to Spain.After regaining the city, the Spanish transformed Havana into the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Construction began on what was to become the Fortress of San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a, the third biggest Spanish fortification in the New World after Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal (the biggest) and Castillo San Felipe del Morro both in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On January 15, 1796, the remains of Christopher Columbus were transported to the island from Santo Domingo. They rested here until 1898, when they were transferred to Seville's Cathedral, after Spain's loss of Cuba.\n\n\n==== 19th century ====\n\nAs trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city. Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the Antilles.\nIn 1837, the first railroad was constructed, a 51 km (32 mi) stretch between Havana and Bejucal, which was used for transporting sugar from the valley of G\u00fcines to the harbor. With this, Cuba became the fifth country in the world to have a railroad, and the first Spanish-speaking country. Throughout the century, Havana was enriched by the construction of additional cultural facilities, such as the Tacon Teatre, one of the most luxurious in the world. The fact that slavery was legal in Cuba until 1886 led to Southern American interest, including a plan by the Knights of the Golden Circle to create a 'Golden Circle' with a 1200 mile-radius centered on Havana. After the Confederate States of America were defeated in the American Civil War in 1865, many former slaveholders continued to run plantations by moving to Havana.\nIn 1863, the city walls were knocked down so that the metropolis could be enlarged. At the end of the 19th century, Havana witnessed the final moments of Spanish colonialism in the Americas.\n\n\n=== Republican period and post-revolution ===\nThe 20th century began with Cuba, and therefore Havana, under occupation by the United States. The US occupation officially ended when Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma, first president of Cuba, took office on 20 May 1902.\nDuring the Republican Period, from 1902 to 1959, the city saw a new era of development. Cuba recovered from the devastation of war to become a well-off country, with the third largest middle class in the hemisphere. Apartment buildings to accommodate the new middle class, as well as mansions for the Cuban tycoons, were built at a fast pace.\n\nNumerous luxury hotels, casinos and nightclubs were constructed during the 1930s to serve Havana's burgeoning tourist industry, which greatly benefited by the U.S. prohibition on alcohol from 1920 to 1933. In the 1930s, organized crime characters were not unaware of Havana's nightclub and casino life, and they made their inroads in the city. Santo Trafficante Jr. took the roulette wheel at the Sans Souci Casino, Meyer Lansky directed the Hotel Habana Riviera, with Lucky Luciano at the Hotel Nacional Casino. At the time, Havana became an exotic capital of appeal and numerous activities ranging from marinas, grand prix car racing, musical shows, and parks. It was also the favorite destination of sex tourists.Havana achieved the title of being the Latin American city with the biggest middle class population per-capita, simultaneously accompanied by gambling and corruption where gangsters and stars were known to mix socially. During this era, Havana was generally producing more revenue than Las Vegas, Nevada, whose boom as a tourist destination began only after Havana's casinos closed in 1959. In 1958, about 300,000 American tourists visited the city.\nAfter the revolution of 1959, the new r\u00e9gime under Fidel Castro promised to improve social services, public housing, and official buildings. Nevertheless, after Castro's abrupt expropriation of all private property and industry (May 1959 onwards) under a strong communist model backed by the Soviet Union followed by the U.S. embargo, shortages that affected Cuba in general hit Havana especially hard. By 1966\u201368, the Cuban government had nationalized all privately owned business entities in Cuba, down to \"certain kinds of small retail forms of commerce\" (law No. 1076).\nA severe economic downturn occurred after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Soviet subsidies ended, representing billions of dollars which the Soviet Union had given the Cuban government. Many believed the revolutionary government would soon collapse, as happened to the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe. However, contrary to events in Europe, Cuba's communist government persevered through the 1990s and persists to this day.\nAfter many years of prohibition, the communist government increasingly turned to tourism for new financial revenue, and has allowed foreign investors to build new hotels and develop the hospitality industry. In Old Havana, effort has also gone into rebuilding for tourist purposes, and a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated.\nBut Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHavana lies on the northern coast of Cuba, south of the Florida Keys, where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbours: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atar\u00e9s. The sluggish Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.\nThere are low hills on which the city lies rise gently from the deep blue waters of the straits. A noteworthy elevation is the 200-foot-high (60-metre) limestone ridge that slopes up from the east and culminates in the heights of La Caba\u00f1a and El Morro, the sites of colonial fortifications overlooking the eastern bay. Another notable rise is the hill to the west that is occupied by the University of Havana and the Prince's Castle. Outside the city, higher hills rise on the west and east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHavana, like much of Cuba, has a tropical climate that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the trade winds and by the warm offshore currents. Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Havana has a tropical monsoon climate that closely borders on a tropical rainforest climate. Average temperatures range from 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) in January and February to 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in August. The temperature seldom drops below 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros. The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) in Bainoa, Mayabeque Province (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province). Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging 1,200 mm (47 in) annually. Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast, and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country.\nTornadoes can be somewhat rare in Cuba, however, on the evening of January 28, 2019, a very rare strong F4 tornado struck the eastern side of Havana, Cuba's capital city. The tornado caused extensive damage, destroying at least 90 homes, killing four people and injuring 195. By February 4, the death toll had increased to six, with 11 people still in critical condition.The table below lists temperature averages:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nContemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado, and the newer suburban districts. Old Havana, with its narrow streets and overhanging balconies, is the traditional centre of part of Havana's commerce, industry, and entertainment, as well as being a residential area.\nTo the west a newer section, centred on the uptown area known as Vedado, has become the rival of Old Havana for commercial activity and nightlife. The Capitolio Nacional building marks the beginning of Centro Habana, a working-class neighborhood that lies between Vedado and Old Havana. Barrio Chino and the Real Fabrica de Tabacos Partag\u00e1s, one of Cuba's oldest cigar factories is located in the area.A third Havana is that of the more affluent residential and industrial districts that spread out mostly to the west. Among these is Marianao, one of the newer parts of the city, dating mainly from the 1920s. Some of the suburban exclusivity was lost after the revolution, many of the suburban homes having been nationalized by the Cuban government to serve as schools, hospitals, and government offices. Several private country clubs were converted to public recreational centres. Miramar, located west of Vedado along the coast, remains Havana's exclusive area; mansions, foreign embassies, diplomatic residences, upscale shops, and facilities for wealthy foreigners are common in the area. The International School of Havana is located in the Miramar neighborhood.\nIn the 1980s many parts of Old Havana, including the Plaza de Armas, became part of a projected 35-year multimillion-dollar restoration project, for Cubans to appreciate their past and boost tourism. In the past ten years, with the assistance of foreign aid and under the support of local city historian Eusebio Leal Spengler, large parts of Habana Vieja have been renovated. The city is moving forward with their renovations, with most of the major plazas (Plaza Vieja, Plaza de la Catedral, Plaza de San Francisco and Plaza de Armas) and major tourist streets (Obispo and Mercaderes) near completion.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe city is divided into 15 municipalities \u2013 or boroughs, which are further subdivided into 105 wards (consejos populares). (Numbers refer to map).\n\nPlaya: Santa Fe, Siboney, Cubanac\u00e1n, Ampliaci\u00f3n Almendares, Miramar, Sierra, Ceiba, Buena Vista.\nPlaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n: El Carmelo, Vedado-Malec\u00f3n, Rampa, Pr\u00edncipe, Plaza, Nuevo Vedado-Puentes Grandes, Col\u00f3n-Nuevo Vedado, Vedado.\nCentro Habana: Cayo Hueso, Pueblo Nuevo, Los Sitios, Dragones, Col\u00f3n.\nLa Habana Vieja: Prado, Catedral, Plaza Vieja, Bel\u00e9n, San Isidro, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, Tallapiedra.\nRegla: Guaicanimar, Loma Modelo, Casablanca.\nLa Habana del Este: Camilo Cienfuegos, Coj\u00edmar, Guiteras, Alturas de Alamar, Alamar Este, Guanabo, Campo Florido, Alamar-Playa.\nGuanabacoa: Ma\u00f1ana-Habana Nueva, Villa I, Villa II, Chivas-Roble, Debeche-Nalon, Hata-Naranjo, Pe\u00f1alver-Bacuranao, Minas-Barreras.\nSan Miguel del Padr\u00f3n: Rocafort, Luyan\u00f3 Moderno, Diezmero, San Francisco de Paula, Dolores-Veracruz, Jacomino.\nDiez de Octubre: Luyan\u00f3, Jes\u00fas del Monte, Lawton, Vista Alegre, Goyle, Sevillano, La V\u00edbora, Santos Su\u00e1rez, Tamarindo.\nCerro: Latinoamericano, Pilar-Atares, Cerro, Las Ca\u00f1as, El Canal, Palatino, Armada.\nMarianao: CAI-Los \u00c1ngeles, Pocito-Palmas, Zamora-Cocosolo, Libertad, Pogoloti-Bel\u00e9n-Finlay, Santa Felicia.\nLa Lisa : Alturas de La Lisa, Balc\u00f3n Arimao, El Cano-Valle Grande-Bello 26 y Morado, Punta Brava, Arroyo Arenas, San Agust\u00edn, Versalles-Coronela.\nBoyeros: Santiago de Las Vegas, Nuevo Santiago, Boyeros, Wajay, Calabazar, Altahabana-Capdevila, Armada-Aldab\u00f3.\nArroyo Naranjo: Los Pinos, Poey, V\u00edbora Park, Mantilla, P\u00e1rraga, Calvario-Fraternidad, Guinera, El\u00e9ctrico, Managua, Callejas.\nCotorro: San Pedro-Centro Cotorro, Santa Maria del Rosario, Loter\u00eda, Cuatro Caminos, Magdalena-Torriente, Alberro.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nDue to Havana's almost five hundred-year existence, the city boasts some of the most diverse styles of architecture in the world, from castles built in the late 16th century to modernist present-day high-rises.\nThe present condition of many buildings in Havana has deteriorated since the 1959 Revolution. Numerous collapses have resulted in injuries and deaths due to a lack of maintenance and crumbling structures.\nNeoclassicalNeoclassism was introduced into the city in the 1840s, at the time including Gas public lighting in 1848 and the railroad in 1837. In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style. Many wealthy Habaneros took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the Aldama Palace built in 1844. This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.\nIn 1925 Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, the head of urban planning in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the great depression in 1929. During the first decades of the 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the Vedado district (begun in 1859). This area features a number of set back well-proportioned buildings in the Neoclassical style\n\nColonial and Baroque\nRiches were brought from the colonialists into and through Havana as it was a key transshipment point between the new world and old world. As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana (1558\u20131577) designed by Battista Antonelli and the Castillo del Morro (1589\u20131630). This sits at the entrance of Havana Bay and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.\nOld Havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767, becoming the new neighbourhood of Centro Habana. The influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in Havana's colonial architecture, with a diverse range of Moorish architecture, Spanish, Italian, Greek and Roman. The San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary (18th century) is a good example of early Spanish influenced architecture. The Havana cathedral (1748\u20131777) dominating the Plaza de la Catedral (1749) is the best example of Cuban Baroque. Surrounding it are the former palaces of the Count de Casa-Bayona (1720\u20131746) Marquis de Arcos (1746) and the Marquis de Aguas Claras (1751\u20131775).\n\nArt Deco and EclecticThe first echoes of the Art Deco movement in Havana started in 1927, in the residential area of Miramar. The Edificio Bacardi, (1930) is thought to be the best example of Art-deco architecture in the city and the first tall Art Deco building as well, followed by the Hotel Nacional de Cuba (1930) and the L\u00f3pez Serrano Building in 1932. The FOCSA Building was finished in 1956. The year 1928 marked the beginning of the reaction against the Spanish Renaissance style architecture. Art Deco started in the lush and wealthy suburbs of Miramar, Marianao, and Vedado.The city's eclectic architectural sights begins in Centro Habana. The Central Railway Terminal (1912), and the Museum of the Revolution (1920) are example of Eclectic architecture.\n\nModernism\nMany high-rise office buildings, and apartment complexes, along with some hotels built in the 1950s dramatically altered the skyline. Modernism, therefore, transformed much of the city and is known its individual buildings of high quality rather than its larger key buildings. Examples of the latter are Habana Libre (1958), which before the revolution was the Havana Hilton Hotel and La Rampa movie theater (1955).\nFamous architects such as Walter Gropius, Richard Neutra and Oscar Niemeyer all passed through the city, while strong influences can be seen in Havana at this time from Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The Edificio Focsa (1956) represents Havana's economic dominance at the time. This 35-story complex was conceived and based on Corbusian ideas of a self-contained city within a city. It contained 400 apartments, garages, a school, a supermarket, and restaurant on the top floor. This was the tallest concrete structure in the world at the time (using no steel frame) and the ultimate symbol of luxury and excess. The Havana Riviera Hotel (1957) designed by Igor B. Polevitzky, a twenty-one-story edifice, when it opened, the Riviera was the largest purpose-built casino-hotel in Cuba or anywhere in the world, outside Las Vegas (the Havana Hilton (1958) surpassed its size a year later).\n\n\n=== Landmarks and historical centres ===\nHabana Vieja: contains the core of the original city of Havana. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nPlaza Vieja: a plaza in Old Havana, it was the site of executions, processions, bullfights, and fiestas.\nFortress San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a, a fortress located on the east side of the Havana bay, La Caba\u00f1a is the most impressive fortress from colonial times, particularly its walls constructed at the end of the 18th century.\nEl Capitolio Nacional: built in 1929 as the Senate and House of Representatives, the colossal building is recognizable by its dome which dominates the city's skyline. Inside stands the third largest indoor statue in the world, La Estatua de la Rep\u00fablica. Nowadays, the Cuban Academy of Sciences headquarters and the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural (the National Museum of Natural History) has its venue within the building and contains the largest natural history collection in the country.\nEl Morro Castle: is a fortress guarding the entrance to Havana bay; Morro Castle was built because of the threat to the harbor from pirates.\nFortress San Salvador de la Punta: a small fortress built in the 16th century, at the western entry point to the Havana harbour, it played a crucial role in the defence of Havana during the initial centuries of colonisation. It houses some twenty old guns and military antiques.\nChrist of Havana: Havana's 20-meter (66 ft) marble statue of Christ (1958) blesses the city from the east hillside of the bay, much like the famous Cristo Redentor in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe Great Theatre of Havana: is an opera house famous particularly for the National Ballet of Cuba, it sometimes hosts performances by the National Opera. The theater is also known as concert hall, Garc\u00eda Lorca, the biggest in Cuba.\nThe Malecon/Sea wall: is the avenue that runs along the north coast of the city, beside the seawall. The Malec\u00f3n is the most popular avenue of Havana, it is known for its sunsets.\nHotel Nacional de Cuba: an Art Deco National Hotel famous in the 1950s as a gambling and entertainment complex.\nMuseo de la Revoluci\u00f3n: located in the former Presidential Palace, with the yacht Granma on display behind the museum.\nNecr\u00f3polis Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n: a cemetery and open-air museum, it is one of the most famous cemeteries in Latin America, known for its beauty and magnificence. The cemetery was built in 1876 and has nearly one million tombs. Some gravestones are decorated with sculpture by Ramos Blancos, among others.\n\t\t\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\n\n== Culture ==\nHavana, by far the leading cultural centre of the country, offers a wide variety of features that range from museums, palaces, public squares, avenues, churches, fortresses (including the largest fortified complex in the Americas dating from the 16th through 18th centuries), ballet and from art and musical festivals to exhibitions of technology. The restoration of Old Havana offered a number of new attractions, including a museum to house relics of the Cuban revolution. The government placed special emphasis on cultural activities, many of which are free or involve only a minimal charge.\n\n\n=== Old Havana ===\n\nOld Havana, (La Habana Vieja in Spanish), contains the core of the original city of Havana, with more than 2,000 hectares it exhibits almost all the Western architectural styles seen in the New World. La Habana Vieja was founded by the Spanish in 1519 in the natural harbor of the Bay of Havana. It became a stopping point for the treasure laden Spanish Galleons on the crossing between the New World and the Old World. In the 17th century, it was one of the main shipbuilding centers. The city was built in baroque and neoclassic style.\nMany buildings have fallen in ruin but a number are being restored. The narrow streets of Old Havana contain many buildings, accounting for perhaps as many as one-third of the approximately 3,000 buildings found in Old Havana.Old Havana is the ancient city formed from the port, the official center and the Plaza de Armas. Alejo Carpentier called Old Havana the place \"de las columnas\" (of the columns). The Cuban government is taking many steps to preserve and to restore Old Havana, through the Office of the city historian, directed by Eusebio Leal. Old Havana and its fortifications were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982. The beauty of Old Havana City attracts millions of tourists each year who enjoy its rich old culture and folk music.\n\nIn spring 2015, the largest open-air art exhibition ever in Cuba took in front of the basilica on the Plaza San Francisco de Asis: Over eight weeks the United Buddy Bears visited Havana. United Buddy Bears exhibitions are part of a non-commercial and non-profit project. The main aim is to promote the idea of tolerance and mutual understanding between countries, cultures and religions and to communicate a vision of a future peaceful world.\n\n\n=== Barrio Chino ===\n\nBarrio Chino was once Latin America's largest and most vibrant Chinese community, incorporated into the city by the early part of the 20th century. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers were brought in by Spanish settlers from Guangdong, Fujian, Hong Kong, and Macau via Manila, Philippines starting in the mid-19th century to replace or work alongside African slaves. After completing 8-year contracts, many Chinese immigrants settled permanently in Havana.\nThe first 206 Chinese-born arrived in Havana on June 3, 1847. The neighborhood was booming with Chinese restaurants, laundries, banks, pharmacies, theaters and several Chinese-language newspapers, the neighborhood comprised 44 square blocks during its prime. The heart of Barrio Chino is on el Cuchillo de Zanja (or The Zanja Canal). The strip is a pedestrian-only street adorned with many red lanterns, dancing red paper dragons and other Chinese cultural designs, there is a great number of restaurants that serve a full spectrum of Chinese dishes \u2013 unfortunately that 'spectrum' is said by many not to be related to real Chinese cuisine.\nThe district has two paifang (Chinese arches), the larger one located on Calle Dragones. China donated the materials in the late 1990s. It has a well defined written welcoming sign in Chinese and Spanish. The smaller arch is located on Zanja strip. The Cuban's Chinese boom ended when Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution seized private businesses, sending tens of thousands of business-minded Chinese fleeing, mainly to the United States. Descendants are now making efforts to preserve and revive the culture.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\n\nThe National Museum of Fine Arts (Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes) is a Fine Arts museum that exhibits Cuban and International art collections. The museum houses one of the largest collections of paintings and sculpture from Latin America and is the largest in the Caribbean region. Under the Cuban Ministry of Culture, it occupies two locations in the vicinity of Havana's Paseo del Prado, these are the Palace of Fine Arts, devoted to Cuban art and the Palace of the Asturian Center, dedicated to universal art. Its artistic heritage is made up of over 45,000 pieces.The Museum of the Revolution (Museo de la Revoluci\u00f3n), designed in Havana by Cuban architect Carlos Maruri, and the Belgian Paul Belau, who came up with an eclectic design, harmoniously combines Spanish, French and German architectural elements. The museum was the Presidential Palace in the capital; today, its displays and documents outline Cuba's history from the beginning of the neo-colonial period. The building was the site of the Havana Presidential Palace Attack (1957) by the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil.\nThe neo-classical mansion of the Countess of Revilla de Camargo, today it is the Museum of Decorative Arts (Museo de Artes Decorativas), known as the \"small French Palace of Havana\" built between 1924 and 1927, it was designed in Paris inspired in French Renaissance. The museum has been exhibiting more than 33,000 works dating from the reigns of Louis XV, Louis XVI, and Napoleon III; as well as 16th to 20th century Oriental pieces, among many other treasures. The Museum has ten permanent exhibit halls. Among them are prominent porcelain articles from the factories in S\u00e8vres and Chantilly, France; Meissen, Germany; and Wedgwood, England, as well as Chinese from the Qianlong Emperor period and Japanese from the Imari. The furniture comes from St\u00e9phane Boudin, Jean Henri Riesener and several others.\nSeveral museums in Old Havana houses furniture, silverware, pottery, glass and other items from the colonial period. One of these is the Palacio de los Capitanes Generales, where Spanish governors once lived. The Casa de Africa presents another aspect of Cuba's history, it houses a large collection of Afro-Cuban religious artifacts.\nOther museums in the city include Casa de los \u00c1rabes (House of Arabs) and the Casa de Asia (House of Asia) with Middle and Far Eastern collections. Havana's Museo del Automobil has an impressive collection of vehicles dating back to a 1905 Cadillac.\nWhile most museums of Havana are situated in Old Havana, few of them can also be found in Vedado. In total, Havana has around 50 museums, including the National Museum of Music; the Museum of Dance and Rum; the Cigar Museum; the Napoleonic, Colonial and Oricha Museums; the Museum of Anthropology; the Ernest Hemingway Museum; the Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Monument; the Aircraft Museum (Museo del Aire).\nThere are also museums of Natural Sciences, the City, Archeology, Gold-and-Silverwork, Perfume, Pharmaceuticals, Sports, Numismatics, and Weapons.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nFacing Havana's Central Park is the baroque Great Theatre of Havana, a prominent theatre built in 1837. It is now home of the National Ballet of Cuba and the International Ballet Festival of Havana, one of the oldest in the New World. The fa\u00e7ade of the building is adorned with a stone and marble statue. There are also sculptural pieces by Giuseppe Moretti, representing allegories depicting benevolence, education, music and theatre. The principal theatre is the Garc\u00eda Lorca Auditorium, with seats for 1,500 and balconies. Glories of its rich history; the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso sang, the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova danced, and the French Sarah Bernhardt acted.\nOther important theatres in the city includes the National Theater of Cuba, housed in a huge modern building located in Plaza de la Revolucion, decorated with works by Cuban artists. The National Theater includes two main theatre stages, the Avellaneda Auditorium and the Covarrubias Auditorium, as well as a smaller theatre workshop space on the ninth floor.\nThe Karl Marx Theater with its large auditorium have a seating capacity of 5,500 spectators, is generally used for concerts and other events, it is also one of the venues for the annual Havana Film Festival.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nHavana Film Festival (The International Festival of New Latin American cinema)\nInternational Ballet Festival of Havana\nHavana International Jazz Festival\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHavana attracts over a million tourists annually, the Official Census for Havana reports that in 2010 the city was visited by 1,176,627 international tourists, a 20% increase from 2005.\nThe city has long been a popular attraction for tourists. Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean. The influx was due in large part to Cuba's proximity to the United States, where restrictive prohibition on alcohol and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.\nWith the deterioration of Cuba \u2013 United States relations and the imposition of the trade embargo on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and Fidel Castro in particular, initially opposed any considerable development of the tourism industry, linking it to the debauchery and criminal activities of times past. In the late 1970s, however, Castro changed his stance and, in 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code which opened a number of sectors, tourism included, to foreign capital.\nThrough the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as Cubanacan), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).\nHavana has also been a popular health tourism destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including eye-surgery, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, and orthopaedics. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for retinitis pigmentosa, often known as night blindness, has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nHavana has a diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism.\nThe city's economy first developed on the basis of its location, which made it one of the early great trade centres in the New World. Sugar and a flourishing slave trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro's government to spread Cuba's industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the centre of much of the nation's industry.\nThe traditional sugar industry, upon which the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centred elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous Habanos cigars. Although the harbours of Cienfuegos and Matanzas, in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.\nIn 2000, nearly 89% of the city's officially recorded labour force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country's highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba's primary economic source.Havana's economy is still in flux, despite Raul Castro's embrace of free enterprise in 2011. Though there was an uptick in small businesses in 2011, many have since gone out of business, due to lack of business and income on the part of the local residents, whose salaries average $20 per month.\n\n\n=== Commerce and finance ===\nAfter the Revolution, Cuba's traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system. In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.\nIn Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities. Banking as well is also under state control, and the National Bank of Cuba, headquartered in Havana, is the control center of the Cuban economy. Its branches in some cases occupy buildings that were in pre-revolutionary times the offices of Cuban or foreign banks.\nIn the late 1990s Vedado, located along the atlantic waterfront, started to represent the principal commercial area. It was developed extensively between 1930 and 1960, when Havana developed as a major destination for U.S. tourists; high-rise hotels, casinos, restaurants, and upscale commercial establishments, many reflecting the art deco style.Vedado is today Havana's financial district, the main banks, airline companies offices, shops, most businesses headquarters, numerous high-rise apartments and hotels, are located in the area. The University of Havana is located in Vedado.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nBy the end of 2012 official Census, 19.1% of the population of Cuba lived in Havana. According to the census of 2012, the population was 2,106,146 The city has an average life expectancy of 76.81 years at birth. In 2009, there were 1,924 people living with HIV/AIDS in the city, 78.9% of these are men, and 21.1% being women.According to the 2012 official census (the Cuban census and similar studies use the term \"skin colour\" instead of \"race\").\nWhite: 58.4%, (Spanish descent were most common)\nMestizo or Mulatto (mixed race): 26.4%\nBlack: 15.2%\nAsian: 0.2%There are few mestizos in contrast to many other Latin American countries, because the Native Indian population was virtually wiped out by Eurasian diseases in colonial times.Havana agglomeration grew rapidly during the first half of the 20th century reaching 1 million inhabitants in the 1943 census. The con-urbanization expanded over the Havana municipality borders into neighbor municipalities of Marianao, Regla and Guanabacoa. Starting from the 1980s, the city's population is growing slowly as a result of balanced development policies, low birth rate, its relatively high rate of emigration abroad, and controlled domestic migration. Because of the city and country's low birth rate and high life expectancy, its age structure is similar to a developed country, with Havana having an even higher proportion of elderly than the country as a whole.The Cuban government controls the movement of people into Havana on the grounds that the Havana metropolitan area (home to nearly 20% of the country's population) is overstretched in terms of land use, water, electricity, transportation, and other elements of the urban infrastructure. There is a population of internal migrants to Havana nicknamed \"palestinos\" (Palestinians), sometimes considered a racist term, these mostly hail from the eastern region of Oriente.The city's significant minority of Chinese, mostly Cantonese ancestors, were brought in the mid-19th century by Spanish settlers via the Philippines with work contracts and after completing 8-year contracts many Chinese immigrants settled permanently in Havana. Before the revolution the Chinese population counted to over 200,000, today, Chinese ancestors could count up to 100,000. Chinese born/ native Chinese (mostly Cantonese as well) are around 400 presently. There are some 3,000 Russians living in the city; as reported by the Russian Embassy in Havana, most are women married to Cubans who had studied in the Soviet Union. Havana also shelters other non-Cuban population of an unknown size. There is a population of several thousand North African teen and pre-teen refugees.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nRoman Catholics form the largest religious group in Havana. Havana is one of the three Metropolitan sees on the island (the others being Camag\u00fcey and Santiago), with two suffragan bishoprics: Matanzas and Pinar del R\u00edo. Its patron saint is San Cristobal (Saint Christopher), to whom the cathedral is devoted. it also has a minor basilica, Bas\u00edlica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Caridad del Cobre and two other national shrines, Jes\u00fas Nazareno del Rescate and San L\u00e1zaro (El Rinc\u00f3n). It received papal visits from three successive supreme pontiffs: Pope John Paul II (January 1998), Pope Benedict XVI (March 2012) and Pope Francis (September 2015).\nThe Jewish community in Havana has reduced after the Revolution from once having embraced more than 15,000 Jews, many of whom had fled Nazi persecution and subsequently left Cuba to Miami or moved to Israel after Castro took to power in 1959. The city once had five synagogues, but only three remain (one Orthodox, and two Conservative: one Conservative Ashkenazi and one Conservative Sephardic), Beth Shalom Grand Synagogue is one of them and another that is a hybrid of all 3 put together. In February 2007 the New York Times estimated that there were about 1,500 known Jews living in Havana.\n\n\n=== Poverty and slums ===\nThe years after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the city, and Cuba in general have suffered decades of economic deterioration. The national government does not have an official definition of poverty. The government researchers argue that \"poverty\" in most commonly accepted meanings does not really exist in Cuba, but rather that there is a sector of the population that can be described as \"at risk\" or \"vulnerable\" using internationally accepted measures.The generic term \"slum\" is seldom used in Cuba, substandard housing is described: housing type, housing conditions, building materials, and settlement type. The National Housing Institute considers units in solares (a large inner-city mansion or older hotel or boarding house subdivided into rooms, sometimes with over 60 families) and shanty towns to be the \"precarious housing stock\" and tracks their number. Most slum units are concentrated in the inner-city municipalities of Old Havana and Centro Habana, as well as such neighbourhoods as Atar\u00e9s in Regla. People living in slums have access to the same education, health care, job opportunities and social security as those who live in formerly privileged neighbourhoods. Shanty towns are scattered throughout the city except for in a few central areas.Over 9% of Havana's population live in cuarter\u00eda (solares, ciudadela), 3.3% in shanty towns, and 0.3% in refugee shelters. This does not include an estimate of the number of people living in housing in \"fair\" or \"poor\" condition because in many cases these units do not necessarily constitute slum housing but rather are basically sound dwellings needing repairs. According to Instituto Nacional de Vivienda (National Housing Institute) official figures, in 2001, 64% of Havana's 586,768 units were considered in \"good\" condition, up from 50% in 1990. Some 20% were in \"fair\" condition and 16% in \"poor\" condition. Partial or total building collapses are not uncommon, although the number had been cut in half by the end of the 1990s as the worst units disappeared and others were repaired. Buildings in Old Havana and Centro Habana are especially exposed to the elements: high humidity, the corrosive effects of salt spray from proximity to the coast, and occasional flooding.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Urban buses ===\nThe city's public buses is carried out by the Empresa Provincial de Transporte de La Habana (EPTH).\n\nMetrobus\nThe Red Principal, previously known as MetroBus, serves the inner-city urban area, with a maximum distance of 20 km (12 mi). The Red Principal consists of 17 main lines, identified with the letter \"P\" with long-distance routes. The stops are usually 800\u20131,000 metres (2,600\u20133,300 ft), with frequent buses in peak hours, about every 10 minutes. It uses large modern articulated buses, such as the Chinese-made Yutong brand, Russian-made Liaz, or MAZ of Belarus.\n\nRed AlimentadoraThe Red Alimentadora, known as the feeder line, connects the adjacent towns and cities in the metropolitan area with the city center, with a maximum distance of 40 km (25 mi). This division has one of the most used and largest urban bus fleets in the country, its fleet is made up of mostly new Chinese Yutong buses. In 2008 the Cuban government invested millions of dollars for the acquisition of 1,500 new Yutong urban buses.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nHavana is served by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport. The Airport lies about 11 kilometres (7 mi) south of the city center, in the municipality of Boyeros, and is the main hub for the country's flag carrier Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n. The airport is Cuba's main international and domestic gateway, it connects Havana with the rest of the Caribbean, North, Central and South America, Europe and one destination in Africa.\nThe city is also served by Playa Baracoa Airport which is small airport to the west of city used for some domestic flights, primarily Aerogaviota.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nHavana has a network of suburban, interurban and long-distance rail lines. The railways are nationalised and run by the FFCC (Ferrocarriles de Cuba \u2013 Railways of Cuba). The FFCC connects Havana with all the provinces of Cuba. The main railway stations are: Central Rail Station, La Coubre Rail Station, Casablanca Station, and Estaci\u00f3n de Tulip\u00e1n.\nIn 2004 the annual passenger volume was some 11 million, but demand is estimated at two-and-a-half to three times this value, with the busiest route being between Havana and Santiago de Cuba, some 836 kilometres (519 mi) apart by rail. In 2000 the Union de Ferrocarriles de Cuba bought French first class airconditioned coaches.\nIn the 1980s there were plans for a Metro system in Havana similar to Moscow's, as a result of the Soviet Union influence in Cuba at the time. The studies of geology and finance made by Cuban, Czech and Soviet specialists were already well advanced in the 1980s. The Cuban press showed the construction project and the course route, linking municipalities and neighborhoods in the capital. In the late 1980s the project had already begun, each mile of track was worth a million dollars at the time, but with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 the project was later dropped.\n\n\n=== Interurban (tram) ===\nAn interurban line, known as the Hershey Electric Railway, built in 1917 runs from Casablanca (across the harbor from Old Havana) to Hershey and on to Matanzas.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\nHavana operated a tram system until 1952, which began as a horsecar system, Ferro Carril Urbano de la Habana in 1858, merged with rival coach operator in 1863 as Empresa del Ferro-Carril Urbano y Omnibus de La Habana and later electrified in 1900 under new foreign owners as Havana Electric Railway Company. Ridership decline resulted in bankruptcy in 1950 with new owner Autobus Modernos SA abandoning systems in favor of buses and sold the remaining cars were sold to Matanzas in 1952.\n\n\n=== Ferry ===\nFerries connect Old Havana with Regla and Casablanca, leaving every 10\u201315 minutes from Muelle Luz (at the foot of Santa Clara Street). The fare is CUP 0.20\u00a2.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nThe city's road network is quite extensive, and has broad avenues, main streets and major access roads to the city such as the Autopista Nacional (A1), Carretera Central and Via Blanca. The road network has been under construction and growth since the colonial era, is currently undergoing a major deterioration due to low maintenance.Motorways (autopistas) include:\n\nA1 \u2013 Autopista Nacional, from Havana to Santa Clara and Sancti Spiritus, with additional short sections near Santiago and Guantanamo\nA4 \u2013 Autopista Este-Oeste, from Havana to Pinar del R\u00edo\nVia Blanca, to Matanzas and Varadero\nHavana ring road (Spanish: Primer anillo), which starts at a tunnel under the entrance to Havana Harbor\nAutopista del Mediodia, from Havana to San Antonio de los Ba\u00f1os\nan autopista from Havana to Melena del Sur\nan autopista from Havana to Mariel\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe current governor is Reinaldo Garc\u00eda Zapata, he was elected on January, 2020.The city is administered by a city-provincial council, with a governor as chief administrative officer, thus Havana functions as both a city and a province. The city has little autonomy and is dependent upon the national government, particularly, for much of its budgetary and overall political direction.\n\nThe national government is headquartered in Havana and plays an extremely visible role in the city's life. Moreover, the all-embracing authority of many national institutions has led to a declining role for the city government, which, nevertheless, still provides much of the essential services and has competences in education, health care, city public transport, garbage collection, small industry, agriculture, etc.\nVoters elect delegates to Municipal Assemblies in competitive elections. There is only one political party, the Communist Party, but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates in turn elect members of the Provincial Assembly, which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president functions as the Mayor. There are direct elections for deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People's Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local municipal delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. In addition, there is participation from \"mass organisations\" and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People's Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.\nHavana city borders are contiguous with the Mayabeque Province on the south and east and to Artemisa Province on the west, since former La Habana Province (rural) was abolished in 2010.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nThe national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba. The schools are of varying quality and education is free and compulsory at all levels except higher learning, which is also free.\nThe University of Havana, located in the Vedado section of Havana, was established in 1728 and was regarded as a leading institution of higher learning in the Western Hemisphere. Soon after the Revolution, the university, as well as all other educational institutions, were nationalized. Since then several other universities have opened, like the Higher Learning Polytechnic Institute Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverr\u00eda where the vast majority of today's Cuban engineers are taught.\nThe Cuban National Ballet School with 4,350 students is one of the largest ballet schools in the world and the most prestigious ballet school in Cuba.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAll Cuban residents have free access to health care in hospitals, local polyclinics, and neighborhood family doctors who serve on average 170 families each, which is one of the highest doctor-to-patient ratio in the world. However, the health system has suffered from shortages of supplies, equipment and medications caused by ending of the Soviet Union subsidies in the early 1990s and the US embargo. Nevertheless, Havana's infant mortality rate in 2009 was 4.9 per 1,000 live births, 5.12 in the country as a whole, which is lower than many developed nations, and the lowest in the developing world. Administration of the health care system for the nation is centered largely in Havana. Hospitals in Havana are run by the national government, and citizens are assigned hospitals and clinics to which they may go for attention.\n\n\n=== Services ===\nUtility services are under the control of several nationalized state enterprises that have developed since the Cuban revolution. Water, electricity, and sewage service are administered in this fashion. Electricity is supplied by generators that are fueled with oil. Much of the original power plant installations, which operated before the Revolutionary government assumed control, have become somewhat outdated. Electrical blackouts occurred, prompting the national government in 1986 to allocate the equivalent of $25,000,000 to modernize the electrical system.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nMany Cubans are avid sports fans who particularly favour baseball. Havana's team in the Cuban National Series is Industriales. FCBA. The city has several large sports stadiums, the largest one is the Estadio Latinoamericano. Admission to sporting events is generally free, and impromptu games are played in neighborhoods throughout the city. Social clubs at the beaches provide facilities for water sports and include restaurants and dance halls.\n\nHavana was host to the 11th Pan American Games in 1991. Stadiums and facilities for this were built in the relatively unpopulated eastern suburbs.\nHavana was host to the 1992 IAAF World Cup in Athletics.\nHavana was an applicant to host the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Olympics, but was not shortlisted.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nNotable people originally from Havana:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Diplomatic offices ===\nAs Cuba's national capital and seat of government, Havana hosts 88 embassies (including the papal apostolic nunciature, traditionally manned by a titular archbishop). \nFurthermore, there are 11 consulates(-general) and a trade office.\nEmbassies\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nHavana is twinned with:\n\nNote: Some of the city's municipalities are also twinned to small cities or districts of other big cities, for details see their respective articles.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nHavana is a primary location and the first city able to be visited in the 2013 video game Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Also Driver 2. The game portrays the city as it existed during the Golden Age of Piracy. In the summer 2017, a Cuban-born American singer, Camila Cabello, released the song named \"Havana\" and became a worldwide hit. Havana has also become a playable map in the video game Overwatch (video game) released in 2016 for the PvE mode, \"Storm Rising\". It later became a map for competitive play.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLargest cities in the Americas\nList of cities in the Caribbean\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial tourism website",

        "wiki": "Old Havana (Spanish: La Habana Vieja) is the city-center (downtown) and one of the 15 municipalities (or boroughs) forming Havana, Cuba. It has the second highest population density in the city and contains the core of the original city of Havana. The positions of the original Havana city walls are the modern boundaries of Old Havana.\nOld Havana is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHavana was founded by the Spanish in 1519 in the natural harbor of the Bay of Havana. It became a stopping point for the treasure laden Spanish galleons on the crossing between the New World and the Old World. In the 17th century, it was one of the main shipbuilding centers. The city was built in baroque and neoclassical styles. Many buildings have fallen into ruin in the latter half of the 20th century, but a number are being restored. The narrow streets of Old Havana contain many buildings, accounting for perhaps as many as one-third of the approximately 3,000 buildings found in Old Havana. It is the ancient city formed from the port, the official center and the Plaza de Armas. \nIn 1555, Old Havana was destroyed and burned by the French corsair Jacques de Sores. The pirate had taken Havana easily, plundering the city and burning much of it to the ground. After limiting the scarce defenders, De Sores left without obtaining the enormous wealth that he was hoping to find in Havana. The city remained devastated and set on fire. Since the incident, the Spanish brought soldiers and started building fortresses and walls to protect the city. Castillo de la Real Fuerza was the first fortress built; initiated in 1558, the construction was overseen by the engineer Bartolom\u00e9 Sanchez.\nOld Havana resembles Cadiz and Tenerife. Alejo Carpentier called it \"de las columnas\"(of the columns), but it could also be named for the gateways, the revoco, the deterioration and the rescue, the intimacy, the shade, the cool, the courtyards... In her there are all the big ancient monuments, the forts, the convents and churches, the palaces, the alleys, the arcade, the human density. The Cuban State has undertaken enormous efforts to preserve and to restore Old Havana through the efforts of the Office of the Historian of the City, directed by Eusebio Leal.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe Malec\u00f3n is the avenue that runs along the seawall at the northern shore of Havana, from Old Havana to the Almendares River.\nThe Paseo del Prado, Havana is the street that forms the western edge of Old Havana, being its boundary with Centro Habana.\nCastillo del Morro,  picturesque fortress guarding the entrance to Havana bay.  The construction of the castle Los Tres Reyes del Morro owed to the step along in Havana of the English pirate Sir Francis Drake. The king of Spain arranged its construction on a big stone which was known by the name of El Morro. He sent the field master Juan de Texeda, accompanied of the military engineer Battista Antonelli, who came to Havana in 1587 and began the task at once.\nLa Caba\u00f1a fortress, located on the east side of the Havana Bay.  The most impressive fortress of the Spanish colony was La Caba\u00f1a. It impresses with its 18th-century walls, constructed at the same time as El Morro.  Every night at 9 p.m., some soldiers dressed in suits of the epoch shoot from her the \u201cel ca\u00f1onazo de las nueve\u201d, (gunshot of the nine). It went off every day to warn of the closing of the doors of the wall that surrounded the city.\nSan Salvador de la Punta Fortress, In the shore opposite to the Castle of El Morro, at the beginning of the curve of El Malecon, there rises the fortress of San Salvador de la Punta, of minor architectural dimensions. It was constructed in 1590, and in 1629 the Chapter of Havana decided, to defend better the port, to join her in the night with the El Morro by using a thick chain that prevented the entry of enemy ships.\nCastillo de la Real Fuerza, The fortress or (lit.) Castle of the Royal Army is another big monument that closes the Plaza de las Armas. It was the first big fortification of the city, initiated in 1558 on the ruins of an ancient fortress. In the same year, the Crown sent to Cuba the engineer Bartolom\u00e9 Sanchez, supervised by 14 official and main stonemasons in order to reconstruct the castle, which had been set fire and destroyed by the French corsair Jacques de Sores.\nCatedral de San Crist\u00f3bal, the most prominent building on the Plaza de la Catedral.  The Cathedral was raised on the chapel after 1748 by order of the bishop from Salamanca, Jose Felipe de Trespalacios. It is one of the most beautiful and sober churches of the American baroque.\nNational Capitol, styled after the Panth\u00e9on (Paris), looking similar to the U.S. Capitol.\nGalician Center, Central Park, The Galician Center, of neobarroque style was established as a social club of the Galician emigrants between 1907 and 1914. Built on the Theater Tacon (nowadays Great Theater of Havana), it was open during the Carnival of 1838 with five masked dances.\nPlaza de Armas \u2013 the main touristic square.  The origin of its name is military, since from the end of the 16th century the ceremonies and the military events took place here.\nGran Teatro de la Havana, the Great Theater of Havana is famous, particularly for the acclaimed National Ballet of Cuba and its founder Alicia Alonso. It sometimes performs the National Opera. The theater is also known as concert hall, Garcia Lorca, the biggest in Cuba.\nThe Museum of the Revolution, located in the former Presidential Palace, with the boat Granma on display in front of the museum.\nSan Francisco de la Habana Basilica, Habana Vieja, The set of church and convent of San Francisco de Asis, byline of the year 1608, and it was reconstructed in 1737.\n\n\n== Threats ==\n\nIn 2008, Hurricane Ike destroyed many structures in Old Havana, overturning years of conservation work directed at the iconic antiquated buildings of the area.  Not only did it damage historic buildings, but it forced many of Old Havana's residents to flee for safety.  The threats that hurricanes pose adds to an already tenuous state for Old Havana's many historic buildings.  Age, decay, and neglect combine with natural factors in a complex set of threats to the long-term preservation of this historic old town.\n\n\n== UNESCO Heritage site ==\nIn 1982, La Habana Vieja was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List. A safeguarding campaign was launched a year later to restore the authentic character of the buildings.\n\n\n=== Photo gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nOld Havana is twinned with the following cities:\n\n Viveiro, Spain\n Cartagena, Colombia\n Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Mexico\n Sintra, Portugal, since 2000\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHavana\nWorld Heritage Site\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLinks to sites with casa particular and travel info on Old Havana\nHotels in Old Havana Travel and tourism\nOld Havana Restoring Hidden Treasured Murals by Vanessa Bauza, Sun Sentinel, April 11, 2004\nParticular houses in Old Havana Cheap accommodation in Old Habana",

          "Old cars everywhere, amazing architecture, nice people, Havana is great to disconnect and wonder around.",

          "My destination pick to Varadero was to take a tour to Havana, long drive but well worth it. Not to disappoint. The architecture was beautiful and the old cars were a thrill. My only complaint was the heat Nov 9th, made it unpleasant to walk around.",

          "A beautiful city untouched by modern vandalism architecture. Other cities around the world, and especially in the UK will look at Havana and realise they used to have that before they knocked it all down for the modern crap you now see. Take a walk around and you will be in",

        "wiki": "Havana (; Spanish: La Habana [la a\u02c8\u03b2ana] (listen)) is the capital city, largest city, province, major port, and leading commercial center of Cuba. The city has a population of 2.1 million inhabitants, and it spans a total of 781.58 km2 (301.77 sq mi) \u2013 making it the largest city by area, the most populous city, and the fourth largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean region.The city of Havana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century and due to its strategic location it served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas, becoming a stopping point for treasure-laden Spanish galleons returning to Spain. The King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City in 1592. Walls as well as forts were built to protect the old city. The sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana's harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish\u2013American War.The city is the center of the Cuban government, and home to various ministries, headquarters of businesses and over 90 diplomatic offices. The current governor is Reinaldo Garc\u00eda Zapata of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC). In 2009, the city/province had the third highest income in the country.Contemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado and the newer suburban districts. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Mari melena, Guanabacoa and Antares. The sluggish Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.The city attracts over a million tourists annually; the Official Census for Havana reports that in 2010 the city was visited by 1,176,627 international tourists, a 20% increase from 2005. Old Havana was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is also noted for its history, culture, architecture and monuments. As typical of Cuba, Havana experiences a tropical climate.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nMost native settlements became the site of Spanish colonial cities retaining their original Ta\u00edno names.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Colonial period ===\n\n\n==== 16th century ====\n\nConquistador Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar founded Havana on August 25, 1515, on the southern coast of the island, near the present town of Surgidero de Bataban\u00f3, or more likely on the banks of the Mayabeque River close to Playa Mayabeque. All attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed. However, an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of this river.Between 1514 and 1519 the Spanish established at least two settlements on the north coast, one of them in La Chorrera, today in the neighborhoods of Vedado and Miramar, next to the Almendares River. The town that became Havana finally originated adjacent to what was then called Puerto de Carenas (literally, \"Careening Bay\"), in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, which now hosts Havana's harbor, warranted this change of location.\nP\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez gave Havana \u2013 the sixth town founded by the Spanish on Cuba \u2013 its name: San Crist\u00f3bal de la Habana. The name combines San Crist\u00f3bal, patron saint of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities, the island served as little more than a base for the Conquista of other lands.\nHavana began as a trading port, and suffered regular attacks by buccaneers, pirates, and French corsairs. The first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the French corsair Jacques de Sores in 1555. Such attacks convinced the Spanish Crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities \u2013 not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs, but also to exert more control over commerce with the West Indies, and to limit the extensive contrabando (black market) that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n of Seville (the crown-controlled trading house that held a monopoly on New World trade).\nShips from all over the New World carried products first to Havana, in order to be taken by the fleet to Spain. The thousands of ships gathered in the city's bay also fueled Havana's agriculture and manufacture, since they had to be supplied with food, water, and other products needed to traverse the ocean.\nOn December 20, 1592, King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City. Later on, the city would be officially designated as \"Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies\" by the Spanish Crown. In the meantime, efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued.\n\n\n==== 17th century ====\n\nHavana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly wood, combining various Iberian architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from Canarian characteristics.\nIn 1649, an epidemic of the often fatal Yellow fever brought from Cartagena in Colombia affected a third of the European population of Havana.\n\n\n==== 18th century ====\n\nBy the middle of the 18th century Havana had more than seventy thousand inhabitants, and was the third-largest city in the Americas, ranking behind Lima and Mexico City but ahead of Boston and New York. During the 18th century Havana was the most important of the Spanish ports because it had facilities where ships could be refitted and, by 1740, it had become Spain's largest and most active shipyard and only drydock in the New World.The city was captured by the British during the Seven Years' War. The episode began on June 6, 1762, when at dawn, a British fleet, comprising more than 50 ships and a combined force of over 11,000 men of the Royal Navy and Army, sailed into Cuban waters and made an amphibious landing east of Havana. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the Peace of Paris was signed by the three warring powers thus ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain Florida in exchange for the return of the city of Havana on to Spain.After regaining the city, the Spanish transformed Havana into the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Construction began on what was to become the Fortress of San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a, the third biggest Spanish fortification in the New World after Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal (the biggest) and Castillo San Felipe del Morro both in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On January 15, 1796, the remains of Christopher Columbus were transported to the island from Santo Domingo. They rested here until 1898, when they were transferred to Seville's Cathedral, after Spain's loss of Cuba.\n\n\n==== 19th century ====\n\nAs trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city. Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the Antilles.\nIn 1837, the first railroad was constructed, a 51 km (32 mi) stretch between Havana and Bejucal, which was used for transporting sugar from the valley of G\u00fcines to the harbor. With this, Cuba became the fifth country in the world to have a railroad, and the first Spanish-speaking country. Throughout the century, Havana was enriched by the construction of additional cultural facilities, such as the Tacon Teatre, one of the most luxurious in the world. The fact that slavery was legal in Cuba until 1886 led to Southern American interest, including a plan by the Knights of the Golden Circle to create a 'Golden Circle' with a 1200 mile-radius centered on Havana. After the Confederate States of America were defeated in the American Civil War in 1865, many former slaveholders continued to run plantations by moving to Havana.\nIn 1863, the city walls were knocked down so that the metropolis could be enlarged. At the end of the 19th century, Havana witnessed the final moments of Spanish colonialism in the Americas.\n\n\n=== Republican period and post-revolution ===\nThe 20th century began with Cuba, and therefore Havana, under occupation by the United States. The US occupation officially ended when Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma, first president of Cuba, took office on 20 May 1902.\nDuring the Republican Period, from 1902 to 1959, the city saw a new era of development. Cuba recovered from the devastation of war to become a well-off country, with the third largest middle class in the hemisphere. Apartment buildings to accommodate the new middle class, as well as mansions for the Cuban tycoons, were built at a fast pace.\n\nNumerous luxury hotels, casinos and nightclubs were constructed during the 1930s to serve Havana's burgeoning tourist industry, which greatly benefited by the U.S. prohibition on alcohol from 1920 to 1933. In the 1930s, organized crime characters were not unaware of Havana's nightclub and casino life, and they made their inroads in the city. Santo Trafficante Jr. took the roulette wheel at the Sans Souci Casino, Meyer Lansky directed the Hotel Habana Riviera, with Lucky Luciano at the Hotel Nacional Casino. At the time, Havana became an exotic capital of appeal and numerous activities ranging from marinas, grand prix car racing, musical shows, and parks. It was also the favorite destination of sex tourists.Havana achieved the title of being the Latin American city with the biggest middle class population per-capita, simultaneously accompanied by gambling and corruption where gangsters and stars were known to mix socially. During this era, Havana was generally producing more revenue than Las Vegas, Nevada, whose boom as a tourist destination began only after Havana's casinos closed in 1959. In 1958, about 300,000 American tourists visited the city.\nAfter the revolution of 1959, the new r\u00e9gime under Fidel Castro promised to improve social services, public housing, and official buildings. Nevertheless, after Castro's abrupt expropriation of all private property and industry (May 1959 onwards) under a strong communist model backed by the Soviet Union followed by the U.S. embargo, shortages that affected Cuba in general hit Havana especially hard. By 1966\u201368, the Cuban government had nationalized all privately owned business entities in Cuba, down to \"certain kinds of small retail forms of commerce\" (law No. 1076).\nA severe economic downturn occurred after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Soviet subsidies ended, representing billions of dollars which the Soviet Union had given the Cuban government. Many believed the revolutionary government would soon collapse, as happened to the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe. However, contrary to events in Europe, Cuba's communist government persevered through the 1990s and persists to this day.\nAfter many years of prohibition, the communist government increasingly turned to tourism for new financial revenue, and has allowed foreign investors to build new hotels and develop the hospitality industry. In Old Havana, effort has also gone into rebuilding for tourist purposes, and a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated.\nBut Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHavana lies on the northern coast of Cuba, south of the Florida Keys, where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbours: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atar\u00e9s. The sluggish Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.\nThere are low hills on which the city lies rise gently from the deep blue waters of the straits. A noteworthy elevation is the 200-foot-high (60-metre) limestone ridge that slopes up from the east and culminates in the heights of La Caba\u00f1a and El Morro, the sites of colonial fortifications overlooking the eastern bay. Another notable rise is the hill to the west that is occupied by the University of Havana and the Prince's Castle. Outside the city, higher hills rise on the west and east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHavana, like much of Cuba, has a tropical climate that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the trade winds and by the warm offshore currents. Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Havana has a tropical monsoon climate that closely borders on a tropical rainforest climate. Average temperatures range from 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) in January and February to 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in August. The temperature seldom drops below 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros. The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) in Bainoa, Mayabeque Province (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province). Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging 1,200 mm (47 in) annually. Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast, and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country.\nTornadoes can be somewhat rare in Cuba, however, on the evening of January 28, 2019, a very rare strong F4 tornado struck the eastern side of Havana, Cuba's capital city. The tornado caused extensive damage, destroying at least 90 homes, killing four people and injuring 195. By February 4, the death toll had increased to six, with 11 people still in critical condition.The table below lists temperature averages:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nContemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado, and the newer suburban districts. Old Havana, with its narrow streets and overhanging balconies, is the traditional centre of part of Havana's commerce, industry, and entertainment, as well as being a residential area.\nTo the west a newer section, centred on the uptown area known as Vedado, has become the rival of Old Havana for commercial activity and nightlife. The Capitolio Nacional building marks the beginning of Centro Habana, a working-class neighborhood that lies between Vedado and Old Havana. Barrio Chino and the Real Fabrica de Tabacos Partag\u00e1s, one of Cuba's oldest cigar factories is located in the area.A third Havana is that of the more affluent residential and industrial districts that spread out mostly to the west. Among these is Marianao, one of the newer parts of the city, dating mainly from the 1920s. Some of the suburban exclusivity was lost after the revolution, many of the suburban homes having been nationalized by the Cuban government to serve as schools, hospitals, and government offices. Several private country clubs were converted to public recreational centres. Miramar, located west of Vedado along the coast, remains Havana's exclusive area; mansions, foreign embassies, diplomatic residences, upscale shops, and facilities for wealthy foreigners are common in the area. The International School of Havana is located in the Miramar neighborhood.\nIn the 1980s many parts of Old Havana, including the Plaza de Armas, became part of a projected 35-year multimillion-dollar restoration project, for Cubans to appreciate their past and boost tourism. In the past ten years, with the assistance of foreign aid and under the support of local city historian Eusebio Leal Spengler, large parts of Habana Vieja have been renovated. The city is moving forward with their renovations, with most of the major plazas (Plaza Vieja, Plaza de la Catedral, Plaza de San Francisco and Plaza de Armas) and major tourist streets (Obispo and Mercaderes) near completion.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe city is divided into 15 municipalities \u2013 or boroughs, which are further subdivided into 105 wards (consejos populares).

Numerous collapses have resulted in injuries and deaths due to a lack of maintenance and crumbling structures.\nNeoclassicalNeoclassism was introduced into the city in the 1840s, at the time including Gas public lighting in 1848 and the railroad in 1837. In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style. Many wealthy Habaneros took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the Aldama Palace built in 1844. This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.\nIn 1925 Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, the head of urban planning in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the great depression in 1929. During the first decades of the 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the Vedado district (begun in 1859). This area features a number of set back well-proportioned buildings in the Neoclassical style\n\nColonial and Baroque\nRiches were brought from the colonialists into and through Havana as it was a key transshipment point between the new world and old world. As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana (1558\u20131577) designed by Battista Antonelli and the Castillo del Morro (1589\u20131630). This sits at the entrance of Havana Bay and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.\nOld Havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767, becoming the new neighbourhood of Centro Habana. The influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in Havana's colonial architecture, with a diverse range of Moorish architecture, Spanish, Italian, Greek and Roman. The San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary (18th century) is a good example of early Spanish influenced architecture. The Havana cathedral (1748\u20131777) dominating the Plaza de la Catedral (1749) is the best example of Cuban Baroque. Surrounding it are the former palaces of the Count de Casa-Bayona (1720\u20131746) Marquis de Arcos (1746) and the Marquis de Aguas Claras (1751\u20131775).\n\nArt Deco and EclecticThe first echoes of the Art Deco movement in Havana started in 1927, in the residential area of Miramar. The Edificio Bacardi, (1930) is thought to be the best example of Art-deco architecture in the city and the first tall Art Deco building as well, followed by the Hotel Nacional de Cuba (1930) and the L\u00f3pez Serrano Building in 1932. The FOCSA Building was finished in 1956. The year 1928 marked the beginning of the reaction against the Spanish Renaissance style architecture. Art Deco started in the lush and wealthy suburbs of Miramar, Marianao, and Vedado.The city's eclectic architectural sights begins in Centro Habana. The Central Railway Terminal (1912), and the Museum of the Revolution (1920) are example of Eclectic architecture.\n\nModernism\nMany high-rise office buildings, and apartment complexes, along with some hotels built in the 1950s dramatically altered the skyline. Modernism, therefore, transformed much of the city and is known its individual buildings of high quality rather than its larger key buildings. Examples of the latter are Habana Libre (1958), which before the revolution was the Havana Hilton Hotel and La Rampa movie theater (1955).\nFamous architects such as Walter Gropius, Richard Neutra and Oscar Niemeyer all passed through the city, while strong influences can be seen in Havana at this time from Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The Edificio Focsa (1956) represents Havana's economic dominance at the time. This 35-story complex was conceived and based on Corbusian ideas of a self-contained city within a city. It contained 400 apartments, garages, a school, a supermarket, and restaurant on the top floor. This was the tallest concrete structure in the world at the time (using no steel frame) and the ultimate symbol of luxury and excess. The Havana Riviera Hotel (1957) designed by Igor B. Polevitzky, a twenty-one-story edifice, when it opened, the Riviera was the largest purpose-built casino-hotel in Cuba or anywhere in the world, outside Las Vegas (the Havana Hilton (1958) surpassed its size a year later).\n\n\n=== Landmarks and historical centres ===\nHabana Vieja: contains the core of the original city of Havana. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nPlaza Vieja: a plaza in Old Havana, it was the site of executions, processions, bullfights, and fiestas.\nFortress San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a, a fortress located on the east side of the Havana bay, La Caba\u00f1a is the most impressive fortress from colonial times, particularly its walls constructed at the end of the 18th century.\nEl Capitolio Nacional: built in 1929 as the Senate and House of Representatives, the colossal building is recognizable by its dome which dominates the city's skyline. Inside stands the third largest indoor statue in the world, La Estatua de la Rep\u00fablica. Nowadays, the Cuban Academy of Sciences headquarters and the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural (the National Museum of Natural History) has its venue within the building and contains the largest natural history collection in the country.\nEl Morro Castle: is a fortress guarding the entrance to Havana bay; Morro Castle was built because of the threat to the harbor from pirates.\nFortress San Salvador de la Punta: a small fortress built in the 16th century, at the western entry point to the Havana harbour, it played a crucial role in the defence of Havana during the initial centuries of colonisation. It houses some twenty old guns and military antiques.\nChrist of Havana: Havana's 20-meter (66 ft) marble statue of Christ (1958) blesses the city from the east hillside of the bay, much like the famous Cristo Redentor in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe Great Theatre of Havana: is an opera house famous particularly for the National Ballet of Cuba, it sometimes hosts performances by the National Opera. The theater is also known as concert hall, Garc\u00eda Lorca, the biggest in Cuba.\nThe Malecon/Sea wall: is the avenue that runs along the north coast of the city, beside the seawall. The Malec\u00f3n is the most popular avenue of Havana, it is known for its sunsets.\nHotel Nacional de Cuba: an Art Deco National Hotel famous in the 1950s as a gambling and entertainment complex.\nMuseo de la Revoluci\u00f3n: located in the former Presidential Palace, with the yacht Granma on display behind the museum.\nNecr\u00f3polis Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n: a cemetery and open-air museum, it is one of the most famous cemeteries in Latin America, known for its beauty and magnificence. The cemetery was built in 1876 and has nearly one million tombs. Some gravestones are decorated with sculpture by Ramos Blancos, among others.\n\t\t\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\n\n== Culture ==\nHavana, by far the leading cultural centre of the country, offers a wide variety of features that range from museums, palaces, public squares, avenues, churches, fortresses (including the largest fortified complex in the Americas dating from the 16th through 18th centuries), ballet and from art and musical festivals to exhibitions of technology. The restoration of Old Havana offered a number of new attractions, including a museum to house relics of the Cuban revolution. The government placed special emphasis on cultural activities, many of which are free or involve only a minimal charge.\n\n\n=== Old Havana ===\n\nOld Havana, (La Habana Vieja in Spanish), contains the core of the original city of Havana, with more than 2,000 hectares it exhibits almost all the Western architectural styles seen in the New World. La Habana Vieja was founded by the Spanish in 1519 in the natural harbor of the Bay of Havana. It became a stopping point for the treasure laden Spanish Galleons on the crossing between the New World and the Old World. In the 17th century, it was one of the main shipbuilding centers. The city was built in baroque and neoclassic style.\nMany buildings have fallen in ruin but a number are being restored. The narrow streets of Old Havana contain many buildings, accounting for perhaps as many as one-third of the approximately 3,000 buildings found in Old Havana.Old Havana is the ancient city formed from the port, the official center and the Plaza de Armas. Alejo Carpentier called Old Havana the place \"de las columnas\" (of the columns). The Cuban government is taking many steps to preserve and to restore Old Havana, through the Office of the city historian, directed by Eusebio Leal. Old Havana and its fortifications were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982. The beauty of Old Havana City attracts millions of tourists each year who enjoy its rich old culture and folk music.\n\nIn spring 2015, the largest open-air art exhibition ever in Cuba took in front of the basilica on the Plaza San Francisco de Asis: Over eight weeks the United Buddy Bears visited Havana. United Buddy Bears exhibitions are part of a non-commercial and non-profit project. The main aim is to promote the idea of tolerance and mutual understanding between countries, cultures and religions and to communicate a vision of a future peaceful world.\n\n\n=== Barrio Chino ===\n\nBarrio Chino was once Latin America's largest and most vibrant Chinese community, incorporated into the city by the early part of the 20th century. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers were brought in by Spanish settlers from Guangdong, Fujian, Hong Kong, and Macau via Manila, Philippines starting in the mid-19th century to replace or work alongside African slaves. After completing 8-year contracts, many Chinese immigrants settled permanently in Havana.\nThe first 206 Chinese-born arrived in Havana on June 3, 1847. The neighborhood was booming with Chinese restaurants, laundries, banks, pharmacies, theaters and several Chinese-language newspapers, the neighborhood comprised 44 square blocks during its prime. The heart of Barrio Chino is on el Cuchillo de Zanja (or The Zanja Canal). The strip is a pedestrian-only street adorned with many red lanterns, dancing red paper dragons and other Chinese cultural designs, there is a great number of restaurants that serve a full spectrum of Chinese dishes \u2013 unfortunately that 'spectrum' is said by many not to be related to real Chinese cuisine.\nThe district has two paifang (Chinese arches), the larger one located on Calle Dragones. China donated the materials in the late 1990s. It has a well defined written welcoming sign in Chinese and Spanish. The smaller arch is located on Zanja strip. The Cuban's Chinese boom ended when Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution seized private businesses, sending tens of thousands of business-minded Chinese fleeing, mainly to the United States. Descendants are now making efforts to preserve and revive the culture.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\n\nThe National Museum of Fine Arts (Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes) is a Fine Arts museum that exhibits Cuban and International art collections. The museum houses one of the largest collections of paintings and sculpture from Latin America and is the largest in the Caribbean region. Under the Cuban Ministry of Culture, it occupies two locations in the vicinity of Havana's Paseo del Prado, these are the Palace of Fine Arts, devoted to Cuban art and the Palace of the Asturian Center, dedicated to universal art. Its artistic heritage is made up of over 45,000 pieces.The Museum of the Revolution (Museo de la Revoluci\u00f3n), designed in Havana by Cuban architect Carlos Maruri, and the Belgian Paul Belau, who came up with an eclectic design, harmoniously combines Spanish, French and German architectural elements. The museum was the Presidential Palace in the capital; today, its displays and documents outline Cuba's history from the beginning of the neo-colonial period. The building was the site of the Havana Presidential Palace Attack (1957) by the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil.\nThe neo-classical mansion of the Countess of Revilla de Camargo, today it is the Museum of Decorative Arts (Museo de Artes Decorativas), known as the \"small French Palace of Havana\" built between 1924 and 1927, it was designed in Paris inspired in French Renaissance. The museum has been exhibiting more than 33,000 works dating from the reigns of Louis XV, Louis XVI, and Napoleon III; as well as 16th to 20th century Oriental pieces, among many other treasures. The Museum has ten permanent exhibit halls. Among them are prominent porcelain articles from the factories in S\u00e8vres and Chantilly, France; Meissen, Germany; and Wedgwood, England, as well as Chinese from the Qianlong Emperor period and Japanese from the Imari. The furniture comes from St\u00e9phane Boudin, Jean Henri Riesener and several others.\nSeveral museums in Old Havana houses furniture, silverware, pottery, glass and other items from the colonial period. One of these is the Palacio de los Capitanes Generales, where Spanish governors once lived. The Casa de Africa presents another aspect of Cuba's history, it houses a large collection of Afro-Cuban religious artifacts.\nOther museums in the city include Casa de los \u00c1rabes (House of Arabs) and the Casa de Asia (House of Asia) with Middle and Far Eastern collections. Havana's Museo del Automobil has an impressive collection of vehicles dating back to a 1905 Cadillac.\nWhile most museums of Havana are situated in Old Havana, few of them can also be found in Vedado. In total, Havana has around 50 museums, including the National Museum of Music; the Museum of Dance and Rum; the Cigar Museum; the Napoleonic, Colonial and Oricha Museums; the Museum of Anthropology; the Ernest Hemingway Museum; the Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Monument; the Aircraft Museum (Museo del Aire).\nThere are also museums of Natural Sciences, the City, Archeology, Gold-and-Silverwork, Perfume, Pharmaceuticals, Sports, Numismatics, and Weapons.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nFacing Havana's Central Park is the baroque Great Theatre of Havana, a prominent theatre built in 1837. It is now home of the National Ballet of Cuba and the International Ballet Festival of Havana, one of the oldest in the New World. The fa\u00e7ade of the building is adorned with a stone and marble statue. There are also sculptural pieces by Giuseppe Moretti, representing allegories depicting benevolence, education, music and theatre. The principal theatre is the Garc\u00eda Lorca Auditorium, with seats for 1,500 and balconies. Glories of its rich history; the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso sang, the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova danced, and the French Sarah Bernhardt acted.\nOther important theatres in the city includes the National Theater of Cuba, housed in a huge modern building located in Plaza de la Revolucion, decorated with works by Cuban artists. The National Theater includes two main theatre stages, the Avellaneda Auditorium and the Covarrubias Auditorium, as well as a smaller theatre workshop space on the ninth floor.\nThe Karl Marx Theater with its large auditorium have a seating capacity of 5,500 spectators, is generally used for concerts and other events, it is also one of the venues for the annual Havana Film Festival.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nHavana Film Festival (The International Festival of New Latin American cinema)\nInternational Ballet Festival of Havana\nHavana International Jazz Festival\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHavana attracts over a million tourists annually, the Official Census for Havana reports that in 2010 the city was visited by 1,176,627 international tourists, a 20% increase from 2005.\nThe city has long been a popular attraction for tourists. Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean. The influx was due in large part to Cuba's proximity to the United States, where restrictive prohibition on alcohol and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.\nWith the deterioration of Cuba \u2013 United States relations and the imposition of the trade embargo on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and Fidel Castro in particular, initially opposed any considerable development of the tourism industry, linking it to the debauchery and criminal activities of times past. In the late 1970s, however, Castro changed his stance and, in 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code which opened a number of sectors, tourism included, to foreign capital.\nThrough the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as Cubanacan), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).\nHavana has also been a popular health tourism destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including eye-surgery, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, and orthopaedics. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for retinitis pigmentosa, often known as night blindness, has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nHavana has a diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism.\nThe city's economy first developed on the basis of its location, which made it one of the early great trade centres in the New World. Sugar and a flourishing slave trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro's government to spread Cuba's industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the centre of much of the nation's industry.\nThe traditional sugar industry, upon which the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centred elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous Habanos cigars. Although the harbours of Cienfuegos and Matanzas, in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.\nIn 2000, nearly 89% of the city's officially recorded labour force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country's highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba's primary economic source.Havana's economy is still in flux, despite Raul Castro's embrace of free enterprise in 2011. Though there was an uptick in small businesses in 2011, many have since gone out of business, due to lack of business and income on the part of the local residents, whose salaries average $20 per month.\n\n\n=== Commerce and finance ===\nAfter the Revolution, Cuba's traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system. In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.\nIn Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities. Banking as well is also under state control, and the National Bank of Cuba, headquartered in Havana, is the control center of the Cuban economy. Its branches in some cases occupy buildings that were in pre-revolutionary times the offices of Cuban or foreign banks.\nIn the late 1990s Vedado, located along the atlantic waterfront, started to represent the principal commercial area. It was developed extensively between 1930 and 1960, when Havana developed as a major destination for U.S. tourists; high-rise hotels, casinos, restaurants, and upscale commercial establishments, many reflecting the art deco style.Vedado is today Havana's financial district, the main banks, airline companies offices, shops, most businesses headquarters, numerous high-rise apartments and hotels, are located in the area. The University of Havana is located in Vedado.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nBy the end of 2012 official Census, 19.1% of the population of Cuba lived in Havana. According to the census of 2012, the population was 2,106,146 The city has an average life expectancy of 76.81 years at birth. In 2009, there were 1,924 people living with HIV/AIDS in the city, 78.9% of these are men, and 21.1% being women.According to the 2012 official census (the Cuban census and similar studies use the term \"skin colour\" instead of \"race\").\nWhite: 58.4%, (Spanish descent were most common)\nMestizo or Mulatto (mixed race): 26.4%\nBlack: 15.2%\nAsian: 0.2%There are few mestizos in contrast to many other Latin American countries, because the Native Indian population was virtually wiped out by Eurasian diseases in colonial times.Havana agglomeration grew rapidly during the first half of the 20th century reaching 1 million inhabitants in the 1943 census. The con-urbanization expanded over the Havana municipality borders into neighbor municipalities of Marianao, Regla and Guanabacoa. Starting from the 1980s, the city's population is growing slowly as a result of balanced development policies, low birth rate, its relatively high rate of emigration abroad, and controlled domestic migration. Because of the city and country's low birth rate and high life expectancy, its age structure is similar to a developed country, with Havana having an even higher proportion of elderly than the country as a whole.The Cuban government controls the movement of people into Havana on the grounds that the Havana metropolitan area (home to nearly 20% of the country's population) is overstretched in terms of land use, water, electricity, transportation, and other elements of the urban infrastructure. There is a population of internal migrants to Havana nicknamed \"palestinos\" (Palestinians), sometimes considered a racist term, these mostly hail from the eastern region of Oriente.The city's significant minority of Chinese, mostly Cantonese ancestors, were brought in the mid-19th century by Spanish settlers via the Philippines with work contracts and after completing 8-year contracts many Chinese immigrants settled permanently in Havana. Before the revolution the Chinese population counted to over 200,000, today, Chinese ancestors could count up to 100,000. Chinese born/ native Chinese (mostly Cantonese as well) are around 400 presently. There are some 3,000 Russians living in the city; as reported by the Russian Embassy in Havana, most are women married to Cubans who had studied in the Soviet Union. Havana also shelters other non-Cuban population of an unknown size. There is a population of several thousand North African teen and pre-teen refugees.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nRoman Catholics form the largest religious group in Havana. Havana is one of the three Metropolitan sees on the island (the others being Camag\u00fcey and Santiago), with two suffragan bishoprics: Matanzas and Pinar del R\u00edo. Its patron saint is San Cristobal (Saint Christopher), to whom the cathedral is devoted. it also has a minor basilica, Bas\u00edlica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Caridad del Cobre and two other national shrines, Jes\u00fas Nazareno del Rescate and San L\u00e1zaro (El Rinc\u00f3n). It received papal visits from three successive supreme pontiffs: Pope John Paul II (January 1998), Pope Benedict XVI (March 2012) and Pope Francis (September 2015).\nThe Jewish community in Havana has reduced after the Revolution from once having embraced more than 15,000 Jews, many of whom had fled Nazi persecution and subsequently left Cuba to Miami or moved to Israel after Castro took to power in 1959. The city once had five synagogues, but only three remain (one Orthodox, and two Conservative: one Conservative Ashkenazi and one Conservative Sephardic), Beth Shalom Grand Synagogue is one of them and another that is a hybrid of all 3 put together. In February 2007 the New York Times estimated that there were about 1,500 known Jews living in Havana.\n\n\n=== Poverty and slums ===\nThe years after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the city, and Cuba in general have suffered decades of economic deterioration. The national government does not have an official definition of poverty. The government researchers argue that \"poverty\" in most commonly accepted meanings does not really exist in Cuba, but rather that there is a sector of the population that can be described as \"at risk\" or \"vulnerable\" using internationally accepted measures.The generic term \"slum\" is seldom used in Cuba, substandard housing is described: housing type, housing conditions, building materials, and settlement type. The National Housing Institute considers units in solares (a large inner-city mansion or older hotel or boarding house subdivided into rooms, sometimes with over 60 families) and shanty towns to be the \"precarious housing stock\" and tracks their number. Most slum units are concentrated in the inner-city municipalities of Old Havana and Centro Habana, as well as such neighbourhoods as Atar\u00e9s in Regla. People living in slums have access to the same education, health care, job opportunities and social security as those who live in formerly privileged neighbourhoods. Shanty towns are scattered throughout the city except for in a few central areas.Over 9% of Havana's population live in cuarter\u00eda (solares, ciudadela), 3.3% in shanty towns, and 0.3% in refugee shelters. This does not include an estimate of the number of people living in housing in \"fair\" or \"poor\" condition because in many cases these units do not necessarily constitute slum housing but rather are basically sound dwellings needing repairs. According to Instituto Nacional de Vivienda (National Housing Institute) official figures, in 2001, 64% of Havana's 586,768 units were considered in \"good\" condition, up from 50% in 1990. Some 20% were in \"fair\" condition and 16% in \"poor\" condition. Partial or total building collapses are not uncommon, although the number had been cut in half by the end of the 1990s as the worst units disappeared and others were repaired. Buildings in Old Havana and Centro Habana are especially exposed to the elements: high humidity, the corrosive effects of salt spray from proximity to the coast, and occasional flooding.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Urban buses ===\nThe city's public buses is carried out by the Empresa Provincial de Transporte de La Habana (EPTH).\n\nMetrobus\nThe Red Principal, previously known as MetroBus, serves the inner-city urban area, with a maximum distance of 20 km (12 mi). The Red Principal consists of 17 main lines, identified with the letter \"P\" with long-distance routes. The stops are usually 800\u20131,000 metres (2,600\u20133,300 ft), with frequent buses in peak hours, about every 10 minutes. It uses large modern articulated buses, such as the Chinese-made Yutong brand, Russian-made Liaz, or MAZ of Belarus.\n\nRed AlimentadoraThe Red Alimentadora, known as the feeder line, connects the adjacent towns and cities in the metropolitan area with the city center, with a maximum distance of 40 km (25 mi). This division has one of the most used and largest urban bus fleets in the country, its fleet is made up of mostly new Chinese Yutong buses. In 2008 the Cuban government invested millions of dollars for the acquisition of 1,500 new Yutong urban buses.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nHavana is served by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport. The Airport lies about 11 kilometres (7 mi) south of the city center, in the municipality of Boyeros, and is the main hub for the country's flag carrier Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n. The airport is Cuba's main international and domestic gateway, it connects Havana with the rest of the Caribbean, North, Central and South America, Europe and one destination in Africa.\nThe city is also served by Playa Baracoa Airport which is small airport to the west of city used for some domestic flights, primarily Aerogaviota.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nHavana has a network of suburban, interurban and long-distance rail lines. The railways are nationalised and run by the FFCC (Ferrocarriles de Cuba \u2013 Railways of Cuba). The FFCC connects Havana with all the provinces of Cuba. The main railway stations are: Central Rail Station, La Coubre Rail Station, Casablanca Station, and Estaci\u00f3n de Tulip\u00e1n.\nIn 2004 the annual passenger volume was some 11 million, but demand is estimated at two-and-a-half to three times this value, with the busiest route being between Havana and Santiago de Cuba, some 836 kilometres (519 mi) apart by rail. In 2000 the Union de Ferrocarriles de Cuba bought French first class airconditioned coaches.\nIn the 1980s there were plans for a Metro system in Havana similar to Moscow's, as a result of the Soviet Union influence in Cuba at the time. The studies of geology and finance made by Cuban, Czech and Soviet specialists were already well advanced in the 1980s. The Cuban press showed the construction project and the course route, linking municipalities and neighborhoods in the capital. In the late 1980s the project had already begun, each mile of track was worth a million dollars at the time, but with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 the project was later dropped.\n\n\n=== Interurban (tram) ===\nAn interurban line, known as the Hershey Electric Railway, built in 1917 runs from Casablanca (across the harbor from Old Havana) to Hershey and on to Matanzas.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\nHavana operated a tram system until 1952, which began as a horsecar system, Ferro Carril Urbano de la Habana in 1858, merged with rival coach operator in 1863 as Empresa del Ferro-Carril Urbano y Omnibus de La Habana and later electrified in 1900 under new foreign owners as Havana Electric Railway Company. Ridership decline resulted in bankruptcy in 1950 with new owner Autobus Modernos SA abandoning systems in favor of buses and sold the remaining cars were sold to Matanzas in 1952.\n\n\n=== Ferry ===\nFerries connect Old Havana with Regla and Casablanca, leaving every 10\u201315 minutes from Muelle Luz (at the foot of Santa Clara Street). The fare is CUP 0.20\u00a2.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nThe city's road network is quite extensive, and has broad avenues, main streets and major access roads to the city such as the Autopista Nacional (A1), Carretera Central and Via Blanca. The road network has been under construction and growth since the colonial era, is currently undergoing a major deterioration due to low maintenance.Motorways (autopistas) include:\n\nA1 \u2013 Autopista Nacional, from Havana to Santa Clara and Sancti Spiritus, with additional short sections near Santiago and Guantanamo\nA4 \u2013 Autopista Este-Oeste, from Havana to Pinar del R\u00edo\nVia Blanca, to Matanzas and Varadero\nHavana ring road (Spanish: Primer anillo), which starts at a tunnel under the entrance to Havana Harbor\nAutopista del Mediodia, from Havana to San Antonio de los Ba\u00f1os\nan autopista from Havana to Melena del Sur\nan autopista from Havana to Mariel\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe current governor is Reinaldo Garc\u00eda Zapata, he was elected on January, 2020.The city is administered by a city-provincial council, with a governor as chief administrative officer, thus Havana functions as both a city and a province. The city has little autonomy and is dependent upon the national government, particularly, for much of its budgetary and overall political direction.\n\nThe national government is headquartered in Havana and plays an extremely visible role in the city's life. Moreover, the all-embracing authority of many national institutions has led to a declining role for the city government, which, nevertheless, still provides much of the essential services and has competences in education, health care, city public transport, garbage collection, small industry, agriculture, etc.\nVoters elect delegates to Municipal Assemblies in competitive elections. There is only one political party, the Communist Party, but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates in turn elect members of the Provincial Assembly, which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president functions as the Mayor. There are direct elections for deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People's Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local municipal delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. In addition, there is participation from \"mass organisations\" and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People's Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.\nHavana city borders are contiguous with the Mayabeque Province on the south and east and to Artemisa Province on the west, since former La Habana Province (rural) was abolished in 2010.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nThe national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba. The schools are of varying quality and education is free and compulsory at all levels except higher learning, which is also free.\nThe University of Havana, located in the Vedado section of Havana, was established in 1728 and was regarded as a leading institution of higher learning in the Western Hemisphere. Soon after the Revolution, the university, as well as all other educational institutions, were nationalized. Since then several other universities have opened, like the Higher Learning Polytechnic Institute Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverr\u00eda where the vast majority of today's Cuban engineers are taught.\nThe Cuban National Ballet School with 4,350 students is one of the largest ballet schools in the world and the most prestigious ballet school in Cuba.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAll Cuban residents have free access to health care in hospitals, local polyclinics, and neighborhood family doctors who serve on average 170 families each, which is one of the highest doctor-to-patient ratio in the world. However, the health system has suffered from shortages of supplies, equipment and medications caused by ending of the Soviet Union subsidies in the early 1990s and the US embargo. Nevertheless, Havana's infant mortality rate in 2009 was 4.9 per 1,000 live births, 5.12 in the country as a whole, which is lower than many developed nations, and the lowest in the developing world. Administration of the health care system for the nation is centered largely in Havana. Hospitals in Havana are run by the national government, and citizens are assigned hospitals and clinics to which they may go for attention.\n\n\n=== Services ===\nUtility services are under the control of several nationalized state enterprises that have developed since the Cuban revolution. Water, electricity, and sewage service are administered in this fashion. Electricity is supplied by generators that are fueled with oil. Much of the original power plant installations, which operated before the Revolutionary government assumed control, have become somewhat outdated. Electrical blackouts occurred, prompting the national government in 1986 to allocate the equivalent of $25,000,000 to modernize the electrical system.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nMany Cubans are avid sports fans who particularly favour baseball. Havana's team in the Cuban National Series is Industriales. FCBA. The city has several large sports stadiums, the largest one is the Estadio Latinoamericano. Admission to sporting events is generally free, and impromptu games are played in neighborhoods throughout the city. Social clubs at the beaches provide facilities for water sports and include restaurants and dance halls.\n\nHavana was host to the 11th Pan American Games in 1991. Stadiums and facilities for this were built in the relatively unpopulated eastern suburbs.\nHavana was host to the 1992 IAAF World Cup in Athletics.\nHavana was an applicant to host the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Olympics, but was not shortlisted.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nNotable people originally from Havana:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Diplomatic offices ===\nAs Cuba's national capital and seat of government, Havana hosts 88 embassies (including the papal apostolic nunciature, traditionally manned by a titular archbishop). \nFurthermore, there are 11 consulates(-general) and a trade office.\nEmbassies\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nHavana is twinned with:\n\nNote: Some of the city's municipalities are also twinned to small cities or districts of other big cities, for details see their respective articles.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nHavana is a primary location and the first city able to be visited in the 2013 video game Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Also Driver 2. The game portrays the city as it existed during the Golden Age of Piracy. In the summer 2017, a Cuban-born American singer, Camila Cabello, released the song named \"Havana\" and became a worldwide hit. Havana has also become a playable map in the video game Overwatch (video game) released in 2016 for the PvE mode, \"Storm Rising\". It later became a map for competitive play.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLargest cities in the Americas\nList of cities in the Caribbean\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial tourism website",

          "This is one of the world's largest opera houses. The theater faces Parque Central and was built as part of a larger complex in 1915. People interested in architecture will love the baroque facade and stunning sculptures. Well worth taking a tour of the building. The interior",

          "The Gran Teatro de La Habana is a gorgeous, fairytale castle of a building on Parque Central. It is well worth going to take a look. At night, it is lit up, adding to its magical quality. The theatre is home, amongst other things, to Cuba's world renowned National Ballet. I",

          "One of the best buildings in Cuba and currently under repair so we could not get in, but go and have a walk around.",
          "... But breathtakingly beautiful on the exterior. Worth a walk by, and enjoy coffee at a sidewalk cafe while watching Classic cars buzz by. Smog is an issue in Havana (old cars and buses), so bring your inhaler :).",
          "Magnificent building that need some restauration, but i have assisted to one of the best performances of ballet ever in life. Enjoyed a lot.",
          "Been in Havana twice and it and the Capitol Building are never open. Maybe someday they will be finished. It will be wortha trip",
          "This is the most beautiful building in Havana, just across from the Central Park. Ballet presentations are held here, mainly at the end of the year and it will get packed because cubans love and admire ballet. Worth the picture.",
          "Does anyone know if the renovations have been completed on the Gran Teatro? I stumbled across the last performance almost two years ago, and was told it would be closed for aprox. two years. Anyone??",
          "On my visit in October 2014 the building was closed for restoration. It is a beautiful example of European architecture ( I am no expert in periods so I can not say which period this architecture represents) and it is worth a visit.",

          "Jumped off the double-decker bus during a 15 minute pause to see if we could get tickets to something. Walked all around the building. Bad luck...in restoration (until when?). But an incredible building from the outside. Lucky to get back on the tour bus. Someday. Wouldn't",

          "There is more that a touch of \"faded glory\" about the Teatro. Paint peeling in places, seats not always very securely attached to the floor etc, but the chance to attend the internationally famed ballet should not be missed. Prices - by European/North American standards - are",
          "We saw a flamenco style ballet of The Phantom of the Opera which was superb and very professional. A lovely old grand building which 7 years ago when we visited had a damp smell. The locals pay a fraction of the tourist price and then the bell for curtain sounds they are allowed",

          "We were lucky enough to see a ballet performance, which was just amazing. The theatre is stunning, and has been refurbished. I would have loved to see backstage, or seen the ballet company in rehearsal, but they do not offer that yet. There is a great atmosphere here.",
          "Check ADAGIO the bar at the corner , they usually have a concert of some sort around 10.30 pm, it is great...",
          "I haven't been there in a couple of years but I know the theater has been refurbished and keeps a regular showing schedule. Taking into consideration this place was open back in 1838, I say it looks very good and is well maintained. I remember when I use to take music and dance",
          "Beautiful building, under a lot of refurbishment, it looks derelict, but according to our guide it is still open for performances. There is a modern bar that is open from 2pm in the bottom right corner, is supposed to have good music, but there was never anyone in there the 4",
          "Gorgeous architecture and it is great to see them preserving it. The saddest part however was that the interiors were under refurbishment when we were there (even if it's good for the building preservation in the long run) and the ballet was not performing that period too.",
          "During our sightseeing/picture-taking-frenzy of Old Havana, the Gran Teatro was absolutely one of our favorites. The exterior architecture is truly impressive and well, just regal. We kept walking by to see if we could go in and finally one day we saw people inside so we",
          "Performances here are world class and one should certainly check early each week to see what will be on stage during the week. Perhaps one of the four best dance companies around perhaps something else but for 10 CUCs you will find it very hard to find better value or finer",
          "The external architecture of the theatre is not matched with the interior. All of the interior has been lost over time and is currently being restored. There is some impression of how the interior looked in its hey day, but at the present the area is a bit sparse being part way",
          "It is hard to imagine finding a wonderful old building like this amid the decay of central Havana. It is currently closed for renovations, so there are no performances to be had. However, try to figure out a way to get in for a little tour (perhaps a well placed tip?) because",
          "This is a beautiful old Baroque building that you should not miss. It has been restored just recently. It is near the Prado",
          "Beautiful building inside and out. My first experience of ballet and what a way to start. We saw the last but one night of the Nutcracker and have to say my expectations were exceeded in every way. This really is a first class company putting on an international standard",
          "this huge and well decorated building is one of my favourites... inside remains the Gran Teatro wish offers galas and ballet shows..",
          "Saw the last performance of a shortened Nutcracker before this closes for refurbishment. Great performance in a magnificent setting. The audience almost defies description. Despite having ticketed seating everyone sits where they please, at least in the stalls, so arriving early",
          "Me and my other half went to the Gala performance of the Nutcracker on 1 January 2013. The show was well-staged, technically perhaps on par with European theatres but below a Kirov ballet performance. Alicia Alonso would, probably, be a little upset with it. Interesting to note",
          "The quality, the energy, the choreography, and the music made this a memorable night. A bit pricey but certainly worth it.",
          "The theatre itself is worth to see inside, it is truly beautiful! During the intermission, you can go to their courtyard bar to have a drink under the stars, very nice! I saw a ballet gala with several numbers from various ballets and a one-act ballet based on Jose Marti book,",
          "very nice location, house of most of the best Cuban scene art: ballet, contemporary dance, and symphony",
          "You can visit the building (not the concert hall) for a couple bucks. You'll only be able to go to the first floor's reception but that great hall is wonderful. You may be able to see dancers practicing on a side hall. It is a shame that such a wonderful building looks so run",
          "We watched one of the last performances at this famous venue before refurbishment works commence. A real treat, wonderful dancing, music and costumes combined to make this a night to remember. A great bargain, too.",

        "wiki": "Finca Vig\u00eda (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8fi\u014bka \u03b2i\u02c8xi.a], Lookout Farm) was the home of Ernest Hemingway in San Francisco de Paula Ward in Havana, Cuba. Like Hemingway's Key West home, it is now a museum.\n\n\n== History of the property ==\nThe house was built in 1886 by Catalan architect Miguel Pascual y Baguer on a hill about 15 miles (24 km) east of Havana. From the back veranda and the adjacent tower one has an excellent view of downtown Havana.\n\n\n== The Hemingway family ==\n\nHemingway lived in the house from mid-1939 to 1960, first renting it, and then buying it in December 1940 after he married Martha Gellhorn, his third wife. Gellhorn, who had come to Cuba to be with Hemingway, decided that she did not want to live in the small room he rented at the Hotel Ambos Mundos. She found the property for which Hemingway paid $12,500. The finca at the time consisted of 15 acres (61,000 m2) with a farmhouse.\nWhile at Finca Vig\u00eda, Hemingway wrote much of For Whom the Bell Tolls, a novel of the Spanish Civil War which he had covered as a journalist with Gellhorn in the late 1930s. (He had started the novel while living at the Hotel Ambos Mundos, and some of it was written in Idaho.) Hemingway bought the property with some of the first royalties from the book, which was published in 1940. After Hemingway and Gellhorn divorced in 1945, Hemingway kept Finca Vigia and lived there during the winters with Mary Welsh Hemingway, his last wife.\nAt the finca, Hemingway also wrote The Old Man and the Sea (1951) about a fisherman who  lived in the nearby town of  Cojimar and worked the waters off Havana.\nIn the early 1940s, during the Second World War, Hemingway's three sons often visited him at the finca, sometimes staying in a small house that Martha (\"Marty\") Hemingway had fixed up for them.\nThe guest house, a converted one-story wooden garage, is now used as offices for the museum director and staff and for meetings. They reported that the property then was overgrown with manigua and flamboyan trees, but that most of the rural land has since been taken over by housing. In those early days there was also a tennis court, a pool and water wells.At the finca Hemingway began to keep and breed cats (in Key West, he had kept only peacocks). There is no evidence that any of Hemingway's Cuban cats were polydactyl. Hemingway started with a gray Angora cat named Princessa (middle cat in photo) obtained in Key West from a breeder, and in 1942 picked up two male Cuban kittens named Good Will and Boise (left and right cats in photo). Hemingway wrote extensively about the habits of Boise. By 1943, the cat population at the finca numbered 11. When Mary Hemingway moved into the finca in 1946, she had a workshop tower constructed on the property for Hemingway to write in, but he preferred to work in his bedroom, and the workshop was eventually assigned to the cats. Today, there are no cats on the Cuban property, but there are several at the home in Key West, some with thumbs.\nAfter the Cuban revolution ousted the US-backed government in January 1959, Hemingway was on good terms with the new Cuban government. In Havana in the summer of 1960, he presented a trophy to Fidel Castro for winning a sport fishing contest named for Hemingway. Nevertheless, as depression and illness overtook him, Hemingway left Cuba for good on July 25, 1960, leaving behind the home that he had used there for more than 20 years.\n\nIn the fall of 1960, the Cuban government expropriated a great deal of foreign property, including the Finca Vig\u00eda. The U.S. government broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in October 1960 and imposed a partial financial embargo. After the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961 and Cuba's announcement that it was a Communist state in May, relations between Cuba and the U.S. deteriorated further.\nHemingway was being treated for severe depression in the U.S. through the first half of 1961, and the Hemingways could not return to Cuba due to the hostile political climate between the two countries. Hemingway committed suicide at his home in Idaho on July 2, 1961.\nThe official Cuban government account is that after Hemingway's death, Mary Hemingway deeded the home, complete with furnishings and library, to the Cuban government, which made it into a museum devoted to the author. Mary Hemingway, however, stated that after Hemingway's death, the Cuban government contacted her in Idaho to report that it intended to expropriate the house, along with all real property in Cuba. Mary Hemingway negotiated with the Castro government for certain easily  movable personal property (some paintings and a few books), plus manuscripts deposited in a vault in Havana. Most of the Hemingways' personal property, with no way to move it out of the country at the time, had to be abandoned.\n\n\n== Cuban ownership and stewardship after 1960 ==\nThe home, claimed to be in danger of collapse by the US National Trust for Historic Preservation, was restored by the Cuban government and reopened to tourists in 2007.  Even so, it has been listed as one of the 11 most-endangered historic sites, despite being outside the US. Also, it is on the World Monuments Fund's biennial list of \"100 most endangered sites\". Significant disputes and controversies have arisen over the condition of the house and its contents, although researchers who have visited the site have consistently reported that the Cuban government, without funding from the US, has responsibly maintained the house, contents, 38 ft (12 m) wooden fishing boat Pilar, and the grounds.\nIn a June 2008 newspaper article, Irish thriller writer Adrian McKinty alleged that during a visit to the house, a Cuban secret policeman offered him any book in Hemingway's library for $200.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nErnest Hemingway House\nHotel Ambos Mundos\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n11 Most Endangered, Finca Vig\u00eda: Ernest Hemingway House National Trust for Historic Preservation, 2008 (web.archive.org)\nMichael Palin's Journal: Finca Vig\u00eda www.PBS.org\nHemingway's Cuba - 2000, La Finca Vigia, San Francisco de Paula Hemingway Society, April 2004 (web.archive.org)\nHemingway Cuba\nFinca La Vig\u00eda Havana\nFinca Vigia\nAdios Hemingway - a Leonardo Padura police detective novel",

          "Spend half a day touring the grounds of Finca Vigia.... peer into the Hemingway home through the open windows, climb the tower stairs, tour the pool and boat... take your time and breathe it in and imagine. Nice gift shop as well.",
          "Amazing home that belonged to an infamous writer, well worth taking the time to see. You cannot walk into the home, but all of the doors and windows are open to peer into and see how Hemingway lived. The property sits high enough that you have a great view of the surrounding",
          "Saw the boat Pillar, which the Cuban govt bought from the family. Nice estate. Can imagine the reason why he stayed and the inspiration that he had",
          "Beautiful home of Hemingway, great views of The countryside. You can see why he loved it there. Take advantage of seeing this lovely country if you can.",
          "This tour doesn't take you inside Hemingway's home, but you can see the rooms through the windows. Outside is the old boat that Hemingway used. You have to visit the home because Hemingway's time in Cuba made the area well known.",
          "A little bit of a drive outside of Havana, this is a 'must-do' if you are a Hemingway fan of any level. Reasonable fee to get onto the grounds (5 CUC/person I believe) for self-guided exploration. No entry into any of the buildings (which actually is better for protecting &",
          "We traveled here as part of a tour on our Empress of the Seas, cruise. It was great to be able to walk around the property. We knew that we cold not enter the house, but there were door ways and windows open so you could take photos that made it look as if you had been right",
          "Excellent look at life of American author Ernest Hemingway who lived in Havana for many years. Beautifully maintained including his hunting trophies, photos, etc.",
          "A tour of Hemingway's Cuba residence was wonderful! We were not permitted inside, we had to view the residence from the windows, which was O.K. We toured the grounds as well. I loved peering in and seeing all the home decor from the 50s and early 60s (Hemingway passed away in",
          "Great experience finally making it out to visit Papa Hemingway's abode where he lived for at least part of the year for over two decades. Although you can no longer enter the house, you can observe most of its rooms, replete with hundreds of books, and taxidermy heads from big",
          "Do not miss it! I was worried because I heard you could only look in the windows. Well, the windows are open and you can see clear across the house to the other side. So don't worry. You can see everything, no problem. It is only one story. It is beautiful and very",
          "Hemingway's home is really comfortable - a place I could live in, if the animal heads were taken off the walls. There is a plaster carving or casting of a bull - it's by Picasso, and never lived, so I'd keep that.",
          "We couldn't go in the house but the windows were open and taking pictures was easy. Beautiful home well kept. Grounds are very pretty. Lots of trees for shade. Boardwalk to his boat needs work. Nice gift shop with excellent price on rum",
          "I am a Hemingway fan and so this trip was fascinating. This is about 30 minutes out of Old Havana by taxi or hired driver. The property is well preserved and very clean and well-kept. The house is like stepping back in time. My husband also enjoyed it, even without an extensive",
          "This was a side interest but our tour guide assured us we had the time. Everything is preserved as left by Hemingway right down to the magazines and clothing he left. His boat is also there. The grounds are somewhat tropical. It is on a hill with Havana in the distance.",
          "It took approximately 30-35 minutes ride from Havana. But you are not allowed to get into Hemingway's house, only opened up a front door, and a few side windows for you to take pictures and view. Not worth the trip to go here unless you are a real fan of Hemingway.",
          "Lovely house in lovely grounds. Helpful staff . Just a shame about all the Americans off the cruise ships who were very loud and rude. If not for them it would have been a very tranquil setting 20mins away from the city.",
          "Hemingway's country home, when he was not in downtown Habana carousing at Ambos Mundos or La Floridita, is set on a hill with a great view of the city (hence the name Vigia - \"Lookout\") . Simple architecture and a very, very male interior design make this house immediately",
          "A well preserved country home, elegant for its heyday, in a somewhat out of the way area where the author was able to work and rest and enjoy the life of a country gentlemen. With must of his possessions left untouched for these many years. Worth the visit. The care takers will",
          "Fascinating experience. Learned about the life of this famous author and say to see why he chose olive here.",
          "You cannot go into the house but the doors and windows are open. For views and taking photos. You can walk a short distance to the swimming pool and his boat. It is a must see if you are in Havana.",
          "Not to be missed. About 20 minutes outside of Havana in Cojimar. Hemingway's home sits on 9 acres. It's beautiful and full of history. We loved walking the grounds and seeing his home. You cannot go inside but you still get a great feel for house looking in all the open windows",
          "Interesting tourist destination, especially if you have read any of Hemingway's novels. He lived well here for some 20 years until the end of the 50's. Big mansion on top of a hill with good views.",
          "I\u2019m a huge fan of Hemingway and have now gotten to see his home in Key West and in Cuba. We negotiated a fee with a local driver to go out and see it and sadly got there with very little time to look around. The grounds and the house are amazing with a view of the city out of",
          "This beautiful Caribbean mansion was Hemingway's home he gave back to Cuba after his death. The home is open to visitors on a tour and is a ways out of city center. You are not able to enter the home. The windows are open and you are able to stick a camera through the window",
          "I am a huge Hemingway fan and have visited his (now overly commercialized) home in Key West and his grave in Idaho, it was a thrill to get to visit, if too briefly, Finca Vigia in the outskirts of Havana. Even though you can't go into Hemingway's house, you can get a good look",
          "Great to see his Cuba estate after visiting the one in Key West, it's unfortunate that this is of course government controlled like everything else in Cuba, but it is fairly well preserved. They don't let you inside the house but you can look thru all the doors and windows",
          "You can't go inside the house but you can get a good view through the windows. It helps to have a guide tell you about the house and Hemingway's life in Cuba.",
          "Our visit to the Hemingway museum, not really a finca anymore, but sits preserved in the Havana suburbs like an aging but still beautiful woman whose youth and vibrant past is readily apparent but is now empty and forlorn. The house, which is partially preserved through the",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed touring this place. Had watched the movie, \"Papa Hemingway in Cuba\" before going to Cuba. Couldn't believe everything is just like it was in the movie. Came back home and watched the movie again!",
          "What a picturesque setting and a beautifully simple estate looking over the city! You don't have to be all about E. Hemingway to appreciate this place, but fans would surely find it most interesting as a glimpse into his life.",
          "Well maintained home from Hemingwway's life in Havana. Interesting looking inside the various rooms that are just as he left them. Unfortunately you cannot go inside the home, but windows and doors are open for public viewing. Large grounds. Admission 5 CUC pp.",
          "Be prepared to access this home - kept as though it must have looked in the early 60's - from the open windows only. It was a spacious and peaceful residence, tucked into a quiet, wooded lot with large windows, lots of light, and a view over the town of San Francisco de Paula.",
          "Pretty interesting place, but looks poor. The house is not open for visitors, only the outside. The rooms can be see because the doors and windows are wide opened",
          "The house on the hill is worth a trip. I was with a tour guide who was able to tell us about the home It was truly a step back in time. I could well imagine living there with Hemingway. The views are amazing. The pool would have been a treat on a hot humid day. The",
          "Nice grounds that are well maintained. Interesting story as to how he ended up here and the writing of a couple of his great novels. He was quite a character himself. Love the boat and the dog cemetery. Great how they maintained the house as he left it. This is a must",
          "the home in which Hemingway lived is preserved as a museum. the rooms are seemingly untouched and the furniture is of the era. I imagine the gardens and terraces would have been in better condition but it was easy to see why he liked the home with the shaded outside terraces.",
          "A visit to Earnest Hemingway's fame is pleasant and a way to see how and where he lived in Cuba. The house, now a bit fun-down, has been maintained as he left it. We lives seeing his old boat.",
          "We took the short drive out of Havana to see the home of Hemingway and glad that we did. You cannot enter the house but there is not reason you would want to. All the windows and doors are open so you can pop your head into every room. The house is exactly has Hemingway left",
          "This is a really amazing museum of Hemingway. The mansion is really big with beautiful garden and swimming pool.",
          "While you cannot walk through the house, peering through the windows all around reveals an amazing glimpse into Hemingway's life. The view from his writing tower is to die for. I wish I could have visited him there in the early 50's!",
          "The Cubans must have loved Ernest Hemingway because they have maintained and memorialized his residence. Must see.",
          "What a beautiful property!! It has been kept the same way as Hemingway had it. It felt like he was still on the property. I loved seeing the original artifacts as well as the original Picasso hanging on the wall!!!! His boat was also displayed beautifully on the property. So",
          "When in Cuba, a visit to the home of Hemingway is a great half day trip. Still furnished as he left it, the home and property represent an era of celebrity filled partying and nightlife, when glamorous movie stars as well as infamous mob bosses made Havana their stomping ground.",
          "As a Hemingway fan, and having just read \u201cLove and Ruin\u201d about Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn, seeing Finca Vigia on our trip to Havana was a must. It did not disappoint. While you cannot go inside the main building, you can see everything from doorways and windows. It was",
          "Heminway's Havana-area farm/home is a beautiful Spanish-style, 1890ish-mansion that has been fairly decently preserved and protected by the Cuban government. Seeing it, I was reminded of the Havana farm house described in \"Islands in the Stream,\" clearly inspired by this home.",
          "An insight into the house Ernest Hemingway lived in. Our driver said it was busier than normal - we were 'fighting' to see inside some windows. Found out when we returned to Havana that two cruise ships in. Maybe check this out before going.",
          "We went here as part of the Best of Havana Tour, offered by Royal Caribbean. This place is AMAZING! The government of Cuba has gone to great lengths to strike that perfect balance between historical preservation, and access to an admiring public. Add in the weather in Havana,",
          "It was in awe to be able to walk around Finca Vigia. It was easy to see why Heningway fell in love with Cuba. The place has amazing views. Even though you cannot go inside the house, you get to peek into different rooms and get a first hand glimpse at the places where he worked",
          "Whether you are or not a fan of Hemingway, this is a worthwhile trip. Just the ride to the \"finca\"/farm, will give you a taste of the Cuban life outside of Havana. The house has been restored with many items belonging to Hemingway. You will see his boat as well as hear how he",
          "Recommend going with someone who can explain the history and importance of this home, if you are not well familiar. You can't go inside, but you can look inside and walk around the grounds. If you have been to the home in Key West, you will not want to miss this to complete",
          "Hemingways beautiful Fina outside of Havana is a experience you must see...The beautiful grounds & the homes lovely setting high above with great views of valley below. The pool where he relaxed and the rooms he wrote in are the same as he left it years ago...Hemingways famous",
          "We had the wonderful experience of talking at length (with a translator) to one of the curators of the collections here. This was Hemingway's home in Cuba and it is a large lovely place. You can see why he was so happy there.",
          "I honestly wasn't very excited to visit the Hemingway Museum, but once I got there I was blown away by his home. It's absolutely beautiful. You can't go inside the home, but you can walk around and see inside all of the rooms - even his closet. You can also walk around the",
          "The view from Hemingway's house is gorgeous as well as the grounds the house sit on. While you cannot actually go in the house there are many open areas for you to view inside. You can also walk around the grounds which offer great views. As this is a historical/touristy spot it",
          "This finca is some way out of the centre of Havana so you need a tour or a taxi. It is very busy. The house is just fantastic although you can only view through the windows. There is the separate tower built for Hemingway and the pool where he entertained the famous. Fantastic",
          "I was so happy to be able to stand right a the open doors and windows to see the home. It was actually better than walking through it and fighting the crowds. Plus, the way it is shown is as if Hemingway just walked out the door. A nice experience for all ages.",
          "Hemingway's Home is a 20 minute drive outside of Central Havana. The house sits on a hill and overlooks Havana. We didn't have a guide but read that others did and thought it was worthwhile. Unfortunately, we were not offered that option when we arrived. Even though we could",
          "We toured the museum as part of the Havana premium tour and it really didn't know what to expect beforehand. It really was fascinating and worth the trip. One of my favourite books is the Old man and the sea so it was a real treat to see. They will take your camera and take",
          "Visited Ernest Hemmingway's old house in Cuba which was donated by his wife after he commited suicide in 1962. Note his boat, war correspondent's jacket, and, of course, thousands of collected books. Nice grounds and views.",
          "Visiting Hemingway's home in Havana cost us precious time in the city as we were only there for 10 hours on a cruise. It was interesting, but not necessary. We saw his home in Key West and that was more informative and manageable.If your time in Havana is limited, I would not",
          "Very interesting tour round this famous writers house just outside Havana. It was built in 1886 and he apparently purchased the house in just under five acres of grounds in the 1940\u2019s. Entrance is free although you can only view the inside of the house through the open windows.",
          "A wonderful experience to behold this famous authors living quarters in this amazing villa. You could not actually go in the house but windows were removed so that you could view each room, take pictures and see it as it was left, even his footwear and clothes. The tower was the",
          "Was a very interesting tour, though you can't actually go in the house or the tower. There are a ton of windows and you can see quite a bit from there. Very intersting to listen to the tour guides and see how he lived. Small gift shop and bar on site, bar had a live band",
          "A drive from downtown but well worth it to experience the environment that allowed Hemmingway to write.",
          "Hemingway purchased this property, and the visit has his history for the time he lived here. It also is a good view of how people with money lived before communism.",
          "very nice place, well preserved, very interesting , the guide had a lot of Knowledge about the history of the place",
          "Hemingway is my favorite author, so I might be a little biased. But, I loved the trip to his house. To see it preserved as it is and to get a glimpse into his life and Cuba and his love for the Cuban people was amazing. Definitely worth the trip outside of Havana to see it and",
          "Very interesting house and grounds to include Hemingway's boat - worth the drive from Havana. It's pretty much as he left it",
          "Hemingway's home was not built for him, but once he owned it, I imagine he was behind creating this beautiful space. Light airy rooms. Multiple floors. Even a small top floor with just a writing desk, telescope, and books! Bookcases are everywhere, as are the trophies of",
          "On our very quick trip to Cuba, we stopped at (we think) every Hemingway hang out including his lovely home at Finca Vigia. It is now a museum that you see from the outside through the open doors and windows. You get to see everything without ever stepping foot inside to",
          "It was so very interesting to take an inside look into Hemingway's life. Lots of fascinating items all throughout the museum/house.",
          "If you are a fan of historic houses or just Hemingway, then this is the place to come. You get a real insight into his home of 20 years. Very friendly staff and a wonderful place to visit.",
          "Amazing to see where Hemingway wrote \"old man and the sea\" and how he lived in Cuba, on a huge property with a view of the sea and havana in the distance. loved seeing his boat and the graveyard of his dogs.",
          "We went here with a private guide from Fer Tours on our last day in Havana. We got there before it opened and were the first people in after they opened the gates. The tour buses began arriving almost immediately and the crowds grew quickly. You can't actually go into the house",
          "We loved viewing the house and the grounds where Hemingway loved and wrote. His boat is there on the grounds!",
          "The best way to get to the Museo Hemingway Finca Vigia is to book a tour through the concierge of your hotel. If you book a private tour, you should get a guide who knows all about the museum. This is the house where Ernest Hemingway lived for a third of his life. The house",
          "A must when in Cuba, especially if you are a lover of Hemingway books. You get to see his house, some of his artifacts, bed, etc, etc, etc. The only drawback is that you see it from the outside, you can't get close to see the interior of his home. Still very nice and",
          "The rooms in the house are amazing. Look as though he just left. Clothes in closets, art work, animal trophies. Don't miss it.",
          "Hemingways house is a must visit whilst in Cuba. Unfortunately so much was being pinched by visitors that now you can only look through the windows. I can see why Hemingay lived in Cuba and why he built where he did. You will get a lot of stories as to who visited and what",
          "We visited Finca Vigia as we were in the area. Unfortunately, we arrived around 11 a.m. when a bunch of tour groups showed up at once. A hundred or more tourists jockeying for a view into the home's interior was pure misery, especially when most people were hell-bent on taking",
          "This gives an interesting insight to Hemingway's life in Cuba, with some original rooms with original photos etc. But, in typical Cuban fashion it is not maintained well and you are not allowed in to the master bedroom or kitchen. Worth half an hour but not much more.",
          "I learned a lot about American author, Ernest Hemingway, as we visited his Havana residence. It is only possible to look from outside into the residence but well worth a stop.",
          "The house and gardens are amazing. Any student of Hemingway must make the trip out to his home. Make sure to walk down to the tennis court and check out his old boat on display there.",
          "The only negative thing I can say is that we could not go in, reason being is at some point someone stole a book from there, so now nobody goes in, you can only look through the windows. Otherwise, Breathtaking.. I learned so much more about Hemmingway. Beautiful, Relaxing",
          "We were surprised to find out that you can't actually go into the house, but all the windows are open so that you can see the rooms as they were when Hemingway lived there. In most areas of the house you can find a worker that will go into the house and take closer pictures",
          "We were in Havana as part of a 5-day cruise on Majesty of the Seas. My husband did his Master's thesis on Hemingway so our 'must see' attractions were Hemingway-related. After meeting our guide at 9 a.m., we drove about 20 minute to Finca Vieja. The house opens at 10:00",
          "Hemingway had a very large estate in Havana. We visited the home, saw his typewriter & best of all the famous beloved Pilar, his boat. The property was lovely & the views magnificent.",

          "This museum is a bit of a trek out of Havana. We visited as part of Hemingway's Havana on a RC Cruise excursion. The guide was charming, but the group was annoying and we wished we'd hired a private tour guide. His residence in Key West was better preserved, but it was still",
          "We booked this as part of a trip in and around Havana. I knew nothign about Hemingway but it was interesting to learn about him and his life in Cuba, not sure you would have learn't anything without a guide (we had one with us) You do get the Cuban version (eg he left the",
          "It's not hard to understand how Hemingway was inspired by the peace and tranquility of this home and the amazing views over Havana. You can totally imagine him sitting on the verandah or by the pool enjoying a cigar and a little rum as he considered his next project! There are",

          "Although we were unable to walk inside Hemingway's home (which was understandable since it is now a museum), we were given total view of the inside of the house due to large doorways and windows. The grounds were accessible to all so we saw his boat, swimming pool and views of",
          "Interesting tour if a Hemingway enthusiast. See the house from the entrance ... cannot go in but can peer in. Enjoy the grounds, see the pool, ... Enjoy and see outskirts of Havana while driving about 40 minutes in the countryside.",

          "Come earlier than later, it could get crowded and too many people around would make it difficult to see and appreciate. Gives a look at his lifestyle. Interesting.",
          "I can really recommend to go to this place while in Cuba. It\u2019s a beautiful spot and you get fascinated by the surroundings and amazed that Hemingway lived here. It\u2019s not a surprise that he could write all this great novels in a place like this. We went by taxi from Havana.",
          "My partner and I visited Hemingway\u2019s house/museum on our way to Havana on a day trip and it was a great place to go. The scenery and views phenomenal and the amount we learned was great. You cannot go in he house guy we managed to get some great photos and highly recommend it",
          "If you love Hemingway and Cuba, this your place. Too much history and memories. The place is naturally beautiful and the house is very well kept. The only con negative side is that it is a little far from the center of the city. But very good.",
          "This was an educational experience for me and my family. It was amazing to walk the grounds of such a famous Author. It was interesting to see his home, and to get a better perspective of who Ernest Hemingway was, and how he lived his life in Cuba. This is a must see attraction.",
          "Situated high on a hilltop about 35 minutes drive from downtown Old Havana (off peak) this attraction is well worth a visit. The grounds are substantially altered from original which lessens the impact of the place and unfortunately much of the change is to accommodate the",
          "What an exciting experience. We have now been to both of his houses. The grounds and the view of Havana is stunning.",
          "The Hemingway house is open to look inside thru the windows and doors, but no entry into the house is allowed. If you give your camera to one of the ladies inside, they will take pictures for you and you should give them a tip. Hemingway's boat is there which he used to go",
          "This place is very far from Havana. Good luck trying to find a cab to take you out this way. Took us around 45 minutes to get here. Once arrived, yes, the house is beautiful and the grounds are all well kept. However, there is ZERO information as to what you are looking at.",
          "The home is 40 minutes outside of Habana and is in some disrepair. It is historically very interesting but they need guides to give tours.",
          "I visited the Hemmingway house on a tour with Cuban Cultural Trips. I'm glad I went with them because our tour guide, who was unaffiliated with the Hemmingway house showed me several fascinating details I would have missed, otherwise. For example, if you look in the window to",
          "Worth a visit to learn of his life and how he lived. Also go to Ambos Mundos hotel to room 511 to see where he spent a year with a wife",
          "Quite a surprise regarding the home and furnishings, the Pilar boat, and the speculator view from the on site light house. And of course, many restored USA cars nearby to take a ride",
          "Our tour guide said we needed to visit. She was a font of knowledge about Hemingway and shared a number of interesting stories that I hadn\u2019t known and really helped me grow to appreciate and understand him better. That said they were stories that would have been far more",

          "Although you cannot go in, the lady inside was happy to take your camera and take photos of every room for you. Just tip her a couple of CUCs ($2). The souvenir shops across the street were also good. I personally don't like souvenirs because they look cheap, but they had",
          "To be able to have a glimpse into Hemmingway's home was worth the visit. Although you are not allowed inside,they have areas where you can view rooms. The Pilar is here along with Hemingway's pet dog cemetary. You may walk about and tour the grounds, which include his swimming",

          "This is a must-see in Havana. Although I have been there dozens of times, I never get bored. The interior design of Heminhway's house is so beautiful and the garden is a relaxing place. No more freshly squeezed sugarcane juice unfortunately :-(",
          "The house is set back off from the main road. The setting is very tropical with many native trees and flowering plants around it. The house has been well preserved. You aren't allowed in the house but can take pictures from the entrance and windows. It does give you an idea of",

          "The visit was part of a planned excursion from Royal Carribean. We were told that we could not get in, that no one could as the preservation aspect kept it sealed. However, from reviews here, it appears that is not true. The surrounding neighborhood is questionable, but",

          "As Hemingway admirers, this was a highlight of our trip. The property appears virtually unchanged, and we were fortunate to arrive during a lull between buses in the afternoon. We therefore had the place pretty much to ourselves. It is not possible to enter the house but we were",
          "A true look into the life of Ernest Hemingway. I truly understand why Cuba captivated him. I did read his biography before my trip. There is no guide or docent. Beautiful grounds and excellent scenery overlooking Havana. Well worth it.",
          "This home and the grounds are beautiful. We had a local grounds keeper give us a guide. The woman was very informative and spoke English pretty well. The entire home was open and full of books, art, and personal artifacts. The view of Havana is spectacular from the tower on the",

          "Loved visiting Hemingway's house in Cuba. We were with a group and had a tour guide who was very knowledgeable and told many anecdotes. While we were not allowed to enter the rooms, you can see quite a bit from the various doorways and windows as you walk around the house.",
          "Unfortunately, you can only look into the windows of Hemingway\u2019s home, and there are no docents or explanatory signs. But you can see the house as he left it, including his many books and records. Disappointing.",
          "My family caught a taxi here on weekday from Havana - I think it was about 20 Cuc for the return journey which was excellent value. Our driver took us through different areas of Havana we hadn't seen before so that in itself was interesting - it felt very authentic.",
          "It was nice to see Hemingway\u2019s Home. It is left in its original state. There is a small gift shop located on property. We were there for about two hours.",
          "Finca Vigia is a fantastic place and well worth the visit, kept as it was with the typewriter on top of the book, swimming pool, boat, and lovely gardens, the view from the tower alone is well worth the visit. Also got to visit Cojimar the village from which he fished and I",
          "What a wonderful estate. I think it could even inspire me to write. Some fantastic photos that take you back along with a memory filled house. Shame there is no shop to leverage on the visit.",

          "Many bars in Havana claim his patronage and it is fun to go to any one of them as an excuse to drink mojitos. However, make time to travel the 12 km to his house in Finca Vigia and get a real feel for this great author.",
          "We absolutely loved seeing Hemingway's Villa in Cuba. Wow! With his hairbrush right where he left it. You cannot walk through the house, only get to see by leaning through open doors and windows, but if you tip the \"guard\" a CUC, she'll take pictures for you from inside the",
          "A wonderful museum that really allows you to get a feel for how Hemingway lived while in Cuba. Although you will be on the outside looking in it is still fascinating.",
          "Our guide was completely unbelievable. She made many assertions that were clearly not based on factual information. For example, she made assertions about Hemingway's personal life that she clearly conjured up out of some king of romantic fantasy.",
          "The home was beautifully decorated by Hemingway\u2019s first wife. Be warned the women who offer to provide a better shot inside of the house expect payment since you can only view from the outside. Beautiful property with veggie garden.",
          "Havana's eternal love for \"Papa\" is evident everywhere in the city from his favorite hotels to his favorite drinking holes and libations. Still, we wanted to visit his house even though it is about a 30 minute drive outside of the city because we had seen his home in Key West",
          "Nice and lots of ambiance reflecting Hemingway. Takes only 45 minutes to see the place. The trip by taxi additional 20 minutes. Mojitos served in the garden.",
          "It is a really fascinating experience to visit the old Hemingway-house. You really get the feeling of hanging around in the fifties, and also got the feeling of a man in the power of doing whatever he liked. Spacious, trophies all over, and situatied nice. A also really liked",
          "You truly get a sense of Hemingway's life style. learn about the boat and the number of dogs and cats that lived with him",

          "This was a highlight of our trip to Cuba. Hemingway\u2019s home was both classic and eclectic with a variety of taxidermy. We did not use a tour guide but would listen in on other tours from time to time and heard some interesting anecdotes. Beautiful landscape as well,",
          "You can look into the house but not really tour the house. There were so many people that the best thing you can do is buy a photo book if the home taken by a professional photographer. I loved Hemmingway books but the house was not open enough to really enjoy.",
          "They have preserved the inside of Hemingway\u2019s home beautifully but it\u2019s a bit hard to fight the crowds to get to the doors and windows to see it. Once you do it\u2019s a beautiful site. His boat has been brought in where the tennis courts used to be. The graves of his dogs are still",
          "We had a great tour here which was accentuated by a very knowledgeable guide, who could separate the myths surrounding Hemingway from the truth! Great tour!",
          "Very interesting look into the great authors home and lifestyle. ever interesting stories which open up the mysteries of a wonderful author.",
          "Touring the Hemmingway estate was a real treat, even though we weren't able to enter the home the day we visited due to poor weather conditions. Walking the grounds, touring his boathouse and seeing a collection of vintage cars still made the tour worthy.",
          "We visited Havana on a cruise and our guided tour took us to Hemingway's haunts and hangouts. Finca Vigia and its grounds are spectacular, and we loved seeing Hemingway's Pilar. This is a must-do for literature or history buffs.",
          "This was a stop on our tour and I'm glad it was. The house is set up just as Mr. Hemingway had it. He was such an incredibly interesting person and having a tour guide was extremely helpful in learning even more about this man and how great he was to the Cuban people. He's",
          "This was harder to appreciate since there was no english speaking guide to help. While Finca is many time larger than his Key West home learned a lot more about him and this home in Key West because of the tour guides.",
          "Finca Vigia is well worth a visit if you are a fan of Earnest Hemingway. From Havana it's probably best to take a taxi but agree terms with the cab driver before departure. Hemingway is an enigma in Cuba - they make money from every aspect of him EXCEPT his books. As he is",
          "one of the stops on our tour - very interesting place - loved Hemingway's house and the history ! its like a time capsule as they said they have not touched anything , the house is how he left it when he walked out the door in 1961",
          "The Hemingway mansion, set on 4 acres with an expansive view of the island, is truly an example of excess that was the life of Hemingway. Lush gardens, an incredible pool, a mansion by any standard, and trophies of a hunter are all representative of a life that was based on",
          "You cannot enter the house, but if you tip the ladies inside, they'll take your camera and shoot pics for you. It's a beautiful property, so glad we went off the beaten path to go see where he wrote Old Man and The Sea.",
          "Loved seeing this bright and airy house exactly as he left it . You cannot walk through the house but can look through the many doors and windows and seeing it this way without hoards of people obstructing your view is an advantage I think. Well worth the trip out from Havana",
          "Enjoyed this visit. The grounds are beautiful and the house is very well kept up. Keep in mind, you can view the rooms from the outside but cant go in. The Pilar is amazing to see",
          "Even though you can't go inside the house, the views from the open doorways and large windows are good. I did not feel I had to be inside the house. Do not go on a rainy day as I understand you can not see parts of the house. Climb up the tower for a good view even though",
          "Interesting drive out of Havana. Villa and the interior decorations are very interesting but you can't actually go in - you look into the rooms through the doors. There are no English guides so read up about it before you make the trip. But it is worth it.",
          "It was really interesting to look back in time and see where and how Hemingway lived, worth the trip out to see his house",
          "We enjoyed getting out of the city and the short drive through the countryside to visit Museo Hemingway Finca Vigia. It was easy to imagine Papa roaming around his Finca, relaxing with famous friends, and writing at his desk. It was like a trip through time to see the preserved",
          "Going to Ernest Hemingway\u2019s home was very interesting. Looking in the home gave me a glimpse of a beautiful space. It was also nice to see his office. The most interesting part was seeing Pilar, his boat.",

          "Fist off, don't expect to muddy the floor of Hemingway's Cuban home. You are not allowed inside. However, once you have accepted this, set out to take a glimpse of the life of one of America's great writers. Windows and doors are wide open, so you do not have to peer through",
          "What a lovely house for a towering literary figure. It's in the midst of a tropical garden on a small estate, with views back to Havana Centro. The house is a glory of mid century shabby chic, horrible hunting trophies (of course) and light airiness. I could have moved right in",
          "Old house where hemmingway lived and partied. My friends wanted to stop, not my favorite, but they were Hemingway lovers and enjoyed it.",
          "For Hemingway lovers - must see place; it is amazing to see where he lived & worked! Beautiful place!",
          "Well worth the time to visit. Even if you are just a token Hemingway fan, this museum is worth it. You get a peek into how the rich and famous lived in Cuba at the time. If you have watched any of the films made about his life, you will find yourself constantly saying \"oh, I",
          "While you can't get inside the museum, you can look through the doors and windows to a scene untouched since Hemingway lived there and imagine what it was like to be there . I found the pictures in the pool cabanas especially interesting, showing a relatively young and fit",
          "It\u2019s a lovely property and you can see what he loved about it. You can\u2019t go inside but rather peek through windows and doors. His hunting trophies abound. See Pilar from Old Man and the Sea.",
          "This house appears to be just like it was left. Only thing I would have liked to have gone inside for closer look.",
          "We \"toured\" Hemingway's Cuban farm and found the setting to be quite lovely. The home has no windows or doors and you are not allowed in. You must stand in line to look in. No guides accompany you so you are left to imagine what it is you should know about each room. There",
          "We enjoyed our tour of Finca Vigia. Bring some coins to offer the women who work on the site - they know so much of the history, and were very helpful (my Spanish is not great, so our own tour guide helped translate).",
          "The grounds were interesting but tourists are not permitted in the house. The best part was the troup of dogs that are descendants of Hemmingway's dogs . T hey still have the run of the grounds.",
          "Visited the Hemingway estate while in Havana recently. It\u2019s about a thirty minute taxi ride from Havana. The grounds were beautiful and the house is as it looked in the 1930\u2019s when it was built. His yacht is dry docked in the area that was once the tennis courts. It also has a",

          "We really enjoyed this visit to Papa Hemmingway's place. Well preserved. Not surprisingly, a pretty nice gift shop. You can also get a bite to eat, which looked good, although we sadly didn't have time to eat there.",
          "is a very short visit you cannot go inside the house only look to the windows that are open, you can take pictures and see the other things like his boat, pool etc they have a gift shop a bar all outside, is was ok because we were curious about Hemingway life",
          "Not to be missed! A well preserved and maintained museum - the spirit of Hemingway still lived there. Preferably, take a taxi and explore it at ease in a hot sunny afternoon!",
          "Built in 1886 and located fifteen miles and east of Havana, Finca Vigia was the home of Ernest Hemingway and his third and fourth wife from 1939 and 1960. The property features a house, guest house/garage, tower, pool, and tennis court on fifteen acres. At the finca, Hemingway",
          "The house has been beautifully preserved and there is a great gift shop and outdoor restaurant with live music. Worth the trip put of the city.",
          "This serves as complement to the key West Hemingway House and Museum. House is well maintained, with pleasant and knowledgeable guides. The view of surrounding countryside is awesome. Cannot go inside but must view from porch and doors. No cats here-they disappeared long ago,",
          "Seems like Hemingway had just stepped out for a moment. Lovely villa on a hill preserved as if he still lived there.",
          "This is the estate where Hemingway lived in Havana. It's located a ways from the central city - you will need transport. A spacious grounds - shows his swiming pool, writing space, even his boat. You can view the rooms but not walk through.",
          "Fairly far out from central Havana, the Hemingway house is well worth the trip. While you can\u2019t walk through the house, you can look through the open windows to see the home preserved as Hemingway left it. Beautiful grounds surround the home, and with a little imagination, you",

          "Anyone who has read Hemingway &/or has an appreciation of his life and larger-than-life biography, would totally love a visit here. I'm sorry, but can't understand the tales of \"hype\" (where?) or lack of touristy refinements. From my perspective, as perhaps one of the few or",
          "This was part of a pre-determined tour - and I'm so glad we got to go. I've been to Hemingway's home in Key West...this is much cooler. Just as it was when he left. You can't go into rooms, but you see it all from the outside windows (which are open) looking in. Great views",
          "You can\u2019t go inside the house and the crowds are considerable. Nonetheless this is well worth the trip out of Havana. You can see inside through open doors and windows and the grounds including his boat Pilar give a good idea of how he lived for many years. Pity he couldn\u2019t",
          "A lush green haven where you can escape the crowds and the heat. A tower provides beautiful views to capital's port and surroundings. Picturesque alleys curve around the house. You can't get in, but doors and windows are fully opened and visitors can take pictures. Nothing to",
          "Broken hearted but they let us walk around but no pictures. Of course the gift shop was open so we bought a mug and just soaked in the Hemingway vibes.",
          "Great stop on a day tour covering all the haunts of Hemmingway. House is kept in original condition of Hemmingway's day with many original artifacts. You cannot go into the house but get great views through many open doors and windows.",

          "This home is left as if Hemingway were to call me back any minute. It's filled with over 9,000 books and animals mounted that he hunted on Safari. A real Treasure!",
          "A bit out of town but worth the effort. Interesting house and gardens. Interesting glimpse into the time Ernest spent living in Cuba.",
          "I was blown away by this museum, yes you cant go in the rooms, but you get a good look in through doors and open windows, wandering around the gardens seeing the swimming pool and boat, i could almost feel the Hemingway and his guest enjoying themselves..",
          "Wear comfortable shoes and follow local rules when visiting. The grounds are amazing, take the time to sit where Hemingway sat, read and relaxed. Limited access, but well worth any access you can gain. Try and hook up with a tour, then go off on your own.",
          "Very enjoyable visit to the house and the well preserved grounds. Unfortunately, due to the weather concerns and incidents of theft, entry into the house is prohibited and windows get closed at the first hint of rain. However, even glimpses inside the dwelling give a good idea",
          "This is a one-of-a-kind house and grounds due to the historical impact of Hemingway, and the comparison of his life to that of the Cuban people. If this museum was in the US, it don't think it would get very good reviews, but within the context of 2017 Cuba, it is one of the",
          "Unusual and thought-provoking 'lay-out' to this museum, as everything has been left as it was when Hemmingway was alive. No-one is allowed in the house, so you have to view the rooms through the open windows and doors. Sounds odd but works very well. Lovely grounds (including",
          "If you don't have a guide that knows much about the house. Just slip 1 of the workers inside the house a few CUC and they will be your personal guide",
          "Great house and grounds no doubt. I was a little surprised that you have to pay an entry fee but you can not actually go IN the house, you have to look though the doorways and windows. I understand they dont want a million people walking though and understand that they must",

          "The home is located about 20 minutes from Central Havana and you spend about an hour touring the home. It was a beautiful well kept home with everything The way Hemingway kept it. I think it's a must see if visiting Cuba, but you can coordinate it with a trip to the beach after",
          "I have followed Hemingway's footsteps for years. So in no small part, his history in Havana, and Cuba, was a big reason for our trip. We took a guided Hemingway tour, that included his country home, and I found it, nothing less than amazing. As a fan of the author, none of",

          "If you're a reader, this is an interesting side trip. It takes a while to get to and has great historical significance as it is the location that Hemingway made his home in Cuba and where he did a lot of writing. We enjoyed the grounds more than the house (you can't go in",
          "We had a guide and requested to visit Finca Vigia. Just know that it is approximately 10 miles outside of Havana and not within walking distance of anything. It is best to use a cab, guide or tour to visit. We saw the public bus system, but would not advise using it. You can not",
          "The home is not \"open\", but all of the open windows and doors give a good view of the interior, which contains all of the furnishings and books - even his typewriter and magazines left on the tables like he was there this morning. His boat, the Pilar, is fully restored and on",

          "We had booked a Hemingway Tour visiting all the places connected to Hemingway in an old timer with a young guide who spoke English very well. The most impressive and beautiful place was Hemingway's house. It is situated on large premises on a hill, where it's calm. In front of",

          "Whether or not you are a huge fan of the literary masterpieces, the life and story of Ernest Hemingway is very interesting. The recent feature film about his life is called \"Papa\", and I highly recommend the movie, especially if you are going to visit this site. His home in Cuba",
          "One of Ernest Hemingway's homes turned into a museum, now open to the public, exactly as he left it in the 60's.",
          "This is your place to learn about Hemingway's life in Havana. Make sure you arrange a tour guide at the Museum, they will give you every detail about his life. The place where the house is located is gorgeous, beautiful garden and back yard. You will need a taxi to take you",

          "Don't miss a visit to Hemingway's house if you're staying in Habana. It's an easy bus ride away. If you're an aficionado of the master's work, I don't need to tell you how fascinating it is, but even if you're not, you'll find it very interesting. It's a beautifully preserved",
          "You can't actually tour the house by going on a walking tour. It's self guided by walking around and looking into the windows. Like most things in Cuba, the reality doesn't match what you were told. Our guide said people could'nt go in because the rooms had to be \"sealed\" to",
          "Visiting this place is like stepping in another world. Beautiful Caribbean view. And knowing that Hemingway was there and seeing his belonging is something else. You have to hire a car to go there, it is about 35 minutes drive from Havana.",
          "When initially told that we could not tour the home but instead would be looking in through doorways and windows, I was concerned it would limit how interesting the stop would be. I was so wrong. Looking in through the doors and windows gives a sense of peeking into a real",
          "They have done a great job preserving this place. The walls are covered in animal heads and in the bathroom there is a preserved bat and lizard which is said to be because he loved to hunt and he had his trophies on the wall--his cat caught the bat and lizard so he preserved",
          "It is great that Hemingway left his farmhouse as it was, so that you can better appreciate his life and lifestyle. It's cooler and shadier than Havana and easy to understand why he went there to write. His birds nest, writing workshop was especially cool to see, as well as his",
          "Part of a 6 hour tour of Havana. Very interesting house. You don't go inside, instead walking around the outside looking in through the windows.",
          "I loved seeing how Hemingway lived in Havana--very interesting to look at his boat (on display there) and see the rooms. You look in from the outside, but that's fine. Beautiful grounds, too, and it was nice to get out of Havana to see the fishing village of Cojimar, where we",
          "Hemingway's estate is pretty, and a quiet retreat away from the noise and bustle of Havana, but the area of the grounds you are allowed to explore is very limited, and you are only allowed to peer into the house through the (closed) windows or (open) doors. Two Carnival cruise",
          "It looks like everyone just left this beautiful home just the way it was in the 1950s ! It was great to see everything in place -- books, dishes, ephemera and all original furniture. You could also visualize famous movie stars visiting Hemingway at the pool. The scariest",
          "It's his house, pool, boat. You cannot go in just look in. Not really a big deal. Coolest part is the writing on the wall in the bathroom.",
          "If you have a guide this would be worth it, but we didn't so you just peek inside the house and wander around the property which has nice views and is cooler and breezier than Havana. Sad to see that his 9000 books are not being preserved.",
          "Definitely worth a cab ride out to see where Hemingway spent so much time writing, drinking, entertaining guests, etc. The house is open for peering into and with the French doors and large windows you get a very good look at the whole place. So evocative with numerous mounted",
          "It is amazing that you can go back in time and imagine what it was like to live among greatness. The grounds are immense and the house is beautiful. So much history in one spot!",
          "This was part of our tour and we rode out here in a 55 Chevy with A/C. About a half hour outside of the city so you get to see the farms and little towns along the way that you might miss otherwise. I think is was $7 entrance. saw the house, pool area , his fishing boat and the",
          "Nice place to go if you have enough time and nothing else todo. A bit far out of the city but with a nice view. Wish to have such a weekend house! Jealous at Hemingway!",
          "I was so pumped to go here, we had a private classic car for the day as a guide and we were excited for the day trip. the house is not open to walk through, you can look through open windows. Over 9k books are shoved in bookcases exposed to the heat and humidity, it was sad to",
          "Hemingway's house as it looks the day he died. Very cool and a must see. The history and the irony of the place just drips from every nook and cranny.",
          "A must see in your Cuba visit. See my separate review on OldCarTours in Trip Advisor how best to see it. We spent two hours there with our own personal guide. Best to read up a little on Hemmingway before the visit- as we should have.",
          "We are huge Hemingway readers so going here was an experience. We loved walking around and looking into the place he called home for so long. It put you in his shoes in the 1940's and 50's living away from the US. It has been well maintained restored. It was amazing to see",
          "Went to Havana on an art tour with #camibaart and visite this place. Call before you go to make sure they are open. We went on a weekend the first time because their website indicates they were open. They were not. We went back during the weekend and the experience was very",

          "We visited here as part of a tour so had a guide who gave us lots of information about the house and its history. The location is stunning and has the most beautiful garden. Felt like it was 'stuck in the moment' and although you couldn't actually walk through the house all the",
          "really not much to do here except listen to the guide. About the same information that you get in Key West about Hemmingway. Cuba keeps the property well maintained and clean.",
          "Great history in the Hemingway's house tour. Learned things I was not aware of. The house is only about 30 minutes from Havana Cuba.",
          "Our tour group stopped here, and I came away disappointed. Beautiful property but there is limited access. You cannot go inside the house for security purposes, so you are left to peer thru windows to view the artifacts.",
          "The entry fee to the house is 5 cuc although you cant actually go into the house the windows are open so you can lean in and see what it's all about and take your photos. The grounds are lovely and tree covered so plenty of shade. The house has been kept as it was when he left",
          "You can't get into the house the office there are plenty of opportunities to take pictures from the windows and doorways. It's my understanding that and Tatian's on entering the house I do efforts to preserve in the collection. Any book lover will identify with the numerous",

          "Out of the hustle-and-bustle of Old Havana, Hemingway's house is a peaceful oasis on a hill overlooking the city. It is a 20-30 minute drive from Old Town, but certainly worthwhile. Visitors can't enter the interior, but can see through big open doors and windows into almost",
          "This is a lovely spot and gives a little insight into the tranquility that enabled this interesting writer to nail some great books !",
          "So an interesting thing about most (if not all museums) in Havana, they all charge you money to enter and then they are VERY sparsely appointed with anything historic. I don't know if all the historical artifacts are stored, sold, in a private collection, but it is strange.",
          "It's all there...from Hemingway's home to his office to The Pilar, one of the most significant places in all of Hemingway history is lovingly preserved by the Cuban government in deference to a national hero. This is a must see!",
          "You can't go inside the house, but it's in great condition. I deducted 1 star because it's a little bit of a drive from Havana, maybe like 30 minutes. It's worth the trip though.",
          "This is neat to see if you're a Hemingway fan. The house holds a lot of artifacts, and you're able to peak in all around! There's a little stand that sells drinks outside of it too, incase you get thirsty and want something fruity!",
          "We watched the movie Papa on Netflix so we had to go to see the museum and to our surprise it was worth it! Our tour girl took us to Ambos Hotel, the museum, then Cojimar. All three places were worth our Cuban pesos! It's a great place, even if you're not familiar with",
          "Hemingway lived here on and off for more than twenty years. He gained fame and fortune early, so the house is a substantial one - which is evident from the rooms and grounds (including a wonderful pool).",
          "The grounds at Finca Vig\u00eda resemble a tropical oasis. It's easy to see why Hemingway made his home there. I'd hoped to be able to actually walk through. Other reviewers commented that due to rain, it was closed off to pedestrians. But, even though the weather was perfect, we",
          "We hired a driver with a '57 Chevy to take us out here. Watch the movie Papa Hemingway in Cuba before you go. The house was left exactly as it was when he and Mary lived there. Don't go on a rainy day because you can't go inside it ever. You walk around it and look inside",
          "The house is just as Hemingway left it in the early 1960s. Well, minus the tennis courts that washed down the hillside. They also brought his boat up there, which certainly was not part of the landscape when he left. It is something that any Hemingway fan should see as it",
          "It was very interesting to see the home of Ernest Hemingway and learn more about him. The grounds are worthy of a short visit. Just be prepared that there is lots of propaganda on this visit.",
          "A wonderful view of Havana from Hemingway's getaway. You can see how the foliage/grounds created the sense of privacy and allowed for a retreat from public life. The home is able to be viewed from the open windows and doors; however you are not able to go in. The home has",
          "Hemingway wrote \"The Old Man and the Sea\" when he lived here (read the book before you leave home for Cuba--you'll get more out of your visit if you do!). His wife bought the house--quite a distance from Hemingway's favorite bars in Havana--with the hope that she could stop",
          "we were on a tour from the cruise ship. Our last stop was Hemingway's house. I didn't know what to expect. It is well preserved. You can not enter into the home but you can view through doorways and windows. The only part you can not see is his personal bedroom. We were able to",
          "I have read some Hemingway but am not a devotee. IMO a special trip to the house is justified for those really interested in his life. The home and property are very well preserved and part of that preservation is not letting you into it. You can see the heads of his African",
          "Hemmingway's house sits beautifully atop a hill and is perfectly preserved. You are able to look in the doorways and windows of the home to observe the interior's artwork, books, furniture etc. Take a climb up the tower and walk down by the pool and boat.",
          "I went by a taxi, though it was a great deal to negotiate. It is in a very beautiful green area. I was very sorry, because only Hemingway's apartment could be seen from outside, not allowed. So I'm a little disappointed.",
          "If you have time take a trip to see the Ernest Hemingway museum to get a look at what his home looked like. He lived in Cuba for 20 years. You cannot walk through the actual house but you can peek inside and take pictures.",
          "Beautifully restored, great to see his books, writing desk, his weight inscriptions on his bathroom wall, graves of his dogs and fishing boat. I think the while museum requires informative interaction as you stand outside looking inside into the different rooms of the house. If",

          "We toured the grounds. You cannot enter the house but you can peer in through open windows. The tour is self-guided with very little interactive media to explain the different rooms. Make sure you climb the tower in the back yard. The view is stunning. 5 CUC to enter the",

          "We visited this house as part of a tour of Havana. Although it seemed a nice old house it was of very little interest to us. You are unable to enter the house so can only peer through open windows. Could have been anyone's house at that time as long as they were rich.",
          "We took the \"The Life of Hemingway in Havana\" shore excursion on a NCL 4-day cruise to Cuba. The Hemingway tour was operated by Havanatur and began with a bus ride to Finca Vigia, Hemingway's estate on the outskirts of Havana. The 25-minute ride was an opportunity to see a",
          "A very interesting stop on our tour. You cannot enter the home, but large windows provided an opportunity to see where Hemingway wrote and how he lived. His fishing boat is on display as well. There are public restrooms available where attendants carry water for the toilets",
          "I would go back to Cuba just to go to Finca Vigia again. It's really beautiful and set up like he just stepped away for the afternoon. You cannot go in but all of the doors and windows are open on each side so you can see everything. The grounds are beautiful and it's neat to",
          "Worth the ride out there. Although you cannot go into the house, all the doors and windows are open so you get a good view. Also visit the pool area & walk the grounds. Very shady and relaxing place to be. Don't bother with the little gift area, nothing but government",
          "Hemingway's home is one of the highlights for anyone visiting Cuba. Try and find a knowledgeable guide and you can imagine Papa wondering the grounds in a Rum induced stupor. Then when you get home, rent the movie \"Papa\" on Amazon. You will be in awe, as it was shot right at",
          "The house can be checked out from the outside through doors and windows. It was nicely decorated and had some charming interior- for my taste. If you like boats you can find the \"Pilar\" there. In general a very peaceful place with lots of greens.",
          "It's a little way out, but our tour hired a small bus. It was a nice place to visit, situated in a nice spot in the countryside, with a view of Havana in the distance. You look in the windows and see Hemingway's home as if he had just gotten up and gone for a walk. It was",
          "We got to explore Hemingway's home and outbuildings, such a beautiful, serene way to spend an afternoon. His boat was there to be admired, his huge swimming pool, empty, unfortunately. Be aware, the bathrooms for public use are very basic and you have to ask for paper!",
          "This beautiful house is set in a tranquil, shaded setting. The rooms have an old world charm with everything as it would have been during Hemingway's occupation. All the rooms are viewed through the windows so as to retain the interior fabric, but are still accessible for",
          "We loved our trip to Museum of E. Hemingway. It is a bit out of the way but worth every minute of your time. On the way there look out of the car windows. Cubans waiting for the buses, cars, just walking or sitting, tons of buildings, old cars, posters, old factories. The best",
          "You get summerged in history there, u can see every single space of Hemingway's home. I was shocked when I saw the height measuresfrom their children drawn on the wall, the desk where he used to write... It is a magic place",
          "It's a beautiful small property overlooking Havana central in the distance. The house and the tower where he could write are visible through the windows. We made it there just before a rain storm where they shut the windows and you have to push your nose up to the windows to see",
          "A delightful house in a beautiful setting with glorious views across the harbour to Havana city. Enjoyable for anyone, not just readers of Hemingway.",
          "Hemingway's house was a perfect retreat for him as I saw it. Not too large so people would stay too long, but a great pool area where he could hold court and entertain. All the decoration was of the period and the old magazines displayed had Hemingway in his glory years on the",

          "No trip to Cuba would be complete without seeing the Hemingway House and Museum. While the house is closed the windows are open to take pictures. You get a real look into his home. You would swear he just left the room. You also get to see the grounds which are stunning. As",
          "This is a large estate with a two bedroom home, huge swimming pool and his boat that he used to go to Key West. It is a lovely property and worth visiting if you are a Hemingway fan. Five CUCs to enter.",
          "Makes you wish you were a guest in 1955. Very cool, casual yet big home. We were lucky enough to be there on a day when it was practically empty, so that was nice! However, due to apparent theft of belongings, you can only look through the doorways which are roped off. But still",
          "although u r not allowed in the house, u can take pictures from open windows. And the grounds the house sits in. Well worth a visit",
          "Similar feel to his home in Key West but the grounds are much more expansive. Great to see the \"Pilar\" has been preserved in dry dock. Also enjoyed visiting his apartment in town at the Hotel Ambos Mundos.",
          "O.k., so there are a lot of tourists there, bit since the house was designed with so many open air windows, one can easily get a feel/view of the way Ernest lived. Rarely have a seen such easy access to a house museum without entering the house. Worth the drive there from",
          "The Museo Hemingway is a chance to inspect (from the outside) the Cuban home of Ernest Hemingway and the tower in which he wrote. The building is open to viewing through the windows and doorways but is cordoned off to prevent actual entry. Much can be seen and imagined at the",

          "This is about 35 minutes outside of Old Havana; about a $20 CUC taxi ride, one way. But it's worth the trip You can't go inside the house but there are plenty of vantage points through open windows so you can see pretty much everything in every room. The displays are",
          "Finca Vigia was amazing even if you are not a hemingway fan it really is a must see. I really enjoyed the view from his tower room. The house is beautiful but you can only look through the doors and windows. It really gives you a full view of the inside. Unfortunately if it is",
          "A once spectacular estate has fallen into severe disrepair like everything else in Cuba. They have preserved what they can the best they can under the circumstances. Most enjoyed the docent's telling us of his life and history in Cuba.",

          "I was quite surprised at how extensive the property here is and how well you can appreciate the home without actually entering it. The guide we had was terrific. All of Hemingway's possessions are there in the exact places where he kept them. His fishing boat is there as",

          "Hemingway's house in Cuba is a bit far from Havana. Take a taxi and enjoy the route as you pass through small towns, fisheries, railroads. The entrance fee is cheap. You can't enter the house, but you can take pictures through the open windows. His house is simple yet elegant.",
          "It does get busy here, so I would recommend getting here earlier, which will also be before it's too hot. We had a guide and it was definitely worth it, without the guide we would have missed a lot of the detail, the guide was booked in advance and met us at our hotel, not sure",
          "This was very cool. Even if you are not a Hemingway fan, this was still very interesting. I especially likes his boat and pool area.",
          "a nice way to spend some time away from the hustle and noise of Havana, and to see what was the home of Hemingway for 20 years",
          "We were very pleased with our ability to see inside each room from the porch and his writing room above another building. His boat is well preserved beyond the house next to an empty pool. Very nice setting on a slight hill.",
          "This house that belonged to Hemingway was a nice visit, still has the furniture and items used by Hemingway including his boat. Worth the visit for any Hemingway fan. Gives a great view of how he lived in Havana and the view from the tower is great.",
          "Though you can't go inside, you get very good views of the rooms from the open windows (they are closed when it rains) and the grounds are fun to explore. The guides we met were very friendly and helpful.",
          "Although a small museum, it is a key place to visit if you are a fan of Hemingway. You can see how his house was last left - from the books he had on the shelf to the music he was listening to. Similarly, you get to see his pet cemetery and boat as well. We recommend a",
          "One of the highlights of our Cuban Trip. House is preserved exactly the way it was when he lived there. His boat , the Pilar, is also on site. Well worth the visit. The movie \"Papa in Havana\" was filmed in the house.",
          "After viewing the film PAPA about Hemingway it was wonderful to view the rooms, the pool the boat. Worth the time!",
          "This is one of the must see sites in Cuba. When you see this property with all it's animal trophies on the wall then his pet Cemetary and cock fighting ring on the estate you see some of the many contradictions in Hemingways life.",
          "A visit to the Hemingway Museo is of course a historical must, and quite interesting to see where he lived when in Havana. You are only allowed a look into the doorway of his estate, but one can view what his home setting was really like. There is a caretaker/visitor building",
          "we were provided a guided tour, which was informative and easy to follow. We got a real sense of how Hemingway lived and worked here. The home and it's interiors are immaculate- untouched by time. You arent able to go inside, but you can poke you head in the doorways and",

          "The Hemingway home is a trip back into the days when Havana was a different world. It certainly is well worth a visit, and goes a long way toward illustrating the appeal of Havana from the 1930s to 1950s. Everything is here, from the house, to the boat, Pilar, and even the",
          "well worth the extra CUCs to get out there in the chauffeured 1957 Buicks. Our chauffeur was Carlos and quite interesting. Hemingway's house is about 15 kms from Havana but really interesting with a magnificent view from his \"writing turret\"",
          "We took a \" Hemingway tour\" in Havana. Went to visit vinca vigia as well as Floridian hotel which Hemingway frequented. Both places gave us a greater understanding of the man His home is just as he left it: clothes hanging, books on shelf, shoes on shoe rack. The mounted heads",

          "We had a guided tour, I think by Isabel. Excellent English, a Hemingway scholar. We observed folks with mobility issues struggling with stairs. Public bathrooms are pretty bad. Bring your own tissues and a coin for the attendant who manually flushes toilets with buckets",
          "This site is about a 45 min drive from downtown, and worth the trip. The house has all the original furniture, books, decorations, and looks like Hemingway still lives there. Great piece of history that should not be missed. Walk the grounds, go down the pool, and then a little",
          "Very nice estate, and piece of American literary history right there in Cuba. Can't go inside the house, but you can observe from outside (windows & doors open). Can get a bit overrun with tourist/buses, so try to go earlier in the day to avoid (if possible).",
          "The property is great for strolling around. Make sure you get down to the empty pool and see the beautiful, custom boat. Fun to peak in the windows!",
          "A beautiful home frozen in time. You can imagine the starry sky in his telescope and peek into a graciously decorated suite of rooms. His boat rigged for some pretty serious fishing. If you can climb stairs a view of his writing space is noteworthy.",
          "It will take about 30 minutes on a \" classic\" car to get to Finca Vigia from Vedado. It's def worth it if you are a Hemingway fan . Unfortunately you can't get into the house but all windows are open and items are very well displayed in clear site. His boat is in the backyard ,",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Morro Castle (Spanish: Castillo de los Tres Reyes Magos del Morro), named after the three biblical Magi, is a fortress guarding the entrance to Havana bay in Havana, Cuba. The design was drawn up by the Italian engineer Battista Antonelli; originally under the control of Spain, the fortress was captured by the British in 1762, and was returned to the Spanish under treaty terms a year later.The Morro fortress in Havana shares its name with structures in Santiago de Cuba and the Castillo de San Felipe del Morro in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In this case,  the Spanish \"morro\" means a rock which is very visible from the sea and therefore serves as a navigational landmark. Perched on the promontory on the opposite side of the harbor from Old Havana, it can be viewed from miles around as it dominates the port entrance. Built initially in 1589 in response to raids on Havana harbor, el Morro protected the mouth of the harbor with a chain being strung out across the water to the fort at La Punta.\n\n\n== Seven Years War ==\n\nIt first saw action in 1762, while under the command of Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla. The British expedition against Cuba under Lord Albemarle landed in Cojimar to the east of Havana and attacked the fortress from its landward side. The fort fell when the British successfully mined one of its bastions. When the British handed the island back in 1763 to Spain, the fortress at La Caba\u00f1a was built to prevent this from happening again.\n\n\n== Exhibition ==\nInside the gates is an exhibition on the lighthouses of Cuba \u2013 El Morro once housed a school for lighthouse keepers. There was actually a watchtower here until the British blew it up during their successful siege in 1762. The Faro Castillo del Morro lighthouse was added in 1846.\nThe cannons around the fort are now badly rusted, but the walls are well preserved. The fort has central barracks up to four stories high. A small underwater archeology exhibition is also located here. Noteworthy are the old latrines and their chute into the sea, as are the two sets of doors and the drawbridge mechanism. The current harbor master's office is still housed in the fortress. A plaque dedicated by the ambassador of the United Kingdom commemorates the 1762 siege, and a small memorial is located between two strong powder rooms in the northeast bastion.\nA small turret at the end of the wall offers views of the sea crashing onto the rocks 20 meters below, and of the huge dry moat. The opposite side of the moat holds more modern guns and cannons, La Bateria de Velasco, and offers a sweeping view down to Cojimar.\n\n\n== El ca\u00f1onazo de las 9 ==\nThe complex is now part of a historical park, along with the El Morro fortress, and houses several museums open to the public. Every night a cannon is fired at 9pm, the so-called \"El Ca\u00f1onazo de las 9\" is a leftover custom kept from colonial times signaling the closure of the city gates.\n\n\n== Appearances in culture ==\n\n\n=== Art ===\nMorro Castle can be seen in the background of John Singleton Copley's oil painting Watson and the Shark (1778).\n\n\n=== Film ===\nMorro Castle appears in the movie The Ghost Breakers (1940), in the background as Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard enter the harbor by ship.\nThe climactic scenes from The Big Boodle (1957) starring Errol Flynn were shot at Morro Castle in pre-Castro Cuba.\nDuring his life, the Castro regime imprisoned the Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas (1943-1990) at El Morro Castle for criticism of the government. The film version of Arenas's autobiography, Before Night Falls (2000), starring Javier Bardem, features scenes set in El Morro Castle prison. (A fortress in Mexico City doubled for the prison, since the filmmakers were not allowed to film in Cuba.)\n\n\n=== Publications ===\nThe Cuban writer Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverr\u00eda (1815-1885) published his only novel, Antonelli (1839), in the periodical La Cartera Cubana in three parts. An historical novel in the tradition of Walter Scott, Antonelli describes the love triangle among Antonelli, a Spanish soldier, and the planter's daughter they both love. Morro Castle is the setting for many of the book's events, including its tragic finale.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Overview Begun in 1589, Havana's landmark fort is named for the Reyes Magos -- the Magi or Three Kings of Bethlehem, who are the patrons of its chapel -- and for the fact that it occupies a morro (promontory) at the harbor entrance. It and its sister fort...more Address:\nCarretera de la Cabana, Havana Cuba ",
          "Gives you good views of the harbour and you can see how this could be a good defence position against the pirates! Lots of history and, of course, you can buy cigars and rum here!",
          "On the edge of the shore, watching and protecting. Went there with a taxi, you cannot go on foot, because you have to cross the tunnel. Wonderful view of the Caribbean.",
          "Transport yourself 5 centuries back and picture a colonial city attacked by Pirates, and you will feel a great sensation of wonder and excitement, simply a must see in yhis beautiful city.",
          "Visited her after the recommendation of our local hero! It\u2019s surly did not disappoint, the panoramic view from the top was incredible. It\u2019s a small cost of 6cuc per person & you can spend as long as you like looking around at the grounds & artefacts etc. We couldn\u2019t go up inside",
          "My husband and I found this place rather disappointing. The views over Havana were fantastic as it is on the other side of the harbour to Central and Old Havana. That being said there was little to no signage telling you any of the history of the place and where there was any",
          "Castillo De Los Tres Reyes Del Morro is a fort designed by an Italian engineer. It was erected between 1589 and 1630 to protect the entrance to Havana harbor from pirates and foreign invaders. The lighthouse is a pinnacle in the Havana skyline that you can see as you approach",
          "This is 1 of the 2 fortress built to defend Havana harbour. This is a Photo Op location that overlooks Havana. The fort was built to defend Havana from pirates.",
          "Wow, what a cool fortress. It is one of the best sites we saw in Havana. Lots of cool tunnels throughout the fort and great views from the walls. Cool place for photos and there are vendors outside and a upscale gift shop inside with cigars and rum. Also a place for snacks",
          "My husband and I toured Havana while on cruise with Royal Caribbean, and this was one of our sightseeing stops. At the entrance of Havana Harbour stands El Castillo De Los Tres Reyes Del Morro. It was designed by Italian engineer Juan Bautista Antonelli and built by slaves",
          "It is a vey nice place to see and have also great views from Havana. Intersting and full of history, quite well preserved.",
          "We spent several hours on our visit and picked a day with a local art festival, what a jewel. Great experience and amazing history, we went late afternoon so got lucky with the golden hour of picture taking.",

          "We were amazed at the construction of this place. Keep in mind there are a lot of stairs and uneven floors. It took us back in time. They are repairing the lighthouse attached. There is a cannon show every night at 9pm. I am unsure if there is a fee for this as we did not have a",
          "There are a lot of great chances to get pictures from here. Great views of the city and would recommend coming here just for that.",
          "Another fort, but the views are lovely. You see it as you enter Havana harbor, and here it stands, still solidly built, falling apart in some spots somwear sturdy shoes and have a fellow traveler take your picture.",

          "This site is breath taking and you get an amazing view on the Havana bay and alao the Havana city. Then taking pics up close with the tunel is another thing you dont or cant really do everywhere. Not in Canada you dont! But in Cuba, you are LIBRE to do anything and anywhere.",
          "This is of course only one of the features of the el Morro fort, visible from most of the Malecon. It is amazing that the builders were able to construct this without the use of modern equipment. It stands as a testament to solid building practices, as well as the extreme",
          "Seriously this place was awesome...i wish I had more time to see it all and that they had better tour guides...opened at 10 closed at 930 after the ceremony which was to fire the cannon....i think it's the largest fort I have ever scene and well preserved. Good times",
          "Well worth the stop and the entry fee to walk about the morro and if you have time go through the castle. A \"morro\" is a rounded hill or promontory usually rocky. The castle sits on top of the morro. The view back over the harbor is a great photo op as well as a great",
          "We stopped here on our way out of town. I usually hate tourist stops. But this was worth the time. The views back to Havana were breathtaking.",
          "Walking through the Morro not only provides a view of the fort in 1500's but a great view of Havana. A lot of kiosks to buy artesanias, drinks and a lot of music.",
          "The entry fee in Jan 2017 was $6 (6 CUC). It was totally worth the visit, and it's better if you come with a local guide who knows about the history of this fort. It's one of the three that was built by the Spanish, but this was by far the most interesting one.",
          "The Castillo, also known as El Morro (there is even a second listing under that name on TripAdvisor) is very well visible across the channel from the Havana Malecon at the Paseo del Prado junction. It provides a lovely backdrop for people photography on the busy Malecon",
          "This is an easy trip across the harbour to Casablanca. The fort provides good views of Havana from across the water. The walk to the fort is not long with interesting attractions on the way including the lookout and a display of missiles, planes and other military weapons used",
          "you can get up the lighthouse and see the narrow entrance of the harbor and the coast line of the city.",
          "3 Morro (rock promontory where the fort sits) Castles were built by the Spanish in the Caribbean, 2 of them in Cuba (1 in PR). El Morro Castle in Havana is an excellent example of how to fuse man-made pieces into natural surroundings, the Castle itself looks like part of the",
          "What a beautiful view! We were able to experience the castle on our tour. \"Our group\" even took a little side adventure when the tour guide and the rest of the people went back to the bus. After we came out of the little shops there's a tunnel before you head back down the",
          "\"morro\" means rock in Spanish, which this fort is and it has served as a navigational landmark, perched on the rock promontory opposite Old Havana. Built in 1589, Morro Castle was constructed to protect the mouth of Havana harbor from foreign raids & pirates. It is impressive",
          "The visit of this Castle is really a must as it is one of the best preserved ones in the whole Caribbean. Intersting from an architectonical point, you can imagine its function when they closed the entrance to the inner harbour with a chain so that the pirates and other enemies",
          "This fort is on the other side of the channel from the main part of Havana. The channel leads to the Havana Harbor, so as one would imagine it was a prime spot for a fortress. The fort itself is on many different levels all with spectacular views of Havana. Much of the"

          "A nice place worth the visit. It was $7 or $9 to enter the fort and walk around. The bathroom is $1 to get in but large and clean. We did not use a guide but walked around and it was a site to see..different but comparable to the fort in San Juan.",
          "Interesting historical stone fort with canons & lighthouse. Lighthouse was closed when we were there but apparently is normally open. Very large open areas, nicely preserved. Some information on placards around, can get a great sense of the importance of this fort on the river leading into the city's harbour.",
          "It's neat here but you can't explore much. Don't buy from the cigar vendor here, no matter how many times your tour guide assures you it's the cheapest place in Havana/Cuba...it's definitely not!",
          "Yeah... kind of good to see, but is is breath taking? Nope.\n\nIf you keen to walk - walk through Old Havana to the Terminal de Ferris and catch a line cross the channel (Casa Blanca) - easy to navigate and hike from there.\n\nIt takes about 25 \u2026",
          "We bought a government day tour from Veradero to checkout some of the tourist spots in Havana. The castillo was by-far the nicest part - yet sadly the one where you are kind of rushed through. We managed to sneak off the beaten path, past \u2026",
          "Quite a large fortress. Several historical periods can be seen in the area. Impressive big and rusty guns. Superb views of the Havana is the best thing about this place.",
          "Great historical figure that shows the resilience of the Spanish / Cubans from pirate attacks during the birth of this very historically rich country.",
          "Amazing fortress. But nos so nice staff. Nothing extraordinary aside from the views outside the handcraft feria.",
          "6cuc and can can walk around it in 10mins. Lighthouse padlocked and no museum (as lonely planet advertises). Views just as good from outside / at the other fort. Didnt get a ticket receipt and was not checked at entrance so guess money was pocketed...",

          "Stunning views across the whole of Havana. Although not steeped with information concerning the building, the architecture is close to breathtaking.",
          "Views are incredible and learning about the history was amazing! Suggest doing a tour, signs are mostly in English and Spanish so if you don\u2019t speak Spanish you\u2019d still be able to learn a lot. It\u2019s a very large space so plan an hour or so to really walk around and take it in",
          "what an amazing tour and place with lots of history. enjoyed the views and also the inside of the castle is just a playground for photography    I highly recommend for anyone to visit this place when in Havana",
          "Definitely a spot everyone should visit when in Cuba. A lot of history and excellent views of old Havana.",
          "Loved my experience in the country and enjoyed learning about the history. The ride to get there in the classic car, under the tunnel and the view of the harbor are all splendid. Also got an opportunity to see where the late Che lived. So much to richness!",

          "Nice view of La Habana. A small market is located on it and a rum/cigar shop is inside.",
          "Worse experience, they don't have a real Cuban experience, no Cuban food and also they don't treat Cuban people. This place is so racists with Cubans. Pls don't go there, they even have local products, only imported products and the price \u2026",
          "This was amazing.  The history, the views, and the layout.  Parents watch your children as there are many deadly dropoffs. Take the time to walk the castle.   Was one of the more thrilling stops on a private tour.",

          "This is one of the iconic places in Havana which speaks volumes about the history of Cuba and remains as and important landmark together with the sea wall in old Havana.",

          "Lovely city with lots of history and charm! Cubans are really nice people!",
          "I was amazed by how big this Castle is! The views from the castle are amazing you can see all of Cuba from here. It costs 6 cuc if you're a tourist to visit it. You can take a bus from the central park which will take you and pick you up for only 5 cuc.",
          "Nice convertible taxi ride over. lovely perspective of the city from the other side of the bay. An Outpost to protect the city from invading ships and pirates back in the day. Lots of  good access no railings so be careful.. row of vendors selling trinkets at the top.",
          "What a beautiful place",
          "Awesome views, 8cuc to get in, you will need to walk a lot, so those that can not walk, it not suggested. (Stairs, steps, hilly grassy area, ruggedly stones steps) mind you personal belonging, when we were there, there were 3 kids begging \u2026",

          "A beautiful fort/castle built by the Spaniards. It is one of the first things you see aboard a cruise ship as it arrives in Havana Bay. Only takes about an hour to 90 minutes to walk the grounds, and I highly recommend it. You will find old cannons that were used to protect Havana.",
          "Visited Cuba while on a Cruise for a total of 7 hours.  Best to visit as an teen or older to appreciate the history.  We walked around the tourist spots without any issues, people are very friendly. All the stories about the old American cars are true. Very odd to see a bottle of Havana Club rum cost less than a good cigar.",
          "Interesting visit. Folks are kind of antisocial, but that's fine.",

          "This castle and fort are amazing. Incredible views. You will feel like you are in Pirates of the Carribean. There is a museum in the fort with models of La Nina, Phinta and Santa Maria. I wish we could have gone up the lighthouse but it was \u2026",
          "Great bit of history & excellent entrance into Havana much better than airport",

          "Cool!",
          "Pretty architecture,  great guides, cigars over  priced, more people can speak English there than in south Florida.  Horrible living conditions. The Russians built some great roads though. I would be building a raft to get out.",
          "Best place to have a panoramic view of the city",
          "Great history and views of Havannah. One thing they don't prepare you for is if you want a tour be prepared to pay. Definitely a tourist trap with shopping. Shops up and down the walk here so a pro is you can get all gifts done in one place but a definite con is too much distraction when trying to learn the history.",
          "It was okay. It was part of the Excursion that we bought from the cruise ship. I didn't have much time to look around, talk to the locals or listen to the history Like I wanted to. If I were to do it again I would go off on my own and find a local tour guide so I could go at my own pace.",
          "Beautiful castle with great views and a solid exhibit detailing the castle's history. The views of the city if Havana and the ocean from the parapets is incredible, especially in the late afternoon. Unfortunately we showed up kind of late, \u2026",
          "This century old fortres is a good place to visit. You will have a great view at the sky-line of La Habana and the fortres it self is spacious and very original.  it is still in its originl state and it gives you a good feeling of how it \u2026",

          "Everything about Cuba was fabulous.  The architecture was incredible.",

          "The building had no power when we visited and the locals will take advantage of any opportunity to close or keep tourists out. If you know Spanish like me you will catch on to their strategies quite quickly. Pretty much all the locals \u2026",
          "It is the perfect place to appreciate the city and beautiful sunsets",
          "You have to take a taxi to reach this location. At the fort, you have a spectacular view of the ocean and some shops tucked away in a open corridor.  The prices of the goods were more expensive when compared to the market down by the train station( only 5 blocks or so from the cruise dock).",
          "It is a nice Castillo. Go early so you don't get all the tourists and the sun. If you want a great view, go to that watch tower.",

          "A beautiful period fortress from the Spanish conquest of Cuba.",
          "Beautiful views of Old Havana, and New Havana, called el Vendado. The iconic castle guards the Atlantic Ocean, and the entrance to the bay. The grounds around it are immaculately cleaned, and the old 1950's pastel and bright colored cars, provide a typical accent to the area.",
          "Nice place a lot of history",
          "Cuba was awesome.  Taken a private tour not one from your ship.  We took a private tour in a 56 Chevy.  Cost was 1/4 of what the ship tour is on a bus with Cuban government guide.  We got the real story of life in Cuba.",
          "Really awesome historical site. As an American visiting for the first time, obviously wish we had more time, but hope to go back again. FYI to fellow Americans,  no real safety standards like here, so watch your step.",

          "Incredible old fortification from the 1500's.  Each evening they do a cannon ceremony in the same way it's always been done.  Pomp and circumstance.  A wonderful look back at history.  The interiors of the castle have vendors set up to sell all manner of locally made items.",

          "Beautiful piece of history",
          "Nice historic place. A lot of history on its walls.",
          "This is a nice historical site, you get to see the colonial fort and even the canons. Be careful when you're on the ledge, there is no safety barrier setup, so you need to watch where you are going. The bus tours to Havana usually stop here on the way back to Varadero.",
          "Great view of the city. The fort itself is still in quite good shape. The underground tunnels are a little dirty but totally worth exploring if you can find an entrance! ",

          "We had our taxi driver take us here. It's awesome. There is also a huge turtle who apparently lives here. To think that all this was made by one guy is amazing. He's like a local Gaudi.",
          "Definitely worth a visit! The mind boggles at the talent of this man. Very creative and expressive. Take your camera!",
          "To be fair, this was somewhat interesting to see the artistic vision of those who inhabit the area. However, this is basically an alley turned into a freaky artist enclave. Most of the art is offbeat and not my style. The general vibe is a bit sketchy, and there are dancers,e",
          "Visited as part of a tour and a little rushed through would of liked more time to study the workmanship. Love that the neighborhood is jumping onboard with the ceramics. Watch the pet turtle.sneaked up behind me and pinched my arse (god love him).",
          "Very impressive especially if you like surrealist art. We combined this with a convertible car trip so got to see parts of Havana which not everyone sees e.g. the embassies, Havana forest , John Lennon Park and the necropolis / cemetery. We only had 30 minutes at Fusterlandia",
          "a little out of the way but worth it. remarkable site with over the top creativity. lots of nice artwork for sale",
          "I've always been in love with mosaic art, ever since I saw Park Guell by Gaudi in Barcelona. This is a personal creation by Jose Fuster, his own home, and then the neighbors contracted him to do facades on theirs as well. Its creative, unique and fun. And for someone that",
          "We had to see Fusterlandia whilst visiting Havana. It is quite out of the way though and there\u2019s not much around once you\u2019ve walked round. It is very colourful and unique and hard to imagine how long it must have taken to complete. There is also a local bus stop and several",
          "It was so interesting to see all the effort that this family has made in this area. So colorful and amazing and they are continuing to add new features. Definitely worth seeing.",
          "Wonderful fun day trip. Everywhere you look is great mosic art. Many sculptures and whimsy art pices.",
          "Fusterlandia is a unique display of sculptures and mosaics. Although some people consider it to be similar to Gaudi's work in Barcelona, Spain, I believe Gaudi's work is far superior.",
          "Fusterlandia is a unique experience created by Cuban artist, Jose Fuster. It is a short taxi ride from Old Havana. The place is small, easy to walk around, and extremely worthwhile. We spent about 2 hours, including buying souvenirs, and had plenty of time for more experiences",
          "When researching places to go in Havana, this was on my list. I HAD to see these unique and beautiful pieces in person. It did not disappoint. When my private tour guide (Nely Havana Car Tour) asked where I wanted to go, this was one of them. She took us here and explained a lot",
          "Took a taxi to Fusterlandia. It was smaller than we thought but wonderfully creative and colourful. Some lovely original and local art being sold by the artists. Well worth a visit",
          "The artist Fuster has created a wonderland in his own neighborhood. Not only is the area where he creates his mosaic pieces covered with his whimsical work, Fuster has decorated his entire neighborhood. It's enchanting!",
          "A melange of sculpture and design using tile. Very Gaudi-esque.Also a nice drive through the city to get there",
          "Amazing house and work of one man, fascinating to walk around the village and see all the other areas - do go for a wander if you just see the house you're missing out on some other exceptional murals.",
          "The owner of Casa Aurora took us there. A crazy area, full of art and recycled artifacts. Full of color and interesting welcoming people with a smile on their faces, explaining about this territory and history. A girl told me that Fast and the Furious shot scenes here.",
          "Go and visit, art paying homage to Gaud\u00ed. Negotiated a vintage taxi ride out there who waited whilst we visited and brought us back. Top visit.",
          "We had a short visit to Fusterlandia. It was a cool spot to take pictures and revel on the details of the place. It was cure fun and interesting. If you're visiting Havana, you should try to get to Fuster for some cool pics!",
          "We visited Fusterlandia during our Classic car tour. It wasn't part of the original itinerary but having seen reviews I asked if we could go there during our tour. Its an amazing area with so much to see, its nice to be able to walk around at no cost. You can take photos apart",
          "I had no idea this was going to be such an amazing stop on our tour! It was a bit of a rainy day in Cuba. By the time we got there, the rain had stopped, but we had to be very careful walking on the mosiacs because they are slippery when wet! I absolutely loved exploring the",
          "Senor Fuster was there when we visited. He granted me a pic with him and even autographed a piece of art I bought.",
          "Beautiful hand made clay tiles, pottery and artworks on 3 levels in this outdoor exhibit. Don't miss this if you get to Havana. Make a special trip to Jaimanitas, if you can!",
          "We went on a tour of the Fusterland exhibit, and it was not disappointing. The artist is very progressive and the artwork exquisite!! When you that in the view on the second floor you feel the culture and itt was great for photos, etc. A definite must see.",
          "On our tour of Havana we stopped here to walk through the area. The tile work was extensive. We climbed to the top of one of the buildings for an overview of all the buildings. It is a very interesting area.",
          "\u2026Have you ever heard of Fusterlandia\u2026probably not\u2026 Should you visit Fusterlandia when in Havana\u2026absolutely\u2026 \u2026 Jos\u00e9 Fuster has taken this small suburb and turned it into a gallery of mosaics for the time\u2026 Neighborhood houses, buildings and businesses, restaurant and the roadside,",
          "Amazing art park! Must see in Havana. Super cool photo ops, plus a great view at the top!!! Good for all ages, would even be fun for kids to play around. Also little shops for souvenirs around.",
          "If you are in Havana you must see this mosaic fairyland created by Jose Fuster. You will be amazed. Wear your walking shoes because it is best to check it all out on foot. It is whimsical, funny and very appealing.",
          "It is like an oasis, you are driving and suddenly you are in a neighborhood covered in mosaic tile. Once we walked into the actual home site, I kept expecting Dr.Seuss characters to appear. It is so magical that The Cat in the Hat or Horton would feel right at home!",
          "Artist Jose Fuster created his major work in his hometwon of Jaimanitas. Fuster was famous for his use of colours in his child-like work. He was sometimes compared to Gaudi. The site of his art and sculptures made for an entertaining 2 hours of wonderment.",
          "Not by design we stopped at Fusterlandia. Absolutely worth your time. Sure wish that we had planned more time for the visit. Truely interesting.",
          "I had no idea what to expect, but the delightful mosaic area felt a little like we had been transported into a cartoon. The art and colors are fun and interesting. I admire the creativity to turn a house and the grounds into a sprawling piece of art. It's charming.",
          "We were able to go without a Big bus tour and left just as one showed up so were were able to stroll and take some pix. This gent was inspired by the Spanish architecture of Antoni Gaudi and brought it back to his neighborhood. The locals and artist that live in the area are",
          "Amazing neighborhood covered in mosaic. Truly amazing! Must see if you love quirky art or can appreciate the time and effort that has gone into it.",
          "We had our tour driver take us to Fusterlandia--about a 20 minute drive from Old Havana. Loved it! Inspired by Gaudi and Picasso, Jose Fuster began tiling his home with mosaics and over many years the art work has spread through the neighborhood. It's beautiful and quirky and",
          "We saw so much on the ride there and the artistry and craftsmanship were so much more than pictures can do justice!",
          "So we had a free afternoon in Havana and hopped in a coco taxi & headed to Fusterlandia. The ride itself was great fun and our driver was extraordinarily kind enough to give us a guided tour on our way. Once there he waited as transport is not that great, what an amazing place",
          "Drove out to Fusterlandia from the Vedado. At first glimpse, the tiled artwork seemed a fine, if not eccentric, touch to the small neighborhood within which the art resides. Then you walk down the street and come up to Fuster\u2019s house. And that\u2019s when the senses overload with",
          "A great place to visit to see the amazing artwork done by hand. Don't miss this one! The artwork is so intricate in detail, you gotta see it to believe it!",
          "The artist created this place as his love of Gaudi's work inspired him. Made completely from mosaic tiles. It's a pleasure to see. It's in a neighbourhood about 20mins drive out of Havana, there are some small stalls too where you can buy paintings and trinkets, bringing much",
          "No photo can do justice to the explosion of colour that is Fusterlandia. the sheer number of mosaics and the incredible variety is mind-blowing - it was probably the most colourful place we have visited anywhere. It's toward the outskirts of the city so make the most of that",
          "Actually never heard of this place but our guide from Cubaoutings took us here What a pleasant surprise! Hard to believe one man had done all this.",
          "Fabulous little neighborhood just outside Havana decorated completely in mosaic tiles. Whimsical, colorful and fun! A must see when visiting Havana.",
          "Want to create a picture that will jump out you, look no further. Me and my friends decided to do a photo shoot here. The pictures came out PERFECT! The art was is so beautiful, at each turn there was some else to capture. The colors are amazing. It was like walking into an",
          "Do NOT miss this small neighborhood about a half hour drive from Old Havana. It is an amazing compact neighborhood completely embellished with mosaic tile work that was started by the original artist Fuster. His neighbors soon followed suit and it is an eclectic and eye popping",
          "Can\u2019t believe we almost missed this! We had a choice between Hemingway and fusterlandia because they were on opposite sides! This was fabulous! Nothing like you could ever imagine! Closed for lunch until 2 and very hot in the afternoon so try to get there in between!",
          "Fusterlandia is like walking into a completely different world. It feels like you've walked into Parc Guel and I actually learnt afterwards that it is an homage to Gaud\u00ed. There are lots of shops and vendors in the area so you can pick up lots of neat things. I recommend taking a",
          "This was a nice stop on our tour of Havana. The Artist spread his vision to much of the neighborhood and it was a treat to walk around and explore. Plus there was a nice breeze which tempered the afternoon heat.",
          "unique epxerience was a stop on our private tour in a convertible car. A beautiful site shows how one individuals vision for beauty can transform a country that is in disrepair in many areas.",
          "Fusterlandia was a surprising delight. It is about 20 minute outside the city center and can be done in less than half a day. We took a classic car from our AirBNB and he waited while we toured the site. Lots of picture opportunities. bring some cash because you might want to",
          "One of our favorite stops during our stay. The art s really cool! It is a little but 9f a ride from Old Havana but very worth it.",
          "If you time is limited in Havana, give it a miss. His home and neighborhood are interesting, but it feels like a real tourist spot. The food is only OK.",
          "The entire neighbourhood is covered in art. Fusterlandia is still a work in progress. Every time you come here something new is added. A huge work inspired by Gaudi and Picasso among others. The house it self is one big mosaic. On the terraces you get a view on the different",
          "Went there to take some cool pictures! It takes quite a while to get there from Havanna Vieja but is absolutely worth it",
          "You really have to see this it is so intricate. Pictures cannot do it justice. Four levels in the house that is mainly open air. Plan at least half an hour for your stop to be able to absorb this.",
          "Fun stop on our touring with Blexie . Having been in Barcelona only six moths ago , it seemed familiar .",
          "The whole town here is covered in art by the artist Jose Fuste . It is done in the style of Gaudi and he has covered the neighbors walls, gates and redid every inch of his studio. It is a magical area.",
          "We visited on May 06 2019. This was one of the high points of our trip to Havana. After seeing the Gaudi areas in Barcelona we were amazed how nice Mr Fusters Havana home was. I recommend this to any visitor to Havana. There are areas that require climbing stairs to see the",
          "Sooo Much artistic work in one tiny place!! I can't believe the imagination and WORK that has gone not only in the one property but the WHOLE neighborhood! Simply Beautiful and Wondrous. A Must See!!",
          "What a fascinating artist Jose Fuster is! His gallery is filled with amazing mosaics that spill into the streets. A \u201cdo not miss\u201d experience.",
          "This area has been tiled by a local artist, it is really something to see. I took a local \"coco\" taxi which provided an excellent way to see the suburbs on the way there",
          "I would never expect to find such art in Havana. It\u2019s like if Gaudi himself built this house and almost an entire neighbourhood. Absolutely don\u2019t miss it. If you\u2019re lucky you may meet the artist.",
          "Neat mosaic area with lots to see. We took a taxi from Old Havana and wandered around for about 1 hour. Take lots of pictures!",
          "We took the drive out to Fusterlandia, and even though the house was closed that morning, we could enjoy much of it from the road, and the mosaics continue throughout the neighborhood - really lovely, creative, whimsical. There are vendors in the neighborhood selling arts and",
          "A fascinating project by a prominent artist who decorated his house and now several neighbors. We were happy we saw it but would not have been devastated if we had missed it. The Havana art scene is amazing",
          "A little Picasso, a little folksy. A very interesting place to visit and probably excellent for kids.",
          "We visited Fusterlandia as part of our classic car tour and I am so happy we stoped. This place is magical! Eclectic art mosaic everywhere you look. My art loving daughter (age 6) loved it as well however she was not allowed on the top overlook as a safety precaution. It is a",
          "While on a Old Car Tour, we stopped at this place. Very interesting story of an artist who started placing mosaic tiles on his place, then the neighbors asked him to do the same. Now, and entire city block is covered in these colorful tiles! Some income-producing attractions",
          "This man inspired his entire neighborhood to incorporate recycle materials into art installations. It is definitely worth a visit. Loved the mosaics.",
          "On our recent trip to Havana, my boyfriend and I visited Fusterlandia on our classic car ride tour. It was really amazing to see in person and unlike any other place I have seen in the world. Do not miss this if you visit Havana and appreciate art! It\u2019s also a great spot to take",
          "\"Gaudi on steroids\", from a guide book - a quirky must-see. Try to check when the house is open - it was closed Mon/Tues and between 12-2. We got there by getting the hop-on-hop-off bus, then a 1 CUC bus journey. Took a long time, but good sightseeing on the way. Of course, a",
          "Very vivid colored tiles, packed with a lot of color-tiled arts and sculptures in a very small area. Very delightful with a lot of imaginary scenery.",
          "This was the highlight of our trip to Cuba. Absolutely breathtaking mosaic tile work throughout 3 stories of this \u201cmuseum\u201d. No admission fee and you don\u2019t need long to enjoy the artwork. 30-45 minutes is perfect. There are little souvenir shops in the district that offered",
          "It's a really must see. Especially because the story behind. It is more than art and more than pleasant to an eye",
          "This area does not take long to tour but it is very interesting. If you like modern art and mosaic, you would enjoy seeing this. We enjoyed the drive which is a little bit ouside the main downtown areas of Havana and we still had plenty of time to see sites in central Havana.",
          "I had no idea this existed until we ended up here as part of a tour in an open top car. Hard to figure out exactly what is going on but so much detail and colour made for a great unexpected trip. Worth a visit if you can find it!",
          "I admit this was not on my list of must see things in Havana. major mistake. Could have spent days instead of mere hours. Reminded me so much of Gaudi's work in Barcelona. Admittedly different style but similiar concept.",
          "We stopped at Fusterlandia as part of a tour stop with our cruise ship group (we were on a cruise through RCCL). This place was SO cool and was such an interesting place to visit. It is so colorful and you'll get some amazing photos. Enjoy!",
          "This is a very strange little part of town and very interesting. It is one or two blocks of small residences that have been absolutely covered in small tiles to make mosaics. It feels a bit like Gaudi was let loose here. There's one area on the main street where you can climb",
          "I didn\u2019t even know to ask to go here. Our tour guide took us. The neighborhood and this man\u2019s home are spectacular. I have never seen anything like it.",
          "the neighborhood has tiles on their front walls /gates but Fusterlandia has many designs and figures all done in broken tile.. a pain staking effort but it is quite interesting ... this is only one lot size so will not take long but worth the trip if you like this type of art.",
          "Our guide recommended we visit Fusterlandia and we were glad we did. Fusterlandia had a Gaudi like feel. We enjoyed touring the house and walking down the streets seeing all the whimsically decorated houses and walls. I'm glad we stopped as it's a place I never expected to",
          "While visiting Havana, our tour guide took us to visit this magical and breathtaking place. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to walk into and experience a seemingly 3D artistic experience. From the gates to the walls, floors and pool art was everywhere. The tour guides gave",
          "This is an amazing installation of art. Jose Fuster created a whimsical and fanciful art display. He has done the whole community in mosaics. A feast for the eyes and little artist shops. Definitely a must see.",
          "Vibrant, artsy fun. Lots of vendors and in some cases a lot of the same stuff. But you can find the handmade, artisan leatherworks, photos etc. The vendors are nice and willing to bargain a bit.",
          "The over the top number of mosaics created with colored glass and stones, grotesquely similarly decorated statues, the child like paintings and the high prices for any souvenir make this a less than attractive place to visit. If you go, spend time in the independently owned",
          "Wow! An eye opening, not to be missed experience. Beautiful mosaic and painted artwork. Go early to get pictures before the crowds arrive.",
          "This is a wonderful fantasy place to visit. It is very whimsical and amusing. We had been to Cuba a few times before and finally had the chance to visit Fusteriandia. The children will love climbing and will enjoy the fanciful building. Speak to a tour guide about the",
          "Inspired by Gaudi in Barcelona ,Fuster mosaiced his whole house from top to bottom in over the top mosaic art. The neighborhood loved it so that all the neighbors wen to their gates to look the same hence Fusterlandia! Do not miss As someone else said to get there you go past",
          "We joined a couple we met on our tour who were going to visit here, we got a taxi from Havana. It's an impressive place and very unusual. The mosiacs and artwork have sread throughout the village along walls, over rooftops. Well worth a visit",
          "<Excerpt from travelogue, Leaving from the Old Havana Waterfront. Figure a CUC per minute for the cab - also worth it.> After about 25 minutes of riding or so, during which we took in the sights of the embassies along Quinta Avenida, we made a right turn down a side street to",
          "Definitely outside the box for tourist attractions in the area. We decided to take an old car tour , a1957 Chevy out to Fusterlandia. This was not a tour it was strictly a taxi camera it however our driver was fluent in English had attended college and was very knowledgeable",
          "We visited Fusterlandia the last day of our tour. It's an amazing community with one main decorated house and then the whole neighborhood is decorated by the same artist. At noon they closed the main house except for our group which had lunch in the courtyard. Great",
          "The Fusertandia modern art work of this artist must be seen too beleive. All of the mosaic tiles were put on the the owner / artist. It should be on the do do list if in Havana",
          "It was ok......Everything was made by the owner of the house, then he retired( he's 75 now) and he left it to his kids. Everything was made from cut tiles....He also did the whole neighborhood.",
          "Fuster began creating images with tiles to add to the beauty of his neighborhood. The community around him joined in. The creativity shown is amazing. There are also a number of \"souvenir\" shops outside the actual Fusterlandia. Unlike other shops they accept American dollars.",
          "Cute neighborhood in the style of Gaudi park in Barcelona. Fun to walk through, not totally clean neighborhood but we were well cared for.",
          "Amazing creation of art and sculpture inspired by Gaudi work from Spain. Like a wonderland of imagination. The lunch we had was very good too.",
          "This was on a list I wanted to see and our tour guide from Old Havana Cars had it on her list without us mentioning it. Just a fun stop",
          "Part of classic car tour, took a little while to get here but drive down was beautiful as is this place the work an passion is visable",
          "Visited as part of a vintage car tour. Created by the Cuban artist Jose Fuster, this place is intricately covered in tiles. Having started by designing his own home, he went on to design his neighbours. The 3 story building exhibits artist's work which are for sale , although",
          "We were on a guided tour and this was one of our stops. Unfortunately, when we arrived they had just closed. If you have been to Barcelona and have seen Guell Park with the works of Gaudi, then this is a much, much smaller version. These pieces of artwork is done by a",
          "Lots of mosaic creations with bold colors that brighten this neighborhood. If you love the work of Gaudi, then this place is not to be missed. Nice to spend a few hours here to take everything in. :P",
          "This place is a must see when you\u2019re in Havana, Cuba! The bright colors and whimsical mosaics that Jose Fuster has created and continues to create in this small neighborhood is so unique and beautiful that it\u2019s unlike any other! I personally think he is better than Gaudi in this",
          "We spend 10 days exploring Cuba and half of the island. Fusterlandia is on our top 10 must see places when in Havana Cuba. Within 20 minute ride from old Havana you can to the place that within walking distance you can see colorful place in typical Cuban style. Bring some CUC",
          "Jose Fuster is a Cuban artist who traveled to Europe and was very much influenced ay Pacaso, Miro and Gaudi. He wanted to create pubic works in the manner of Gaudi. First ,he decorated his own home and then those of his neighbors. The small village is very much like Gaudi's",
          "Inspired by Gaudi - you can walk around this outdoor area, up and down different levels of different art sections and a small gallery inside. There is some art throughout the neighborhood aside from the main section. Located 15 min drive from centro Havana - free entrance",
          "The mosaic art which covers this area is a fantasy come to life. If you don't read Spanish, ask someone to translate the mottoes which curl around doorways and roofs. The subjects of writing and designs seem naive and folk-loric but great love and community spirit imbue this",
          "This is truly amazing. It started when the artist, Fuster, started decorating his home - inside and out. The neighbors loved it so much they asked him to decorate their homes. The rest is history.",
          "Not the kind of art I would have personally but you can see that the detail and the creativity in the work. it's quite a sight to see",
          "This is where Alice would live in real life! What a place. A living at work to be explored and appreciated by all. It may not meet everyone's tastes, but it certainly has to be respected as a great work. Fuster has put well over 20 years of work and sweat into this and it shows.",
          "We were taken here on a tour and I was delighted. The work that one man has done in this place and surrounding area is incredible!",
          "I requested to be driven here on our private tour. We drove in a wonderful blue convertible classic car. So fun. It takes about 45 minutes to get there through nice residential streets and country embassy buildings. Fusterlandia is a very unique and creative residence made with",
          "We requested a visit Fusterlandia as part of a private tour as the neighbourhood is several miles from the city centre. A renowned artist has decorated every inch of his old house with colourful broken mosaic tiles and added unusual statues and formations to make the whole place",
          "Absolutely fabulous place, the mosaic tiles are everywhere, so clever, we loved it here, we were even serenaded by an elderly gentleman and his guitar. This place really is a must visit, it's crazy & brilliant and full of art, across the street there are shop's & stalls, we had",
          "This is a fun side trip. The whole neighborhood is done up in whimsical style. Several smaller galleries have sprung up in unison with Fuster's facility.",
          "I enjoyed it and the area. It\u2019s fun. Gaudi like. Area has small shops with art from local artists. Some have the usual tourist stuff. I bought a small piece from the artist. She was great to talk with and art is amazing. Creative.",
          "Not far from the Hemingway Marina, a small neighborhood embedded with mosaic tile artwork. I went alone and didn't learn much about the artist who had the original vision. It would be nice if they offered more tours.",
          "I was blown away by the amazing colors and figures in Fusterlandia. Really enjoyed seeing all the beauty.",
          "We visited Fusterlandia on a cruise ship tour. Our guide described it as a community art center. Although Fuster's work doesn't especially appeal to me, and I'm not sure I quite \"get\" what this is all about, it is interesting to see all the broken tile mosaics in Fuster's studio",
          "While visiting Havana this is a must se. A smaller version of Parc Gaudi in Barcelona. Not as classy as Barcelona but still worth seeing.",
          "Amazing to think one man could create so much from so little! Fuster started creating art from pieces of broken ceramics in the economic downturn in '91. Since then, what he has created in his own home and community is truly a tribute to humanity's ability to transform our own",
          "Such an amazing place, well worth seeing! The mosaics are inspiring. The project work is fantastic. Stop and admire the art work.",
          "We were in awe seeing a whole neighborhood project which showed commitment and unity. A neighborhood tiled from bits and pieces of glass, plaster, ceramic, otherwise thrown and discarded. One's man discard is another's treasure! The time and patience, organization required for",
          "Cruise to Cuba and on one of our day tours we visited Fusterlandia. Very unique, unusual and interesting. Had a feel of the Sagrada. The whole neighborhood was decorated in this style. Unfortunately there was not much more to see there.",
          "A very interesting community to visit. The artists home is open to everyone and free. It\u2019s sprawling and charming. Photos really do not tell the story. Fuster\u2019s painting are very Picasso-esque and reflect Cuba\u2019s culture. The mosaics are spectacular.",
          "Inspired by the work of Gaudi and Picasso, Cuban artist Jose Fuster has turned his home and the neighborhood village into a masterpiece tilework and kaleidoscopic colors - a street art extravaganza, an artsy village. The result is unofficially known as Fusterlandia, an",
          "We were so glad that our tour guide took us here. The kids and adults absolutely loved seeing all the art work. And the artist was there at his house, just playing some chess! He has such a creative mind. It's one of the main things that will stick with me in my memories of",

          "This place was fabulous! Could not believe how much work this must have been. Although it obviously was a work of love. We were fortunate enough to see the artist there. He was hopping on his scooter to leave.",
          "Our tour bus let us off to peruse through this fun neighborhood in the Havana suburb Miramar. Of course a comparison with the mosaics of Barcelona's Park G\u00fcell are obvious; however, the playfulness and whimsicality of Fusterlandia give this locale a totally different flavor. One",

          "Very interesting place. The artist, Jose Foster, has decorated his home with all kinds of fantasies made of ceramics. It was so outstanding that his neighbors asked to have their homes done.I think we found the Emerald City. It's certainly a horse of a different color.",

          "This reminded me a little of Gaudi in Barcelona....Fuster took the time to decorate his home and surrounding area with mosaic. Colorful and fun to see and imagine the work that went into this. The tiles themselves are amazing on the steps and around the house.",
          "This place was inspired by the artist's visit to Barcelona. He came back to his hometown and decorated his neighborhood with tile with a Gaudi-like influence but made it his own. I liked that he was inspired to come up with this creative project that is now helping his own",
          "We went in the morning and for some reason the gates were closed and they would not let anyone in but lots of people were coming out. Bad timing? Mid morning? Don't know. So we did not get inside. This was very disappointing as we could see over the top of the fence and it",
          "Fuster was influenced by the likes of Picasso, and Gaudi. as you enter one of the main residences, you will see the influence of Gaudi with the \"mosaic\" style art. You will also come across some of the Santeria , very typical of Cuba.",

          "We saw this as part of a choir tour in January 2016. It was a delightful surprise! You can tell the mosaic work has been going on for years and spills out into the neighborhood. Additionally spotting evidence of visiting art groups was another nice surprise. If I didn't have to",
          "We visited Fusterland while on a guided tour. What this artist has done is amazing! Interesting place to see.",
          "We were taken here by our guide, the visit was one of our highlights whilst staying in Havana. The house & garden is completely decorated in hand painted tiles and mosaic work by the artist Jose Fuster, whom we were fortunate enough to meet. He opens his house to the public (no",

          "With a goal of the ultimate neighborhood beautification project, the artist opens his mosaic-filled home to you. Roam this neighborhood where unique mosaics adorn all the homes and surrounding walls. The residents of the area run small businesses from their homes selling",

          "Our classic car tour took us to Fusterlandia on day one and it was simply amazing to see. Fuster's art is a real mix of the Latin and African influences that make up Cuba today. You can easily see how he is influenced by Gaudi and Picasso in his art. There is a lot to see and",
          "For nearly 30 years, an artist and a few dozen workers have been tiling a neighborhood, and Fusterlandia is the result. It is free to enter (although there may be guys trying to convince you to pay - don't do that). The compound includes more tiles and mosaics than you can",
          "This was included in our tour of Havana and we had no idea what to expect. This guy is truly driven and his artwork spreads across the entire neighborhood. We liked it and walked through much of the area.",

          "Fusterlandia is one of the most pleasant places to visit in Cuba. Although small, the art is amazing and the best part is, how it is transforming the neighborhood. Of course I had to make a purchase or two in support as there is no entrance fee but donations are accepted. Be",
          "If you have ever been to Barcelona and saw Park G\u00fcell, Fusterlandia will remind you of it. Most definitely worth a visit, or even a purchase or two",

          "We love Barcelona and the work of Gaudi so, of course, when we visited Havana, we had to see what Fusterlandia was all about. We weren't disappointed. While it's not a place that is going to take up a big part of your day, the drive there for a visit of 30-45 minutes is worth",
          "This man's house is well decorated with lots of colorful ceramics and influences by such name as Gaudi, Picasso and Brancusi. He has developed his ow style. And he has decorated his neighbor's houses as well as the streets around his home. Good place to take lots of photos",

          "Fanciful mosaics. A must for art lovers. It's definitely a unique place and I found it interesting. There is a short video to introduce you to the artist and his work. Then you are free to wander around the house and enjoy the art. There was no pressure to buy.",
          "I would give Fusterlandia more than five stars if I could. It is utterly fascinating - the Picasso of Cuba. It looks like something created by Dr. Seuss or Gaudi but all in mosaic.",
          "This unique neighborhood in Havana is like nothing I\u2019ve seen! It has been in the making for over 20 years and it is a must see if you are in Havana! The colors and artwork are so different and vibrant! I\u2019m so glad we made a stop here!",
          "The imagination necessary to create a virtual mosaic neighborhood with the main house decorated in all manner of designs is mind boggling. I saw this prior to seeing Barcelona's Park Guell the latter which I think is beautiful and this fun in a bizarre way.",

          "we rented an old Chevy to get there (50$ for 2 hours) it\u2019s bit out of the center but good to visit while in Havana. There are also few shops with souvenirs",
          "We stopped here are part of our tour of Havana. First, this seems to be in a somewhat sketchy area. Second, once inside we felt like we were getting side-eyed a bit and there are multiple areas where they expected \"donations\" if you get caught (the native dancers, gallery,",
          "Oh my word. If there were only a few displays, you'd feel the artist was a fraud. But the sheer volume of the installations -- installations that even creep into neighboring houses -- forces the visitor to engage with Fuster and linger to appreciate his manic, over-the-top",
          "We visited Fusterlandia twice on two separate tours. The artist's point of view is unique, and the art is shared with the neighbors homes.",

          "This is quite a remarkable place - if you found it anywhere. But finding it in Havana makes it even more special. It's a unique style of art by an artist who is still doing his work throughout this neighborhood. There's so much to see, you can spend all day there if you want.",
          "It's not far away from city centre and thus a nice short trip. There is no entrance fee. Looking at all those tiles you can easily imagine, why it takes year to create this. Though the prices for souvenirs are quite high.",
          "The artist created this place for himself and then helped local people so that they have income from art. This is important to understand as you walk around the area. I went with a group so did not have to spend a significant amount to get there. It is far and not worth more",
          "If you enjoy ceramics and fancy, this is the place for you. Fuster was a master ceramicist. He started by decorating his own property. Soon the neighbors were asking him to brighten their walls as well. What has resulted is a fanciful property with probably no surface",

          "This is on the other side of island from \"Old Havana\" where you usually get dropped off the tourist cruise ships. Quite a drive to get there, but interesting to see. The thing I liked best was knowing that anything I bought was actually made there, not from China, so I didn't",
          "Interesting eclectic art in the walls floors and ceilings but nothing extraordinary. Mostly a tourist buying stop.",
          "Don't miss this place when visiting Havana! Basically, you enter the world as perceived by Fuster. Whimsical paintings and sculptures abound. Like Gaudi, he uses broken up tiles to create his pieces. He says his main influences are Chagall, Miro, Picasso, and Gaudi. I was",
          "A regular stop on day tours but so interesting and unique. Have never seen anything like it on our world travels. If you do not want to do a tour, hop in one of the many classic taxis and ask them to take you there",
          "A very interesting streetscape. Reminded me a lot of Gaudi but much more extreme and fascinating. Never underestimate a person's imagination and creativity. Definitely worth a stop.",

          "A friend took us to Fusterlandia, saying we would be surprised by this artist's haven in the middle of poor suburban neighborhood. Yes we were. The history alone was astonishing - how an artist picked up his neighborhood's spirits and economy by creating a tiled \"world\" out of",

          "My wife and I were taken there by our private guide on our last day in Havana and were blown away by the similarities between it and Guidi's village in Barcelona. I would recommend it to anyone going to Havana. My one complaint was I bought a $5 CUC DVD called \"What you saw in",
          "We came to Fusterlandia early, and wandered the neighborhood with our guide before it opened. From my first step beyond the gate, all I could do was smile. I felt like I was in a magical garden! Everywhere I looked I found something new to admire. The creativity expressed there",

          "OMG!!!! such an excellent place to spend 30 minuts no more... we visited the place this month when we where using the services of a private agency in havana. Really nice!!! I really recommend thisplace, Fuster is the man.",
          "This artsy area of Havana was a wonderful addition to our tour f the city! It is possible to walk among the works of art that the resident artist has produced. Loved it!",
          "Went here during our taxi tour. The place is amazing if you are into this kind of art. Really over the top art made from broken tile pieces.",
          "This spot is well worth the visit. Be sure to wander around the neighborhood as the artist has decorated many of the walls and homes in the area.",
          "It is alittle overwhelming at first but what a place to explore. It is not confined to one building and it is unbelievable that people created this. It is a top attraction in Havana and worth seeing it atleast once.",
          "We landed here by accident and we were very surprised! Our taxi driver said that we shouldn't miss it...and he was right! Great place to visit, takes about 30 minutes to see everything. If you want to buy art, save it for here. Lots of little places around the area that sell",
          "We visited Fusterlandia as part of our tour of Havana. Not to be missed. The artist who started this is still alive and lives there.",
          "This place left me in awe. I had never seen anything quite like it. It does resemble Park G\u00fcell in Barcelona, though, with the exception that access to Fusterlandia is free of charge and the gardens and homes turned into art are homes made into art and people still live there.",
          "We, my huspand an I were using a private agency Viajes Vintage and one of our stops was here, such an incredible place to spend no more than hour!!! Full of art and history!!! The craft sellers right beside the street has really good deals!!",
          "Fusterlandia is a wonderful example of art in the place you might least expect it. The residence and surrounding area is the concept of Cuban artist Jos\u00e9 Fuster. Fuster has decorated his home in beautiful mosaic tiles. His residence and most importantly his work is something",
          "we went to see Fusterlandia, the studio, residence and wild kingdom of Cuban Artist Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez Fuster, during a recent cruise to Cuba.",
          "This is a wonderland of sculptural art! What a story behind it. Miramar province, outside of Havana, was a poor slum until local artist Jos\u00e9 Fuster got an idea to decorate his home with broken tiles and found objects. The neighbors loved the colorful displays so much that they",
          "We discovered this little gem, which can be found in Miramar outside Havana centre. It is surreal and looks a bit Daliesque and well worth the taxi ride. It's free to enter.",
          "This place is a must see when in Havana. A bit of a drive out of the Old City - expect to pay 30cuc there and back (ask your driver to stay) but worth it.",
          "I don\u2019t think there is anything like this place anywhere, the tile work, not only in the artists home , is so clever ..the entire property is a work of art,. And incredibly the entire neighborhood is an explosion of color .. it is a must see. Great souvenirs too.",
          "One of the most unusual places in the world and available to savor at no cost. Enter the hallowed gate and wander around in the mind of Tehran artist. Mosaic graphics from floor to ceiling in all directions. A palace of whimsy surrounding a gallery of paintings. I love this",
          "Cuban artist Jose\u2019 Fuster\u2019s quirky home and neighborhood, known as Fusterland. You can tour his home and be amazed at his prolific artwork.",
          "If you are a fan of Gaudi in Barcelona, you will love Fusterlandia. How this artist covered everything in mosaics is amazing. Out of the way but if you have a couple of extra hours, I would go for a visit.",
          "Fusterlandia is very very impressive. Its a short 20-25 cab ride from Havana and absolutely worth the trip. I can\u2019t imagine how long it took Fuster to do all of this. His artwork is incredible.",
          "This place is a must see Stunning. All done by one artist by hand...the tiles are beautiful and perfectly placed. It's like a page put of Alice and Wonderland. Pictures don't do this place justice. A must see. And its free!!",
          "I was traveling with my wife throught a private agency (Viajes Vintage) from the cruise, one of our stops was Fuserland, WOW!!! really something to see in Havana it is the best....",
          "It is amazing how creative the artist is and what he has done for his neighborhood. The details of his work is unbelievable. It helped that our guide was able to give us history behind his pieces.",
          "About 20km from Havana, there's this Fuster's house, a tiles artist who decided one day to improving his home with this art and also his neighbours houses (they asked him to do it as well). It's a free enter and take some time to stroll the neighbourhood too. The only problem is",
          "Inspired by Gaudi, this local neighborhood art gem is well worth a stop when you are in Havana. The artist opens his home to curious visitors and you can climb the tower to get a broader view of his work throughout the neighborhood. Don't miss his pet tortoise in the courtyard.",
          "Gabriel with Cuba Connections Tour really listened to us when we told him earlier in the day what our interests were...this was an add on to our trip and WOW!!! It was absolutely fantastic...a must see!!",
          "We had a great tour with the agency Viajes Vintage from our cruise and one of our many stops was here. It is amazing the history of this artist. Definetelly simething to see in Havana.",
          "It is an interesting and eclectic art project, that grew over many years. It spilled into the neighborhood and is fun and entertaining to visit. Good for the whole family. I would not personally go as destination point. But, it would be good, as part of a general tour. It is a",
          "This was a quick stop on our Havana tour but it was quite interesting. There is pieces of tile everywhere and even out on the street. They have art for sale as well and places to shop right across the street.",
          "This is definitely worth a quick tour during your Havana tour. It is interesting to see how the inspiration and vision of one artist has in effect created a little cottage industry for a whole community. The entire community is covered with eclectic mosaic tile murals...",
          "Fantastic, somewhat unbelievable art exhibit. Even though the art is literally everywhere -- from every inch of the residence to the pool and roofs and spilling over into the entire neighborhood, there is real talent in the individual pieces cobbled together one giant",
          "This incredible proyect is somethig I really recommend if you want to see real arte. It is great and Mr. Fuster is an unstanding man.",
          "This place was so cool! It's said that he is a local artist giving back to the community by creating the house in mosaics for all to see. He is constantly improving the property as well as branching out to adding mosaics to the neighborhood.",
          "Breath taking art! It's worth stopping by and admire not only the art that surrounds neighborhood but the house. A must see place!! No entrance fee, only donations.",
          "This reminded me of a miniature Park Guell in Barcelona. I loved the time we spent there! I can't believe that it has been accomplished in a relatively short amount of time (20-plus years seems short for all the work involved)",
          "We were in a private tour around Havana and our guide took us to Fusterland, the place is amazing. Every body need to visit it...",
          "This place is amazing! It is hard to believe one artist did it all. Excellent place to take pictures. No admission fee, donations welcome. Beautiful.",
          "The tile work is very creative. It is quite an experience to see what Mr. Fuster. the artist, has created. He even tiled fences, entryways, etc. in the neighborhood!",
          "A local Cuban Artist Jose Fuster turned this neighborhood into an amazing work of art. its unique, its free. Great Artwork for sale. It's very unique. The only place I have seen anything like this is in Barcelona. Worth coming and taking it in. We picked up some tiles painter by",
          "Only had a few minutes here for a stop-off. Wish we'd had longer. Wonderful art work, amazing forms on different levels and some pleasing souvenirs too!",
          "Come and see a lot of hard work, time and art invested into this living art museum. Ceramic tiles form and shape the artist house and shop.",
          "We didn't know what to expect when this was suggested but glad we visited there. So nice to see someone giving back to the community.",
          "This is such an odd and fun area. It's free to visit and is a stop worth making. It's just so different and fascinating.",
          "So many details, you have to look carefully and soak in the experience of this place ---- a must see!",
          "Fusterlandia is a must see in Havana. It is the Cuban version of Gaudi's Park Guell in Barcelona. However, it is smaller than Park Guell. The mosiacs were funky and colorful. A must to see!",
          "Created over 30 years ago by artist \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfa8Jose Fustet, this place and surrounding home is remarkable if not magical. Strongly recommend a visit if you visit Havana.",
          "If you have been to Barcelona and liked Parc Guell, you must see Fusterlandia. It is a magical place and I was fortunate enough to meet Jose Fuster, himself!",
          "A poor fishing village + an artist = ceramic art for the village. Lots of souvenirs, art, and happy people. Amazing tile works. Go on line and view pictures. Donations are optional. Take a old car ride to this area on your own or with a guide.",
          "Very interesting street with the artist on site to answer any questions you have on his artwork or purchase a souvenir.",
          "The site is amazing - clean and uniquely decorates in memory of the works of Gaudy in Barcelona Take an hour and visit the place !!",
          "It took John Fuster 25 years to complete Fusterlandia. It\u2019s pretty crazy the dedication he had. When you look at the details you wonder \u201chow he had the patience to do all of this?\u201d. it is beautiful and totally worth the drive.",
          "We were pleasantly surprised by how interesting this stop was. We were part of a private tour that took us here (I Love Cuba Guided Photo Tours). Having a guide makes this stop wonderful. I don\u2019t see how anyone could tour this location and get a full appreciation of what\u2019s",
          "Loved this place, I could have spent hours here with the camera, I think it was made better by having someone with me who knew more about the place and the continued expansion .. it sneaks into the streets surrounding and is still the brainchild of one man. Inspired by Gaudi",
          "We went on a tour from our cruise boat. If you have seen Gaudi's work in Barcelona, you will love this too. Go up on the stair and don't forget to look up too. Take your time, there is so much to see. It is a pity that some Cubans don't know this place.",
          "We took the tour because we both love art and loved what we saw. Our guide Miguel was knowledgable and showed us some unusual places that were unique to Havana",
          "We visited Fusterlandia while doing a Classic Car Tour. This was a really fun place - very unique and interesting to explore. It is a bit of a drive from the port - about 30 minutes, but we felt it was worth it. Plan to spend about 30 min-1 hour max.",
          "What an incredible place to see !! If you have a taxi or a chauffeur, don't hesitate to tell him to bring you here (20-25 minutes drive from the center). You will enjoy a place like \"Sagrada del familia\" in Barcelona ! It's absolutely a \"must do\" on your trip in Cuba ! And the",
          "We love our visit to Fusterlandia, which we easily added to our private tour in a vintage convertible. It was about 15 minutes out of town, but so worth it. As soon as you drive into the neighborhood, you see that every front yard has the tile entrances. But then you get to",
          "The artist has combined his love for Picasso and Gaudi into an entire neighborhood. Unique designs and applications of art grew from the home of Jose Fuster to an explosion of color and fun. A fun diversion from the usual tourist or city attractions, plan enough time to go",
          "We stopped here during a guided tour. Very interesting and pretty. Amazed at all the beautiful art pieces. Make sure to go up the steps.",
          "We really enjoyed viewing the creation of the person that started this project to improve the looks of his neighborhood. Reminded us of Barcelona.",
          "We shared a taxi and spent a couple of hours at Fusterlandia outside of Havana. It was a lot of fun walking through the mosaics and the small artsy souvenir shops.",
          "My daughter and I visited Cuba for her 16th birthday. It was not originally my first thought for a \"vacation spot\" but the destination was my daughter's pick. I'm so glad she picked Cuba. Fusterlandia is one of the Beautiful, Magical places I've visited. The art filled streets",
          "This is a very strange place to see. There are mosaic pictures and sculptures everywhere. It is hard to imagine until you check this place out. Jose' Fuster did all of this and was inspired by Picasso and his works!",
          "During a tour of Havana and environs our guide (Nellie, from CubaOutings) took us to this incredible \"neighborhood\" of mosaic art, all done by a contemporary Cuban artist. You really have to BE there on a sun-drenched day to begin to appreciate his works. We have pictures, true,",

          "Not sure there are words to describe...Beautiful, unique, amazing all seem inadequate! The artist, Fuster, is talented and creative beyond words!",
          "This man is very talented. Our tour guide took us there. His pieces are beautiful. Very expensive, but beautiful.",
          "I hope it stays like this in the future, but currently it is a hidden gem with not so many tourists. We got the tip from our casa particulares owner and he was right: it is completely different: mr Fuster is creating a place, inspired by Gaudi from spain, but with a typical",
          "Our stop in FUsterlandia was the highlight of our day in Havana. The art is remarkable, definitely reminiscent of our stop of Gaudy's work in Barcelona. The artist not only did his house, but then began doing houses around the neighborhood. You can buy pieces of his art for",

          "You can't help but see the influence of Picasso and Gaudy in the works at Fusterlandia. We had been unsure whether to see Hemingway's home or Fusterlandia. When we asked our guide the question, if you only had one day and had to choose, which would it be? He said unless we",
          "My tour guide said he wanted to show us a street that was full of art. I almost said I am not interested. Thank god I didn\u2019t what a great place the way they did the houses and streets are great small pieces of ceramic tile, to walk through and see everything is free, a",
          "Fusterlandia is a must-see in Havana. It was about a 20-minute drive from the cruise port but well worth it (the drive itself is interesting). The main house is totally covered in mosaic tile and it's expanded to many of the other houses in the neighborhood. A fascinating",

          "One of the best neighborhoods in Havana. It\u2019s really magical with mosaic wonderland all over the houses, the walls, literally everything is covered with art.",
          "Worth a visit. The sheer size of the tiling in the street with more houses being added. One mans dream has given so much delight to many people Go and enjoy",
          "This is a destination you don't want to miss. Every part of the home and grounds is so colorful and whimsical. I bought an original tile right out of the kiln the day we visited. Being a retired art teacher, I was blown away with all the art/tile work on every surface.",
          "Quaint area, take the time to look around and local neighbors share art, and unique pieces that you won't find down at the San Jose Market. It is free to get in, but they ask for a donation, and why not? Its beautiful. If you wish to use the facilities, you will need to leave",
          "Nice place to know about history, amazing walls and art. my husband and i had an amazing time there.",
          "We visited Fusterland as part of a tour and what an amazing place. As we were leaving we were even lucky enough to meet Fuster himself and have our photo taken with him. Well worth going as it's nothing like you will experience elsewhere in Cuba. It's like the Gaudi park in",
          "A little out of the way of regular tourists, but i wanted to take this photo opportunity and asked for a driver to bring us here. Didn't regret it, lots of pictures and emotions. This is how Cuban express themselves in art. Poor country, but they manage to create something with",

          "This was one of our stops on our tour around Havana. It was impressive. It's a mosaic neighborhood. The creativity and time that went into this place is amazing. I'd recommend visiting here. It's interesting. Our tour guide explained that Fusterlandia was created by Jose",

          "This is an area of homes about a block long that is decorated with colored tile. The painter is getting old and has health issues but his art work is \"different and unique\".",
          "Wonderful studio of local Cuban artist Jose Fuster. We were lucky to meet the artist. We also walked around the block as the neighborhood is full of his art. You will see a memorial he made for Gaudi. Fuster is a cross between Gaudi and Picasso. Fuster even turned two bus stops",

          "It is like the Cuban Picasso museum made of tiles. A very unique village and experience that is worth the 20 minute drive and 30 minute experience to see this one special place that continues to grow and thrive. Not too bad of a tourist trap when I visited in June 2018.",

          "To walk around and see the small shops, don't buy everything, was fun and exciting. Went into Fusterlandia and was amazed at all the tile work that had been done. When you went up the stairs and looked down, you had views of the whole area and the work that had been done.",
          "A bit overwhelming because there is just so much to see everywhere. The whole neighbourhood is a feast for the eye so plan to spend a bit of time in this lovely suburb. Exceptional in that there is no entrance fee. And no musicians strumming a tune and holding out their basket!",

          "While it is certainly impressive that this entire neighborhood has adopted this artist style, overall, it is a lot of overdone tile work. It looks like an overdone Goofy golf course. The artist claims that Picasso was his idol/mentor, but it appears he mainly just copied his",

          "This was waaay off the beaten path, but the taxi ride there was worth it. En route we drove along el Malecon and got to see parks and neighborhoods...regular places. It was a joyous wonderland of creation, pure and simple! The souvenir shops across the street had lovely,",
          "Very interesting combination of creativity and practicality. Artistic thought combined with available materials have created a unique neighborhood.",
          "This visit was part of an excursion offered by Royal Caribbean for the day. Very colorful and interesting that the artist had started at his home, placing tiles to create art. These tiles create people, animals fountains etc. It has extended to the street and neighborhood.",
          "Well worth the drive and time to see the artistry of Cuba. A flashback to Parc Guell in Barcelona. The drive in a 1955 Ford Fairlane through Havana to the outskirts started the best day ever! Walk the streets, visit with the people and take in the intricacy of tiles hand",
          "If you have around 2 hours to spare, I would recommend for you to visit this little village! It was about a 15/20 minute drive from vedado. It\u2019s a really unique place in Cuba ... we didn\u2019t need too long there, probably spent around 40/45 minutes there (taking pictures and",
          "What an amazing place. What imagination, which is now spreading throughout the village. Just lovely, right and cheery.",
          "Stopped in Cuba on a cruise and took a tour with our cruise line. Judging from the pictures of this place we weren\u2019t too hopeful but WOW, pictures do not do it justice! It was beautiful artwork, level after level. This was my favorite stop on our tour!!",
          "Every house on the street is uniquely decorated. Not to be missed. Definitely take the time to watch the 3 minute video explaining the history..",
          "the paintings and things on sale are crazily priced. We enjoyed the experience and would recommend visiting it. There are kids begging on the outside which is unusual.",
          "Do not miss this part of Havana. Art lovers and everyone else will be amazed at the decorations on the houses, and in particular the house of the artist who started it all.",
          "Very quirky but fantastic. And definitely a place to put on your list to visit. Free entry but contributions are welcome.",
          "A visit to Fusterlandis in neighborhood of Jaimanitas in Havana Cuba is well worth your time. You will see fountains, sculptures, poles, doors and walls covered in vibrant mosaic tiles by artist Jose Fuster. You can see and feel the Cuban pride.",
          "We enjoyed our visit and the opportunity to view not just the outdoor art but other art for sale indoors. It is possible to purchase original art and other memorabilia.",
          "We were told we were going to see a real treat from out tour director from Your Cuba Travel. And that is exactly what this is. Imagine a dedication to Gaude in Cuba. We loved seeing all the mosaic pieces, especially the one dedicated to the Patron Saint of Cuba. Would have",
          "I\u2019d read about this but due to my disability, I picked the \u201cEasy Panoramic Havana\u201d tour on Royal Caribbean Majesty of the Seas. It was not listed as a stop so I\u2019d resigned myself to possibly not seeing it. Lo and behold, not only was it a stop on our 4 hour coach tour, we spent",
          "I didn't know what to expect from Fusterlandia and given our limited time in Havana we weren't sure whether to prioritise it. So glad we did though as it's a quite incredible little street that for me was even more of a spectacle than Park Guell in Barcelona. A couple of tips",
          "This is a must stop on any tour of Havana. What this artist has created defies explanation!!!! His use of Mosaic tiles in numerous themes is amazing.",
          "This place was cool with an interesting feel good story behind it. Totally worth checking it out. Look for the super friendly turtle.",
          "We were not going to visit this place but we were told that we should. Only part of it was open when we got there but there was more to see than we realized! Take an hour or so and stop by this place.",
          "This reminded me of Philadelphia's Magic Garden. The artist has quite an imagination. It was raining on the day of our visit, but the colorful artwork was still fun to see.",
          "Interesting work of Jose Fuster, known as Picasso of the Caribbean. Our tour group had lunch there. Food was great, but many flies. Artwork can be purchased. Storefronts outside of artist area somewhat aggressive trying to get you to their store.",
          "I loved visiting Fusterlandia! What a treat to see such a unique area and see the art in progress! Very special part of our trip!",
          "Artistic area made of mosaics outside the city of Havana. Drove here in an old convertible to see this interesting area. Very unique.",
          "If you've been to Barcelona and seen Gaudi's work, this artist was inspired by him. The mosaic art work is not to be believed and it is the artists home. Go see it. Its amazing!",
          "Our tour guide from FerTours, Elvis, suggested that we would enjoy this stop and it was not disappointing. Arriving in our vintage convertibles, our group was treated to a magical fantasy land of this creative artist and the neighborhood surrounding it. This is a must see for",
          "Our tour guide Blexie of Blexie Havana Tours took us here on 5/17/18. We looked around for over an hour and took a ton of pictures. The artist Fuster and his son were both on the premises. Don't miss this wonderful place, a real highlight of our visit to Havana",

          "Our tour guide took us in our vintage hot pink convertible to Fusterlandia. The entry to the neighbourhood was so colorful with curved, tiled walls. Then we were able to walk around the outside of the original house which is built entirely out of colorful tiles. There are no",

          "It's a little out of the way, and not on all day tours but, if you can get there go and see it. Visually breathtaking and the back story is so interesting. Wish we had spent more time there.",
          "Really enjoyed the art and the top floor view. If you get to Havana, make the trip out to Fusterlandia as its well worth it. I enjoyed the art very much and am not much of an art person. The sheer volume of work involved was very impressive. And if nothing else its a very",
          "Gorgeous tiles surround the block and Fuster\u2019s childish style can be seen upon entering the street and throughout. Cuba\u2019s Picasso has his interpretation of art that inspires and leaves you speechless. Take the time to see this. It will change your perspective on Cuba. Then",
          "A fun side trip to take- probably about 25 minutes outside the city. Fun to see and wander through- great for pictures.",
          "This place is one of a kind. The artist did a bunch of murals out of pieces of ceramic, kind of like a collage. It really is wonderful and amazing the scale, covering a large number of properties.",
          "Beautiful place to visit and be amazed at what has been done here. Quaint shops over the road. A must to see",
          "Much of this country is broken and dismal. This was an unexpected bright spot. It is free for you to wander about the town and people are generally welcoming and pleasant. Glad we had the opportunity to see this.",
          "Beautiful art!! So fun so walk through and see all that he has done. So much to see. Wish I could afford some artwork. Settled for postcards.",

          "You\u2019ll love Fusterlandia! The ongoing work of Jose Fuster is a fun and amazing exhibit. There is so much to take in and it is not a large space. You leave here in awe of the creativity.",
          "Unexpected visit by tour guide to this little town covered in mosiac artwork - so much to look at and see - worth a stop",
          "Jose Foster has decorated his home and more than 80 neighborhood houses with ornate, Gaudi-inspired murals and domes. His son, Alex, explained that Jose has a team of 5 or 6 artists who actually create the art, based upon Jose\u2019s designs. And you will see why, when you realize",
          "We visited Fusterlandia as part of our 9 day Support for the Cuban People tour. The artist who started this is very resourceful and Fusterlandia is a great display of the creative Cuban spirit at work. Fusterlandia is small and takes less than an hour to visit. This wouldn't"

          "We went there last week. We lost the opportunity to visit Fuster house which is the most important thing to see there however it was such a great experience. It's a poor neighborhood outside of Havana. We paid 30 cuc by taxi from central \u2026",

          "This is an interesting place to visit. This sheer scale of the mosaics are impressive: they seem to be everywhere. This however is an art form that strongly appeals to some and less so to others. It is certainly worth a trip to see, but \u2026",

          "Very neat project. Drastically different from any other architecture in Havana. Quirky art with a Dr. Seuss feel at times. A very cool neighborhood to visit. Some of the local artists have items for sale, but they seem like staple souvenir items rather than unique pieces of art.",
          "Awesome place to see. A must go in cuba!!",

          "Very crowded when all tours arrive at the same time. Similar art at all stalls. Not many original pieces. Worth a look but be prepared to be rushed through.",
          "Definitely a fun place to visit. Colors everywhere.",
          "Our personal driver for the day took us here on one of our stops. Pictures don't do it justice for the size scope and detail that this artist has undertaken as a life long project. Most definitely worth an hour or two stop to appreciate the scale of the work.",
          "This place is very enchanting. Many cab drivers offer a return trip back to Havana and they wait for you, which gives you an idea of how short it is for the price they charge you to take you out there. Most people tell you there's no \u2026",

          "Visited here on a cruise excursion; we had no clue what it was when we first arrived, but after seeing it in person and learning more about the artist, this was probably the most impactful place we visited.",
          "A fun little stop, with a chance to not only see, but also purchase art from one of Cuba's best known artists. Even if you dont care for the style, you cant help but appreciate the time, effort and generosity of Fuster, who set every single tile himself and at no cost to his neighbors who requested it.",
          "Cool neighborhood with lots of tile art. Not much else out in the same area, but the neighborhood itself had shops and free places to walk around and galleries.",

        "wiki": "The Museum of the Revolution (Spanish: Museo de la Revoluci\u00f3n) is located in the Old Havana section of Havana, Cuba. The museum is housed in what was the Presidential Palace of all Cuban presidents from Mario Garc\u00eda Menocal to Fulgencio Batista. It became the Museum of the Revolution during the years following the Cuban Revolution. The building was the site of the Havana Presidential Palace Attack (1957) by the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nThe former ''Presidential Palace' was designed by the Cuban architect Rodolfo Maruri and the Belgian architect Paul Belau who also designed the Centro Gallego, presently the  Gran Teatro de La Habana. The 'Presidential Palace was inaugurated in 1920 by President Mario Garc\u00eda Menocal. It remained the Presidential Palace until the Cuban Revolution of 1959.  The building has Neo-Classical elements, and was decorated by Tiffany Studios of New York City.\n\n\n== Attack on the palace ==\n\nThe building was the site of the attack that took place at around 3:30 PM on March 13, 1957. The Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil from the University of Havana had the objective of killing Fulgencio Batista. It was a two-prong attack which included the take over of Radio Relox at the Radiocentro CMQ Building. Both attacks failed. According to one of the attackers, Faure Chom\u00f3n of the Revolutionary Directorate, they were following the golpe arriba strategy and together with Menelao Mora Morales sought to overthrow the government by killing President Fulgencio Batista.\n\n\n=== Plan ===\nThe plan, as explained by Faure Chaum\u00f3n Mediavilla, was to attacking the Presidential Palace by a commando  of fifty men and simultaneously support the operation by one hundred men occupying the radio station Radio Reloj at the Radiocentro CMQ Building to announce the death of Batista.  The attack on the palace would result in the elimination of Fulgencio Batista, the purpose of taking of Radio Reloj, was to announce the death of Batista and to call for a general strike, to incite the people of Havana to join the armed struggle.\nThe plan to capture of the Presidential Palace by up of fifty men, under the direction of Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez Menoyo and Faure Chom\u00f3n, this command was to be supported by a group of 100 armed men whose function would be to occupy the tallest buildings in the surrounding area of the Presidential Palace (La Tabacalera, the Sevilla Hotel, the Palace of Fine Arts) and, from these positions, support the main command taking over the Presidential Palace. However, this support operation was not carried out as the men who were to participate never arrived at the scene of the events because of last-minute hesitation. Although the revolutionaries reached the third floor of the Palace, they were unable to execute Batista.\n\nThey spoke in code order to frustrate a potential infiltration or a divulging of the attack in any conversation, it had been agreed early on that they would refer to Palacios as \"la casa de los tres kilos.\"\n\n\n== Radio Reloj ==\n\nThe action of Radio Reloj, located in the Radiocentro CMQ Building at Calle 23 and L in El Vedado, was directed by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverr\u00eda who was accompanied among others, by Fructuoso Rodr\u00edguez, Joe Westbrook, Ra\u00fal Diaz Arg\u00fcelles, Julio Garc\u00eda Olivera, including reading a prepared statement announcing the execution of Batista by Echevarria:\n\n\"People of Cuba, in these moments the dictator Fulgencio Batista has just been justified. In his own burrow of the Presidential Palace, the people of Cuba have come to settle accounts. And it is we, the Revolutionary Directory, who in the name of the Cuban Revolution have given the shot of grace to this regime of opprobrium. Cubans listening to me. It's just been removed...\"[2]\nThe operation failed because Batista was never killed and the troops guarding the Radio Reloj transmission tower in Arroyo Arenas knocked down the transmission. Jos\u00e9 Antonio was shot and killed by a Batista patrol car on the corner of November 27 and L, on his way back to the University. \n\nThe combatants departed from a basement apartment located on Calle 19 between Calles B and C towards the Radiocentro CMQ Building in three automobiles:\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nThe museum's Cuban history exhibits are largely devoted to the period of the revolutionary war of the 1950s and to the country's post-1959 history.  Portions of the museum are also devoted to pre-revolutionary Cuba, including the 1895-1898 War of Independence waged against Spain.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==",

          "We spent a couple of hours here during our first visit to Cuban - whilst little of the information about the displays is translated (and my Spanish is - embarrassingly - non existent) there are fascinating displays depicting the reality of the revolution, but also of more recent",
          "I woke up early to tackle the crowd that can be expected at this Museum. I was happy to be one of the first 5 people to enter the Museum. I like that I had the opportunity to walk though each room to read and get a full understanding of the Cuban Revolution and the people",

          "I expected the museum to display more interesting artifacts and information. However, I felt that the walk quickly became repetitive.",

          "We did not like this exhibition too much. It is glorifying the former Cuban leaders very much complemented with items belonging to them. But there is little structure on how the revolutions took place. Better read some articles before as otherwise you will not take too much out",

          "I am rather disappointed by my visit to this Museum. Despite the relatively high ticket price there are very few actual items from the revolution, if any, what you see is mainly photos and texts. And on top of that there is no air conditioning so it gets rather hot. Not worth",
          "We visited as this place is marked as a must see in guide books. We were disappointed. It is undergoing restoration so parts are closed but we imagine even if it was all open it wouldn\u2019t be worth the 8 CUC entry fee. There are very very few exhibits in the main building - a",

          "As you'd expect, the museum is clearly biaised in favour of the revolution and anyone that took even the smallest part of it, but praise simply gushes for Fidel, Che and their comrades. Many exhibits are simply along the lines of \"boots worn by Colonel X during the assault on",
          "This museum should not be missed as it tells you so much about Cuban history and the revolution. Obviously, don't expect a neutral view but it is still very informative with great exhibits. There is a lot of restauration going on currently so looking forward to any extension.",
          "This is a real must if you\u2019re in Havana. It\u2019s a beautiful building and tells the story of the Revolution. The exhibits are interesting and it feels very personal and from the heart. There is a tiny place to grab a drink. The guy there is so friendly and welcoming. Try the",
          "Winston Churchill is supposed to have said that \"History is written by the victor - and I certainly intend to write mine!\" This is certainly true with this museum! Having accepted that, it is nonetheless an interesting account of the period from just before, to just after the",
          "I visited the museum on a Sunday, and apparently, one Sunday epr month, syudents of the school of music perform. I was lucky enough to catch a concert of Cuban traditional music played by very talented children. It was brilliant ! The museum itself is a little old, but still an",
          "This really is a must-see place if you're visiting Havana, as you will get a real sense of history particularly for the period in the late 50s when Castro and Che led the revolutionaries on their freedom struggle. Lots of fascinating memorabilia although I didn't quite share the",
          "This museum was really fascinating and there were plenty of signs and written information to help you learn more about the history of Cuba. It's possibly a good idea to have a basic understanding of what happened during the revolution before you go as this museum will help",
          "In the old palace this museum has a fantastic location and a lot of interesting info about the revolution. However, it was being restored when we went so was somewhat limited in what we could see",
          "Located in central old town Habana, spend as much time as you want looking at the history and the making of the revolution. It's a very interesting building and steeped in history.Each president lived here with the exception of Castro. The state dining room (hall of mirrors) is",
          "Castro had promised to make the people proud of this building, which as the presidential palace had been viewed as anything but, so turned it into a museum to the revolution. It truly is a beautiful building which you get to see the best of - the museum exhibits are set in a",
          "Always great to experience different cultures and their perspectives on events. The Museum of the revolution is packed with artefacts from that time in history and gives you an overview to the events preceding and during the Cuban revolution.",
          "This is the place to learn about the history of the revolution in Cuba, which stamped the life and social life in this island. There are many pictures and personal items of Castro. You can also see old planes and military vehicles used in the past.",
          "When we visited (May 2019) a lot of the rooms were closed for \u2018restoration\u2019 work so the whole exhibit was a little disjointed and unclear. Seeing the vehicles, planes and Granma Yacht used during the revolution was interesting, but I would probably recommend waiting until the",
          "Lots of information about Che Guevara and the revolution. As with most of Havana this is another building being renovated, so I\u2019m sure it will be better once completed",
          "I guess that is not the idea of a museum! The place has mostly braking down the history of the revolution and its commanders. Very poor, and at some points dirty, I guess due to some renovations taking place.",
          "The building itself is really cool, but it seemed a little empty. Also a lot of rooms were blocked off or under construction. It's ok, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.",
          "Small new museum accessed via an old colonial palace. Both buildings had bits and pieces from the revolution but neither really explained the background or sequence of the revolution. We spent a couple of hours here and took lots of photo\u2019s but left a bit disappointed that we",
          "I enjoyed reading all about the revolution and looking at all of the items in the museum. It's a lot of information and materials to go through, so be prepared for lots of reading.",
          "Simple yet very informative, provides an excellent overview of the revolution period, along with some interesting detailed stories from the time. Well worth a visit.",
          "It is a disappointing museum because it is badly presented. It is like someone cut out some newspaper articles and glue them on the walls in any order. There is not enough explanations of how bad was the dictator in place and the motives for the \u201crevolution\u201d, it is too much",
          "Very little places in my opinion are able to pull a renovation and stay open. Remodel and renovate and then let us enjoy your work. Not a good choice on my last trip",
          "An absolute must for anyone who has heard of Che Guevara or the Cuban Revolution. Very informative with a wide range of exhibits and written information. Also home to the famous Granma Boat used during the revolution.",
          "The building is great - and is still being restored. The walk through the history of Cuba also interesting. The bit at the back with some old army vehicles less so....",
          "I was really excited to go here and find out more about the revolution. We queued for half an hour to get in and then the displays were very basic - I've seen better in a primary school. The information was detailed but with no timeline and no order to what you were looking at,",
          "The palatial building is showing its wear and needs some love, as do exhibits. However, it is full of information on the Revolution. As an American, I found it so interesting to see \"the other side\" of this history. Cuban accounts of the role of the CIA in years following the",
          "Even for a foreign this place provides a good view of the revolution. You don\u2019t need to understand all the history to get an idea of what happened and who the key players were. Also shows you an other perspective than what is commonly known from the USA perspective. It provides",
          "If you have little knowledge of Cuban revolutionary history you will find out a bit here. A number of vehicles, armaments and the Granma are displayed in an exterior attachment to the museum. Worth a look.",

          "Former headquarters of Batista before the revolution. Now a few of the rooms have displays of pictures, maps, artifacts, etc. from the days of the revolution up to 1959. Should be much better arranged considering the importance it has to today's Cuba. The outdoor exhibits of the",
          "The museum is small but packed with photos and items telling the story of the struggle of the Cuban for their liberation from Spain and then the dictators of the 1900s. It is interesting to hear their side of the story and their grievances against the USA. There is plenty on",
          "Save yourself the 8 CUC admission fee: the most interesting part of the museum is the outdoor exhibit (tanks, planes, missiles, etc) which is easily visible from the street. Take a quick walk around that portion and take photos for free. The interior part of the museum is mainly",
          "This is a good place to visit especially if you want to find out what happend during the revolution. We were amazed. Nice for kids as well",
          "I was really looking forward to learning about the revolution and also the history of what led to it. The layout was confusing with seemingly no order in which to view the exhibits. Lots of memorabilia and propaganda; little information and chronology.",
          "We had been looking forward to our visit to this museum hoping to learn more not only about the revolution itself but also but of the history on what led up to the revolution. The museum has lots of photos but not too much in the way of explanations. It was under renovation",
          "My boyfriend and I visited this museum, 45 minutes before closing and we were worried it wouldn't be enough time. We were wrong. We managed to get around all the floors and the shopping area. The museum is interesting as it consists of many memorabilia from Che Guevara. There is",
          "We queued for 15 minutes for entry and paid our 8CUC each. There are two buildings, the first has detailed information boards and some exhibits while the second modern glass building has Castro's boat plus a few vehicles and missiles. The historic main building has a large dome",
          "Really interesting place to visit to learn about the revolution, lot's to see and read about and learn from. This is an amazing building, at last it is being restored, it has a beautiful boy & gold dome ceiling, amazing columns, a truly remarkable place. It was the place where",
          "I Really didn\u2019know what to expect from this Museum, so I was pleasantly surprised with everything I saw and learned, it is very interesting. Tells you all about the Cuban Revolution how it started and ended. There\u2019s so much on display from Castro\u2019s Boots to Guevara\u2019s famous",
          "There is lots of information about the Cuban revolution. Some of it is a little embellished but it is the bet place to get some knowledge. There was some work being done in one of the rooms after the bad weather recently and great views out of the window. Prices of CUC and CUP",
          "Essential visit if you want to learn Cuba\u2019s history as documented by the Cubans rather than reading about it in books written by authors from western/capitalist economy countries. Good to get both perspectives then weigh it up yourself. Excellent educational opportunity for for",
          "A well done history lesson on the revolution. Basic displays (photos, uniforms) laid out chronologically with reasonable English descriptions. Impressive building.",
          "The entry is 8 CUC. That was the price for pretty much all the museums we've visited. The palace is pretty big and you have some pieces outside as well. Most of the pieces in the museum consist of documents and photographs. They have very few belongings to people involved in the",
          "Gives pause to Americans to think about the wisdom of its policies. Interesting historic exhibits about the Cuban Revolution.",
          "This gives a great overview of the revolution, made particularly more interesting with the guided tour. Unfortunately, the tours are only offered in Spanish though.",
          "Although the building that houses the museum is beautiful, unfortunately the same cannot be said of the exhibit. We visited in early March and there was quite a bit of renovation work happening in the museum so that could\u2019ve been one reason that we didn\u2019t enjoy the exhibition.",
          "Not one of the better curated exhibitions we have ever visited. Whilst there are interesting items aplenty, they are far outnumbered by the non-interesting items on display; the boots worn by a revolutionary, the spectacles of another etc., etc.. All are displayed in a random",
          "The Museo de la Revolucion (Revolution Museum) of Havana is housed in the old Presidential Palace and used by several presidents of Cuba, the last of them Fulgencio Batista. It is a must visit place, specially for those one interested in the history of Cuba. The museum exhibits",
          "8cuc entry and we whizzed around the museum. Interesting but you only need 2 hrs tops. Would recommend for a different perspective",
          "A bit lopsided presentation but the the winner in a conflict gets to write the story. Aside from that some artifacts are remarkable. Castro\u2019s boat used to get revolutionaries from Mexico is on display. The radio used by Che Guevara in the jungle has beef retained in goo",
          "Fairly informative on the revolution of 1959. A strong political presence. Some war machines on the yard that where interesting. Also the boat that the rebels took from Mexico to arrive for the revolution.",
          "This was a must on our list to Havana and we were not disappointed. We went through all areas and found much information about the revolution and changes made to this country. Very worthwhile.",
          "It was so interesting to read all the descriptions of the items in the museum and see how Cubans view their history. It's quite different than the history American students are taught and it helped to explain the pride that the Cuban people feel for their country. Every country",
          "An excellent insight into the revolution but if you don\u2019t start at the right point on the top floor it can be confusing.",
          "Though the museum is an important site to see in Havana the exhibit is very basic and consists primarily of pictures from the revolution along with the Cuban perspective on it. It is housed in the very opulent building which had been the Presidential Palace of all Cuban",
          "Its the usual government propaganda the building was spectular, still has the bullet holes from the revolution attack. Has a small snack bar for sodas and water, fortunately being 76 I was allowed to use the elevator , rooms contain picture history of revolution and also a",
          "This museum is located in the former Presidential Palace used by Batista before Fidel's revolution. The building itself is thus a museum exhibit - there are bullet holes in the marble walls inside the entrance from the 1957 assault on Batista in his office. And outside you can",
          "A very worthwhile eye opening and thought provoking visit whilst in Havana giving a detail insight into the Country and its People. We visited on our first day of our visit to Cuba which we found invaluable in understanding how the country had developed since the volatile 1950\u2019s",
          "In the grand house previously occupied by pre revolution presidents this has been converted into a national monument to the 1959 revolution. There are fewer exhibits and more explanatory pieces than I had hoped for but it all gave a great sense of Cuba in my lifetime. Large room",
          "This museum is somewhat disjointed and does not flow in a historical sense. Although it may be partly due to a language barrier (I don\u2019t understand Spanish). There are grainy black and white pictures along with bits of cloth and some art with some descriptions in English, and",
          "A big Communist style museum, similar to those in the former Russian States. Full of hundreds of blurry, black & white photos of Fidel and Che, bits of torn uniforms and odd boots. No sense of sequence of events, just rooms full of pictures and descriptions written too small in",
          "Very interesting and insightful despite, at times, the obvious anti- American slant on events. Worth visit g to put the history of Cuba in context. Good English translations of all exhibits.",
          "Let's remember that the US sponsored an invasion of Cuba in the early 1960's. It's called the Bay of Pigs. The invasion was poorly planned and failed. So this museum is the Cuban government's celebration of Castro's rise to power. It is full of military equipment and portray's",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed looking round this museum and reading about the 'main players' in the revolution. Would definitely recommend if you are in Havana.",
          "Was great to even walk around such a historic building. The planes and tank outside were very cool to see up close. The various artefacts were great to see and it was so interesting to read of the revolution from the Cubans perspective.",
          "Nice to see, interesting to see the revolution from inside and the boat of Fidel used to cross the sea. Otherwise it is another time...",
          "Hubby and I visited this museum on our own when our cruise ship docked in Havana for the day. After handing in our Cuba travel Visas to Cuban customs, we were free to wander around Havana. We used the money exchange in the cruise terminal to get CUC needed for the museum",
          "So, it's not really the best museum you're going to visit in your lifetime, but it has some cool pieces. Mostly it does what a Museum should do - educates about the Revolution. However, it would be good to read beforehand more about the revolutionary struggles to be able to",
          "There is no plan and nothing is in English so you wander and look at \u201citems\u201d behind glass and try to figure out how it relates to the revolution. The \u201cguards\u201d seemed a bit overzealous for what it is and security in general is pretty over the top. The coolest things you can see",
          "Quirky. Interesting, sort of. I'm sure you know that Fidel and Friends won the revolution several decades ago. This museum will reinforce the point. It also makes clear that they didn't think of the CIA as their friend, though it's hard to imagine that the CIA was responsible",
          "The history and background of the revolution laid out in photographic form. So very interesting. We came away with a much better understanding.",
          "The museum tells the history of the period before, during and after the revolution. The difference between this one and others is the fact that almost everything is also available in English. whereas we did not find a lot of those area's in Cuba. Of coarse there is still a lot",
          "Housed in what was once a palace, the museum celebrates the revolution in excruciating, dry detail. More of a display of revisionist history than what Westerners would think of as a museum, it is jam-packed with every piece of memorabilia, newspaper article and scrap of paper",
          "Before visiting this museum, it's better you have some good understanding about thr Cuban history of the revolution. It's not a big museum so only takes less than 1hour to see all. There is some reconstruction ongoing when I visited. It's nice to visit and find out about true",
          "Former presidential palace now being restored to glory which houses the history of the Cuban revolution. Quite a few bits give an insight that it was not all blood & bullets but real reform giving land & literacy to the previously exploited masses. Also taking some ideas back",
          "We would have benefited from using a tour guide as it is not clear which path to follow and this became confusing. This made it difficult to follow the story clearly. Some interesting items, but it is mostly reading from boards. There are some stairs, but lifts for disabled",
          "The museum is interesting only if you have a guide explaining the history behind the items. The organization is actually pretty bad, you don't know where it starts and where it ends and there is not much explanation besides the short captions under the items. I felt a storyline",
          "A lovely building in fairly good condition, with echoes of past grandeur. It was an extremely hot day and the windows were all open to take advantage of the breezes from the sea and the view is fabulous.There was an abundance of information, memorabilia and photographs across",
          "Informative and interesting! The hall is beautiful, and it has a balcony with a view. Not too expensive.",
          "This museum is mostly for the history buff. It has many artifacts from the many revolutions depicting many battles and victories from Baptista to Fidel Castro.",
          "Is everything presented to you in the Museum of the Revolution true? No. But is everything presented to you in the Smithsonian American History museum true? That is a more difficult question. The Museum of the Revolution is an essential experience for an American tourist in",
          "Don't waste your money, uninformative and one sided, missing a lot of information. Better off looking it up on the Internet when you get a connection. The Che museum across the river is a better use of time.",
          "The building itself is quite spectacular. When I went recently, part of the exhibit was closed which made it confusing. You start upstairs at 1959 without any preliminary info. Thankfully some info was in English so I was able to understand what happened but it is not",
          "The building itself is beautiful and undergoing restoration. The exhibits were underwhelming. There just was not much stuff there. Just a series of rooms, many of which were empty. This may change when the restoration is complete but it was just not a good exhibit. You must",
          "There's a lot of interesting content in the museum to read, but much less to see. The top floor with a description of the communist revolution has some artifacts from the rebels (mainly Che), but is mostly a textual description of the events (and not an entirely clear on at",
          "After reading some blogs about the Museum Revolution, I put it on things to do in Havana. On our second day in Hanava, this was the first thing we've done walk to the museum. We got there before it was open, but the security guard didn't let anyone inside. Together with other",
          "We brought our tweens and teens to this museum and the whole family enjoyed it. There is a great chronological history of cuban history with english text. Some bullet hole in the walls from battles, vehicles used during the revolution and a missile. It was a great way to",
          "Given the significance of the Revolution and it\u2019s impact on Cuba since, this museum did not do justice to the event, the struggle or the people. The building was more interesting than the artefacts.",
          "Very informative if you take the time to read and learn. Worth the visit and only takes about an hour or two to go through. Little market on top floor has great prices.",
          "I would call it museum of Fidel Castro instead of revolution. Too many things which doesn't bring any value, is it really so much important what cap or glasses was he wearing? Not worth it's price, quite boring.",
          "We spent about 60 minutes here. The cost was 8CUC per adult with children free if they are younger than 12. Having read a fair amount about the revolution and history of Cuba before visiting it was fascinating to see (some) of the story from the perspective of the Castro",
          "We did this on our last morning in Havana and were glad we did. Don\u2019t expect pristine displays as they obviously can\u2019t afford it but they are very interesting. You start on the highest level and work your way down. Worth a visit.",
          "The story of the ongoing struggles of cuba its post revolution persecution bay of pigs invasion and underminement",
          "First of all, the building itself, the former Presidential Palace, is worth the experience. However, the lasting treasure trove is the three floors of photographs and explanations about the revolutions (plural) in Cuba. One really can gain a sense of Fidel and Che and countless",
          "The museum of the revolution is not just a building that tells us about moments of significant Cuban history, but is a significant piece of it by itself. The outside walls of the rear part of the building are sprinkled with bullet holes stemming from the early days of the",
          "A lot of writing with no much to see. You can see the external area from outside, not necessary to pay to enter the museum.",
          "The museum used to be the presidential palace but the current state of the building looks old and poorly maintained, far from its glory days. The displays were mainly photographs and articles of the revolution, but the reproduction of these documents are poorly done.",
          "Visited the museum whilst in Havana, it\u2019s a work in progress as the building its self (a former Palace) is being renovated. Interesting and great display of vehicles used during the revolution.",
          "Fascinating story told in a wonderful way which tugs at the heart strings. Actual items worn by Che a d Fidel brought tears to my eyes. The separate area reserved to the iconic Granma also beautifully presented. Staff friendly and on site shop sells lovely and a bit unusual",
          "Considering that this was the former Presidential Palace and that this museum is supposed to tell the story of a very important piece of Cuba's history, this building is in extremely poor condition. Even the artifacts are housed in glass cabinets that are so dirty it's hard to",
          "A good way to learn more about the revolution, the key players and the perspectives of what happened in history.",

          "We love it here. we took our time to see everything. We saw the military changing turns very ceremonial. I will do it all over again. My husband love the old military cars and planes outside.",
          "When the rebels arrived in Havana, they captured this building which was the Presidential Palace and made it a headquarters in the city. The bullet holes that are evident in the walls are a striking reminder of the event. Many rooms are filled with cases containing items used",
          "We had several guides over a two week trip and they could not talk about the revolution without saying \"the triumph of the revolution\". In which case this attraction must be an essential on the to do list. It is almost not worth the bother. It starts in a corner of the third",
          "I went to the museum on my first day in Cuba. I had only a passing knowledge of the history of Cuba ( that is history of the last 60 years or so) . This museum gave me a better understanding of the Cuban people, their struggles ( going back to the 19th century) and their",
          "A fascinating hotel full of interesting information and plenty of misinformation as well (its hard to fact check when you dont have google at your disposal!) The yacht, missile, U2 spy plane bits and cars etc were fascinating.",
          "Visited museum, most interesting objects were outside, the building itself and a large Cuban flag. Inside exhibits are mostly photos and commentary (Spanish / English) Interesting for a short visit.",
          "The museum is set up in chronological order of the events of the Revolution. The displays are in Spanish as well as English. It gives the Cuban perspective of the Revolution. Nice to see the less Americanized propaganda. So people may find boring as there is a lot or",
          "For all truly interested in history a brisk walk through this museum is important. If the displays were edited in half would be much better considering the amount of time it takes to carefully read all the labels on important things like Ch\u00e9's boots. The walk through truly is",
          "We decided to go to the museum on our last day and it didn't disappoint. It was very interesting to see various things regarding the revolution. The building itself is beautiful and full of history. I would recommend a visit even if its to get away from the sun. It was",
          "Visited this museum while in Havana recently and was not too impressed at all. It is housed in the former presidential palace which is a nice building but that\u2019s the only positive thing I can say. It\u2019s not like any other museum I\u2019ve ever been too. There were just \u201cposters\u201d in",
          "Intresting place to learn about revolution. It would be easier if there would be more information written in english. They will ask you to leave bags and rucksacks in the lockers. So of you want to use toilet take toiler paper with you.",
          "Such an interesting building with great staff which answer all your questions if you ask. They even took the time to take my picture. Lots of history and worth a visit",
          "What an amazing collection. A must see to understand the history of Cuba. Makes you understand why the gorgeous Cuban people are so proud of their beautiful county.",
          "Unfortunately information is clearly presented but while under renovation some rooms are closed and information is not in chronological order which makes it difficult. Must climb stairs for three stories. $8cuc entrance fee.",
          "Great information in this museum! Very interesting and new facts you could learn coming here. This is a must when coming to Cuba.",
          "They charge high but limit you on what you carry in , what you watch - the attitude is \" we do not care if you visit here or not\" so we left and gave up the \"pleasure\"",
          "Just propaganda on a low cost museum, but the ticket it\u2019s super expensive. It\u2019s only interesting for communist and locals. Don\u2019t lose your time.",
          "They are currently renovating the outside and some part at the inside. But the whole place should have a renovation. Describing the revolution, a lot is in spanish, english is available in some parts. Beside the reading of the boards, not so much to see. So not the ideal place",
          "As a person who appreciates a good museum, and someone who likes to find out information about the place I am visiting, I was satisfied by my experience. The museum tells Cuba's story. It details the lives of Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, the revolution and the impact America's",
          "I liked this museum very much, because I am very interested in Cuba's recent history and had read up on it extensively beforehand. What is very nice is that it is not just all about Che and Fidel, they also honour many other revolutionaries and women who were part of the",
          "The visit to this museum helps to understand the recent history of Cuba. The museum is above all a description of the events that characterized the Cuban revolution. Few finds. The settings are therefore essential and spartan, but this is very much suited to the theme of the",
          "Easy to navigate and attractively arranged, the Museum of the Mexican Revolution in the heart of Mexico City is a must stop for the history buff. I was thrilled to see the famous Zimmerman telegram and other artifacts from the 1910-1920 era that launched modern Mexico. Be sure",
          "You must leave your bags in storage after paying for your ticket, that was chaotic to say the least. Toilets are downstairs on the ground floor and aren't very well signed. To be honest we couldn't follow the exhibit and didn't realise we had to start at the very top, no signs",
          "I'm giving this museum 5 stars because you can't go to Cuba and not see the revolution from the perspective of the people who created it and supported it. It's a slight strange place because it's not clear whether the audience is the international tourist, the local kids or",
          "We decided to come here on the end of our Cuban tour, as we thought it'd help if we'd seen things first. On the way in, you'll have to leave you backpack at the cloakroom. Then head upstairs, all the way to the top. The signs aren't that great, so it took a while to realise",
          "Even if you are not particularly interested in the revolution it is worth visiting this building alone. Starting at the top of the building you can trace the chronological order of events. It was very hot inside as it was July which meant we couldn\u2019t spend long on the top",
          "Beautiful building that used to be a presidential palace, now holds Cuban Revolution artifacts. Lots of history here. I really enjoyed walking around this beautiful building. Amazing views from open balconies on 2nd and 3d floors. Great place to visit, a must do!",

          "If you are a real history lover and want to see and read historical items and statements or the inside of the building then yes, it is worth your time and money. But if you are coming for the sake of ticking boxes of what are available in Havana then not much here to see as the",

          "There are simply too many things in the exibition - far too many words. There is plenty of room to improve. What is the most important story to tell? What is the image that the museum wants to give to the visitors? The story is full of witnesses still alive - why dont you have",
          "Was our very first spot in Havana and a huge disappointment. The entrance fee is 8 cuc per person and we expected something more than some pictures, unclear explanation and some other personal belongings hanging in there. The building itself is indeed beautiful and with a tour",
          "Spent a couple of really interesting hours here and learned a lot. Exhibits are in English as well which was really good. The displays lack the graphic design and polished presentation of uk/us museums, which adds to the overall effect. If I was going to be slightly biased",
          "Alright museum with some intestesting displays but not enough to keep your attention if you already have a grasp of he history. A lot of the displays are more like news clippings or propaganda pieces with sparse facts.Nice views fro, the upper floors. Biggest downside was",
          "You will get a good idea of the revolution and the history around that. Also sets the pace of how the Cubans feel about and experience their own life now. Not being able to speak Spanish though made it difficult to understand some of the exhibitions (actually in the whole of",

For those who know very little (me \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) about US/ Cuban relationship, this is a great place to learn. You can go as deep as you want studying every photograph and reading the comments. A beautiful building with such",

          "Put this up as a 5 star as I believe that everyone visiting Havana, should come here. Yes, it is not finished and layout is slightly confusing, but this is 2 hours well spent. It does not just cover the revolution, although that is the majority - I learned a lot here, but then,",
          "This museum is a must see when visiting havana.Why not visit this museum,after all is all about the revolution,its past,its people,its history.Very well organised,many information and fotos and objects.Some are disturbing to see.Other than that,its informative.Take a foto with",
          "I loved this museo! I would defo recommend for you to go here if you want to learn more about the revolutionaries!! It was amazing to see the old government building which included the door Batista used to rasps from when the rebel\u2019s entered! I would defo recommend a minimum",
          "This museum is located in central Havana, it's big & inviting, and should be considered a 'must see' aside from possibly having to wait in line and pay (much) more than locals. Though a little disorganized and discombobulated, it offers a rich take on the history of this truly",
          "This museum is so helpful in understanding how Cubans think about their history and the present state of things. The translations are kind of rough and the information isn't cited making it a very biased source of information. Not that I think the US is totally innocent but",
          "Just go! It\u2019s a must for one to understand Cuba and the revolution. The CIA does come out of it well!",
          "I would highly recommend visiting this museum and not exactly for its exhibits... In fact, the exhibition is poorly designed, doesn\u2019t flow with the story and you will get confused which room is next to see on which level (You start top of the palace, down). Artefacts stay",
          "This is where it happened. The rooms are small in comparison to the large building... but nonetheless this is where bullets rang and their holes can still be seen... imagine Batista running for his life up the backstairs from his office. There are some great pictures and good",
          "For the significance and history of the building as much as for all the info in it, if there is only one museum in one's list to visit it has to be this one.",
          "I think this is a must-see for Havana visitors. The museum is old-school - no interactive or digital exhibits, building in need of repair, faded photos and peeling exhibit placards. Still, it's a comprehensive look at the history of the revolution with plenty of details, images",
          "Well worth a visit for anyone going to Havana a lot of things to see here if you can read past the propaganda interesting time",
          "Very informative about what happened re the revolution and the good intention of Fidel and how communism worked initially.",
          "My wife and I found this museum to be very interesting. The United States paints such a propaganda filled image of Cuba, that everyone should see and hear the Cuban \"side of the story\". At this museum you will learn much about Fidel, Che' and other people who were influential",
          "This is an interesting place to visit if you have one or two hours to spare - they have many rooms containing a lot of photos, weapons, letters, personal items belonging to the leaders (Che Guevara, Castro...), and other memorabilia along with descriptions of events and battles.",
          "I personally didnt get any enriched by coming here. You see banal things and listen to propaganda. Better off checking a documentary... oh well no unbiased documentary yet available.",
          "The museum is nice but that\u2019s all it is, just nice. Some interesting artifacts are here but it didn\u2019t live up to my expectations. They could\u2019ve done a lot more with all the space the building has. Would\u2019ve wanted to see more.",
          "It a stroll away from the main square worth a visit to educate yourself about the revolution the building is amazing with a lot of ceiling painting and original pieces .",
          "The building is nice and was undergoing some restoration while we were there. The displays are very interesting and in both Spanish and English. Well worth a visit to gain some insight into Cuba's history. There was a school tour there also, they have two planes and a",
          "For the history that represent the place, they could do it better. some rooms are amazing, with full of information and slides but others rooms looks abandoned or even with duplicate information that you already saw in the previus rooms. Is a nice place to go with patience for",

          "This palace used to be the lavish home of the last dictator and it became the museum of the Revolution. Some interesting items, the most important one is the Granma which is the ship Castro took to get to Cuba. The rest are pictures and facts from the revolution.",
          "A must visit ....written in English as well as Spanish. To read and see some of the artifacts was quite an emotional experience. It enabled me to get a greater understanding of what the Cubans went through.",
          "Independently of anybody's political opinion, this is a must see place for any visitor interested in history. The Cuban revolution is of course highlighted in depth, as are almost all areas of the country's development since then. In addition, there are the old presidential",

          "The museum is very old: mostly in Spanish, very old presentation, everything is discoloured and damaged, mostly propaganda pro-revolution information. Interesting architecture. Expensive for the visit (8CUC/person). You can probably do better: rhum museum, Gran Teatro, and cigar",
          "Interesting, a must if you want to learn more about how Cuba want you to view them. A bit messy of an installation, but look at the bigger picture",
          "Ok it\u2019s propaganda. Not subtle but a welcome alternative to the view we get from abroad. Mostly newspaper cuttings, old photos an lists of dates. We\u2019re interested in politics so found it worth a visit, but some people may not get much from it. The museum also includes the",

          "The museum is housed in the old Presidential Palace and has some beautiful neo-classical elements. It was even decorated by Tiffany's! There was definitely lots to see and we spent about 2 hours making our way around. It was very interesting reading about the revolution and the",
          "Ok this museum is in my opinion a must! - but be prepared to read some hard truths of the history of Cuban people but try to hang in there as it helps you really get to appreciate the country and their struggle. The exhibits are set outside the museum beside a memorial and i",

          "I learned so much while on this tour; I did not know what to expect going in, but the guide was knowledgeable and I had the best time seeing all that they had to offer there.",
          "You can\u2019t go to Cuba and not know about the Revolution. The Museum and it\u2019s surrounding are astonishing and is well worth the visit.",
          "All is in the title. Basically, a very discutable interpretation of the Story mostly in favor of the government.",
          "Interesting museum full of artefacts relating to the Revolution in Cuba. Some facts have a propagandist slant but it is still fascinating to learn about this part of Cuban history through the Communist party's eyes.",
          "Well, mucho propaganda but it gives you an insight into how and why Cuba is the way it is. I really enjoyed it.",
          "This museum is first and foremost a display of communist propaganda, which one should expect while in Cuba. The museum architecture was quite beautiful. As a museum there was limited \u201cartifacts\u201d. it was carefully curated to demonstrate the strength of the communist government",
          "We visited the museum and felt totally humbled by the tasks achieved by those who are part of the revolution. A must if you want to know the history of Cuba. We both felt totally inspired and in awe of Fidel, Che and the rest of the revolutionaries.",
          "The walls still have the marks from the bullets fired when, in March 1957, revolutionary university students attacked to try to kill President Batista. Less than two years later, Batista had gone and the new Cuban government was in power. What do you do with an empty",
          "The museum is in a beautiful building but the presentation of information is rather dated. The museum at Che\u2019s mausoleum in Santa Clara is better. Still, it was interesting.",

          "You pay a relatively high entrance fee. and it seems none of those money are given to maintenance of this place. It is literally failing apart, bathrooms not working, dirty... About the exhibition - it seems that It was created in the 80's and never changed afterwards.",

          "This place is really run down! Broken windows, old labeling, out-dated exhibitions. I thought they would cherish a place like this in Cuba. It was an eye-opener to me. A lot of propaganda and you get an impression of what the political system must be like.",

          "You have to see this place to help understand current Cuba and their revolution even if you don\u2019t agree with the politics. We did the tour on our own but may have been better with a guide. A few more English signs would have helped. The outdoor displays of the Granma yacht and",
          "For me as an American, this was a must see in understanding to what ends the CIA will go to win at any cost. That a small group of eighty men could have inspired a population to prevail for fifty years over huge odds demonstrates the integrity of their cause.",
          "Firstly. Having this in the old presidential palace is just perfect. Also its in the center of the city and very accessible. The building is beautiful and very well kept. The guides are very helpful and enthusiastic. The most incredible thing is the exhibits!! I was blown away",
          "This building was the Presidential Palace of all Cuban presidents from Mario Garc\u00eda Menocal to Fulgencio Batista. It became the Museum of the Revolution after the Cuban Revolution. Prior to going to Havana, we watched the 8-part documentary \"Cuba Libre\" on Canadian Netflix.",
          "By all means, come and spend a few hours here. It certainly has the Cuban point of view, but it is very fascinating.",

          "Housed in a beautiful building ( the Presidential Palace), we found the museum to be an extremely interesting and informative documentation of the revolution. Outside there are vehicles used in the campaign as well as the yacht Granma. Good value for money and well worth a visit",
          "My friend and I visited the museum one day. It really is one of the must see things in Havana. Gives the history of how this great country has evolved and fought. Lots of authentic memorabilia on show along with the stories (in Spanish and English) besides each one. Amazing",

          "A very interesting museum of the revolution from the Cuban perspective. Situated in the old presidential palace perhaps to show what they were rebelling against. The material could be presented in a more user friendly way and involves probably too much reading for your average",

          "If you are like me and during your travels want to learn about an event/conflict/etc. from the \"other side\", this museum does not disappoint. Don't miss the displays in the front of the museum or in the park at the back... Originally the headquarters of the Cuban government,",

          "Be prepared for a revolutionary spin on all the displays - adds to the fun but gets a little jaded after a while. Lots on show but it's not easy to follow and the translations tend to be sporadic. Particularly liked the jibes at US presidents but can't help but feel it's a bit",
          "The inside of the museum opened at 10:00 AM and I had to be out by 11:00. 8 CUC to get in for non-cubans. Needless to say, it was not enough time. I would recommend 2 hours. There was a great variety in the things they presented and everything was written in both english and",
          "museum specialized on the Cuban revolution, people, equipment and belongs that been used at that time.",
          "This museum was quite eye opening. Every story has 2 sides and then normally the truth lies between the two. As an American I had a different perception of Cuba and its history. I'm very happy I was able to see Cuba's version of events. This is a good place to visit. The",
          "Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Had pride in their country. Learned a lot of history. We were in a taxie but were allowed to sit in the old cars for pictures.",
          "There are a wide variety of displays here, interesting and not so interesting. In general not well explained. The boat that is the main attraction( my opinion) you can't get close to and is obscured by sunscreen. There are some intriguing vehicles ( like milk vans) that used to",
          "We were on a person-to-person tour in Cuba and spent two days in Havana. On the second day we had a choice of visiting the National art museum or the Revolution Museum. We opted for the Revolution Museum (turns out the other group wasn\u2019t allowed in the art museum anyway). The",
          "The old Presidential Palace is now a museum to the Cuban Revolution. Full of historical artifacts. A must see.",
          "Interesting to hear/see history from a different point of view. Cool to see the yacht Castro used to travel to Cuba for the invasion. I think it could have been more informative.",
          "I really enjoyed touring this museum. While I know there is much anti-American sentiment and propaganda in every sign and explanation, I found the history very interesting!! Worth the money (about $10 USD)",
          "The museum is worth a visit to better understand the Revolution and history of Cuba. There is a lot of propaganda, which was expected. What I didn't expect was the bad maintenance of the whole museum, the exposition is really old, generally bad kept, and some rooms were closed",
          "I speak Spanish and I like history so I found this museum very interesting, but it is true that a lot of explanations are missing in English. Maybe it is worth to take a guide, I don't know. The museum explains the 'Movimiento de 26 de Julio' starting in 1953. It is interesting",
          "This was the best attraction I went to while in Havana. The displays are very well represented, some in English and gives a good idea what happened during the Revolution. It is a must see while in the city. A person could spend several hours visiting the various exhibits.",
          "Propaganda at its finest. This museum has displays laying out the (improbable) actions by the CIA (a U.S. intelligence agency) against the Cubans - kidnapping children and putting them up for adoption in the U.S.A., contaminating clouds to destroy the Cuban sugar harvest,",
          "Really not recommended. 8 cuc per person and seriously overrated. Dilapidated. Part of exhibits aren't even there and unlikely to make a come back. Not kept at all. Pass!",
          "Great place to check out, 3 floors of exhibits, and outside with old cars, Fidel Castro boat, and much more, much more history than I realized especially on Che. Definitely a place to check out worth the 8 CUC entrance fee. Loved the huge Cuban flag in the courtyard/",
          "It is always fantastic to get a view of history from the perspective of the people that lived it. Very informative.",
          "Although the exhibits are a bit hard to follow the building is beautiful and worth the visit. You do get a sense of post revolution history.",
          "Spent some time here wandering through the exhibitions and learning more about the revolution. Building quite dated but it's still worth a visit.",
          "Interesting building and many artifacts from the Revolution. Ceilings were beautifully decorated ed( see photos) Plenty of information about the various items displayed. Well worth a visit, all our group agreed on this.",
          "I've always been passionate about the history of Cuba. Have seen many documentaries, read various biographies of Che and Fidel... I know quite a lot about Cuba and the revolution and I was quite excited about going here, despite the bad reviews I heard from people around me.",
          "This museum gives a very good sense of the Cuban identity and pride. It is interesting to see themes you learn here pop up in other areas of the city. There are important artifacts and good information about the people and history of Cuba.",
          "The Museo de la Revolucion combines a glimpse of old Spanish imperial Havana, alongside the 'modern' history of the 1959 Revolution - bullet holes in the wall included - much of it taking you back to the 1950s and 1960s in content and tone. Not to be missed!",
          "Truly recommended since this defines the current Cuba. A great way to fully understand the background leading up to, and the victory of the Revolution. Enough English used to explain each element. Plan on 60+ minutes if you really wish to appreciate the majority of the",

          "The museum is housed in a magnificent building, but the interior is very run down and is currently in the process of being renovated, so much of the interior is closed off. The main interest is in the exterior part, where there are several items from the Revolution - planes and",
          "Luckily, we had been warned to arrive early at the Museum so there was hardly anybody there when we arrived, but when we left the line was very long (The Cruise ships must be in). This Museum is located in Old Havana in what used to be the Presidential Palace, the last of which",
          "Incredible history told at this museum, a must do when in Havana. The cars and boat outside are very interesting to see as well.",
          "My 2nd time in Havana and never got chance to visit the first year so it was a must on my list. We didn't get a tour guide it a cheaper to go and pay 8 cuc pp and worth going at your own pace. The is loads of history and some very interesting memorabilia from the revolution.",
          "Overall a fairly interesting experience as you can see how the Cubans view/ are taught history. Nothing overly spectacular or super interesting until you get to the massive mural of US presidents. A golden opportunity to have some good pictures taken of yourself if you weren't a",
          "It has a Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, dogma, martyrdom, shrines, relics and holidays. Take an opportunity to see the revolution from the other side, how it succeeded and why... and how Bautista avoided the early attempts on his life -- and the bullet holes in the staircase.",
          "The museum itself is old with yellowed photos and documents in obsolete cases. However, it is a very educational trip from 1953 up until the takeover by Castro. It\u2019s the only museum I saw with explanations in both Spanish and English. It is housed in the old presidents house and",
          "It was extremely insightful to understand the role that the USA played during the Bay of Pigs, Quantanamo from a Cuban perspective.",
          "As an American, I grew up learning about Cuba in a certain way, so when I had the opportunity to visit Havana I thought it was important to see their national history museum and learn about their point of view. I wasn't disappointed. Most of the exhibits have English",
          "its nice to learn alternative side of the story... Building where the museum is located is pretty, staff is nice. But museum doesnt have much in it. Old shoes... newspaper, some charts... thats it. Its definitely for Cubanos who learn about revolution at school. For me just",

          "I went here on a spare hour whilst walking around Old Havana. It's reasonably engaging but the entry fee was quite steep for what it is. Obviously the views presented are somewhat biased but it was still interesting to learn about the history of the revolution. Not all of the",
          "Spent a couple of hours here learning about Cuban history and the Revolution. Beautiful building which is undergoing restoration and where you can see bullet holes from the Revolution on the grand staircase. Lots of interesting exhibits and as someone else has said most but not",
          "This was a very interesting museum. They are still working on some of the floors/exhibitions but that did not stop us enjoying both the architecture of this building or the displays and history of Cuba! Most of the displays and information were translated into English but",
          "Don't be offended... speech, heat and scaffolding but great lemonade I attended an event there and although the building was beautiful, it was hot and had lots of scaffolding. I think it was under renovation in the same areas more than one year ago. Things move slow... As for",
          "Our tourist guide told us that we will need at least 3 hours for this visit but we spent hardly 1 hour (which included drinking in the local bar). Its good for those who are not familiar with Cuba history but if you came well prepared its not gonna impress you. Its looks pretty",
          "Tells the romantic story of Fidel Castro, Che Gevuara and others, form the official cuban point of view, with many artifacts etc. but it is also in the old presidential palace, which is worth seeing by itself. At the outside display, bullet-riddled transport from the",
          "The museum was incredible, beautiful artwork and historical exhibits. I was truly inspired to do further reading and research about the Cuban revolution. My only complaint would be the bathrooms had no toilet paper and no seats on the toilets.",
          "So, not the best laid-out museum and it probably helps if you can grasp some Spanish, but there are some exhibits translated into English. Particularly interesting is the contrast of the Cuban view of events like the Bay of Pigs compared to the US/UK view we've grown up with -",
          "A good opportunity to learn about the island's history from the Cuban perspective. A guided tour is best unless you are fluent in Spanish. It is best to allocate at least 1.5 to 2 hours to the museum visit. The museum building itself and its courtyard along with several outdoor",
          "It is not a great museum, in fact, in the states, we would say it is a poor museum. Poor signage, not much in English, mostly just pictures and of course, a very political message. Having said all of that, I think it is a must see, because in 90 minutes you can get a very",

          "I was amazed by the building in which this museum is situated - the old Presidential Palace with all the excess that you might expect. It is good to see that the building is being renovated, as it is spectacular. The display is also undergoing renewal, which is a good thing,",
          "I think this is a must-do in Havana but we really didn't need a lot of time. First of all, it is hot! No fans at all or any air circulation. Employees were going into the closet and grabbing hand fans. The exhibit was not in order chronologically, which would have been",
          "We loved our visit here as it provided a great summary of the events of the Revolution - some we knew and much we didnt. Well worth the visit - even in the heat",
          "The museum is in the home of the deposed corrupt leader Batista. It's primitive - mostly made up of photos and pieces of clothing and equipment from the revolution. The style is very Cuban (sparse, simple) but it tells an amazing story. You can agree, or disagree with the",
          "This is a place to visit if you want to understand how the Cuban revolution evolved. There a of items from the guerrilla and the photographs are iconic. Essential to understand how the revolutionaries well used propaganda to achieve success.",
          "wanna see the boat, the planes and the cars ysed for the revolution ? this is the place all the press articles, military suits and other historical equipments a must for history fans",
          "A real must-see when in Havana. You learn so much, and get to understand the troubled history of Cuba first-hand. The photographs, the letters and historical documentation is dramatic and very moving.",
          "When mostly through the museum, it struck me that I was having a Deja Vu. The particular one was when we backed the Shah of Iran and he was overthrown and we ceased relationships with that country. We know people who lived in Iran when this happened While one can have",
          "Due to the cash issues you can have we immediately and armed about visiting as we slowly ran out of cash - but it was worth the extra couple of days of pizzas and yogurt breakfasts from the little hole in the wall places. Fantastic array of displays giving a great overview of",
          "There's plenty of information here about the history of Cuba. Good English translations too (not always the case in other museums). Not very hands-on for children but there is an area with weapons and vehicles etc that was fun for a 13 year old boy. Small cafe and decent toilets!",
          "Wasn't sure how this would go down with my friends as they weren't really keen on visiting. However, with captions on displays in both English and Spanish, we all were soon engrossed in following the 'plot'. Everyone agreed at the end that it had been a great place to visit.",
          "I wouldn't have missed this museum for the perspective it gave on Cuba's history. The building is impressive and I also enjoyed seeing the Granma yacht out the back. My thoughts are that the exhibits could tell the story better than they do. It is more of a piece by piece",
          "Quite incredible museum that explains a lot about Cuba's recent political history. All one-sided of course but that's the country. It's all here even down to the bullet marks on the stair walls! Maybe some of the exhibits could do with tidying up but then the way they are",

          "Good place to start if you know nothing about the history and the context of the revolution. Dry exposition with many recovered objects from the key figures of the revolution (e.g., shoes of..., jacket of..., handkerchief of..., and so on) and some historical context filled with",

          "Fascinating and informative, the museum is housed in the pre-revolutionary Presidential Palace and tells the history of post-colonial Cuba leading up to the 1959 revolution, the key events of the revolution and details how Cuba was reorganised to become a successful Socialist",
          "OK, so it's not a perfect modern museum. But it does give a taste of the revolutionary history and is in an impressive setting. The garden and Bay Of Pigs exhibits is probably the best bit, but there is something about the endless rooms of black and white photographs that",
          "The Museo de la Revolucion is one of the museums in Cuba and a must if you'd like to know more about the past of the country. The history starts with the upcoming of the revolutionary groups and ends with current day history. Even though it's one of Cubans best, don't get your",

          "I heard and read mixed reviews about the Museo, but I'm glad I went. It was a bit outdated and cluttered, but it was very interesting to get the perspective of the government of what happened around the revolution time. Lots of anti American propaganda. The building itself was",
          "We visited this museum on our 2nd day in Cuba. We were not planning on visiting any museums, but noted that our knowledge of the Cuban history was lacking and needed an upgrade. This museum was great for that! Mostly it consists mostly of rooms filled with a variety of objects",
          "Disappointing that our guide did not tell us that our backpacks and larger purses were not allowed in this museum which is a former Presidential palace. Too bad we had to miss it as there was no way we were leaving our bags with the people at the front desk. A missed opportunity.",
          "This museum should have been updated by now... Still, it's pretty interesting to find out about the story of the revolution, the official side, that is. But even if it's \"the official\" side of things, it's a good start if Cuban history is new to you; it might peek your",

          "Very interesting and historical place to go and look round. Lots of reading. Souvenir places to buy things the wooden cars are very well made here on one stall and a decent price, wish I'd got one there.",

          "Here is the story. Everything is very well exposed. Every detail is incredible. It is a place of impressive architecture. Beautiful paintings on the ceilings or \"frescos.\" Explains every detail of the revolution. Its priorities in the education and health of the people. Is in",
          "This was a must visit for my son and yes we did all enjoy reading everything to try and understand what Cuba is all about. Its very hard to rationalise communism when you come from a massively consumer orientated world. It was a very hot day so not great for that but I would",
          "Of course: if you expect to get a balanced view of the recent (although it is already 60 years!) history, this is not the place to find it. Nevertheless, a trip to Cuba would not be complete without a visit to this showcase of the heroic aspects of \"La Revolucion\"",

          "The museum is housed in what was the Presidential Palace of all Cuban presidents from Menocal to Batista. I liked the contrast between the decadent presidential Palace and the pictures and artefacts of the revolution. The outside exhibition is the most impressive.",
          "I was expecting a lot more for a museum about such an important part of Cuba's history. Very disappointing. There is so much history related to the revolution, but the displays are old and poorly put together. The most interesting part is outside, where the Gramma (boat Fidel",

          "This museum has a lot to see but the problem is that everything was in Spanish. I have not been there since 2016 but that is how it was then. Worthwhile either way",

          "Potential is there for an outstanding museum. Poor exhibit labels and very hot inside. A bit thin in exhibits.",
          "The added bonus is you get to see a building where some of the events actually happened. The displays are a little homemade in places but you do get to learn a bit about attitudes to the west and America in particular.",
          "To get the most from this museum having an idea of the main players and events of the revolution would be beneficial. The building itself is fascinating- designed by tiffanys- and gives an insight into the excesses before the revolution. Many interesting artefacts including",
          "We went to very few museums..in fact I dont really enjoy museums since Chicago has some world class museums but this one is special. Read a little about the history of Cuba before you go so you can get the feel of why the revolution is so alive so many years later. Cuba is proud",
          "I truly enjoyed learning the other side of the story as far as Cuban-American relations go. It is a great privilege to visit this place and simply read about their history. I was reminded by a local that much of it is also purely propaganda. I left there hating America lol...and",

          "this museum is good to see, although it costs 8 CUC, but we can explore the history of Revolution in Cuba and things connected with it",
          "This is one of the few buildings in Cuba that is not only standing, but is actually in good condition. This was a first for me, starting with the tanks and airplanes located around the entire perimeter of the building. The entire visit was very interesting and very unusual.",

          "Popped in to see this place. Was originally called the Governors Palace where Bastista had his office. The office is set up with furniture, interesting. Don't miss the great hall. Under renovation in some parts and a big place with displays of the revolution history. $7 entry.",
          "This was a pretty cool museum, although I was expecting more of Fidel Castro to be featured. It heavily emphasized Che more than either Castro brother. Definitely worth seeing if in Havana.",

          "Spent a couple of hours here and it was brilliant. Lots of actual pictures, letters, uniforms and newspapers. They are refurbishing at present and you can still see the bullet holes in the walls. Seemed to be more about Che Guevara that Fidel Castro, but Che looked good and",

          "I was so excited to visit Cuba and the Museum of the Revolution was definitely on the list. I enjoyed the time there to learn more about the country and its complexity. I would recommend it. This is not a 'traditional' museum. Its like reading a history book in school. If that",
          "I went there with five friends who were traveling together, and this museum received mixed reviews in our group. One observation - there is a lot of \"text\" (and regime propaganda) compared to actual artifacts to look at and observe. The members of our group who knew less about",
          "Due to the high ticket price, we had some high expectations for the museum. Despite the beautiful building, the content of the museum was not impressive. Almost nothing is translated to english. If you however speak Spanish, i guess the museum is more interesting.",
          "This is a must to get to know the history of the revolution and understand Cuba today. Do not miss this! Interesting read on the Cuban side of history and the Missile crisis and how they view American government. Make sure you go out outside and see the Gramma and the military",
          "If you want to see a collection of printed propaganda pictures and some Che Guevara's pants and pay 8 CUC, this museum is for you.",
          "I didn't expect the Museum of the Revolution to be balanced or objective; so i wasn't disappointed. This place is The Party Line all the way. Conservatives will probably be annoyed, leftists will be (unduly and inaccurately) inspired, Cuban exiles from Miami will be enraged",
          "In the old presidential palace; you can still see the pock-marked marble stairway, from the bullets. You get a sense of the pride Cubans have for their country and recent history, and it's interesting to see US involvement from another point of view. I enjoyed seeing the",
          "You can really imagine the important history that took place here. And even though only my husband likes cars and tanks etc those parts were fascinating. people who are expecting more are comparing to Europe. I loved the unapologetic pro communist narrative. eat at Cha Cha",
          "This is a real must see in Havana which depicts the years leading up to and beyond the revolution. The building itself is the main attraction as this is were it pretty much began. You can trace the history events that shaped Cuba to what it is today and emphasis with the people",
          "The information is interesting and the price was fair, but overall subpar for a museum of such importance. The exhibitions were very old, poorly done and not particularly engaging. It is helpful to know some history of Cuba's past and of the revolution to add to the significance",
          "My son and I usually are not big on museums, but this places was absolutely fascinating! We spent a wonderful couple of hours browsing the exhibits and learning this history of the Cuban revolution. Many of the exhibits have explanations in English. It was amazing thinking about",
          "This was tough to do with 30 kids and a soft-spoken tour guide. The exhibitions are old and not especially engagingly presented \u2014 you really have to be interested in the subject matter \u2014 but the building is beautiful.",
          "You can view all the cars, tanks and planes used during the revolution, all the history is decribed there, you will learn ao much during your visit",
          "The whole history of Cubas Revolutions are in this building. From the Liberation from Spanish Rule to Liberation from Bautista. The Granma is there - the little boat that brought Fidel and other revolutuonaries from Mexico. The building was a Palace of past Presidents but now is",
          "We were hyped up to go to Museum, but it was underwhealming. Not to impressive exhibitions even though the history it self is really interesting. They could with ease do this double the experience. Don\u00e4t go here if you dont feel comfortable with Spanish, since almost nothing",
          "Don't waste your time and money to watch xerox copies of political propaganda. The exhibit is a reflection of the poor state the revolution left this beautiful country in.",
          "A bit shabby, but I guess any more expense dedicated to this propaganda palace would just be more taken away from someone who needs it more. Somewhat educational, if you've got enough Spanish, and definitely not a balanced perspective on the historical events. But the armored",
          "This is one of those museums that you feel you HAVE to visit but the quality of the expositions is quite poor. Expected a lot of propaganda so that didn't surprise me but didn't learn anything much.",
          "we paid full price for having half of the museum closed, even the main room was under restoration. I asked for part of my money back and they laughed at me.",
          "This is a must for a trip to Cuba. Gives info of important Cuban history. Must see in term of history but really slightly lacking in execution of a museum. Exhibits are about dated and disorganized. All the text is based on photos and details and lacks the overarching big",
          "As others have said, this was certainly a unique thing to experience as an American. The bias is obvious, although I'm not sure what I expected as it was the Revolution museum. It is mostly in spanish, which wasn't a huge problem since I can speak it fairly well, but if you",
          "As an American, it was an eye opening story of the Cuban Revolution. The former presidential palace was gorgeous and the Granma was interesting. We can only read a little spanish but they seem to have been translating many sections.",
          "I was surprised how many people recommended this site because it really was not worth it. I knew that some of the exhibits would be rundown and only in Spanish, but a more accurate description was all of the exhibits were rundown, and very few were in English. There is no AC",
          "Amazing historical site - it was used after the revolution as the seat of government so there is more to it than just the exhibits. Granma, military tanks, planes and cars, and a piece of the original wall around Havana were worth seeing too.",
          "Much of the museum is in Spanish and unless you have done some reading on the Revolution, you likely won't get much out of this museum. Also note that you have to check your bags at the door and they wouldn't let us into the building with the boat in it with a small purse.",
          "Budget a few hours to look through this museum. It is several stories and also includes an outdoor section where the Granma is encased by glass. If you are a history buff, a leftist, or a combination of the two (like me) this is a must see attraction!",
          "The museum is basically propaganda for the current administration.The good stuff can be see from the street. Outside the fence you can view the boat Fidel and his small army brought from Mexico. The command car of Raul is an old Pontiac.Their are other relics of the revolution",
          "Like most of Cuba, no A/C. You start on the third floor and work down in chronological order of how and when the Revolution started. If going to Santiago de Cuba, the musuem inside the Army Barrack that Castro first shot up is better and has A/C",
          "We visited the museum on a recent visit to Havana. Admission is about 8 CUCs. The exhibits are mostly in Spanish, however, many had English Translations. It was very interesting to learn about the history of the Cuban Revolution, and the people that were involved. As you",
          "Located in what was the Presidential Palace, the Museum of the Revolution tells the story of Cuba's contemporary history. Very interesting and educational.",
          "I hadn't experienced propaganda like this since the Scientology exhibit in Hollywood warning about the \"dangers\" of psychiatry. This was the best example of how ego brought an entire country to its knees. It's sad, inaccurate at times, and not very well maintained. It was also",
          "Good place to learn of the Cuban revolution. Would learn more if you can read Spanish. Interesting exhibits across the road , the cruise ship that took Fidel Castro to Cuba and the van riddled with bullet holes. Small cafe on site if you need a breather from the heat.",
          "We live the bustling as well as the art work that defines the exquisite moments of being in Cuba ! We would recommend a visit for all!",
          "A good museum to visit. They have an elevator but will not let people use it. One people in the group needed to use it. The museum is good to review or learn about the Cuban revolution. One sees also the point of view of the revolutionary people. There is a good restaurant in",
          "This museum is a fascinating look into the Cuban mindset. It's best visited if you know a little about the Cuban revolution and some of the key events that have taken place with the US over the last 60-70 years. The perspective presented here is a completely opposing",
          "This was a good museum to visit and get a better understanding of some of the aspects of the revolution. Some images on display may be disturbing for some, but it helps to explain why the revolution took place. Most of the artefacts have a plaque that provides information",
          "So much information! My brother is a historian and geeks out over this stuff, but as a novice I found it fascinating! It was eye opening to see news paper articles from Cuba with headlines and content that described terrorist tactics used by the CIA that you can see now on CNN",
          "Located in the former presidential palace, the Museum of the Revolution is a treasure-house of literal relics of the Cuban revolution. You'll see Castro's boots, Che's beret and bullet holes in the walls from the revolutionary attack. And also salsa classes in the courtyard and",
          "A little pricey for what we got to look at. The place needed a deep cleaning and many needed repairs.",
          "Take time to walk the museum - history galore. Take pictures. There's a history lesson in each room.",
          "An interesting and informative lesson on how to stage a revolution. Batista's former palace is beautiful. The bullet marks add a sense of reality to what occurred in that very spot so many years ago.",
          "It was informative enough but hard work reading/walking and doing it with no chronological order. Room for improvement.",

          "This is not a 10-minutes in and out museum! You have to take time to truly appreciate it; also speaking Spanish helps a lot, as some texts are not translated in English. Outside there are a few army planes and other vehicles displayed. Cameras are allowed, but you will have to",
          "This was a much looked forward to visit and the building itself was grand and beautiful. While there were a good number of rooms and exhibits to see, be aware that almost all of the descriptions are in Spanish. Sadly, as a non Spanish reader, it meant that I probably missed",
          "For what you would think would be the most important message of the Cuban history, I found most of this attraction lacking. They have a section with the boat that started the revolution and several trucks and military equipment from the time period, but the exhibits inside the",
          "As far as museums go it's probably lacking (but you generally come to expect that in Cuba), but it has a lot of interesting artifacts. It's worth going to to have a look, and the setting of the museum is spectacular.",
          "This museum is is a beautiful building and contains exhibits from the revolution. While folks I was with found it boring, (as it is a little drab and due to a lack of funds a tad shabby) but the artifacts they have are really fascinating. I would suggest reading up a little on",
          "Quite interesting to read history from the other side. The building is, in itself, fascinating, because there are still signs of resistance that are permanently encased in the marble walls. But, the building, like most buildings, are in disrepair. Look up and around, read the",
          "I am a museum fanatic. And, although this museum does not have all of the fancy displays and and advanced technical displays, it definitely gives you history. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the history of Cuba. Outside of Cuba I would give it a lower rating,",
          "This was once the presidential palace of General Batista. It is a fascinating experience to walk through the various rooms which are a tribute to the revolution. It details the beginning, all the various trials and hardships endured, which culminate in the Cuba we see today.",
          "We spent hours in this museum soaking up the history of the Cuban Revolution. Its housed in a beautiful building and the displays are well done. It has an outdoor area with a plane, vehicles and the Granma - all from the time of the revolution. The museum is extremely",
          "Really interesting museum with lots of information and photos. Also home to the Granma which is the boat in which Castro sailed to Cuba. Particularly amused by the Corner of Cretins featuring Batista, Bush Sn & Jr and Reagan.",
          "The first thing to recognise is the significance of this building to the history of modern Cuba - I'm sure that for the local population it is very important. The building itself is very impressive and was (I think) the old Presidential palace before the revolution. However, as",

It boasts many rooms dedicated to the rise of communism, the fall of capitalism, and (biasedly) explains how Cuba became the country",
          "The museum is definitely a must see if you are visiting Havana.We spent over 2 hours checking all the floors and the exhibition outside.",
          "We visited Cuba for the first time before it get flooded with tourists. They are slowly renovating Havana for Cuba 500 years birthday. You can see the old and in progress renovations. People are friendly, architecture lots of souvenir and lots of propaganda for the regime."

          "The main building didn't really cater for non-Spanish speakers very well, an audio tour would probably make it very interesting. The vehicles outside were more interesting but it would be better to understand the story behind each one. It was more interesting to watch the dance lessons in the empty rooms and courtyard. ",
          "Excellent collection of photos and artefacts",
          "Big square with a Cuban history and rural times. A Cuban guide told us about the place and all important facts in the history of Cuba in the years '60.",

          "A small museum but with highly detailed explanations about interesting Cuban history & revolution (English & Spanish). Costs 8 CUC for foreigners (8 CUP for locals).",

          "The setup of the exibition and organization of the museum is bad. You may understand the exibition only with the guide and there are no guides available. The building and the arhitecture is beautiful. The museum ia connected with the outside Granma memorial, which also lacks any explanation of the items presented.",
          "Very interesting and fascinating.",
          "It was not worth the price. There was very little to see and the graphics and layout of the story it was trying to tell were sloppy.",
          "A horribly one sided and misinformed museum, don't bother spending the money. The Che museum is a much more informative use of your time",
          "All the exhibits were subtitled in English. The museum is clean, bright and airy. There is a coat check and no water is allowed inside. Make sure to check out the \"Wall of Cretins\" about American presidents!",
          "It was interesting to read and see the revolution from the Cuban perspective. A great many of the exhibits had English subtitles as well to make it easier to understand. Definitely worth a stop if you're in Havana. ",

          "Making photo inside is no possible",
          "Very neat museum and first time visitors to Cuba must check it out.  It tells the story of the Revolution and why Cuba is where it's at today, in terms of political landscape.",

          "Interesting, I believe that as you are in Havana you must go.",
          "I was recommended to visit the museum and I was glad that I did! It was a very interesting place with a lot of pro Cuban government propaganda. The building that it is in is kept quite well and it is a beautiful historic building. Well worth a visit, but must be noted that there is an entrance fee. ",
          "Great visit if you are interested to learn more about the Cuban revolution (strategies, objects etc).",
          "Interesting place to visit, not great, but at least worthwhile to see some serious propaganda!",
          "Homophobic owner",
          "Really interesting I would be even more interested to see how it looks once the renovations are completed!",
          "8 CUC entrance fee is absolutely reasonable  .. lots of exponates that show the time from 1950 to 1990 with different,  non-american eyes. I guess in Germany we learnt more reality than the USAmericans. For sure the entire structure of \u2026",
          "I was waiting something more!",
          "If you are offened by \"them\" not liking Americans all the time - don't go - there are digs against the US here and there. That having been said, it is really interesting to see photos and artifacts of times, places, events.  Sadly for \u2026",
          "A wonderful space showing off the great accomplishments of the Cuban Revolution. Full of relics and artifacts from the War. Definitely portrays America poorly but definitely fitting for the regime.",
          "Good place",
          "One best museum on Havana",
          "If you're in Havana you gotta go to this museum. More shameless propaganda than history (Unless you actually believe Dengue virus was introduced in Cuba by the CIA) but, it has a lot of interesting artifacts that belonged to the heroes of the revolution and the famous Granma yacht in the memorial across the street.",
          "A stirring shrine the Cuban Revolution. The yacht, Granma, was the most moving to me. It sits in a glass pavilion on the museum property. The museum collection is a shrine to the audacious success of the Cuban revolution. \n\nThe collection \u2026",

          "very nice place.",

          "Beautiful architecture badly maintained. The revolution exhibition is similar to those we once do in China, focusing mainly on the revolution leaders, whose personal belongings are on display. There is some student made arts located upstairs.",
          "some amazing history here! beautiful building! we went and werent disappointed! we will return!",
          "Very limited things in this museum. Not alot of actual artifacts but just more of a art gallery to best describe this museum. And even then what's inside is very limited.",
          "The building is gorgeous and worth the price of admission. The tourists pretty expensive and you're not allowed to bring any photographic equipment except for cell phones into the museum. A lot of the attractions are not incredibly technically well put together but some of the pieces are interesting.",
          "It's an awesome place to visit. It shows another side of the story we all know but some of the information have to be taken with a grain of salt. It is quite interesting to see how a totalitarian regime is portraying the revolution and how the rest of the world is being described. My favorite part of the museum was the wall of cretins.",
          "Small museum with a few military vehicles outside in the back",
          "A small museum, very informative with some good exhibits.",
          "Very interesting",
          "A raw view into the struggle of the revolution and desire to overcome",
          "Amazing place to visit.",
          "Walking around inside the former Presidential Palace is cool, and a couple of the exhibits were interesting, but overall it's too expensive (8 CUC) and disappointing.",
          "Very interesting history of the Cuban people. The building its self is wonderful to look at and has wonderful architecture inside. Definitely a must see when visiting Havana.",
          "Great museum.  Really gives you an insider's perspective on the revolution.  It's located in the old presidential palace which is a magnificent building.  You can see Batista's office the way it was left at the end of the revolution.",
          "Definitely worth checking out. The Museo has very detailed exhibits relaying the events  of the revolution as they unfolded and the lives of the men and women who participated. It also goes on to describe the positive effects of the \u2026",
          "Interesting. Gave good insight into Cuba's rich history and past oppression. Did seem biased at some points but very eye opening.",
          "It was very interesting to see the history Cubans are taught about their relations with the US, as well as learn about the heroes of the revolution. It was nice to get an alternate view of events between the two countries.",
          "I really liked that place. Brings you back into the young history of Cuba.",
          "Don't miss this informative museum.  It will give you a better understanding of Cuba.",
          "Could me more interactive. It's too much text to read",
          "Great way to learn the Cuban history",
          "Definitely download google translate with the Spanish package so you can translate the images. Works really well. \n\nThe place is mesmerising. ",
          "A must visit to learn the struggle for freedom by Cubans",
          "The evils of America all presented in one convenient location.",
          "It will tell you the story from the side of the Cuban government. In in the you might get convinced by their cause. You need to speak at least a bit of Spanish to understand something.",
          "Definitely worth a visit.",
          "You must visit. Amazing place.",
          "Interesting but over glorifies the revolution.",
          "Nice museum",
          "A little bit disappointed. Big part is only pictures and stories on the wall. Bonus: original Granma boat is there, but I'm sure it didn't look that well back when Fidel and his men traveled from Mexico.",
          "Important History, Worth a Visit",
          "Worth reading about the revolution beforehand as the museum doesn't really explain much context, and its poorly ordered",
          "We are not suppose to give a note",
          "I love history and the history inside. No matter what you believe about it, it is a great place to go and learn about Cuban history. The only bad thing is that if you're not proficient in Spanish, bring a guide or someone who is. I was okay, but many others didn't fare well. ",
          "It's historic",
          "Nice place to visit",
          "Great eye opening spot",
          "Have to go there just to say Viva La freakin Revolucion but as museums go it's not the best. The exhibits where done a while ago and don't seem to have been refurbed in a while. It is very cool if you don't know the facts but if you've done \u2026",
          "A place to see. History from other perspective.",
          "Thumbs up...  if you like to learn something about Cuban history and importance of revolution, this is a place that you must visit.",
          "Loads of interesting history in here. All of it given a 'take with a pinch of salt' government twist, portraying Castro, Che & Cienfuegos as totally god-like beings who have saved Cuba from the evil of Batista & the US and turned it into an economic powerhouse.\n\nThere's elements of truth in it, but it's a good story anyway.",
          "Nice museum in Havana. Little on sided story but that is how history is written.",
          "I simply love it. Beautiful building",
          "Very interesting place with lots of historical information",
          "Probably the most interesting museum in Havana. Set in Bautista's former palace, the museum documents the Revolution and the aftermath. More importantly, the museum is a window into how the Cuban government views the Revolution, as parts of \u2026",
          "Probably the best preserved/kept building/museum in Havana we saw (but it is still quite run down and under permanent renovation). Exhibits and story are interesting even as there are only a few things brought into the museum after the year \u2026",
          "It's a cool museum to learn more about Cuba even thought it would need a quite big refresh on how things are exposed because it can be a bit repetitive the way it's exposed",
          "Museum of the revolution just like it says.  Gives  the history of the Cuban revolution.  Contains artifacts, maps, uniforms and the yacht Granma that brought the revolutionaries back to Cuba.",
          "Really interesting exhibits in a beautiful building. Would definitely recommend to get a Cuban perspective on the Cold War. ",
          "The museum lies walking distance from Parque Central and close to another nice park. You will have to leave your handbag/backpack in a locker at the entrance. Check out the caricatures behind the wall at the entrance.",
          "Interesting but a bit boring",
          "a very special moseum, a lot of the history of the revolution, a must visit in la habana",
          "The entry is 8cuc, and that's not too bad.  There is a bag check that's mandatory.  The museum is mostly informational boards with photos and news stories.  There are not a lot of physical objects.  The bathrooms, like most of cuba, lack toilet seats or paper.",
          "This museum was absolutely wonderful.\nMany fascinating artefacts and personal items from Fidel , Che etc....and a real insight into the revolution. \nThe building itself is beautiful.\nPlease ignore many of the ridiculous negative comments \u2026",

          "Very detailed history, wish the were more interactive stuff",
          "The building is quite beautiful, but the museum itself is expensive (8 CUC for foreigners at the time of writing) garbage.\n\nThe exhibits are mainly printouts with photos and text. There are some random, uninteresting odds and ends \u2026",
          "The museum was definitely a highlight of my trip to Havana. The entry fee is 8 CUC for tourists, and well worth it. You start on the third floor, and each room tells the story of the revolution. It's definitely more thorough in Spanish, but \u2026",

          "Some good news about the History but a bit expensive for what it is.",
          "Long lines (arrive early) and despite advertising, guided tours aren't available in English. The whole museum is filled with seemingly random artifacts, and isn't tied together into any sensible timeline of the history of Cuba.\n\nLots of \u2026",

          "Very informative, reasonably priced, not air conditioned so don't go middle of the day.",

        "wiki": "The University of Havana or UH (in Spanish, Universidad de La Habana) is a university located in the Vedado district of Havana, the capital of the Republic of Cuba. Founded on January 5, 1728, the university is the oldest in Cuba, but not one of the first to be founded in the Americas (the National University of San Marcos in Lima was founded in 1551). Originally a religious institution, today the University of Havana has 15 faculties (colleges) at its Havana campus and distance learning centers throughout Cuba.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt was first called Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Ger\u00f3nimo de la Habana (in English Royal and Pontifical University of Saint Jerome of Havana). During those times, universities needed a royal or papal authorization in order to be created and thus the names Real y Pontificia. The two men who gave that authorization to the university were Pope Innocent XIII and King Philip V of Spain.\nIn 1842, the university changed its status to become a secular, royal and literary institution. Its name became Real y Literaria Universidad de La Habana (in English, Royal and Literary University of Havana) and later, when Cuba was a free republic, the name was changed to Universidad Nacional (in English, National University).\nThe university had first been established in San Juan de Letr\u00e1n (located in Villa de San Crist\u00f3bal in Old Havana) before it was transferred on May 1, 1902, to a hill in the Vedado area of Havana. The interiors of the building were decorated by Armando Menocal y Menocal. The seven frescos represent Medicine, Science, Art, Thought, Liberal Arts, Literature, and Law. At the main university entrance (shown above) there is a bronze statue of Alma Mater (meaning the \"Nourishing mother\" in Latin) that was created in 1919 by artist Mario Korbel. The model for the statue's face was lovely 16-year-old Feliciana \"Chana\" Villal\u00f3n, the daughter of Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Villal\u00f3n y S\u00e1nchez, a professor of analytical mathematics at the University. Chana later married Juan Manuel Menocal (a distant relative of Armando Menocal), who went on to become the Dean of the Business School. Juan Manuel Menocal was a professor at the law school when Fidel Castro was a student there in the 1940s. Maria Rosa Menocal, former Director of the Whitney Humanities Center at Yale, was the granddaughter of Chana and Juan Manuel Menocal. (See Alma Mater Witness of Time by Eduardo Heras Le\u00f3n).\nThe main library \"Rub\u00e9n Mart\u00ednez Villena\" was established later in 1936.\nAfter the government was taken over by Fulgencio Batista in 1952, the University became a center of anti-government protests. Batista closed the University in 1956.  From January 1, 1959, the date on which Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba, until January 1, 1962, the University went through a period of reformation to eliminate \"anti-revolutionary ideas\".\nIn 2002, Rutgers University\u2013Camden and the University of Havana signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to formalize research and exchange opportunities for students and faculty.\nThe MOU was re-signed in October 2016 with the addition of encompassing all of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe University of Havana is made up of 16 faculties (Spanish: facultades) and 14 research centers in a variety of fields, including economics, sciences, social science and humanities. In total, up to 25 specialties are taught at the university. Now, it has about 60,000 degree students in regular classes.There are 16 faculties into which the university is divided:\n\nNatural Sciences\nFaculty of Biology\nFaculty of Pharmacy and Foods\nFaculty of Physics\nFaculty of Geography\nFaculty of Mathematics and Computer Science\nFaculty of Psychology\nFaculty of Chemistry\nSocial Sciences and Humanities\nFaculty of Arts and Letters\nFaculty of Communication\nFaculty of Law\nFaculty of Philosophy and History\nFaculty of Foreign Languages\nEconomic Sciences\nFaculty of Accounting and Finance\nFaculty of Economics\nFaculty of Tourism\nDistance Education\n\n\n== Student organizations ==\nBefore the Cuban Revolution of 1959, students joined different organizations, aligning themselves directly or indirectly with some political party. The strongest of all these organisations was the FEU (Federaci\u00f3n Estudiant\u00edl Universitaria or University Students Federation) created by Julio Antonio Mella, a co-founder of the Cuban Communist Party in the 1920s. The European revolutionary tradition of college-based political activism that was practiced in Cuba and in many other Latin American countries and the alleged corruption of Cuban political parties at the time turned the FEU, a stronghold of communist ideology, into the most influential of Cuban political organizations before 1959. It was a major participant in the overthrowing of Cuban President Gerardo Machado.  The FEU initiated the national general strike of 1933, resulting in the imprisonment of many of its members.  Founder Julio Antonio Mella, himself had been killed at the hands of two assassins sent by Machado while exiled in Mexico in 1929\nAfter the coup d'\u00e9tat by Fulgencio Batista in 1952, when free and democratic elections were suspended, the violent clashes between university students and Cuban police reached its extremes. Students known to be members of the FEU were violently tortured and killed in the streets of Havana, and the organization reacted with an irregular war in the city, aiming mainly to assassinate police officers of high rank, like the chief of the police in Havana, Blanco Rico, who was killed by 4 FEU members. After the assault on the Moncada barracks  by Fidel Castro, an attorney who graduated from Havana University School of Law, and who had contacts in the FEU, the FEU became an ally of Castro's new July 26th Movement, though there were discrepancies between the leaders in the form that the forthcoming revolution should be carried out. While Fidel Castro was hiding in the Sierra Maestra mountains, the FEU, led by Jose Antonio Echeverria, attempted to kill Fulgencio Batista in an armed assault at the Cuban Presidential Palace on March 13, 1957. Batista managed to escape, and many student assailants died in the action, as did Echeverria himself.  During the months that followed, the police executed many of the students that led the failed coup. President Batista ordered the university to be closed, and it remained so until Batista fled the country and Fidel Castro entered Havana in January 1959.\nThe Castro administration re-opened the university in 1959.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBacardi Bowl\nEberto Escobedo Lazo\nEducation in Cuba\nList of universities in Cuba\nList of colonial universities in Latin America\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Cuba: Universidad de la Habana\".

          "I stop by the Plaza de la Revolucion during a quick trip from one end of Havana to the other. There is a parking place for cabs across from Plaza. There isn't much too see here besides to get a picture of both revolutionary heroes. Just watch out for traffic.",
          "This is a must see and if you can do it on foot do so. We walked from our hotel and spent an hour here. Only by standing in the middle of the square do you get the impression of the history and importance of this place to the state. Large monument to Jose Marti complemented by 2",
          "Truly, if you are in a cab, just ask him to slow down as it is not as impressive as one might think. It's like a giant parking lot without all of the pavement markings. We spent at the most, 5 minutes. That's how long our guide took to inform us of its history.",
          "A huge and historic plaza located in downtown Havana. Castro once addressed more than a million Cubans on the site. The steel murals of Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos are very impressive. Worth a visit for sure",
          "This square is cool to see, but that is where it begins and ends. Our taxi driver explained to us about the buildings and told us to go for a wander and if we needed him, he would be in the same place for the next 15 minutes. He\u2019s clearly done this before, once you\u2019ve seen it,",
          "The art is really cool. The two big murals of Castro and Che Guavara. Usually there's also a lot of classic cars here.",

          "Must see when in Havanna. This huge plaza de la revolution is a must see when you are here. I would take and old car tour (20-30CuC for one hour no more!) and this stop is also included",
          "We arrived at this historic Plaza in a convoy of colourful antique cars. The Plaza is huge and taking pride of place is a very tall monument which can be seen from afar. This Plaza is a must visit while in Havana to soak up some history.",
          "Absolutely amazing place to just take in. It is truly incredibly important as it was here that many of the first speeches and gatherings of the revolution took place. Not much to it, but still cool to check out!",

          "If you came to Cuba in order to learn more about their history, then revolution square is a good spot to visit. Although there really isn\u2019t anything we are able to do in the area as tourists, it is very neat to see the government buildings in monument that was erected there. Our",
          "We stopped off here whilst touring the city in a classic car. The plaza is huge and you can only image the number of people it would hold for the revolutionary rallies. Dominated by large Jose Marti monument and the impressive steel memorials of Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos",
          "This large open square has been the focus of many gatherings over the years since the Revolution. Featuring in many photographs and used today as much as ever. The large portrait of Che was very eye catching as is the large monument across the very wide road. (Too wise and busy",

          "This is just a big open square surrounded by important buildings. You have the monument of the revolution one one side and ministerial buildings not the other three sides. On the square there is no shade.",
          "What makes this zone the magnet for all tourists is the display of 50s and 60s convertibles and the showpiece examples of the much loved older autos for hire. The square undoubtedly is massive in its historic and symbolic importance i remember watching black and white tv",
          "Must do tourist stop for photo of Che Gavara wall picture and lots of American cars from the 1950\u2019s. We took ride there in 1956 Buick convertible. And a tour round Havana. For 4 adults it cost 50 Cucs for 90 min tour. Started at Central Park. You must haggle over the price",
          "This is a large plaza or gathering area in Havana. Several large buildings around. Lots of history. We had a tour guide through Belver (highly recommend) who taught us lots of things which was very helpful. Nothing was going on the day we were there but was still neat to see.",
          "I was surprised at how plain the square and main statue was. The faces on the buildings adjacent the square were interesting",
          "Our tour guide took us here and explained this are's history. As part of it, it is the gathering place that the masses gathered to hear Castro's 8 hour speech. Today they celebrate Labor Day here with free beer, music and fun.",
          "We were taken here by our tour guide and the history of the Square was explained to us. It is a big area , easy to walk around and view the huge monument to the revolution years ago that liberated the Cubans from the Spanish in the 1800s At the opposite side of the Square there",
          "An historical place to go. You can take nice pictures and imagine the past events that took place in La Plaza de la Revolucion.",
          "We did not get a chance to go inside but read about it when we got home. We were able to get some great pictures.",
          "There are no statues of Fidel. From what were told Fidel did not want any statues for himself because the revolution was about the people. If that's true that was very humble attitude. Go see this square by taxi ride.",
          "This was the place we\u2019re Castro had one of his famous speech . And from what I\u2019m told Che Guvaras famous photo is taken. This year it\u2019s 60 years since the revolution. Go by bike, by taxi or walk.",
          "We were there just as they were setting up for the May 1 parade. A great feeling of history and pride from the very friendly Cuban people",
          "Hugh plaza where so many events in Cuban history took place. As an American I truly did not fully appreciate the events that took place here. As with many Communist era architecture the point is to make the person seem small and in awe of their leaders.",
          "The history of the place is in evidence with the murals of figures from the past on buildings in the plaza It was much bigger area than I had envisaged with a main road through the middle Quite easy to imagine past rallies with hoards of people in the square listening to Fidel",
          "I enjoyed muy visit here. I took the bus and stayed on the bus taking photos... Lots to see and this was a really big place",
          "A great place to visit from the Hop On Hop Off bus. It is a massive open space in the centre of Havana and the 'murals' of the revolutionary leaders gives it an aura.",
          "To be here. Knowing what happened here and then being there as a tourist. I was pretty conflicted with admiring the architecture and knowing how speeches made here changed a nation. The architecture was nicely done. I much preferred the other places I visited.",
          "To be in the square that is named after the Cuban revolution of the 1950\u2019s underlines the changes that have been made in this great country of friendly, wonderful people. They live a hard life, cheerfully, there is a long way to go to provide the people with adequate food and",
          "And I was so happy to see it in person. The plaza was very empty that day, but it\u2019s still an impressive thing to see. I loved Havana.",
          "Experience the flavor of the city and its history...a historic sight. Lots of traffic.....be careful how you walk the street....people are very friendly....and enjoy the old cars...what an experience.",
          "We visited this square with our guide Ricardo and he was very informative about the history of this square. When you stand there and imagine what went on in this square it's hard to believe you're there at the same spot.",
          "We really wanted to go here but opted not to put it on the list because it's not close to anything and there's not much to do in the area. However in the classic car tour this is one of the stops which totally worked out. It's super cool to see these up close!",
          "I could never have imagined standing in the same spot that ushered in a new age of life in Cuba! The history of this place is just too much to fully understand.",
          "We drove through the plaza on a bus tour (best 10 cuc spent during the trip). Everything is on a grand scale.",
          "This is a very large square which is the center of government in Havana. This is also where Fidel would give his long speeches. We spent about 20 minutes here where our guide explained the history of the square. It is worth a brief visit.",
          "We came to the Square as part of our driving tour. It truly is just a huge huge parking lot and Fidel Castro as well as the pope have made speeches from the podium across the way .It\u2019s amazing that in the heat of the day that all of the Cuban people would stand for hours upon",

          "This is a relatively plain concrete square, except for the colossal relief of Che Guevara on the side of one of the buildings. I believe this is where huge public meetings were / are held. Worth a quick look if you're nearby.",
          "We stopped here on a formal tour and it was well worth it. The square is huge and it was easy to see why Fidel and even the Pope held audience here. The buildings have interesting etchings of Fidel and Castro. It made me want to read more of Cuba's history since all I remember",
          "Ok we are in a communist country, trying to help the trapped Cuban people by spending hard currency. Got it. It still is a little odd that the tour guide points out the giant figures of Castro and Che with pride being the third most recognizable in the world. Just like Mao in",
          "Well worth the visit lots of bars and restaurants to pop in to but when we asked for gin n tonic in a local bar the girl said we have none only Zion beer and dakery",
          "This area of Cuba is beyond historical. This is where Fidel Castro would talk for hours and the people would be enthralled. It's not that the area is much to look at but what it stands for.",
          "Its just a building, its nice to see from the roofless tour bus. And its opposite where i think Raul Castro lives.",
          "A must visit place, a very large square, in fact it's huge, this place is steeped in the history of the revolution, huge images on the building's of the revolution hero's. Lot's of old Cadillac & convertibles in the huge car park. It's a good walk around once your here, but just",

          "It\u2019s a big square and we were unfortunate that when we went they were refurbishing the lights and the big car park was empty usually full of old classic Cadillacs.",
          "Amazing to think about the history of this place, with Castro speaking to the masses in this square, I think it would be better to visit with a guide to explain what you are looking at",
          "Plaza de la Revolucion is a Good example how squares in communist countries may look like. Spacious squares surrounded by austere ministries in \u201cappartment blocks \u201c with big artefacts of the leaders ; here Fidel Castro and Che Guevarra . On this square Fidel held a 7,45 h long",
          "This is reported to be one of the largest plazas in the world. The most obvious sights are the outlines of Che (on the Ministry of the Interior) and Cienfuegos on the large buildings at the edge of the plaza. You won't see similar likenesses of Fidel. He did not want his image",
          "The place is nice and big enough to take a nice walk. You can see Che Guevara saying \u00a1Hasta la victoria, siempre! and Camilo Cienfuegos saying \u00a1Vas bien Fidelidad! Beside all of that you can see a statue dedicated to a famous Cuban poet. All in all it's a must see when in Cuba.",
          "This is the famous plaza where Castro made many speeches. Every communist country has a large square for such a thing and this is it (as far as ole Fidel was concerned). There isn't much to see other than a few buildings and the tallest structure in Cuba. This place is popular",
          "History is here with Che, Fidel and all the Cuba \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddfa Leaders to celebrate their strength in defeating the enemy of the state. It beautiful both at day & dusk and all Convertible drivers stop here.",

          "This was an interesting area and a good place to get some holiday photos. The buildings are grey and bland but the portraits of Che (and the other person - I forget the name) look very grand, and are illuminated at night. Apparently big music stars sometimes perform free",
          "Very impressive \"sculpture\" of Che and Jos\u00e9 Marti in this huge square. A \"must\" visit in Havana. Nice place to relax and take photos. Always lots of brightly coloured 1950's taxis around.",
          "This is a large paved area where most of Cuba's modern political history played out. The art and design of the buildings are practical and functional. Walk through the plaza and image the hours-long diatribes of Fidel and the throngs of people in attendance regardless of weather",
          "Plain old socialist architecture and city planing with slabs of concrete as the dominant element. 5 five minute tour with a tourist bus probably is enough.",

          "THe outlines of Che & Fidel on the buildings are worth seeing. THere are also hawks (or some relative of a hawk) flying around the tower. The Plaza is a large paved lot where the people would stand to listen to Fidel Castro speak. I am not impressed.",
          "The plaza is really a large parking lot with the Che and Fidel portraits. The view from the top of the Jose Marti memorial is worth the few CUCs it costs to go up.",
          "we visit the jose marti museum at the revolution square, great view of the city from the top and a lot of information about the cuban revolution",
          "At night the images of Castro and Chi are lit up and very attractive. Great way to remember the struggles of the Cuban revolutionaries to get where they are today. OK visit in the day as well but night is a wonderful exposure.",
          "This is where Castro delivered speeches of up to 5 hours. It\u2019s a bland concrete square and, other than, it\u2019s size, there\u2019s nothing to recommend it",
          "I can't believe that according to our guide thousands of people stood there for 4 to 5 hours listening to Fidel rant about the hated Yankees,putting that aside it's not that interesting ,buildings surround The square with steel images of Che and camilo but no fidel. The",
          "There is not a lot exactly to see in this area ... other than the buildings with their massive portraits of Che and Castro. On the other side is the Jose Marti (an iconic poet who Cubans say was the original revolutionary ... trying to free them from colonial oppression). Well",
          "After a long day of sightseeing, we ended up at the Plaza. Some of the things you\u2019ll notice instantly will be the two large buildings with the faces of Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, as well as a large open square. Besides seeing all the old classic cars, tour buses, hop on hop",

          "This is a very wide open space. A locations where cubans gathered to listen to the speeches given by president of the republic Fidel Castro years ago. There other buildings around with the pictures of Che, and Camilo. You can find classic cars near by, taxis, or the hop on hop",
          "This large square is flanked by bland government office buildings. There is a monument and concrete grandstand in the plaza where Fidel addressed the masses for eight hour at a time. There is not much of note to see. I was with a Havana University student, who escorted me up to",
          "Not much to see but huge metal outlines of main figures from the revolution. More intriguing was learning that Fidel once gave a 9 hour speech here.",
          "It really is like a big parking lot surrounded by different buildings. One of them shows the an image of Che Guevara with his famous \"hasta la victoria siempre\" and just opposite is the monument to Jose Marti. It's a quick stop but definitely an area of high importance for the",
          "Not much to see. Basically a very large parking lo t, with 3 large buildings around it. It has important historical significance but not worth it other than to say you went there.",
          "But it is stark, and without a great guide to explain the significance, we were left unaffected.....either do your research in advance or take a guide.",
          "We saw this area during a bike tour of Havana. Our guide was able to tell us about the history of the area, the significance of the statues and monuments, and the events that happen there. If you're going to Havana, this is a very important spot. You owe it to yourself to learn",
          "We were glad to see Plaza de la revolution. It is really such an important part of Cuba's more recent history. It is usually a 10 min stop on a tour but exactly as we expected.",
          "Our classic car tour parked a short walk from the square. The roads around the square were wide and the square itself was a huge concrete square ,with few if any amenities or statues within it. Just a people gathering area. All around it were offices of state with two offices",
          "Unless you decide to spend longer here, it can be a quick stop. The face art is really cool, but if you\u2019re in a time crunch, you can look, admire, & move on.",
          "This is an interesting area to visit while in Havana. You can picture Fidel holding court with thousands and thousand of people in the square.",

          "We book Royal Caribbean's \"Best of Havana\" bus tour, but really, almost all the Havana tours included the Plaza De La Revolucion. At first glance, it looks like an empty parking lot. BUT, listen to your Tour Guide, and look around; this is where the masses gather to be inspired",
          "This is Cuba's Red Square - a huge space for Cuban leaders to make grand speeches, it's very impressive particularly viewed from the Memorial Jose Marti overlooking the area. Plus who doesn't want to have their photo taken with the huge steel Che Guevara memorial on the side of",
          "one could state there is not much in this plaza, but there is actually huge history along with the classic soviet-inspired architecture. not to be missed",
          "Disappointed . Building is under renovation...very noisy. Entrance fee - US$8 equivalent which is expensive for Cuba.Mainly a collection of photos. If you already familiar with the History of the Revolution you will be disappointed. After visiting the Che memorial and the museum",
          "There is nothing to really see here. Most people stop here simply for the photos with steel memorials of Che Guevara, and Camilo Cienfuegos (no, it's not Castro). However, across the street is a tall tower where you can take an elevator to the top for views of the city.",

          "This is a must do stop cos of its historical significance but actually there is nothing there. No seats no refreshments no souvenirs and actually when we went very few people stood around. If you didn't know where you were you would just walk on. Probably sums up Havana. They",

          "There is interesting history in Revolutionary Square. Apparently Castro gave one of his longest speeches from this square (8 hours long). We parked and stayed in the shade rather than going right up to the monument, which was in the hot sun. That was close enough to see it",

          "It's interesting to visit but not much to see really unless you pay to walk up to the tower across the street (can't remember the name of it). It's worth visiting simply because so many famous speeches have been given her by Castro, the Pope and many other dignitaries.",

          "This monolithic atrocity is a headstone marker to communism and fascism, built by Castro to suppress this beautiful population. It is really a shamelessly ugly cement building. You will see it, as it is required as part of any tour that you\u2019ll go on. It will be a 30 second stop",

          "We visited Revolution Square on our second trip to Cuba and it was less about Castro and more about the original founder of Cuba, which surprised me. Its somewhat surreal to see after having watched the history of Castro's speeches here. Wide open and peaceful, a definite must",
          "I didn't really like this area. I wanted to check it out but the monuments to these people and the entire revolution and political talks held here was kinda eerie. I think you need to go there but don't spend a lot of time. It is good to see and take some photos but that is",
          "Our tour bus guide was very proud of this plaza. When it's not being used for political rallies it's basically just a large parking lot like you would see at any large shopping mall in the US. That's a picture of Chi Guevara on the building wall. When we were there about 20",

Winston Churchill said \u201cNever have some few done so much for so many\u201d and I can\u2019t help feel that that applies here, too....but not in a good way. For all intents & purposes, Cuba is still on its knees. To me,",

          "We visited this Plaza while on a private tour of old and new Havana. I love the portraits of the revolutionaries on the side of the buildings. It was great to walk the streets of changemakers, and hear their stories. A must visit if you're going to havana, or doing a tour of",
          "So, is it worth taking a trip here just to see it, not so much. That being said any tour will take you here, and if you take a tour in one of the antique cars they will stop here so you can get out and take some pictures. So, it make a good picture.",
          "This is the plaza where you will see buildings with faces on them, and the classic cars. It feels like a real touristy location, which it is...but you have to go there. If you have time, ask one of the car collectors to open up their hoods. You will see that most cars don't have",

          "It was a very quiet square when we visited as part of our tour but you can still feel the history and imagine what it can be like here when the Cuban people gather to celebrate their freedom. The square is surrounded by government buildings on three sides including one with a",
          "Although not much to see really this place does give you a sense of what it must have been like during the revolution.",
          "This Plaza is huge, as are the monuments and installations, when we went you couldn't really get up close, and although our guide told us a little, it felt like there was more to it which was not passed on or readily available. Definitely worth going to visit but there are",
          "It is an impressive site for its history, very crowded the areas are very clean and it is very safe there is not much to see",
          "This is a giant square of tarmac on which sits the huge star shaped tower which is a monument to Cuba and its enduring battle for freedom. There are giant pictures of Che and another revolutionary and a very small (in comparison) tribute to Fidel - by all accounts he asked not",
          "I enjoyed my visit to revolutionary square. There is a picture of Ch\u00e9 Guevara & A guy who looks like the famous Osama. It was sort of a joke with our tour guide.The man is actually a co-revolutionary with Castro, named SinFuegos Who was killed in a plane crash before the Cuban",
          "Did a whistle stop tour on route to Old Havana. It was filled with many tourists in classic cars who were keen to take in a part of this historic monument, take pictures and basque in the glorious heat.",
          "The plaza is a huge open area used for political gatherings. All of the classic car tours stop here . Great photo ops.",
          "Found this trip a bit weird in that it celebrates the revolutionary 4 ,impressive buildings with their pictures on the front of them , take a moment to take it all in as it is impressive , a huge area of outstanding cleanliness and no litter",
          "This is a must see location, but what you see in pictures is exactly what you get. Nothing going on here, not even on revolution day. There was no reason to walk around, we just stayed on the air-conditioned bus.",
          "You will get to see this once you take a classic car tour. It is worth seeing this but overall there is nothing much around it to see",
          "I love history but this is kinda boring. How Castro has these poor people stand out in brutal sun for hours on end to listen to his speeches (without any tree or coverage) is beyond me. Good to stop, take a few photos, sit in classic car (bunch here) and leave.",
          "To be shy and take the iconic picture here. You didn't came to Cuba if you don't get here. Sometimes theres people around that can tell you about the revolution and why those characters are so important to Cuba.",
          "Huge square where Fidel Castro used to have his great speeches in front of the full crowd. This is extremely wide square that can fit in lots of people. During our visit in the afternoon it was empty. Jose Marti Memorial, Che Guevara Mural and a line of Old Colorful Automobiles.",
          "considering it was a national holiday, Revolution Day, the plaza was empty. no parades,no patriotic events.",
          "We saw Plaza de la Revolucion as part of an organized tour and then returned on our own to explore it more ourselves. So cool to see the history of this city in person!",
          "This is of course a significant place in Revolution-era Cuba, with speeches from the tower by the great leaders, and now (from what I've read but not visit) there is an interesting museum with view(s). You cannot miss the iconic portrait of Che on the ministry building. And",
          "Only so, so. I think its on the governments \u201cmust see list\u201d It\u2019s a parking lot surrounded by government buildings. There are no bathrooms and there is no shade.",
          "Feel it! Emblematic spot where you can feel \u201cChe\u201d. Loved it... it was one of the places always dreamed about!",
          "The guide's carefully told story of Che Guevara and my memory of the public story and of this time did not sync. Also fuzzy understanding of what ministry is housed in that building",
          "A must visit location to take a few photos, old cars park along the square which you can go take some picture as well",
          "While doing research, I saw these images. However, to view them on my own and get pictures was a rewarding experience. I got off the Hop On, Hop Off bus and spent about 30 minutes just walking around.",
          "The Plaza de la Revolucion is huge. One can imagine the huge rallies that took place here. It's overlooked by images of Che Guevara and Cienfuegos.",
          "Very strict security so unless organised tour, if you hire a car you can't get out and stroll. Great meeting place for Cubans for all sorts of reasons - but again organised settings.",
          "Another historical monument, it\u2019s a must to visit Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n! Funny historie we were on our way to the airport (our vacation was ended\ud83d\ude2d) and it was sunny when we got there but as soon we got out of the car it started pouring, we where there so we didn\u2019t care and",
          "Typical place for applauding the revolucion, huge empty space - go by car not on root as it Is a desert under the hot cuban sun",
          "when we came 10 years ago, we could only see che on the wall. Now also Fidel is showing on the wall.",
          "A must visit place in Havana, Cuba. Give 15-20 minutes at least to look around. Leave the history behind and move forward.",
          "A must to see in la Havana. It is a magnificient monument next to official buildings and in a big avenue. The statue is Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, a national hero and Cuban writer",
          "Historically significant and worth a visit. There are a bunch of ministries, the national theatre, he national library, and near the national baseball stadium.",
          "Amazing square with incredible monuments, Worth a visit to feel the history....great photos too...If visiting Havana this is a must do visit.",
          "Very important part of Cuban history and political history. This is where Castro delivered many of his speeches. Glad to have visited. There is surely something about this place that is an attraction and commands attention.",
          "I was lucky enough to see the Plaza as they were preparing for this years May Day Celebrations, and the square itself is large and open, surrounded by a multi-lane highway. The Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed tower is incredible, cheap and offers incredible views of the city, and from the square is",
          "Knowing some Cuban history this was an amazing place. You could envision Castro trying to motivate people contrasting with the Pope inspiring. The 3 heros of the country represented in a quiet space gives u chill.",
          "This is a must if you're visiting Havana, its just a great place to soak in the atmosphere, it's such an iconic location and really worth a visit.",
          "It\u2019s very hard to imagine this place jammed packed with people listening to Fidel Castro when you\u2019re stood here yourself. The place is very important to Cubans and Cuba\u2019s history, a must visit for all",
          "You cannot go to Havana and not have a photo of this place. Part of the vintage car tours, and the lined up old cars are just as spectacular.",
          "Many classical taxis park here and you are given an opportunity to walk around and take pictures of Camilo Cienfuegos, Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, and even climb to the plaza where Fidel gave his 5+ hour long speeches (costs 1CUC to enter). Not much else otherwise...",
          "In my my mind you can't go to Cuba and not get a picture in front of the iconic image of Che Guevera at Plaza de la Revolucion. There isn't much in this area but you will be able to get some great shots and it will take you only a few minutes to do so. There are also classic",
          "Revolutionary Square has such history. The surrounding hotels have the face art of their country's leaders.",
          "This is the ironic epicenter of both the heros of the revolution, going back to Jose Marti and of course Fidel and also the gathering place of vintage Buicks and Chevys from the 50's with fresh paint and shiny grills.",
          "A large parking lot or public square with a couple of interesting looking buildings on the periphery. It's nice to see art works depicting Cubas revolutionaries, but aside from that and the cars that drive around the square, there's not much else to see here. Probably worth a",
          "On this place a lot of old cars gather and let tourists take pictures, they also give you a ride around the square for reasonable price.",
          "Massive space surrounded by various building all depicting Cuban well none figures. This is a photo opportunity for the car spotter.",
          "Good photos ops of sculptures and monuments. A lot of classic cars come here. Expect to pay about 30 CUC per hour",
          "The multi-story image of Batista seems to be the most interesting aspect of the square, and it is striking. The second most interesting thing is the nearby parking lot where several 1950's era cars for hire park. You can negotiate for a ride in one of the cars or just walk among",
          "We stopped there in a big parking lot. Apparently a lot goes on in the evening. The only thing we saw there were a lot of old cars",
          "Took a classic car taxi out to the Plaza de la Revolucion (Revolution Square). It was a lot bigger than I had imagined and more impressive. Glad we took a cab as I don\u2019t think we would have walked it in the heat.",
          "This place is neat, but truthfully it\u2019s mostly just a large parking lot and not really a lot to see. You can get some cool photos, but I wouldn\u2019t plan to spend a lot of time here.",
          "Very interesting history of the plaza. We stopped here on a bus tour during our excursion. The antique cars were awesome and tourists could take photos with them or get taxi rides.",
          "Stunning, the sky is beautiful at this location. Very clean and picturesque. Cuba is lind\u00edsima. A must see, the tour buses takes you past Plaza de Revelucion. The iron work on the buildings are amazing. Culture rich despite all that the country has weathered.",
          "A vast square, that is normally quiet empty from tourists, only due to its size. 2 large impressive buildings on one side adorned with the giant faces of Che Guevara & Camilo Cienfuegos on the other side the very large monument of Jose Marti. on one end of the square you will",
          "This is right in front of the plaza de la revolucion, pretty interesting to see and makes you wonder about the days of the revolution.",
          "You can see the largest building (monument) in Havana and also get to see some of the government, military and FBI buildings as well.",
          "Not to miss. You stand in the parking lot (a prior protest location) and take photos. Impressive place.",
          "One of the mandatory stops when enjoy this beautiful city, by classic car, stop for a photo and listen to the stories of the local drivers of the classic cars.",
          "It was quite rich in history, and knowledge!! I was consumed with stories of the country's past and their uncertain future. One thing for sure is if you love to learn there is never a dull moment!",
          "You can see many monuments and government offices from this one large open area. It's a popular stop for many of the tours, so if you like to look at many older US autos, you can see them here.Ask your tour guide to explain the history that the plaza was built for. It's very",
          "We visited the Plaza de la Revolucion three times. One in the morning. One in the afternoon. One in the evening. Enjoy all as experience was different due to sun direction and lightning. Try to go very early before the arrival of tourist coaches.",
          "Plaza de la Revolucion is essentially a deserted square. You can see artistic images of Che and Fidel Castro on a couple of government buildings. You'll also find a dozen or so vintage cars parked near the square that you can sit in and photograph and probably rent as a taxi.",
          "I could just imagine the history locked up in those cobble stones, and probably still to come. My favourite was the three images on the buildings.",
          "Beautiful and everything clean a big plaza, a lot of tourist busses,doble deckers and taxies. Awesome experience.",
          "Its not far from the center but ofcourse a must see! That a Cocotaxi or a convertible oldtimer for the ultimate experience!",
          "A photo cannot really do this justice. The artwork on the building is HUGE. Interesting photo opportunity. The tour guides gave us the historical information about the building.",
          "Generally it is best not to talk about politics in Cuba but the open top bus tour is well worth the \u20ac10 or so. The tour includes revolution Square and is really good value for money",
          "We were told that the Pope addressed some 50,000 people here so you can imagine the size of this plaza. Today it seems the classic car club hangs out here to sell rides. Worth seeing at any rate.",
          "A very large open square were revolution started some great views for photos only our driver to tell you things but we'll worth a visit",
          "Not the loveliest site of Havana but a cult place. On the huge Plaza hundred thousand Cubans used to gather to listen to the famous lengthy speeches of their Lider Maximo. Pieces of history.",
          "Beautiful place and veiw. History, paintings,souvenirs. Clean and you will enjoy sitting outside the museum having a beer.",
          "You cannot fail to be interested in Cuba\u2019s recent history. Whether you agree with communism or not. Castro is one of the great orators and this is the place to see to get a feel for the revolution. It prepares you for everything that followed it.",
          "Just to be here is something special. The wire faces were pretty impressive, as these two men must have been to be recognizable with a wire outline, great art in that respect.",
          "This is a stop on most tour routes I recommend for historic background on events that took place. It is also a great opportunity to admire the many classic cars in the parking lot.",
          "With the metallic portrait of the Che and Camilo, across from a major monument to Jose Marti, this Plaza is a must visit in Havana. For those who know the history, and/or who have visited the Museum of the Revolution, this large space that Fidel would fill for his several",
          "This huge plaza is popular for tourists to take a pic while being driven around in vintage cars. There are 3 prominent landmarks here - the huge tower dedicated to Jose Marti and two buildings with murals of Che and Camilo Cienfuegos",
          "So.... It\u2019s big square. Good photo on the right. Good photo on the left. Iconic. Done. Return to the city. When you\u2019re there, hope it\u2019s sunny. Hope its burning hot. Stand of the middle of the square. Think of all the people that used to congregate to listen to Fidel\u2019s",
          "We came with a tour group and learned a great deal about the history of Cuba and it's people. The site of the monuments in the plaza is a sight to remember.",
          "This is a great picture spot, but I honestly found the statue across the street much more interesting! Either way, great spot to take pictures with these walls or with the giant statue across the street.",
          "Really could experience this driving right by. Bonus was seeing a lot of the beautiful 50s taxis parked in the lot next to the square",
          "We visited this plaza while on a tour and did not find it to be that interesting. The most popular attraction at the plaza was the line of old cars on display. Everyone flocked to those, had their pictures taken in the cars, and just admired the beauty. We wouldn\u2019t make this",
          "But not a lot to do. It\u2019s a big square with a few buildings. There is a place to be able to get out and take pictures.",
          "A great photo opportunity. Nice place to walk take photos of the old cars going by and surrounding buildings.",
          "It looks like a huge parking lot - and that's exactly what it is. But this is the site of many of Sr Castro's speeches and is the home of a monument dedicated to Jose Marti.",
          "This square is important to those who can understand its significance. Significant events for Cuba and the Cuban people took place in this square. For us, it is a privilege to be here and to feel a part of the atmosphere when Fidel Castro maintained the significance speech after",
          "So of course we visited iconic Revolution Square. How could you go to Havana and not come here? Not the most picturesque area, though. Far from the old town - we took a cab. The plaza is huge and empty and you cannot climb the monument across the street. There are no shops",
          "Skipping this is like skipping the Eiffel Tower in Paris. We got stuck with a RAINY day here, but it was warm so we just got soaked (oh well). You can view the square for free, and the big monument is impressive. If you want to spend a few CUCs it's worth paying to enter the",
          "We were brought here on a tour of Havana and it was very eye opening listening to the tour guide explain the history of the square and what it symbolised.",
          "Revolution square is where many of Fidel\u2019s political rallies and meetings were held. It includes a memorial for Jose Marti ( freedom fighter, and so called father of the Cuban nation) and is surrounded by many buildings which houses government ministries - 2 of which have",
          "This is good for a quick stop. Lots of history here and kind of a must-see for Havana. A ton of old cars gather in the parking lot at all times as well.",
          "A must see spot, to see where Fidel stood and did most of his speeches. Our driver took us here, and most of the old cars are parked here as well. It's like going to a car show. A blast from the past.",
          "We stayed in a Casa not too far from Plaza la Revolucion which was so central, convenient for the various sightseeing in the local vicinity and further afield. We walked for miles one day to old, modern and central Havana completely got lost once we seen Che's face we got our",
          "This is a must place to visit when you go to Cuba. You can go up the tower and have a nice view of Havana.",
          "I went here during the old car review. Nice place. The driver stops here during the tour and explains what the type of work the do a the buildings around.",
          "Our private car took us here to show us the square and give us the history which was interesting. The absolute highlight is that all the old cars and their drivers come here all day so it\u2019s like a car show. A great place to walk around and take pics. The owners are so proud of",
          "We dropped by Revolution Square on our Cuba tour... old 50\u2019s style government buildings and oodles of old cars plus the ever present tour buses that have become part of the tourist scene... not all that impressed as a drive by is adequate.",
          "My two sons and I visited this local location and were impressed by the history voiced by our guide Ariel. He was very knowledgeable and effective in his presentation.",
          "We were lucky enough to be in Havana on 1 May this year and we decided to join in the May Day Parade - what an awesome, unforgettable experience! We started our journey down Avenida Paseo at 4:30am where crowds were celebrating throughout the night and were now scattered along",
          "If you are on a trip it will probably be one of your stops. It is an open area for thousands to congregate. Our guide told us this is where the Havanan's gather when there is a speech. The parking lot resembled a Chevrolet convention. The other side of the plaza is Jose",
          "This is one of the \"must see\" sights in Havana. One can almost imagine thousands of Cuban citizens filling the plaza poised to catch every word of one of Fidel's inspirational speeches. Images of Fidel and Che' adorn the adjacent buildings and the monument to Jose' Marti looms",
          "As part of a tour, this is a must see stop. Big open area with a monument and the the wall sculpture of Che. It is also a good place to see many of the classic cars all in a row as pretty much all tours stop here.",
          "Tour was 3.5 hours. Saw old and new Havana. Visited the old fort, the cemetery, Revolution Square. Saw the old cars from the 40s and 50s.",
          "While quiet during our visit, the square has history and a few significant views. Art is imposing. We visited mid day weekday.",
          "One of our favorites stops in Havana. The museum was full of interesting exhibits, pictures and documents from the Revolution of Cuba. The building itself, is piece of importance to that period of history. Also enjoyed the exhibits outside which included Russian tanks,",
          "This huge square is pretty ugly by all urbanistic and architectonic standards, but you visit it for historic and symbolic reasons. Two enormous wall metal portraits on two governmental buildings, respectively of Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos, look down at you from",
          "Looking like a very large parking lot for tour buses, the plaza is the place where Fidel Castro made his famous 6 hour speach to \"his people\" after taking over the government. Today the plaza is filled with tourists and historic vehicles as well as tour buses. It's interesing",
          "On our tour 'Old Havana City Sightseeing' one of our many stops was at this site. Our tour guide, Nilda, called this site by it's correct name but also said it is referred to Revolution Square. She was very informative re the history...including that this was the site of many of",
          "Tourist guide explained that this is where everyone had to gather for Fidel Castro's updates and talks to the nation. Che Guevara's face and symbols are all through the city, and others of his camaradas as seen in the buildings surrounding the plaza",
          "The square itself is a big concrete area surrounded by traffic. The Jose Marti monument (reviewed separately) and the graphic of Che Guevara on the side of one of the buildings, not much to it! National Theatre is also nearby.",
          "This is an important part of Cuban History which shouldn\u2019t be missed the statue and the actual building are very impressive. The tour which takes you to the top of the building gives you the opportunity to take panoramic photos of Havana. The Museum is very good , the",
          "We stopped here on the Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour. Huge square, of significance to the Cuban Revolution. Images of Che Guevera and Fidel Castro on the buildings.",
          "If you made to La Habana, go ahead and take a picture with Che on the background, even if you hate communists and genocides like Che, go ahead and take that picture and send it to all your friends and let the controversy begin.",
          "Great to see the monument and buildings with the faces of the 2 generals. It\u2019s a great place to take picture with all the old cars in the background.",
          "This is a large square in the city surrounded by government buildings and a memorial. Apparently political rallies have been held here for many years. The Jose Marti (revolutionary writer) memorial is an extremely tall tower made with granite. There's only something on the main",
          "Close your eyes for a moment when you are at the plaza with a big statue of Jose Marti and also the big murals of Che and Fidel across the big road. It gives a feeling that you were present among many individuals when the leaders of Cuba were speaking to them for many hours. Did",
          "Definitely something I have want it to see for a long time and I finally did and what I must enjoyed was the view from the top for sure just stunning. There is a lot of Jose Marti history inside of it too.",
          "An icon of Cuba, the Plaza of the Revolution and its huge images of Guevara and Cienfuegos is something only a fool would pass up.",
          "Really does remind of the old Soviet Union. Imposing buildings around the square with images of revolutionaries on the buildings. Must be impressive when there is a political rally.",
          "A must if you go to Havana is to visit Revolution Square and see the wall-portraits. It's a stop on the open-top bus so easy to get to. Besides the huge square, there is also the tower monument that has a lift inside and only costs 3 CUCs to get to the top for amazing panoramic",
          "This was our second stop in our tour of old Havana, we spent 15 mins in the parking lot checking out the old cars and listening to our tour guide tell about the history of the area and the two buildings with the iron work on the sides of the building. Very interesting part of",
          "It\u2019s a really big parking lot. It\u2019s fun to see the buildings and tons of classic cars. It\u2019s a good stop for about 15 min. Good photo op.",
          "We visited the plaza as part of the hip on how off bus tour. Lots of old cars driving by so can get great pictures with the memorials. Only need about 30minutes to walk around it all. Taxis around so easy to get transport from there.",
          "It is basically a large parking lot with pictures on the side of the building. It is nice to see in a drive-by but not somewhere you want to park and hang out.",
          "one of my biggest disappointment in cuba. The place looks like a parking lot and they don't really care. I'm know the history of the place and for that is why I was expecting more. I went to tiananmen square (beijing) and THAT was a square (clean and majestic). You have to go if",
          "No matter what your view of Cuban politics is, this is the center of them. It is interesting to know that this area is often the heart of everything in Cuba. Having a tour guide even enriches the experience. You also will see many of the old style cars lined up where you can",
          "This place is like a giant parking lot, not really close to anything. It seems to be a mandatory stop on most Havana tours. Other than it appearing like a parking lot surrounded by a few government buildings with sculptures of key Revolutionary people, there is not much here.",
          "It is the sheer size that impresses. When empty you have to imagine Fidel under the tower making one of his marathon speeches to appreciate what this place means to Cubans.",
          "I took my parents here who are a fan of Che Guevara and they had the best time. My children and myself also enjoyed the museum, the history. It was a great experience",
          "This square is a huge parking lot looking across to the massive monument where Fidel Castro would speak to the people. It was interesting the day we were there as the military were conducting parade drills preparing for Presidents Day on May 1st. There were hundreds of soldiers",
          "Did this as part of day tour in a open top car. Huge plaza with giant images of Fidel Castro, Che and Jose Marti on the surrounding buildings.",
          "The be there as the power of the Castro family is about to pass to a new generation of leaders, it is great to see wheere the rallys and gathering of the early years after the revolution took place under the leadership of Fidel Castro.",
          "Huge plaza with monuments as some iconic buildings. Two of this buildings have the images of the revolutionary heroes as well as the main government building.",
          "Cuba has one nationally recognized hero: Jose Marti. Here you'll find a monument and museum dedicated to him. In addition, you'll find the pics of well-known revolutionaries Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos. Must see.",
          "To stand in the square and look around and imagine what it was like was amazing. It is not much more than a car park now where tourists pull up in coaches and chevrolets park for people to take photos, however there is an aura about the square and it makes a great photo and",
          "It's a big asphalt parking lot with tour buses and old cars. Clearly the guides want you to see and walk on the parking lot. Not sure it is really an attraction. I didn't get much out of the visit to this place - a drive by would have been fine. Best part of the stop at",
          "The h\u00e9ros of the revolution are on display and watch over the plaza. Visit to understand the history of Cuba",
          "It is essentially a massive square surrounded by buildings from the Revolution period but you have to go to get the iconic picture of Che Guavara on the building. Visit doesn\u2019t take long or cost anything just to be there.",
          "Big, hot and a lot of cars. Cool monuments and statues. Taking the tourist bus there and driving by was good enough for us.",
          "A big dusty space with little shade, it\u2019s important to the Cuban people, but has limited appeal to visitors.",
          "One of the must do and see in Havana. Pretty large space, and walkable from both Vedado and old Havana.",
          "Frankly, it's not much to look at but then I am an American so one must consider my perspective. It is basically a very large open space. But, when you consider that Fidel used to give four hour plus speeches here to over a million people, and the monument to Jose Marti, and",
          "The plaza has so much history. The rulers of the place spoke to an audience of million people. You can see the issues people faced",
          "It\u2019s not hard to imagine Fidel standing here addressing his people. Apparently he once spoke for 6 hours and many collapsed. It can get crowded but it is big so it\u2019s easy to get a photo.",
          "Cool spot to take a quick photo. We rode here on our classic car tour around the city. This seemed to be a spot mostly for tourists.",
          "A place in history not to be forgotten where Fidel Castro addressed millions. The importance of Che to the revolution and the countries greats",
          "We went there during the Classic Car tour! You can take the picture of the image of Che and Camilo there.",
          "A must see just for the buildings portraying the likeness of Che and Camilo Cienfuegos as well as its history. It is more interesting if you go with a guide as they can explain all of the events that too place in the square.",
          "It was all wonderful. Not one disappointment. See it before it changes. A step back in time. Food wonderful, sights amazing and music outstanding.",
          "I recommend to take a tour in the American cars that can drive you to all the touristic places in havana, while you are watching they are explaining everything, this plaza was used to politics speeches and concerts and events Christmas celebration. Amazed by the plaza!",
          "Interesting to see, but other than its historical meaning there is not much there. We took one of the many classic cars to this location, there are many places to park. If you are in Cuba as a tourist you should see this, but there is so much else that is as worth while to see",
          "Cubans are a resilient people and the Plaza de la Revolucion is a continuous reminder of the past. The plaza can be assessed via the hop on hop off bus tour and is a sight to behold.",
          "This plaza is situated at one of the important crossroad in Havana. The place was used in the past by cuban leaders to talk to the nation but it is a little bit devoid of charm. There are bus and hopon-hopoff stops plus a big parking for taxis. Imposing public buildings with",
          "This is really jus a large parking lot used for political speeches and rally\u2019s. There is not really anything to see, but other tourists standing around looking at a parking lot. With so much to see in Cuba this is just not worth the time.",
          "Building sits side by side to a sister office building and all are within walking distance to each other.",
          "A must visit place. Huge space reflecting the recent history of Cuba & fab to see all the old American cars!",

          "It was my dream to visit the Plaza de la Revolution and stand where all the great revolution-er freedom fighters use to gather LOVE U CHE",
          "Very nice square which is large and one building has a sketch of Che - you see him everywhere in Cuba",
          "Once you know and understand the history of Cuba, this is a must go to spot. Beware it's very hot during the day as there is no shade.",
          "The square holds so much history as being where many political rallies took place and Fidel Castro and other political figures addressed Cubans. To stand where Pope John Paul II Pope and Pope Francis held large Masses there during papal visits to Cuba just felt so surreal.",
          "The square is notable as being where many political rallies took place and Fidel Castro and other political figures addressed Cubans. Fidel Castro addressed more than a million Cubans on many important occasions, such as 1 May and 26 July each year. Pope John Paul II, during his",
          "You must come and visit this square to see the murals of Che and Camillo as well as see the Jose Marti tower. We took the hop on hop off bus to get here.",
          "This place is not for staying too long if you come as a tour. The new parliament is not something that you would stop to view. It is just like a multi-storey building. The plaza itself is quite big and spacious and the view to the monument is good. It is good for a group",
          "The plaza isn't particularly pretty, its pretty much like a huge car park but it's famous for its huge memorials of Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos and you've really got to see them! The plaza is where you can also view the Jose Marti memorial, a tall tower which I also",
          "The Plaza is worth seeing in your Havana tour. The design structures are very cool. There are two buildings beside each other with iron portraits of the revolutionary leaders. The third structure is a monument dedicated to the nation's independence from Spain. The Plaza is very",

          "You may not agree with the Cuban Revolution and all that went with it in the 50s. But whatever has happened the Cuban people are very proud of their history and this is shown in the forefront of their pride. They are very committed to country and one cannot help but admire how",
          "I am not sure why Americans are so scared of socialism, It has so many great attributes... This place reminds me of Cold war era type constructions from what you will see in Eastern Europe. Very cool. Cuba is a beautiful Country and so are the people.",
          "I wish I had more time to explore this infamous plaza where Fidel used to give speeches for hours at a time. I was fascinated by the paradox of brightly colored old cars and drab concrete ministry buildings with the imposing and impressive memorial dedicated to Jose Marti",
          "Was great to learn about the Cuban hero\u2019s Che Guevara he came to help Fidel Castro with the revolution .",
          "It is what it is. Government buildings idealizing the revolution. If you like Che Guevera and Fidel Castro, look no further, this will be utopia. Read your history books and form your own views.",
          "This is a large parking lot that was like a car show lol The taxis are all the old cars from the 50\u2019s. You can go for a ride around the block or city. You had the buildings around you with the art work on the sides and statues and then all the cars. Such an experience.",

          "Interesting to visit, if only for a few minutes, to take in the ambience of where so many gathered to listen to speeches and celebrate their Revoluci\u00f3n. But, in reality, the bulk of it is a large parking lot surrounded by a couple buildings with large metal reliefs and a",

          "One of the 2 things I had to do in Havana, take a pic with these giant murales? On the sides of the buildings! Its literally just a pavement lot to stop at, wouldnt take more then about 15 mins to snap a few photos!!",
          "We visited the square as part of the hop on hop off bus tour and also our vintage car trip. Frankly it is just a huge open space with various government buildings and monuments where everyone goes for a photo. Not a great spectacle but an important part of Cuban history.",
          "Cubans are humble and welcoming people. This reflects even in their most \u201cprotected\u201d buildings. You can walk around, take pics, go inside visit. Show your cuc and walk in for a tour. You must go up the national revolucion museum to get a very nice 360 view of havana.",

          "A stop off as part of my classic car tour. Seeing the big iron image of Che I\u2019ve seen so many times in photos was quite moving. I can imagine the rallies in this huge space. A plethora of colourful classic cars wait for their passengers. My tour guide was very knowledgeable but",

          "I know this is a very important location in Cuban history but it's impossible to feel anything!! It's a huge white square and a missed opportunity for us tourists to read a little more about Cuba. The best bit is the lines of convertible 1950's cars = we went in our own",
          "Quick stop for a photo or two, nothing special, just another tourist pit stop. Take a classic convertible for best views.",

          "There isn't really that much to see apart from the two buildings with Che and Fidel but it's worth a look. We went by classic car and it was a fun trip.",
          "My husband summarized our trip to Cuba as \"Beautifully Tragic\". There is beauty but then the reminder of history and how bad you feel for the people of Cuba. Our tour guide was a sweet, young man who was separated from his family living in Miami.",
          "The Plaza de la Revolucion is amazing. located in a wide expanse, it truly is a great place to visit.",
          "We visited here as part of our tour of Havana in the old cars. Interesting for the big figures on the side of the buildings, one being Che and the other a revolutionary leader whose name escapes me. There is also the revolutionary tower that you can ascend, we were going to",
          "Ok the trick here is to take a tour bus. It cost 10cuc per person and takes you around the main sites in havana. Also you can get a better photo from tbe top deck of the bus.",
          "Famous for the imposing sculpture of the revolutionary Che Guevarra. It is on the tourist trail and i guess every tour to Cuba goes here.",

          "I only took a picture of the wall with che guevaras face on it, other than that there is nothing to see here. If you have limited time in Havana skip this.",
          "We visited on foot and then as part of our tour in a classic car. The square is huge and has the famous Jose Marti Memorial. It is a fair walk out of Old Havana but is an absolute must visit.",

          "World famous for the many events that have taken place here, it is a wonderful place to see the old American cars that still run in Havana. Sometimes crowded with tourist buses. Don't miss the monument to Jose Marti that is the main focal point.",
          "This is where Fidel used to make speeches and there most national parades take place, all 1950's American cars coverge here on weekends its not so busy, tourists frequent it for selfies and pictures. not much of a buzz",
          "This area is quite stunning with massive depictions of Che, Jose and Fidel surrounding you. The monument to Jose Martin is unique in design and quite stunning up close. You get the distinct sense that Cubans are very patriotic and respectful of their heroes and history. It's",
          "This is more than a square that looks likes an empty parking lot! When I think about the thousands of people who stood in that square for hours listening to Fidel speak I get chills. This is a pretty iconic location and a stop by every people to people tour. You can usually",
          "This plaza was the site where Fidel Castro made most of his speeches, some as long as 12 hours. In the square one see Che Guevera imprint on one of the buildings where he once worked. Dozens of classic cars, mostly convertibles, can be had for touring with a driver and guide.",
          "Large cement area with picture of Che on a building. Old American cars are used as taxis. Cars are very well kept and are a hugh attraction.",

          "Such an important historical location cannot be missed if visiting Havana. Having a guide with us was also so helpful in putting the history into perspective.",
          "It is very interesting and quite a large plaza. There is not a statue of Castro. Which I found interesting. The people had to stand in the plaza in the heat for the entire length of his speaches. It was noted if you were not in attendance.",
          "Apparently Castro used to address the Cuban people with speeches lasting hours the architecture and monuments are stunning and you can feel the atmosphere in an empty square so this must have been a site to behold when it was packed to capacity, there are also some of the finest",
          "The Jose Marti monument is the focal point of the square and you can climb it to have an outstanding view of the area. There are also 2 large images of Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos on nearby buildings decorating the square and these light up at night. To get a real sense",
          "The plaza doesn\u2019t have a lot to see but it is fascinating to be there and imagine 1 million Cubans there listening to Fidel give a speech.",
          "Worth a short stop while you are touring around Havana. When we were there there were many historic cars parked in the parking lot. You can see the images of Che and Fidel the Jose Marti monument. Worth a short stop. Would love to see it during an event - perhaps another",
          "Guided tour a must to understand the significance of Plaza de la Revolucion and the buildings surrounding it. An absolute piece is Cuban history as well as the iconic photo opportunity. Some American car taxi tours leave from here.",
          "Definitely worth seeing this iconic landmark sight of Havana is the Che Guevara steel facade \u201cuntil the everlasting victory, always\u201d and the Jose Marti memorial museum and the other guy who I can\u2019t remember I think Carlo... but it\u2019s not Castro. Fascinating place to visit.",

          "Take a quick visit to the Plaza of the Revolution. See where Castro gave his speeches and see the artwork on the facing buildings. It doesn\u2019t require a lot of time.",
          "Passing by but had to stop at this site visit To take the photos of these Cuba figures as it is part of Cuba history.",
          "While I think that this huge square is such an important site for Cuban revolutionary history and for its cultural and political identity, it's not pretty and there's nothing sensational to see except for the truly colossal hugeness of the expanse. The way to see it, of course,",
          "I understand this is one of the most representative places in Cuba, but it doesn't offer a great time. I booked a Classic Car Tour on CubaCabs Club website. The tour cover this place as an attraction, and it's very nice for taking beautiful pictures but nothing else. I also have",
          "Overall very unimpressed. The expanse of car park in the middle of the iconic figures (that are lit at night) and the tower are really not worth going out of your way to see, unless you want to drive in one of the cool American cars - then it is worth it for sure.",
          "This place holds a lot of history. Standing here you can really see old vs new. There is usually a parking lot full of classic cars. You have two landmark building and the tower there. Loves of architecture and history will enjoy their visit.",
          "Our driver took us here and pointed out areas of interest. There were many old cars also stopped here, just great to watch the old cars, walk past and take photos",
          "This is my second time to Havana and this is a must stop for this city/significance. You have to imagine over a million people present in the plaza. Nothing fancy but important site.",
          ".....It\u2019s amazing-lii awesome just to be in Cuba and to see how much it has already changed! It was always my desire to see and take a photo here! The Jose Marti museum and statue is a masterpiece! How he looks at the whole of La Havana laying picturesque down below! And",
          "This large open place has murals of the key revolutionaries. This large square is also the place where Fidel Castro gave his famous speeches and Popes addressed their followers. Great place to watch the classic American cars drive by.",

I found it worth going just for the history of it and obviously for the pics.\nFrom there you can continue walking to cemetery Colon, definitely worth visiting.",
          "Came out here first for May Day back in 2015 and it was wild. I've been to Labour Day parades in Toronto and Montreal but this was next level. Visited it more recently in the quiet times where I snapped this pic of Camilo Cienfuegos. It's a \u2026",

Having a tour guide or doing a little research on Wikipedia would be a good idea to be able to appreciate all that this place represents. Definitely a must-stop on your Havana tour!",

          "Obviously a destination of all the tours of Havana. It is basically a large open space with streets that are hard to cross (thank goodness there are not many cars there). The monuments are imposing but unimaginative and sad; caricatures of \u2026",
          "Great place to visit. Friendly people and love the old fashion style colorful cars.",
          "Beautiful city and the square is where all of the speeches were given by leaders of past. I love history and this was an interesting plaza.",
          "\u2764",
          "Historic site! Great place to take pictures with your convertible rentals.",
          "Just so interesting",
          "Iconic place in Habana to visit, famous Revolution Plaza, just to make photos i guess and look at big Che. Its very hot there and no shadow at all",
          "this is a square looks pretty mich like a square as you can see on the pictures. there are buildings on the side and a rather big monument to the revolution. on the square you can probably give parades and do markets of some sort. but when i was there it was pretty much empty",
          "I was here. My husband asked out of curiosity where does the president lives and the tour guide said: are you an American? He said: yes. The lady replied: \u201che lives in our hearts\u201d. \n\nSounds good, I thought. \n\nA big square with two faces, Che and someone else I don\u2019t remember. Some revolutionary guy (Camilo Cienfuegos perhaps?)",
          "Big square,  big statue.  We visited on a bike tour of Havana (highly recommend),  and the explanation of the history was very interesting.",
          "Interesting place, recommended.",
          "This is the center of communism  at this time.",
          "It is very nice to see the giant statue of Marti (Cuba's National Hero) along with the Jose Marti Memorial Tower. I did not care for the face of Che, as I despise Communism! A fun fact is that most if not all of the buildings, the tower, and the Jose Marti statue was build before the Revolution.",
          "Interesting. The Jose Marti monument is beautiful and reflects the Socialist tendency towards giant, heroic monuments. One has to remember that Cuba is an island with a small, limited economy. Putting up such a monument to honor a great poet and nationalist cost them a great deal more than it might have cost us in the US.",
          "It was amazing to stand in a place that I've read about and seen on tv/internet so many times and never thought I would be able to visit. It's an empty parking lot where you can view all three monumental buildings. Across the street is a parking lot full of old colorful cars used as taxis.",
          "Though it is 3 star hospitality is nearing 5 star.\nIn the next building all South Indian foods available on prior order.\nJust opp Dal Lake, Srinagar.",
          "Historic site",
          "Plaza is a big paved lot with the impressive statue. Would be good as an event venue.",
          "wonderful place to visit",
          "Not a lot to see here but interesting history.",
          "Good for a quick pic with che and camilo. Not much else to see.",
          "It was an amazing experience and I learned a whole new side of the revolution. The building was so beautiful and ornate.",
          "Paved parking lot basically",
          "Cuba was a great place to visit. Nice people.",
          "The history, the vibe and the evolution of the Cuban nation are some of the reasons to see Revolution Square. The monument dedicated to Fidel Castro and his Revolution tower over the square and is a sight to behold. A must see for the Cuban tourist.",
          "It's what dreams are made of. I suggest going at night & at daytime!",
          "A must-see place in Habana, Cuba, where old fashion roadster cars are exhibited. Love this plaza",
          "Cuba is indeed in bad shape. Must have been beautiful in it's prime. The people seemed happy but live in squalor. Most Cubans have to use the black market for everyday products. Most have at least 2 incomes.",
          "Love Havanna ! The classic cars take me back to my childhood ,lots of chrome , car fins,huge v8 engines! The architectural  facids r remarkably  in fair shape  but u can see the grandeur of long ago masterpieces  !",
          "My father waited his entire life to visit La Habana. I was able to help him fulfill his wish. At 74 and with not steady footing, we trekked across the city, rode in a car mostly, but by god, he made it there! A trip and chance of a lifetime, for both of us.",
          "While in Havana , a place you should not miss. Proud people honoring their heroes.",
          "Very nice monuments",
          "Great cars always in the area. Check it out!  P.S its very safe and the people are always great there.",
          "The plaza was clean and there's plenty of space to walk around and take pictures.",
          "Another check off my bucket list. It was a little more run down than I was expecting.  The giant image of Che and Camillo Cienfuegos was a little bigger than I expected. But it was amazing to stand in the plaza and just take it all in.",
          "We probably spent 10 minutes but it felt enough. I guess it is a must see in Havana\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Was interesting to learn that Fidel spoke here to the public.",
          "Sad to see such a depressed country. I always wanted to go there and it was interesting,  just too bad they are trapped in the clutches of history.",
          "When looking at the monument, it gaves an oppressive feeling. It's doesn't help that its just one or two giant concrete stone building with Castro's face etched.",
          "So much history in this place if you take a moment to reflect on it. Not a lot of fanfare associated with it on my visit as it\u2019s meaning escaped many who were visiting. Great place to see many of the vintage cars though.",
          "History at its best",
          "One of the most iconic places in the world where history has been made regardless of whether you think that history had been good or bad! Felt a little funny knowing I was standing where Fidel Castro spoke so many times to the people of \u2026",
          "Havana is a place when you have visited here it stops in your heart forevermore \nI hope some time me and my wife will return",
          "Interesting place. Lots of history (obviously), the tour I was on took us to a giant open square (like an empty parking lot). You could get out of the bus and walk around and see all the buildings surrounding the plaza.",
          "Very clean and a great place for photo opportunities.",
          "Has got story",
          "Even better than I expected. I knew about some US interference in Cuba but, I was surprised about just how much we have stuck our nose in their business.",
          "Not bad for Cuba",
          "It's a great feeling to be the middle of Cuban history.",
          "Vast square it the city with Jose Martin statue one side and huge portraits of Che and other on the opposite side. Quite and impressive sight.",
          "Good to get to know history - leaders that brought about the revolution",
          "If you get the chance to visit Havana, Cuba, take a tour in a vintage car.  The Cuban people are friendly and warm, and proud to share their country's history.  It's a great opportunity to get past the propaganda of both the U.S. and Cuban governments.",
          "Nice place to visit",
          "Incredibly historic location.",
          "Very exciting since I grew up in Tito's Yugoslavia",
          "Emblematic square in Havana, witness to the most important historic events of the last 60 years",
          "I'm American and it is always good to see the story from the other side. I found this museum fascinating. There's some propaganda here, but hey, who doesn't present at least some propaganda?",
          "Awesome place!  The vintage cars and the various revolutionary images and monuments make this a very exciting place. Definitely  worth a visit.",
          "Great views of the entire city.. takes about a minute to get to the top. Not sure how to go back down unless you wait for the elevator attendant!",
          "A visit to Havana wouldn't be complete without a ride in one of the American Cars. Nead to haggle over price, good way to have a city tour.",
          "Very nice place",
          "Such a beautiful place filled with so much history. It's really a site to see no question. If you ever get to Cuba I suggest you do the 50's car tour and check it out for yourself. Definitely won't be disappointed.",
          "Beautyful place",
          "If you love your history & you're a revolutionary this is the place to visit",
          "One of the best historical places to visit in Habana. Very interesting place regarding the symbology of the revolution to Cuban people.",
          "As a new tourist destination, at least for Americans, Cuba has a few things to work on.  I found it interesting but a bit confining given Cuba's government and the USA's current policies.  Go expecting little interaction with Cubans except \u2026",
          "Office buildings on the sides, and a supertall monument and no shade from the sun in the middle. Interesting from a civil engineering standpoint. Nevertheless, would not recommend walking around there in the middle of the day when the sun burns you to a crisp!!",
          "We were with my family enjoy visited to Cuba,people is very friendly",
          "Wonderful place to be will visit again",

          "The historical value",
          "Amazing history that you can feel. The old and new balanced and contrasted so well here. Find many a old taxi ride from here. The 6 sides of the best view if havana used to face the 6 provinces. Now there are many more. A must see. Step into Cuba's history in this square",

          "I really liked visiting Cuba, and getting to know it's history, our guide was very eloquent and fun.",
          "The fact that this place has earnt its place in Cuban history is why l took the photo, but l can't  say that it has a lot of kerb appeal, but its one of the bucket list. This shot was taken from the hop on off bus caught by the cruise \u2026",
          "Place must to visit",
          "Amazing to see",
          "A big square in Havana. Historical site of the revolution.  Not much to see, just an big concrete floored open space.  If you love classic American Cars, you will see a lot of them here for hire or bringing in tourists.",
          "Vast open iconic square. Not too impressive but a stoo to tick of the must see list.",
          "It's a nice symbolic visit but it's quite a walk.",
          "Arriving in one of Cuba's retro cabs is a perfect way to roll into this plaza. Come as part of a tour, or on your own and enjoy the huge square, monument, and tribute to some key Cuban revolutionary figures.",
          "A nice view from the top. A missed opportunity that they aren't open at night. The bathrooms were under construction. We paid 1CUC to walk around the tower and 3CUC to go up.",
          "Havana was great, lots to see do and eat.",
          "It was great to view this Historical Monument in Havanna! We hired a private cab/bus with a student who spoke perfect English, to take our group of 5 into Havanna. He explained each area to us and showed us the sites of interest.  It was an enjoyable day!",
          "Historical place to visit. Would recommend a trip in a Tuk Tuk",
          "Remarkable culture. The ability to adapt and thrive with so few modern technological resources is amazing.",
          "Nice place and country one must visit.",
          "A lot of history worth the trip.",
          "Crazy stuff here, worth the visit to understand the history of Cuba.",
          "Nice place",
          "An extraordinary, historical place for Video's speeches.  Some local raled about being there in the 60s.",
          "This was an outstanding cultural experience. Visiting Havana, Cuba is definitely one of the highlights of this year. The city and its people were different than I thought they would be.  They were friendly, helpful and very open. Go if you can.",

          "The history behind the Revolution Square made me reflect",
          "If you want to know more about the history of Havana and Cuba, this is a \"must-see\". The buildings are all reminiscent of a time-gone-by. There are a lot of monuments close by, and a plethora of old taxi's and cars. There are still a lot of \u2026",
          "A must see.",
          "The revolution plaza is great. It has a beautiful view from the top.",
          "Revolution square is monumental and it is interesting to consider historical events which happened there.  On the day we visited, only two busloads of people were wandering about the plaza which really emphasized the size.  Government buildings bordering the square have interesting art works showing past leaders.",
          "Nice place to see old cars but not much more to do besides that",
          "Beautiful space to memorialize the revolution.  The surrounding buildings are white and have very large likenesses of Cuban heroes, Jose Marti, Che Guevara and of course Fidel Castro. There is a tower like structure meant to remind the people to build on their success.  Lots of operable antique vehicles that will take you wherever!",
          "Better in pictures. There were no people, no life. It felt like a very large parking lot.",
          "Great place to check out 50s cars (and get a sense of the awe inspiring space in which masses of people are gathered for \"inspiration.\")",
          "Loved Havana.",
          "Beautiful Monument",
          "It is a beautiful site to visit.",
          "Very interesting site. When we were there, there was an exhibition of the 1950's cars that,are so common in Havana. They were amazingly maintained, although some had replaced the original engine with a new(er) one. Great photos and met done nice car enthusiasts.",
          "Must see while in Havana. There isn't much there so you only need 20-30 Mon to walk around ant take pictures",
          "Very well maintained historic site",
          "Amazing place with amazing history for one of the greatest elected leaders of all times! His excellency Fidel Castro held great, intellectually robust discourses and the people would flock by the millions (all by their own free will of \u2026",
          "It's the highest point of Havana City. You can going up using an elevator and see an outstanding 360 degrees view of the city.\nAt bottom there is a permanent exposition about how this monument was built. Golden columns hold ceiling of this area. Wall are decorated with Jose Mart\u00ed text.",

          "Very interesting and historical.  A great place to find a lovely vintage American car and a knowledgeable driver to give you a nice tour. We paid $40 for 4 to ride in a 1955 Ford Fairlane convertible for an hour tour!  It would have been \u2026",
          "Obviously part of any Havana checklist \ud83d\ude0a. Definitely take a ride up the tower for the panoramic view of the city.",
          "Great place. On the 1st of May it's an iconic place where the major parade happens. It's a must see",
          "A bit far from the old city and access with car is not easy as parking is not allowed. Good for a photo only.",

          "Should be the first destination for visitors to Havana. 360 view, history, and visual grandeur made this one of my favourite sights in Havana. One million people stood in this Plaza once when Fidel spoke for hours and hours.",

          "Cuba was awesome. Great people, history, music and food.",
          "highly recommended ! must see",

          "Great area for history of Cuba. No facilities but large groups of people.",
          "First place we visited in Havana. The history of this small country is amazing. I felt supercharged while I was at Revolution Plaza. Of course, you can also see many of the classic American cars here too.",
          "It's just steeped in history.",
          "It feels majestic but not oppressive.",
          "I am not a fan of Che Guevara. It's a nice looking square, but the Cuban revolution, although it may have started as a positive change, quickly turned into repression, murder, personal privilege for those at the top, and abject poverty for the rest.",
          "We enjoyed our time in Cuba and visiting this historical location. It's always great to see others cultural history and meet some wonderful people.",
          "Very interesting to see where they hold all of the important rallies. Knowing that a million people can gather in the square seems impossible once you stand there. There isn't really much to do other than see it though so if time in Havana is limited, you might want to pass.",
          "Many monuments and important buildings in the same place.",

          "As others have mentioned , this IS a giant parking lot.  But then again, it was designed to hold a large crowd of people.  The outlined images of Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos appear on neighboring buildings.  The Jose Marti monument \u2026",
          "It was an amazing experiance.  But bit high humid allaround",

          "Historic Square with museums. A must-visit on a trip to Havana",

          "Interesting to view at night.",
          "Is is a sight to see when in Havana? Yes! Is it pretty? Like most monuments of it's type, not really. My very honest suggestion is to take the double decker tourist  tour bus on the route that covers Vedado and Miramar, it passes the plaza de la revolucion. Otherwise it's no worth the hassle to just go there specifically.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a (Fort of Saint Charles), colloquially known as La Caba\u00f1a, is an 18th-century fortress complex, the third-largest in the Americas, located on the elevated eastern side of the harbor entrance in Havana, Cuba. The fort rises above the 200-foot (60 m) hilltop, along with Morro Castle.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter the capture of Havana by British forces in 1762, an exchange was soon made to return Havana to the Spanish, the controlling colonial power of Cuba, in exchange for Florida. A key factor in the British capture of Havana turned out to be the overland vulnerability of El Morro. This realization and the fear of further attacks following British colonial conquests in the Seven Years War prompted the Spanish to build a new fortress to improve the overland defense of Havana; King Carlos III of Spain began the construction of La Caba\u00f1a in 1763. Replacing earlier and less extensive fortifications next to the 16th-century El Morro fortress, La Caba\u00f1a was the second-largest colonial military installation in the New World by the time it was completed in 1774 (after the St. Felipe de Barajas fortification at Cartagena, Colombia), at great expense to Spain.\nOver the next two hundred years the fortress served as a base for both Spain and later independent Cuba \u2013 La Caba\u00f1a has been used as a  prison by the government of Fidel Castro and his younger brother Ra\u00fal.\n\n\n== 1959 ==\nIn January 1959, the revolutionary group led by Fidel Castro seized La Caba\u00f1a; the defending Cuban Army unit offered no resistance and surrendered. Che Guevara used the fortress as a headquarters and military prison for several months. During his five-month tenure in that post (January 2 through June 12, 1959), Guevara oversaw the revolutionary tribunals and executions of people who had opposed the communist revolution, including former members of Bur\u00f3 de Represi\u00f3n de Actividades Comunistas, Batista's secret police. There were 176 executions by Che Guevara documented for La Caba\u00f1a Fortress\nprison during Che\u2019s command (January 3 to November 26, 1959).\n\n\n=== La Caba\u00f1a, land reform, and literacy ===\n\nThe first major political crisis arose over what to do with the captured Batista officials who had perpetrated the worst of the repression. During the rebellion against Batista's dictatorship, the general command of the rebel army, led by Fidel Castro, introduced into the territories under its control the 19th-century penal law commonly known as the Ley de la Sierra (Law of the Sierra). This law included the death penalty for serious crimes, whether perpetrated by the Batista regime or by supporters of the revolution. In 1959 the revolutionary government extended its application to the whole of the republic and to those it considered war criminals, captured and tried after the revolution. According to the Cuban Ministry of Justice, this latter extension was supported by the majority of the population, and followed the same procedure as those in the Nuremberg trials held by the Allies after World War II.\n\n\n=== Revolutionary justice ===\nTo implement a portion of this plan, Castro named Guevara commander of the La Caba\u00f1a Fortress prison, for a five-month tenure (2 January through 12 June 1959). Guevara was charged by the new government with purging the Batista army and consolidating victory by exacting \"revolutionary justice\" against those regarded as traitors, chivatos (informants) or war criminals. As commander of La Caba\u00f1a, Guevara reviewed the appeals of those convicted during the revolutionary tribunal process.\n\n\n=== Tribunals ===\nThe tribunals were conducted by 2\u20133 army officers, an assessor, and a respected local citizen. On some occasions the penalty delivered by the tribunal was death by firing-squad. Ra\u00fal G\u00f3mez Treto, senior legal advisor to the Cuban Ministry of Justice, has argued that the death penalty was justified in order to prevent citizens themselves from taking justice into their own hands, as had happened twenty years earlier in the anti-Machado rebellion. Biographers note that in January 1959 the Cuban public was in a \"lynching mood\", and point to a survey at the time showing 93% public approval for the tribunal process. Moreover, a 22 January 1959, Universal Newsreel broadcast in the United States and narrated by Ed Herlihy featured Fidel Castro asking an estimated one million Cubans whether they approved of the executions, and being met with a roaring \"\u00a1Si!\" (yes). With as many as 20,000 Cubans estimated to have been killed at the hands of Batista's collaborators, and many of the accused war criminals sentenced to death accused of torture and physical atrocities, the newly-empowered government carried out executions, punctuated by cries from the crowds of \"\u00a1al pared\u00f3n!\" ([to the] wall!), which biographer Jorge Casta\u00f1eda describes as \"without respect for due process\".\n\n\n=== Executions ===\nAlthough accounts vary, it is estimated that several hundred people were executed nationwide during this time, with Guevara's jurisdictional death total at La Caba\u00f1a ranging from 55 to 105. Conflicting views exist of Guevara's attitude towards the executions at La Caba\u00f1a. Some exiled opposition biographers report that he relished the rituals of the firing squad, and organized them with gusto, while others relate that Guevara pardoned as many prisoners as he could. All sides acknowledge that Guevara had become a \"hardened\" man who had no qualms about the death penalty or about summary and collective trials. If the only way to \"defend the revolution was to execute its enemies, he would not be swayed by humanitarian or political arguments\". In a 5 February 1959, letter to Luis Paredes L\u00f3pez in Buenos Aires Guevara states unequivocally: \"The executions by firing squads are not only a necessity for the people of Cuba, but also an imposition of the people.\"\n\n\n=== Land redistribution ===\nAlong with ensuring \"revolutionary justice\", the other key early platform of Guevara was establishing agrarian land reform. Almost immediately after the success of the revolution, on 27 January 1959, Guevara made one of his most significant speeches where he talked about \"the social ideas of the rebel army\". During this speech he declared that the main concern of the new Cuban government was \"the social justice that land redistribution brings about\". A few months later,n 17 May 1959, the Agrarian Reform Law, crafted by Guevara, went into effect, limiting the size of all farms to 1,000 acres (400 ha). Any holdings over these limits were expropriated by the government and either redistributed to peasants in 67-acre (270,000 m2) parcels or held as state-run communes. The law also stipulated that foreigners could not own Cuban sugar-plantations.\n\nOn 12 June 1959, Castro sent Guevara out on a three-month tour of 14 mostly Bandung Pact countries (Morocco, Sudan, Egypt, Syria, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Yugoslavia, Greece) and the cities of Singapore and Hong Kong. Sending Guevara away from Havana allowed Castro to appear to distance himself from Guevara and his Marxist sympathies, which troubled both the United States and some of the members of Castro's 26 July Movement. While in Jakarta, Guevara visited Indonesian president Sukarno to discuss the recent revolution of 1945-1949 in Indonesia and to establish trade relations between their two countries. The two men quickly bonded, as Sukarno was attracted to Guevara's energy and his relaxed informal approach; moreover they shared revolutionary leftist aspirations against western imperialism. Guevara next spent 12 days in Japan (15\u201327 July), participating in negotiations aimed at expanding Cuba's trade relations with that country. During the visit he refused to visit and lay a wreath at Japan's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier commemorating soldiers lost during World War II, remarking that the Japanese \"imperialists\" had \"killed millions of Asians\". Instead, Guevara stated that he would visit Hiroshima, where the American military had detonated an atom-bomb 14 years earlier. Despite his denunciation of Imperial Japan, Guevara considered President Truman a \"macabre clown\" for the bombings, and after visiting Hiroshima and its Peace Memorial Museum he sent back a postcard to Cuba stating, \"In order to fight better for peace, one must look at Hiroshima.\"Upon Guevara's return to Cuba in September 1959, it became evident that Castro now had more political power. The government had begun land seizures in accordance with the agrarian reform law, but was hedging on compensation offers to landowners, instead offering low-interest \"bonds\", a step which put the United States on alert. At this point the affected wealthy cattlemen of Camag\u00fcey mounted a campaign against the land redistributions and enlisted the newly-disaffected rebel leader Huber Matos, who along with the anti-Communist wing of 26 July Movement, joined them in denouncing \"Communist encroachment\". During this time Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo was offering assistance to the \"Anti-Communist Legion of the Caribbean\" which was training in the Dominican Republic. This multi-national force, composed mostly of Spaniards and Cubans, but also of Croatians, Germans, Greeks, and right-wing mercenaries, was plotting to topple Castro's new regime.\n\n\n=== La Coubre ===\nSuch threats were heightened when, on 4 March 1960, two massive explosions ripped through the French freighter La Coubre, which was carrying Belgian munitions from the port of Antwerp, and was docked in Havana Harbor. The blasts killed at least 76 people and injured several hundred, with Guevara personally providing first aid to some of the victims. Fidel Castro immediately accused the CIA of \"an act of terrorism\" and held a state funeral the following day for the victims of the blast. At the memorial service Alberto Korda took the famous photograph of Guevara, now known as Guerrillero Heroico.\n\n\n=== INRA ===\n\nPerceived threats prompted Castro to eliminate more \"counter-revolutionaries\" and to utilize Guevara to drastically increase the speed of land reform. To implement this plan, a new government agency, the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (INRA), was established by the Cuban Government to administer the new Agrarian Reform law. INRA quickly became the most important governing body in the nation, with Guevara serving as its head in his capacity as minister of industries. Under Guevara's command, INRA established its own 100,000-person militia, used first to help the government seize control of the expropriated land and supervise its distribution, and later to set up cooperative farms. The land confiscated included 480,000 acres (190,000 ha) owned by United States corporations. Months later, in retaliation, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower sharply reduced United States imports of Cuban sugar (Cuba's main cash crop), which led Guevara on 10 July 1960 to address over 100,000 workers in front of the Presidential Palace at a rally to denounce the \"economic aggression\" of the United States. Time Magazine reporters who met with Guevara around this time described him as \"guid(ing) Cuba with icy calculation, vast competence, high intelligence, and a perceptive sense of humor.\"\n\n\n=== Literacy ===\nAlong with land reform, Guevara stressed the need for national improvement in literacy. Before 1959 the official literacy rate for Cuba was between 60\u201376%, with educational access in rural areas and a lack of instructors the main determining factors. As a result, the Cuban government at Guevara's behest dubbed 1961 the \"year of education\" and mobilized over 100,000 volunteers into \"literacy brigades\", who were then sent out into the countryside to construct schools, train new educators, and teach the predominantly illiterate guajiros (peasants) to read and write. Unlike many of Guevara's later economic initiatives, this campaign was \"a remarkable success\". By the completion of the Cuban Literacy Campaign, 707,212 adults had been taught to read and write, raising the national literacy rate to 96%.Accompanying literacy, Guevara was also concerned with establishing universal access to higher education. To accomplish this the new regime introduced affirmative action to the universities. While announcing this new commitment, Guevara told the gathered faculty and students at the University of Las Villas that the days when education was \"a privilege of the white middle class\" had ended. \"The University\" he said, \"must paint itself black, mulatto, worker, and peasant.\" If it did not, he warned, the people were going to break down its doors \"and paint the University the colors they like.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Every night for 350 years, a cannon has been fired from the Fortaleza. Originally to signal closure of the City Gates and harbor, it lives on today as a source of local entertainment and pride. Many families bring their kids out for the free nightly demonstration. It was",

          "Great experience walking around historic location\u2014guided tour not worth the cost since you can self guide",
          "We decided to visit early evening so we could hang around for the display for firing of the Canon which starts at 8.30pm. Bad idea. Around half of the exhibition rooms were closed and there is not much else to see aside from a few touristy market stalls amd a pretty limited cafe",
          "We visited the 9:30 cannon show and it was specatular. With full military guard, marches, fire and drama, the kids were entertained from start to finish. Entry was a little pricey in my opinion, but really entertaining, and I am really glad that we went.",
          "We really liked the panorama of Havana and the views of the castle. We went there at noon and enjoyed the absence of the crowd. We were almost only visitors. Though we didn't see the firing of the cannon, still we are happy with the visit. The only disappointment is the cashier",
          "Its an expensive experience when you factor in the cost of a taxi ride to the fort and a 8 CUC entrance fee. There is a 10 min soldier marching ceremony and a single cannon shot at 9pm. Your money is probably spent better elsewhere.",
          "Quite a fun thing to do but don't pay for a tour and it will cost you 8CUC to get in. The area is not lit at night and very uneven. Learn about it before you go as it is confusing as to what is happening if not.",
          "San Carlos de la Cabana Fortaleza de la Cabana is a historical park with a number of museums, on the other side of Habana harbour. The tunnel for car-traffic under the harbour is connecting both sides. Every day at 9 PM there is a gun salut, a huge touristic attractyion",
          "All ho hum here especially the expensive viewing of the night time cannon firing at 9pm. Dont waste your $$ by spending 3 cuc more to get a better view....you dont !! However you do get a can of cola and a sanger for your 3cuc.",

          "It is a fort of several hundred metres long, with cannons every few metres apart facing the sea. There are a few souvenirs shops inside several rows of army buildings. Part of it was closed at my time of visit. Otherwise, there was not much to see inside the fort. It has a",

          "We went to the cannon show on a Sunday evening. It was very crowded and my youngest couldn't really see (we did get there early). You must buy tickets prior to entering (the ticket office is after the first entrance to the left before going over the bridge). It is 8 CUC per",
          "It is amazing sight. With all the marching in period soldiers uniform and loading of the cannon, they fire it at exactly 9 pm. Expect a large crowd",
          "Went here on a Saturday afternoon and we were the only ones there. Small entrance fee, typical old fort but nice views of Havana. Interesting museum of Che Guevara here also.",
          "The fort was built by the Spanish and is the largest such imperialist fortress in the Americas. Che Guevara had his office here following the revolution. It is possible to view this and his belongings, but unfortunately when I was there they were preparing for a Tourism Festival",
          "This Fort is just too big to visit. Go to El Morro. Far better! It is located on the other side of the river. Huge!",
          "Get there early to grab a good spot. The canonazo was a really worthwhile show. Pay a few more CUCs and try to pay the rooftop view.",
          "This is part of the history of Havana so if you are visiting, you might as well see it. It is not one of the most impressiveness fortresses but it is nicely situated.",
          "We went twice to the Fortaleza. Once with a tour of Havana by night and once on our own. With the our we where there only for the nightly shooting of the cannon. We didn\u2019t have time to spare to walk around so we went back. It is a very big fortress with a great view on the city.",
          "Took a tour to this huge fort guarded the narrow entrance to the Bay of Havana. It was the perfect military location to protect the enemies trying to enter. This was even used as a prison and even Che Guevara set up his headquarters here. The cannons lined up showing us how",
          "Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana was a tour stop on our tour. We had the opportunity to walk around and hear about the history of the fort. It is an 18th century fortress built by the Spanish king Carlos III to protect the waterway.",
          "Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a, colloquially known as La Caba\u00f1a, is an 18th-century fortress . It is the third-largest in the Americas, located on the eastern side of the harbor in Havana, Cuba. The Spanish Kinng Carlos III ordered the construction of this massive fort to",

          "Take a taxi or a ferry to this side of the harbor and see this site as well as the other 2 I have reviewed. Don't go to Havana without taking a few hours to come to this side of the Harbor.",

          "Brilliantly interesting and well-maintained fort ; the museum in the underground tunnels is beautifully laid out , and the fort itself is huge with great views of Havana and out to sea. We came across on the ferry from Havana then walked up the hill where we treated ourselves to",
          "Great location on the Malacon so a lovely way to spend time. Some history of the area is given of this Fortress complex of the harbour entrance so great views. Also look at the cannons and statue of Miranda situated close to the Museo de San Salvador.",
          "Impenetrable fort easily taken with a creative analysis. Instead of a frontal attack from the sea, enemy landed, circled around and captured fort and then used it to capture the city. The views are spectacular from this location making it a must see.",
          "Castillo and El Moro were though to be impregnable, until an English ordered by the king realized all the armaments were facing the sea. So he landed his 800 or so croups ten miles to the east and attacked by land. Once he captured the Castillo, he turned the canons on Havana",
          "We were told by several people to go see the cannon firing, which happens every night at 9pm. We decided to go early so we could see the museum part as well, but turns out the museum closes at 6pm! so there's an odd gap where nothing is really happening. there was a market going",
          "My husband and I were with Royal Caribbean and Havana was one of our port of calls. We took a shore excursion and this was one of our stops. Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana (Fort of St.Charles) known as La Cabana is an 18th century fortress complex. It is the third",
          "Not to much to see here as it is like most forts. But in the evening there is a bit of a show when they fire the cannon at 9pm so show when a chain was put across the harbour entrance. We got there about 8.30pm and it was busy.",

          "Historic old castle/fort guarding the harbour into Havana , reached by small ferry or by taxi under the water tunnel .Very imposing and large fort looking out to sea ,and overlooking the city of Havana , you can walk around the walls and go inside part of the castle and see old",
          "Definitely worth a visit if in Havana. Travel by small boat from the port (only 5cents), by car or bus. Beautiful views of Havana from this side of the Malacon. The cannons are fired at nine every night but visit during the day and spend time looking at the military museum.",
          "It is well preserve, the view of the castle and form the castle are very nice. If you are unlucky sometimes they have activities that do not let you visit the castle.",
          "We came on a tour of Havana and were really only there for the 9 p.m. cannon firing. There was a night market set up for the tourists which was really night. The fort looked spectacular at night, our only regret was that we didn't get to spend some time there during the day.",
          "The fort is huge. We went in the evening to see the canon ceremony. We got a taxi for 5 CUC from Old Havana to the fort, then had dinner at a restaurant near the parking lot. We just made it into the fort in time to, sort of, see the ceremony. It was crowded. Go early.",
          "I cool historical spot with a great view back onto Old Havana. We went for the nightly Cannon firing (9 PM every night). It is a bit of a show with soldiers marching and carrying of the flame to light the cannon. The crowd was pretty large. You can stand right by the",

          "We went there at night to see the firing of the cannon. Nice experience with all the soldiers in the uniforms from the early days of the fort. It is well preserved and the size of it was surprising.",
          "The history of this fort and how they drew a chain across the harbour mouth at night to protect themselves from pirates is amazing. I don't think anything has been changed since they built it except you can now buy cigars and Rum in the shop. There are also craft shops outside",
          "This place is huge, it's like a city. There are some places inside that you can stop to eat or have a drink. It was fun to walk through and take in the history and strength of the fortress, also learning how it was used after the Revolution as well",
          "this is fun to explore however again not worth staying her longer than 1hr. The cannon show was good as well. The history of knowing what happened is better than the visit though, especially if it is a hot day as there is not much to do there. There are lovely views here.",
          "The castle is located across the narrow water way from Old Havana. It is the largest castle in Cuba and one of the largest of the Spanish Empire. It is in very good condition and has wonderful views of Havana. There are not many exhibits. But, it does have many of the old",
          "This is the second of the two castles on the headland.It was built next to the original castle to repel invaders and offers great views of Havana.At nine o'clock every night a cannon fires,it is very loud!!! if you get there early there is a ceremony of sorts but don't worry if",
          "All we could think about was shoot the canon already. We were close but actually watched it from the 50 iPads from people on each other\u2019s shoulders. Seriously the pomp and circumstance is ridiculous. However the grounds are beautiful, great views of Havana and the water. I\u2019d",
          "Entirely interesting for history buffs. Original cannons and walls. Rum and the 'longest cigar' shop on site. The day we went there was a lively salsa band playing - they were wonderful; support the arts and drop them a few CUC or buy their CD.",
          "Worth seeing. Go at night to see the cannon fire and sunset. The performance of 18th century soldiers firing the cannon is slightly amateur. Stunning spot for sunset. Worth paying a buck to go onto the balcony and getting a fee soda. If you are on a budget only combine a visit",
          "We took a taxi to this area. We were able to see Old Havana from this area. Great place to take pics. There are some souvenirs you can buy here as well.",
          "Very impressive in its size and history and a lot of free reign to explore the fort. Great views of old Havana and can see the Capitol building, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed structure and much more all in the same picture. The free reign over the fort Is great as can do a lot more exploring than",
          "This old Castle at the opposite of the bay is not so spectacular as El Morro, but the view you get from on Havana and the bay from the outer walls is magnificent. But come very early or late in the afternoon, otherwise you risk to have the sun over Havana",
          "Come here early before the cruise ship amatures come here. There are good views of the city with a lot of local history. I was able to take some great pictures from here, so come prepared.",
          "Especially if there are multiple cruise ships in town, would recommend arriving no later than 8:30 (8:15 would probably be ideal) for the 9:00 cannon ceremony. You'll have approximately a ten-minute walk to the top of the fort, and then you'll have to decide where you think",
          "Make sure you gatjered a sunny day and visit the castle. It is a rahter usual Spanish castle but offers the best view to the old city of Havana.",
          "This area provides a great view of Havana and beautiful sunset photo opportunities. Great old castle",
          "This is an amazingly-kept place that is in much the same condition as when it was the most fortified installment in all of the Caribbean. At night there is a canon ceremony, which is a reenactment of the firing of the canon at night when the gates to Havana were closed. Active",
          "This forteress is nice to visit. Walking around it and enjoy the view of Havana from this place. Around 9:00 PM, they fire the canon, it's packed but really impressive.",
          "This provides a great view of the water and is not far from the port. Our guide gave us the history on the architect who built many of the forts in Cuba. Fascinating. At night, they fire the canon. Unfortunately, we missed it.",
          "Do Not Miss this Fort Love El Morro in San Juan Puerto Rico but this fort is the gran daddy of them all - huge and fabulous easy walking lay out. Do not miss. Cannon blast ceremony nightly",
          "La Caba\u00f1a has been built by the Spanish in the 18th century along with El Morro castle. It\u2019s an impressive fortress located on a hill overlooking Havana harbour. From the remparts the view on the city is splendid. Every night at 9 pm a cannon is fired, actors playing the",
          "This would work well as evening visit. There is the fort to look round, variations on the standard street stalls, as well as a restaraunt on site. But the real reason to go in the evening is for the nightly ceremony which takes place at around 21:00 where they fire one of the",
          "Part of our tour and really enjoyed the views, history and beauty of this place. Cuba has many forts and this one is one of the best. If your in the are and like to walk, make sure you stop here.",
          "This was the highlight of our 4 hour bus tour to see sites around the city. The Castillo is in much better shape than almost everything else I saw. Like similar forts on other islands, it is a terrific historical treasure and is on one the best piece of real estate in town. Most",
          "The fortress is huge, what ever threat used to come in from the sea wouldn\u2019t have a chance with the amount of cannons there. The ceremony itself dragged on a big. I understand it\u2019s tradition but I did find it go on long. The cannon shot itself was unbelievably loud. Nothing else",
          "On a cruise to Cuba we booked the tour 'Old Havana City Sightseeing'. Our tour guide Nilda was super...informative, pleasant, patient and funny...she was a delight to be around. We went to many sites...one of Tom's favorites was this fort. We walked up a steep cemented area",
          "I think this is the best colonial place to see in havana. the place is super huge and amazing. Is so big that in some parts you will feel that you are alone in the place. Also it have a super nice view of the bay and nice tunnels underground to see. Important: if you like walk,",
          "took a local bus there an experience and worth a review in itself !! 9 pm start are minibuses for the less faint hearted !",

          "A huge fort across the harbour from Havana with numerous canon trained on any enemy ships entering the port with ill intent, ie English Privateers from the 17th Century. The trip across the harbour is C$2 each way on the noisy and not very quaint ferry. Then if is a walk up the",
          "Great view of the city, wish I had time to take to He tour of the museum. Definite place to stop. Unfortunately it is a du,ping ground for litter. Old rooms full of garbage and don\u2019t peak in as people use them as bath rooms.",
          "Make sure your city guide (preferably in one of the classic cars) takes you across the channel for this spectacular view of Old and New Havana",
          "We took a taxi over from near the Revolution museum for CUC5. The fort is an amazing structure with an entry fee of CUC6. There is not much explanation here so make sure you read up before you come. We enjoyed our walk around and the views back over to Havana but this place has",
          "We visited like most tourists on a bus tour. It seems a staple of the Havana tour buses or if you hire a private tour car they will take you there as well. The fort is home to a small market where you can buy the usual trinkets and there is also a rum shop inside the fort",
          "Its seems a long way from the city but it's only across the harbour and is easily reached. great views across the water to the Old Town building. The fortifications are secondary but you can't help appreciate their strategic significance.",
          "We got the ferry over here during the day and walked to the fortress to have a look around. It's fairly big and has lots of sights (including a chapel, plenty of cannons and cannon balls) and a great view back over Havana. The information boards were useful for some background /",

          "Our favourite part of this event was actually our visit to the small Che Guevara museum. Here were lots of photos and artifacts from Che's life, including the small coffin in which his remains were transported to Cuba from Bolivia. The actual ceremony consists of a few",

          "there are at least 3 castles around havana, this one is free of charge and one of the best views on the city",
          "The views of Havana are great however historically there is little or no information. Inside the castle is just a large souvenir market. Grounds around the castle are covered in trash and many corners have been used as impromptu toilets",
          "The Canonazo de las Nueve Ceremony takes place here. Even though the ceremony starts at 8:30 you need to be there earlier. It costs 8CUC to enter and the place is always packed with tourists. If you want to see the ceremony you really need to be up on the stand by 8 at the",
          "On a hill with great views of Havana Town across the water, the fort is a full hour's worth of history. There are many other things to see nearby. You can arrive by taxi, there is a huge variation in prices so haggle. We go across by ferry for 1 Cuc from the pier just south of",
          "The very beginning of Habana, La Fortaleza gives you a great view of the Old Town. The \"Canhonaso\" is a beautiful event and worth the visit by itself.",
          "This is where you can admire Havana in all her beauty! You can see all of the scars of the city that create its character from across the harbour mouth. The fort itself is very big and beautiful, fitting for a city like Havana. You can wander around for a couple of hours at",
          "We reached the fort by taking the T3 tour bus. 6 CUC entrance fee. This complex is sprawling and needs at least one hour to see the basics. The history covers the last 200+ years and some interesting facts and snippets are to be found around most corners. As a bonus, with the",

          "The Spanish colonial fort is an iconic landmark that cannot be missed. Built in the 1500-1600's and still a partially active base. It is the second largest fort in the Americas after Cartagena. I have been to both and like this one in Havana much more.",
          "We went on a walking tour of Old Havana with a guide, followed by a meal at La Bodeguita del Medio (a bustling restaurant and bar frequented by Ernest Hemingway) and were then coached to Castillo d San Carlos de la Cabana for the cannon firing ceremony - celebrating the closure",
          "Plenty of cannon platforms to protect the city from any attack from the sea when Havana was inhabited. Great sight lines and with a lot of imagination you can go back to the 1700's. Rum and Cigar shop on site gets very crowded and cozy when a bus or 2 show up.",
          "A huge fortress with loads of history to explore so a guide is good to have. We went to the evening canon firing at 9 pm where there is a ceremonial parade, with staff dressed in historic costume. Fingers in the ears if you are close, gunpowder not electronic! There is also a",
          "You are able to see these sites (city sky line and other buildings) coming into Cuba by boat, we also did a bus tour and saw this site, it reminded me of a typical city, but really historic, still beautifully designed buildings pretty robust for them being so old, but still",
          "The Castillo de San Carlos de la Cabana is a formidable fortress guarding the city of Havana. It is strategically located on a ridge at the entrance to the port of Havana. It is the largest Spanish colonial fortress in the Americas.",
          "I wish I had read more from TripAdvisor before heading to Cuba. I was brought to the fortress to see the 9pm ceremony which was one of the activity included in my guided 9 days Cuba program. Due to some reason, we were only brought there in a rush and had to pay 8CUC just to",
          "Same as ..old havana city... place to be walking around in a middle of Spain build on the time of colonization ...",
          "This is a great park to walk around the old remnants of the fort of the entrance to Havana inner harbour. There is a cigar shop inside and a few vendor stalls selling drinks and sweets. Great views and free.",
          "Great place to visit and to be part of the history, awesome view and popular place for tourist, it's been a while since I've been in that kind of historical place and liked it a lot, in the evening around 8,9pm (not sure exactly) they're shooting canon which you can participate",
          "This is a very historical attraction, living in Cuba I always heard el Ca\u00f1onazo de las 9 from my house but never had the chance to go until now that I went for a family visit and we went there. This is a must see attraction.",
          "A must see, at night they do the ceremony, at 9 the soldiers wearing costumes like the colonial period of time, shoot the cannon shot. Also have beatiful views of the city, you can buy souvenirs, visit the museum and eat in the restaurant, an important point is go early to visit",
          "The largest fort in the America's remains a very impressive sight today. It was probably overkill to build something so big in the late 1700's, but British forces had captured Cuba for a period, and the King of Spain wanted to make sure that it never happened again.The sheer",
          "La Cabana was totally worth the drive over from Old Havana. The fortress is stunningly beautiful; it's almost like walking in an old, walled section of a European city. There are great views of Havana across the bay. The exhibits are interesting, telling the history of the",
          "Fantastic view of Old Havana from this interesting place. Worth the visit over especially if you can make it over for sunset. Make for a magical photo opportunity :)",
          "You have no business in Havana if you haven't seen this. The original beginning of Havana. Beautiful architecture and full of history",
          "Many people will tell you to go to the \"Ceremony\" a reenactment of the closing of the gates in period costumes but don't wait until evening to arrive. There is lots to see and do and locals line up very early to be closest to the cannon to see it shot off. Best location to view",
          "I attended the Cano\u00f1azo ceremony that takes place every night at 9:00PM. The fort is filled with history and the ceremony was both extremely interesting and educational. By attending, I learned a lot about the history of Havana and the ceremony itself. If you are able to",
          "Visited with a private tour guide who recommended that we didn't pay the entrance fee as he stated that there was not a lot to see unless we came back for the 9pm ceremony. Beautiful architecture and views over the city, took lots of photos before visiting the city.",
          "In 1763 an 11 year project began which made San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a the largest and most expensive fortress that Spain had built in the Americas. It is 700 metres long and 250 wide, occupying the entire hill of La Caba\u00f1a, above the Castillo del Morro. Its commanding position",
          "Take one of the old convertibles over to the fort and enjoy the walk and views of old Havana. There is also a display of aircraft etc from the revolution",
          "I am really disappointed about going here. It is a really huge fort, but every single room is locked. You cannot really enter any room other than the small chapel. The entrance fee is 6 CUC, which I think its not worth paying unless you are attending the CANNON CEREMONY which is",
          "This huge fort gives you an idea of how important Havana was in colonial times. Engage a guide, the descriptions of the history of the fort in various periods were very interesting. We took the ferry from old Havana and walked up in the late morning. The views of the city",
          "The castle itself is wonderful, and there are fabulous views of Havana, we stayed for the nine cannon ceremony which occurs at 9 pm every day , this was really interesting and very enjoyable. There is a Che Guevara museum on site which is really interesting and very informative.",
          "This event is not to be missed for two reasons: (1) the wonderful selection of souvenirs sold, and (2) the nighttime canon ceremony itself, which concludes with a BLAST (literally) at EXACTLY 9 p.m. Not to be missed!",
          "This 18th-century fortress, the third-largest in the Americas, is located along the entrance to Havana harbor. It's a very picturesque place to enjoy views of Old Havana, located below on the opposite shore. This is a magnificent fortress, steeped in history and a great place",
          "Interesting history, great views but if you don't get here early (7:30 pm ) for the 9:00 pm firing you will not be able to get close enough to the canon see to the actual firing. Lots of pomp and circumstance leading up to firing including period costumes, and chants which you",
          "A really good night out locals selling souvenirs plenty of pomp marching band and firing of cannon go well worth it",
          "We went in the evening to see the cannon ceremony. The trip across Havana Harbor is worth it just for the that. The fort itself is fascinating and well worth wondering around. We did not make it over to Castle de Los Tres Reyes del Morro. Next time I would allow more time to",
          "I've seen a gazillon cannons, but never one go off! At 9pm every night they fire the canon and have been doing so every day since the fort was built some ~500 years ago. How cool is that? It was done back in the day to let everyone know they were closing the drawbridge and",
          "If you are a lover of history and historic sites, the Castillo is a must during your visit to La Habana. Of the New World Spanish forts I've seen in St. Augustine, FL; San Juan, PR; and Cartagena, Colombia, the Castillo is only surpassed by El Morro in San Juan. Impressive,",
          "This was great! We managed to avoid the crowds at Morro and pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. Depending on how much walking you want to do, you can spend about 1-2hrs here. We got a great view of Havana and the ocean. We started around 10am as it started getting",
          "Go into the Fort after visiting the cigar factory and watching them hand roll cigars. Climb the outer wall and see the magnificent views of Havanna. The Fort itself is in very good shape and interesting to walk around. They also have some small restaurants there.",
          "Better in comparison to el morro. At least there are alot more exhibits in English. What i thought was really insightful was the house where Che Guevara stayed for a short while and worked. The history and write ups about him gave us a glimpse and idea what made him the man",
          "Nice place to overlook Havana and also take in the cannon ceremony.. I definitely recommend it if you are in Havana Cuba.",
          "This amazing castle with a view is also a fortress built to protect the harbor and the city of Havana...Old cannons overlook the city and still have the feeling of protecting...Take time to walk to several view points to see across the water at this beautiful cities sky line and",
          "This fort is known for two things. First, there are great skyline views of Havana. Second, every night, they re-enact the closing of the city by firing a cannon at precisely 9pm. It's worth seeing. Beware, the fake canon is surprisingly loud. There is a small pizza stand",
          "I thought the 9 o'clock firing of the cannon was amazing. The whole ceremony leading up to the firing is really cool. There is also good shopping there too!",
          "This is a very large well restored fort on a point across from downtown with a view of the entire waterfront, the Malecon.",
          "Great appreciation for age and history of Havana when visiting this beautiful site at the entrance to Havana Harbour. The cannon firing ceremony is a great experience on a moonlit night but the daytime views are spectacular.",
          "The view of Havana from the Castillo is amazing. There's a lot of history that is not discussed given the political landscape but it is definitely worth seeing and the history shared is interesting.",
          "Entrance is around 8 cuc. Go around 7:30 pm, explore the historical military museum, take pictures, walk around the gift shops vendors, admire the magnificent architecture and then stay for the show, The show is based on the history behind the firing of the cannon, where there",
          "The castle was built overlooking the town of Havana and as a result has magnificent views along the river and out to sea. In days gone by it was the security against attack but now is a monument to those bygone times. Thde views from the walls are magnificent and the Havana",
          "There is a bus that leaves central park and goes to playa Santa maria.it's first stop is here.round trip costs 5cuc and runs every 30-40 mins.it runs on time and us reliable.transtur is the company.great spot to visit.loads of history and can even head out to the beach before or",
          "Wonderful views. Epic history. Great place to spend a few hours while in Havana. Follow the road past the Christ Statue to the Casablanca ferry (1CUC pp) either going or coming from Old Havana.",
          "Firstly, if you walk toward the waterfront and take a taxi from there to the fortress (which is no more than 7 mins away) make sure you don't accept the first price given. $10.Cuc or under is the kind of price (still tourist rip off price) you are looking at. Go to the fortress",
          "We came here one evening to witness the cannonball ceremony as part of our people to people tour (Vemares/havanatur.cu). Lisandra, our guide, explained the history of the fort and its nightly ceremony. It added a nice perspective to the Colonial days of Cuba. The ceremony was",
          "Visit this fantastic pair of forts. they are in great condition and well worth the time. Plan to spend several hours enjoying the views",
          "The castle has a nice panorama of Havana especially at sunset. If you go there around 6 p.m. you can catch the sunset and enjoy your dinner at one of the restaurants nearby.As you enter in the castle by paying 8CUC entrance fee and if you want a guide assistance you have to pay",
          "It's 8 CUC admission and you want to get there around 8:15 p.m. to get a good spot for viewing. The soldiers attired in old-fashioned uniforms march through, the cannon is prepared and lit to go off at precisely 9 p.m. It is extremely loud, but it's a very cool and interesting",
          "Located across the harbor from Havana, it has great views of the skyline. This is the place you want to visit and photograph now before Marriott high rises, McDonald's golden arches and Starbucks signs ruin the view.",
          "We actually visited here during the annual book fair. The event makes interesting use of the various rooms in the fortress. The book fair is part cultural event and part county fair with rides to entertain kids. One shocking aspect was the amount of garbage visitors left behind",
          "We went to the Castillo during our last visit to Havana. There are canons, so much history and the architecture is beautiful. We really loved to see the skyline of Havana across the river. We didn't go to the museum but just walked around the grounds and enjoyed the beautiful",
          "Whilst many people seem to think that the cannon firing occurs at El Morro, it's actually this Castillo where the 9pm shooting happens. It's next to El Morro across the bay from the historic old area of Havana. This means you need to get an expensive cab (for some reason 25 CUC",
          "Went here as a stop off part of tour and was impressed with the amazing views. There is a lot of stairs up and down you have t climb to get to the top to get a decent photo. There is also a museum you can go around and pick up information.",
          "time has been great to this awesome location to remind you of the greatness the island used to be and will be soon",
          "Go in the evening to see the military parade, capped off by the firing of the canon. Get there early. Bathrooms were a challenge. We took taxi after dinner in Havana, had issues finding taxi back; they overcharged us because they knew we had to get back to the city. But",
          "There are many forts to see in Havana. This fort is one of the top forts to visit. The military museum inside is an added bonus. It is a quick walk from the Morro fort. Both can be easily visited together. The views of Havana Vieja are great.",
          "This I dare say is on all tour guides stops but on saying that the views are amazing and a great photo opportunity as you can see both old and new Havana. Cigar shop inside is extremely busy when buses are in, we waited until we went walkabout in Havana to purchase cigars.",
          "acces by taxi (5 CUC) or by ferry (2CUC) from south of the cruise ship terminal (good classic car watching from here). We never found any information on it but kept asking until we got on the right boat (pay on entry). Keep going up to Jesus then walk past the fort and the",
          "This is a must visit place. It has a lot of history and beautiful sightseeing. There is a famous ca\u00f1onazo at 9 pm.",
          "We came for the 9pm canonazo ceremony on a night that quickly turned rainy. This made the views and wandering the fort more challenging and meant we saw less. I do wish I could have seen it in daylight. There was a no re-entry policy on the tickets, so if you want to see the",
          "I did not do the tour, but only shopped at their souvenir shop at the encouragement of a guide. We found the best prices for rum, coffee and cigars here, far and away better than any resort shop. Totally legit as it is a government store. They take Visa if purchasing more",
          "Like many caribbean forts, it has cannons and a moat, interesting relics and antiquities. A beautiful view. Lots of diesel smog from the buses and cabs below. We paid three cuc each to get in with the promise of the use of the restroom. Once we were in, the other employees",
          "La Caba\u00f1a is close drive from Old Havana, on the other side of the Bay. Every night at 9 pm sharp the perform a colonial tradition to shoot an old cannon to announce the closing of the bay and the city gates in yonder times. Admission is 8 dollars (cuc) be an hour early or you",
          "It's worth the taxi ride back and forth to watch this nightly ritual cannon shot over the city-great night view over the city",

          "The show starts around 8:20 PM. The cannon gets fired at 9 PM. It is explains through entertainment when it was built and how long it took. The charge is 5 cucs.",
          "This fort is very large in well laid out with some very interesting architeture beggining with the tunnel going in.",
          "This is the biggest fort in Havana and maybe the nicest. I am particularly fond of forts, so I visited several in Cuba... and this was particularly. Apart from the \"fort part\", you also have stunning views from Havana. They also have several small museums/exhibits/shops so you",
          "This is a very extensive and historic fortress with great views of Old Havana. There are several exhibits to explore as well as a cigar shop, and the chapel is small but beautiful. A cannon is fired at 9 every night, signaling the time the doors to the walled city used to be",
          "Great old fort, well worth a visit at any time but evenings are good culminating with the canon being fired at 9pm. My suggestion is to reserve a table at the nearby El Canonazo Paladar restaurant for 7pm, have a leisurely dinner and then walk across to the Fort. You'll need to",
          "We were here in Cuba havana on a tour with a great guide stopped hereand took many pictures of the view",

          "This is an old castle that is best visited at night when there are shows. We got there at lunchtime when it was closed. There is a fab cigar and rum shop in the grounds which cost 2 pesos to walk round.",
          "The largest fort in the Caribian and well worth a visit. In this heat, it must have been dreadful to fight in full armor. Can also be visited at night - when it is cooler.",
          "Cool place with a shop with one of the most famous cigar rollers in the world. He rolled a 81 meter cigar for a world record and is working on a 90 meter on for Castro's 90th birthday. Walking around the fort was nice and peaceful.",
          "Our visit to the Castillo was in the evening to watch the daily firing of the cannon at 9pm. All personnel involved in the cannon firing are serving army officers dressed in traditional soldiers uniforms. Good views over to havana. Just a shame you have to run the gauntlet",
          "A very big Fort and has amazing views of the city. This fort was never captured and was Fidel Castro's head quarters at the end of the revolution. Interesting exhibition about Che Guevara but could have more to see. They fire a cannon here every night at 9pm.",
          "Although I wasn't able to stay until late that day to enjoy the ceremony of \"El Ca\u00f1onazo\" I had a very relaxin time on this part of Havana.",
          "This place offers a fantastic view of Havana, It cost just a couple of Peso to enter, as you enter there is a cigar shop and a display of the world record holding longest cigar, 18m or so. At an extra cost you can enter into the Castillo itself.",
          "Impressive fortress on the other side of the river in Havana. We specially liked the Che Guevara museum which is inside the fortress!",
          "Stopped here for a nice view of the town. And it is. Windy. The towns humidity and noise seems far away.",
          "There are some great reasons to visit; the views over central Havana, the clearly signposted directions and museum pieces (covering pre-revolution Havana), the cannon display and especially the Che Guevara museum. You'll need a taxi to get there, but if you walk out towards",
          "The \"Ca\u00f1onazo de las nueve \"ceremony is very interesting,this tradition began in the XVIII century,when the old Havana was surrounded by a wall,the canon was fired when the gates were opened and closed, at 6;00 am and at 9;00 pm;this tradition has been kept ,but only the 9;00 pm",
          "We did not tour inside this imposing fortress but checked the ramparts. There is a shop on the grounds which one can purchase those fine Cuban cigars. San Carlos de la Cabana was built to replace the less defensible El Morro castle after the British had captured it in 1762",
          "Do go in the evening- there is a nightly spectacle also popular with locals. Fantastic views.The procession is quite slow but worth waiting for the canon to be fired! Then head to a nearby restaurant for a late dinner.",
          "We went to see the sunset and the Ca\u00f1onazo Festival. The sunset is beautiful and we can see the whole Havana. There is some museums to visit and the Ca\u00f1onazo Festival is interesting to see.",
          "There are great views of Havana from here and the castle is worth a wander around. We went for the canon display at 9pm. Before the canon is fired (they only fire one), there is a historical performance that starts around 8.15-8.30, which is mostly people marching around in",
          "Went around 8.30 pm and great views of Havana. Busy place as people want to see the canon being fired at 9pm. Great anticipation with the pageant of soldiers preparing the canon.",
          "We visited the fortress just a little late for sunset, but it was still worth it. I'd really like to go back to see it. The views of Habana Bay, the harbour and the city are unmatched. The tour around the fortress is also very recomended, our guide was patient and nice and she",
          "This is a big fort with open ramps up the walls and a surprisingly laissez-faire approach to health and safety. Bring walking shoes and make sure you are careful where you walk as I can't believe children or adults haven't fallen over the sides. If you want cigars and rum",
          "This is a great place to take in the view and the Fort itself is very impressive with the worlds longest Cigar at several stages having been rolled next to the fort means there is plenty to see and do. There was a lot more to see and do than we actually did as this was",
          "The House of Ch\u00e9, La Caba\u00f1a,was a interesting place to go!Learning a little bit more about the cuban history and revolution and Ch\u00e9",
          "Just loved it. There are different spots where you can take a perfect shot of the city. You should arrive in the afternoon to explore the place and have a moment to relax and watch the sunset.",

          "Get over to the other side of the water to look back on Havana from the castle. If you have not seen a 17th fortification this is great example of one. Cheap to get into and a great cigar collection with the words longest in it.",
          "On the very same site as the fortress are some of the remains of the U2 former CIA plane piloted by Maj. Rudolf Anderson while doing surveillance for the United States Air Force that would reveal the presence of missiles on the island of Cuba. Major Anderson was the only",
          "This is the largest fortress in Latin America, dating from the 18th century. Beautiful, intact stone walls surround the installation. There are two drawbridges (now nonfunctioning) and thus two motes. The grounds are well-kept and each night you may observe the canon",
          "this is a huge castle, with lots of pits and caves. all the days at 9pm you can see the fire of a cannon to the harbor.",
          "Together with El Morro, this fortress makes Havana's 18th cent defensive complex. It's built very close to El Morro, over the place from where the Brits shot their cannons against the city. There's an open air museum, with war airplanes and missiles displayed. The views of",
          "This imposing 18th century Spanish fortress is very clearly visible from across the water from old Havana, however, very few tourist make the journey across to see it. It is well worth it though for the impressive views it commands, as well as a display of 1962 full size",
          "I found myself immersed in the view from the walls of this impressive fortification. Not rushed as private tour. Well restaored and maintained. Nice variety of shops.",
          "Not a prime destination but it did prove to be a great one! A very raw stronghold, filled with history.",
          "The tour began with a visit to the cigar shop and watching them being cut and rolled. Then off to explore the fort. Seemed as many of the shops were closed and a visit to the bathroom was unsuccessful as we were told we could not use, even with CUC's in our hand. The view of",
          "Quiet a good place to visit, huge earthworks, ramparts, many mysterious storage areas and small museums within its walls. Staff, however, generally seem less than interested in exhibiting any enthusiasm. Went into one of the bars and asked for a couple of cocktails as a list was",
          "I read about the cannon firing at night being a bit lame, so I thought I'd go during the afternoon instead. I had a taxi take me first to Morro then I walked over to Cabana which is about 10 minutes in the strong sun. (no shade) By the time I walked all over Cabana (which was",
          "It's nice place to get out and stretch your legs. There is a beautiful panoramic view of Havana. Every night, for decades, one of the cannons is shot off at exactly 9pm. It's a tradition. They have many cannons from the 1770's. There is an army barracks here. Che Guevara",
          "Take this in along with El Morro on the same afternoon. Worth planning to be there for the cannon firing ceremony at 9pm each evening. Get the boat across and then a taxi-bike up to the two forts, starting with El Morro and ending with the Castillo",
          "We followed the guidebook's advice in visiting this biggest fort in Latin America on very hot day. We hired a lovely guide, Beatriz, whose historical knowledge was very good, and who is working very hard on improving her English - already very good. She is very enthusiastic.",
          "We went over to the fort in the evening to watch the canon ceremony. It was about the only thing in Cuba that started on time! You need to get there early to get a good space to watch. The ceremony was interesting (ish), but quite drawn out for just shooting a canon. It was",
          "This is a great place to visit for the 9pm nightly ceremony. It was very entertaining and allowed great views over Havana Bay. There are lots of stalls in the courtyard selling the usual local souvenirs. Be prepared to jump when they ignite the cannon!",
          "From the upper wall of the fort, there are nice views across the bay of Havana. Exploring the wall containing multiple cannons, walking past the barrack doors and admiring the small chapel, all make visiting this 18th century fort worthwhile.",
          "You can't miss the ceremony every day at 9:00 pm in the Caba\u00f1a fortress... tension and expectation and a band of soldiers of the Spanish colony announcing the closing of the doors of Havana... everything beautiful, the view, the tradition, the place and suddenly BOMM! the cannon",
          "This is not my idea of a 17th century fort. True the fortifications are in good nick but the area outside on the approach from the tunnel and inside is more akin to a fairground than an important historical site (can this truly be a UNESCO world heritage site?). The inside is",
          ".\u2026\u2026 every night at 21.00. A big performance around a one off bang. Nothing special. For the best views get a place in the square below rather than being too close to the cannon.",
          "perched on the headland the other side of the bay from the town you get stuninng views of Havana from here, we didn't go inside as we didn't have time but its quite a large fort with plenty to see, daily they fire a canon still.",
          "The architecture of the castle is impressive. It is very sad that it is in so poor condition, with litter everywhere. It seems like the government would spend some money here to restore this place. Fabulous views of the city and harbor The chapel is plain, but don't miss it.",
          "Similarly to El Morro, this castle has magnificient architecture when looked at from the outside, however it's a disappointment once you enter - it's in a bad condition, littered, the exhibitios are poor and there was nobody to tell it's story. It might have been an interesting",
          "Just a few trash cans would improve this impressive structure, but without them it's pretty messy with lots of trash scattered around. Some renovation is needed. However, it is worth the effort and should not be missed. Great vantage point of the harbor and city.",

          "Admission is CUC $6 at the time of our travel. We visited during the daytime so we did not catch the cannon ceremony that held every night at 9pm. The views are great but unfortunately all the shops, cafes and restaurants are closed over the New Year holiday. Only a couple of",

          "Unfortunately, I was not around at 9pm to witness the firing of the cannon. Before getting a taxi back to Havana, I did pop down to the wonderful La Divina Pastora, to take in the view, and to enjoy a cold drink. There were a lot of tourist stalls setting up in the Cabana in",

          "While the exhibits at the fort are fairly well done - beware of the 9pm canon firing ceremony! The ceremony should only be of moderate interest as it involves perhaps a total of 15 costumed re-enactors with one running around with a flaming torch and after twenty minutes of",
          "Stopped here after the beach to check it out. Walked in all the way in to the 2nd gate and then were told to go back the main gate to get a ticket that cost $5, it really cost $7 each. Signs would help here. Once inside all the exhibition halls were closed. We asked and were",
          "This is a daily ceremony that seemed to be visited by mostly locals, very few tourists on the night we went and I believe they get in for free - you pay 8 pesos each. Ensure you purchase your entry tickets before you cross the bridge into the fortress or you will be turned back.",
          "At 9pm they fire a blank round from an old cannon, out across the entrance to the harbour. There are actors dressed in 18/19th century military uniforms who are part of the 'show', which starts around 30 minutes earlier. Best view is from the roof of the barracks building, which",
          "We only managed a visit as part of a tour there in the evening to see or rather hear the canon firing at 9pm. We had time to have a quick glance at the museum display but not enough really. The pageantry of the cannon ceremony was worth the visit and the views across the harbour",
          "Interesting place to stop on your way into Havana. This historical sight is just on the edge of the city on top of a hill above the city so it gives you a wonderful view of Havana. You can walk the outer wall for free but there is a paid area inside. There are lots of people",
          "Extensive and charming castle but not a great deal going on. Good thing they were rehearsing the cannon ceremony because all the ground level rooms were closed. Looked like they were rebuilding the expositions in there. Great views of El Morro and Havana though!",
          "This is another interesting piece of Cuban history and architecture. It is located directly across the harbour from Havana. Great panoramic photo ops of Havana.",
          "Really good place to visit. We went mid afternoon and we appeared to be the only people there! We had our own guide and she was definitely worth the cost as she gave us so much more information that we would have known if we had just walked around by ourselves. We got there by",
          "We were there on our own and that was nice, ended up back there on a city tour, but they don't go inside the fort, however we had missed the worlds longest cigar the first time so we got to see that. We didn't know about the 9 pm ceremony or I think I would have timed our visit",
          "We visited this site as we entered Havana. It is a very large old fort and involves some walking which we enjoyed after a bus ride from Cienfuegos. The view of Old Havana and the Malecon is lovely. And you must see the world's longest cigar!",
          "Everynight (at 9.00) there is a ceremony firing the gun across the harbour which is a major local event. However, we got there in time to see it and only had a short time to look round the associated museums which was a mistake - much better to get there early in the evening and",
          "We stopped here briefly on our Havana tour. The fort was nicely preserved although it was odd we couldn't go certain areas to get photos. The cigar store cool with the world's longest cigar in the display. Definitely worth a quick stop.",
          "Nice place to visit specially at night to presence the 9:00 pm show called El ca\u00f1onaso, every night they fire a cannon a traditions since the Spanish colonization",
          "Lovely views ..we visited this location as part of the coach tour of the city ..' I did not enjoy the steep cimb to finally see the views ..Others did not seem to mind.",
          "We visited the fort in the evening to see the 9pm firing of the canon. That was a great show, with period dress and it makes a loud bang!! It was good to look round the fort and see some of the history. There is also great views across the rest of Havana which was lovely to see",
          "We went to see the ceremonial firing of the cannon which is held every evening at 9pm. The noise is a surprise even though expected and the period dress and members of the military that carry it out are something to behold. Well worth seeing!",
          "Can't remember the name, canonazo?, of the restaurant located at the fort, but live traditional cuban music, excellent food and atmosphere.",
          "And lots of history! Nice things to see and great views. Beware of the 'helpful' assistants who might try and extort money from you! It's fairly typical given the favourable rate of the cuc but be sure not to have too much cash available on you!",
          "The Castillo is a beautiful place but a lot of people miss the cigar shop, where the longest cigar in the world is on display. Meet the unassuming guy who made that cigar.",
          "We took great pictures from this place and went to see sunset and the 9pm activity, which to me should be part of a trip to Havana, at least the first time.",
          "The castillo is great, lots of history. The viess of havana are superb. The canons that ard housed here were in great condition. Lots of walking and the tunnels ard a must whdn visiting.",
          "Every evening at 9 p.m. military exhibition with soldiers in period uniforms is concluded with the firing of a cannon. This display dates back to colonial times, signaling the closing of the gates in the city wall according wikipedia. Arrive early, and you can tour several",
          "Interesting to visit, lot of history and architecture, you can spend a whole afternoon walking through it.",
          "It\u00b4s the space where a bit shot of a cannon is hit at 9PM daily. Just visit the place but do not waste your time waiting for the shot.",
          "Be here at 9 pm ANY night for the traditional guard firing of the cannon. Arrive early for food, wine & souvenirs. Best view is from the cordoned off area above the plaza. (Don't pay extra for seating, it is not the best view anyway). This fuerta is real and a treat.",
          "Went there at around 8pm for the cannon ceremony and it wasn't disappointing! Getting there is easy by taxi, only 8 CUC from Old Havana, you also have to pay a small fee to enter but nothing too expensive. Once inside the fortress, you're back into time with the cannons, the",
          "The fort (which overlooks Havana) has been renovated and contains a lot of tourist stall, but the most interesting and entertaining event is the nightly 9 pm firing of the cannon. With all the pomp and ceremony and traditional dress, it's worth arriving slightly early to get a",
          "A lovely place to visit, calm after the hustle and bustle of Havana. The fortress is an amazing structure, built on both sides of the river entrance to Havana. I sadly didn't get to see the cannon firing ceremony, but it occurs every evening around 8 or 9 pm and is easily",
          "The cannon ceremony takes place every evening at Castillo de San Carlos de la Cabana and is performed by young military men; the men who performed the evening we attended were Venezuelan soldiers. The canonazo ceremony is a tradition started in the 17th century. A cannon would",
          "Take the hop on off bus route 2 to the castle (5 Euro return). We went in the afternoon but most of the smaller rooms within the complex were closed, except for the church! Beware! Keep your entrance ticket. we experience some hassle from attendants, being asked for our ticket,",
          "We went to the 9:00 PM cannon firing. We were running a little late and we planned on coming back so we did not see as much as we should have. However the period actors were great and very friendly. I feel the cannon firing was not historically accurate. The period actors walked",
          "I visited the fortress during the 2015 Habana Bienal. There were excelent expositions of contemporary cubn art. Besides this it has the best vista on Habana.",
          "Forteleza de San Carlos de la Cabana rests along the river across from Old Havana, offering a wonderful wide perspective of the city. The panoramic views, along with its history, are the best part of this attraction and warrant a visit. These points earned my 4 star review.",
          "This castle is located across Old Havana and offers great views over the port and the old city. It isn't a significant detour (5-10 min) and the castle site actually has several monuments and areas to visit. The fortress is open to street vendors so expect some people to push",
          "The entrance to Havana from the sea is guarded on both sides by a series of Forts. This particular fort is a Star Fort name from its star shaped construction. These forts were very hard to take in their larger forms as they could bring more firepower down on the enemy.",
          "Worth spending some time walking around the old spanish fortress. The view of the city is superb and you can enjoy food & drinks.",
          "Our group was in Havana for the Havana Art Biennal and the Castillo was the perfect venue. The whole place was very festive and easy to navigate the difference art exhibits. Also we ate at one of the restaurants there and the food was awesome. You can get some great camera shots",
          "In was used for decades till recently as a Prison for political prisoners and Military detention for soldiers . Not to mention the Fire Squad that used to take place in its surrounding, where 1000 of Cubans were terminated in their life yelling \"Viva Cristo Rey\".",
          "We did go up twice to see Castillo de San Carlos, once around noon and then back in the evening. If you are a history buff (or military), a daytime visit is in order. The history of the Castllio is fascinating. It must have been an absolute monumental task to haul the material.",
          "It is a ceremony that goes back over 400 years! The inhabitants of the fortress are dressed in period costumes , carry lanterns and the view of Havana is beautiful from across the bay.",
          "Castillo de San Carlos was an interesting place to visit. The Che section is interesting and well put together, as is the section on arms. The canon ceremony at night is an awesome and unique experience. The paella at the restaurant on site is surprisingly good and cheap. The",
          "Only saw this place from the outside and walked around the grounds. It's renovated not too long ago and there is a beautiful bridge connecting the Castillo to the buildings next to it.",
          "The best way to get there is taking the ferry from Havana Vieja to Casablanca. It takes only some minutes to get to the other side. Then you walk up the hill and you arrive directly in front of the statue of Christos. Another walk of 10-15 minutes brings you to the main entrance",
          "Whilst we had already viewed the firing of the canon from the rooftop of a Paladar where we dined, we also wanted to witness the ceremony from this location. There were few tourists (non-Cuban) but there were tons of locals and the atmosphere was festive. It is conducted in",
          "A strategically located and well preserved fort with good views of the city. The views alone are worth visiting. Lots of historical information around the fort. At the front of the fort are remnants from the Cuban missile crisis.",
          "This historic fort, was build to defend from pirates and corsairs, at night a cannon is fired, dont forget to visit the triada cigar factory while you visit.",
          "Lots of information about Cuba History, some nice shows about \"El Che\". There's a daily ceremony to fire cannons (not real cannons) at 9PM, called \"ca\u00f1onazo. The city view from there is also a plus.",
          "6 CUC each to get in during the day. Not much to see. Had to pay 12 cuc to taxi there from Miramar. While there the idea was to also visit Morro Castle, but at 6 CUC each extra for that and another 2 CUC each to check out the lighthouse I thought it would be a waste so didn't",
          "This 18th century architectural gem happens to be the largest fort built by Spanish colonialism in the Americas. An enticing view of the visit from its promontory!",
          "From the Havana side of the river it is a 5 CUC cab ride each way, plus 8 per person to enter. You can hear the cannon from anywhere in the city. Unless you've got a thing for colonial uniforms and marching in a line...there's an easier way to enjoy it from the other side of",
          "The castillo is huge and interesting, and the views of Havana and the bay are spectacular. You should not miss it. Lots of areas to walk in a park like setting. We had lunch in a lovely garden at a nearby restaurant - Hostal El Canonazo, delicious food and drinks, wonderful",
          "Either take the little ferry and walk up to the fort ( 15 min) or take a taxi through the tunnel ( 5 CUC). The entrance fee is 6 CUC. The fort is one of the largest in the Americas and takes while to walk around. We were here on a Saturday afternoon and there were perhaps 10",
          "This fortress is even larger than El Morro in San Juan PR. The major industry in Havana in the nineteenth century seems to have been the manufacture of cannons: hundreds of them are downtown, upended and use for street barricades, but the battlements here still have an",
          "Take the small ferry over from Old Havana to Casablanca and walk up the hill to the fort in about 15 minutes. This is a nice walk and takes you past the huge Christ statue as well as Che's house and remnants of the Cuban Missile crisis. No need to pay to go in as you can see all",
          "The Fort is quite large so wear comfortable shoes. It guarded the entrance to the harbor and as such gives a wonderful view of the old city of Havana on the other side of the bay. It pays to have explored the old city before you visit the Fort because then it will be easy for",
          "Every night they do a whole production to shoot off a cannon at 9pm to commemorate when the city was closed in by a wall and the cannon would shoot to signify that the doors were closing for the night. A definite must see - more crowded on weekends when many of the locals come",
          "It's worth popping over to the big fortress (when the taxi driver asks you 'which' one you want just tell him the 'Castillo grande'!) so you can look over to Havana. There are a couple of bars within the fortress where you can buy drinks and small, basic snacks too, so it's ok",
          "This old fortress was part of Havana defence against pirates and unfriendly naval powers. Today it gives you a magnificent view of Malecon, Havana Vieja and the harbor.",
          "Well worth the bus trip through the tunnel and lots of refreshments. Cigars made and sold at this location along with art works;",
          "WHY WORTH? This fortress complex is one of the biggest in the Americas, and was built to improve the defense of the city between 1763-1774. We have visited the castillo during the day, and there was literally just the 2 of us. Beautiful views to Havana and the Malec\u00f3n, romantic",
          "From Cabana you can see Havana shining bright during the sunset. Going there is worth spending a bit of time for relax and just enjoy the view.",
          "I have a great family time in the San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a Fortress. They are re-enacting a over 400 years old ceremony that was originally used as a closing of the Havana city walls in the Spanish times. The ceremony starts around 8:30 pm and ends right at 9:00 pm. I recommend",
          "We were there in the evening when they fires the cannon. The kids thought it was superb. It was a bit ceremonies with military soldiers in old uniforms before they let loose cannons. Worth a visit in the evening.",
          "Went for the Canonazo, a nightly ceremony of firing a canon to announce the closing of the city gates. Soldiers dressed in period uniforms conduct the ceremony. If you go get there early and get a position on the wall to watch or it's just kind of a blur and mob of people. Lots",
          "It is beautiful place to take pictures, and you can appreciate Habana vieja from another perspective but there's not much to do there and it is far away. The show of Ca\u00f1onazos is fun but short. The whole experience disappointing.",
          "This is a huge castle built to defend the entrance to Havana harbour, and shows the classic Spanish design for such fortifications.",
          "Really enjoyed the Ca\u00f1onazo and historical reenactment of the cannon shooting ceremony. Spend the additional 2 pesos to enjoy the view sitting down with a complimentary mojito.",
          "We went to the canon ceremony which takes place every night at 9pm, which many of the guidebooks recommend. In truth the ceremony was a bit boring with a long slow build up and then the canon is fired and its over after 5 seconds. I'm surprised by how popular this event is,",
          "After Havana were return to Spanish dominion by the British in 1763, one of the priorities was fortifier the hill where this fortress stands today and which was the place that decided the Spanish defeat a year before, taken in account its privileged position. During eleven years",
          "We were very luck to be upgraded to the Hotel San Felipe located on this square, there is a massive 15th century convent on this square , which is a must see as well as all the priceless church artifacts of solid gold and silver 500 years old. You are allowed to go up into the",
          "We came in the off-season - no one here except staff. Huge grounds, great views of the city. Allow at least an hour and be prepared for some walking. A few exhibits of armour, weaponry. Good access from here to the nearby Christ statue and Casa Blanca ferry.",
          "If you are in Havana visit it. Every night at 9 there is the canon ceremony, the castle is beautiful and you have a great view of Havana!",
          "Besides the very bureaucratic entrance tickets system (at the moment we were there, the electricity did not worked, and we had to wait for more than half an hour..), this fortress is beautiful. It is big, you can have a stroll around, and we saw the fantastic view with sunset.",
          "If you are allergic to walking and exercise then you may not want to explore here, but if that does not hinder you, then this is the place to tour. Great views of Havana, great history lesson and more.",
          "After seeing a lot of castles and fortresses in Europe, nothing special here... But the view on Havana is wonderful, you can see Old Havan, Parque Central and Vedado with the Malecon!",
          "Its better if you visit this place during night time but even if you are here during the afternoon it provides a great outlook of the old and new city.",
          "What is not to be missed here is the cerimony of the \"ca\u00f1onazo\", that remembers the spanish Havana, when there was a canon shot to advise the people that the gates of the Havana wall was about to close and until the next morning no one could get in or get out. It worth the visit",
          "Probably quite boring during the day, all you get is great views of the Habana Vieja and the Morro fort. In the evening you can watch the special ceremony called el canonazo which is a little bit funny, but interesting anyway (admission fee 8CUC). When the ceremony is over, you",
          "Went during the day after visiting El Morro next door. Certainly no stalls and characters dressed up when we were there, perhaps that all kicks off at night? It was quite dead, a bit dull and nothing had any information to go with it. We also thought it was cheeky that they want",
          "This attraction is not to be missed on a visit to Havana. This fort was built to protect the mouth of Havana harbor in its day. Much of the armament remains. It is best to first visit the city and become familiar with its hotels and plazas, as there is a point on the harbor",
          "Probably the one place in Havana where one can visit and learn about the many critical events that shaped Cuba and Havana",
          "I have already been a few times in Havana, and a visit to the La Caba\u00f1a is always on the program. If it is for the \"ca\u00f1onasso\", a ceremony held at 9pm to symbolise the closure of the portals of the ring wall of Old Havana during ancient times, or just to have a splendid view",
          "Being on this wall, facing the sea on a sunny afternoon in Havana. Looking the Old Havana that has not changed much since its creation, may result in a similar to that of a time travel experience. At the time you can feel the moment and emotion when this impressive building",
          "My husband and I visit many forts and fortresses in North America and Europe. This one was impressive to look at, and the views were spectacular, but a lack of interpreters took something away from our enjoyment of the place. There was limited information posted and poor",
          "Very enjoyable strolling around this huge fort. The view over Habana Vieja is magnificent. A little short on information regarding history so get a guidebook or guide.",
          "Wonderful old castle at the entrance to Havana harbour. Did this as part of our private car tour. We did not go inside as there did not appear to be any entrance. Some vendors hawking their wears but we're not pushy in any way. Good start to a Havana tour.",
          "Visited the castle as part of a car tour of Havana. The castle on a nice day had some great views across the bay to Havana. It can get very busy during the day but it is well worth taking a stroll around. There is a caf\u00e9/bar where you can buy drinks from.",
          "This is the place to spend an evening. The view of sun setting over Havana was wonderful and the place was really quiet at that time, the silence letting us savor the sight. We had a pleasant walk between its walls discovering a pretty little garden.",
          "Of course you have to visit as many of the forts and castles as you can and this is a good starting point.",
          "This lovely and sprawling old fort is fantastic for an evening exploration. It gets a little more expensive at 6pm so eat beforehand, arrive just before 6, wander round and enjoy the spectacular views of the sun setting over Havana as music drifts across the water, then explore",
          "The largest stone fort in the western hemisphere, La Cabana provides an excellent view of Havana, the bay, and the ocean, as well as Morro Castle.",
          "Wow...that place was amazing, we went there to watch the sunset, also to see the canones celebration that happens everyday at 9pm for 200 years. Also bring some extra money cuz they sell lot of souvenirs inside and prices are much better than at calle obispo or plaza de las",
          "Each night the Cuban army assigned at La Cabana provides the memorable pageantry of the lighting of the 9:00 PM cannon. Hundreds gather for this event, including Cuban military dressed in period uniforms from the 18th century. With the city in the background across the harbor",
          "Lovely to sit on walls and people watch. Nice photo location. Great place for sandwich eating!! Worth an hour or so.",
          "If you really wanna to see this place in special atmosphere then take a evening tour with dinner, when you can see the canon shot.",
          "My disappointment for arriving too early was totally forgotten by the beautiful sunset but especially by the very professional shotgun ceremony at 9pm. Actors characterized as 18th (?) century guards spent circa of \u00bd hour in an interesting ceremony culminating on an incredible",
          "While walking along the Malecon during the day, this fortress is very impressive and quite beautiful to admire. Every night a cannon shot rumbles at 9pm as the so-called \"El Ca\u00f1onazo de las 9\", a custom kept from colonial times, signaling the closure of the city wall doors.",
          "Took the ferry Casablanca & walked to the statue of Jesus, then round to the fort. It's 6CUC to get in during the day, 9 at night, but other than nice views of the harbour (which you can see from the statue for free) there isn't much to see. All the museums were closed. So I",

          "We came to see the canon firing ceremony at San Carlos del la Cabana citadel and were a bit disappointed- it seems that this is a ceremony for tourists, performed by amateurs (not soldiers). The citadel seems impressive, but it's still not properly organized to show exhibits.",

          "We spent several hours exploring this fortress. There were very few tourists, as it's not offered on most tours, and we had some great views of the harbor and Old Havana across the harbor. It is being restored so a few parts were not accessible.",
          "This fortress sure wasn't designed in 18th century to be a tourist sight. Nice walk trough the big fort but not much to see. It least during the day time. Every evening the old canon is fired, also the entrance fee is more expensive. Of course it is a propaganda museum but in",
          "We, a family with two young boys, understood that this fort is the place to be, due to its views on Havanna Vieja and the well-preserve fort. It was a bit of a disappointment. Two of the three musea were closed. And the one wich was open was another propaganda museum for the",

          "Lots of tourists ask about what to do with kids in Havana @ night and really the cannon shot from La Cabana is very enjoyable, especially on dark nights. If you can time it so you get there aout 8pm there's lots of lovely little stalls and cafes etc to browse around while you",

          "Well worth the trip. Suggest you take 2hrs to look around before the canon goes off at 8:40pm. BYO ear plugs if a loud bang would worry you.",
          "Go there on your own and avoid the tour buses and you can enjoy the place pretty much to yourself. The inside of the fort is filled with modern art which takes away from the history of the place.",

        "wiki": "El Cementerio de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, also called La Necr\u00f3polis de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, was founded in 1876 in the Vedado neighbourhood of Havana, Cuba to replace the Espada Cemetery in the Barrio de San L\u00e1zaro.  Named for Christopher Columbus, the cemetery is noted for its many elaborately sculpted memorials. It is estimated the cemetery has more than 500 major mausoleums. Before the Espada Cemetery and the Colon Cemetery were built, interments took place in crypts at the various churches throughout Havana, for example, at the Havana Cathedral or the  Iglesia del Esp\u00edritu Santo in Havana Vieja.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Colon Cemetery is one of the most important cemeteries in the world and is generally held to be one of the most important in Latin America in historical and architectural terms, second only to La Recoleta in Buenos Aires. Prior to the opening of the Colon Cemetery, Havana's dead were laid to rest in the crypts of local churches and then, beginning in 1806, at Havana's newly opened Espada Cemetery located in the Barrio de San Lazaro and near the cove of Juan Guillen close to the San L\u00e1zaro Leper Hospital and the Casa de Beneficencia. When locals realized there would be a need for a larger space for their community for the deceased (due to a cholera outbreak in 1868), planning began for the Colon Cemetery.The Col\u00f3n is a Catholic cemetery and has elaborate monuments, tombs and statues by 19th and 20th century artists. Plots were assigned according to social class, and soon became a means for patrician families to display their wealth and power with ever more elaborate tombs and mausoleums. The north main entrance is marked by a gateway decorated with biblical reliefs and topped by a marble sculpture by Jos\u00e9 Vilalta Saavedra: Faith, Hope and Charity. Some of the most important and elaborate tombs lie between the main gate and the Capilla Central. The Monumento a los Bomberos (Firemen\u2019s Monument) built by Spanish sculptor Agust\u00edn Querol and architect Julio M Zapata, commemorates the twenty eight firemen who died when a hardware shop in La Habana Vieja caught fire in 1890\n\nIn front of the main entrance, at the axes of the principal avenues Avenida Cristobal Col\u00f3n, Obispo Espada and Obispo Fray Jacinto, stands the Central Chapel modelled on Il Duomo in Florence is the octagonal Capilla Central (central chapel), the Capilla del Amor (Chapel of Love), built by Juan Pedro Bar\u00f3 for his wife Catalina Laza. On every side rectangular streets lead geometrically to the cemetery\u2019s 50,000 hectares. The area of the cemetery is defined by rank and social status of the dead with distinct areas: priests, soldiers, brotherhoods, the wealthy, the poor, infants, victims of epidemics, pagans and the condemned. The best preserved and grandest tombs stand on or near the central avenues and their axes.\nWith more than 800,000 graves and 1 million interments, space in the Colon Cemetery is currently at a premium and as such after three years remains are removed from their tombs, boxed and placed in a storage building.\nYet for all its elegance and grandeur the Colon Cemetery conceals as much as it displays. Empty tombs and desecrated family chapels disfigure the stately march of Cuban family memorials even in the most prominent of the avenues, and away from the central cross-streets are in ruin. Many of these are the tombs of exiled families, whose problems with caring for their dead have been complicated by residency outside of Cuba since the Revolution of 1959.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMar\u00eda Argelia Vizcaino writes: \"The first stone was placed on October 30, 1871 and before its extension completed in 1934, it had a capacity of\n504,458.22 square meters. Rectangular in shape as a Roman-Byzantine-style Roman camp, with sidewalks, streets and listed roads, facilitating access to the visitor, (which in republican times was provided with a free map). Enrique Mart\u00ednez y Mart\u00ednez tells us in \u00abCuba Arquitectura y Urbanismo\u00bb: \u201cIt was the most remarkable religious construction that was made in the city during the nineteenth century\u201d. \nThe square located on the central street between the chapel and the huge doorway was called Christopher Columbus, because it was planned to erect a\nmonument to the Discoverer next to the remains, which ironically never happened of the Cathedral of Havana, being the first bust\nerected throughout the continent (1828) and the only one that exists in the whole world with a beard. So the cemetery dedicated to the great\nAdmiral, full of famous sculptures lacks one by which he was given his name.\"\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe Cementerio Col\u00f3n measures 620 by 800 meters (122.5 acres). Designed by the Galician architect Calixto Arellano de Loira y Cardoso, a graduate of Madrid\u2019s Royal Academy of Arts of San Fernando, became the Col\u00f3n\u2019s first resident when he died and before his work was completed. It was built between 1871 and 1886, on former farm land. Laid out in a grid similar to El Vedado by numbered and lettered streets it becomes an urban microcosm of the city. \nThe cemetery is laid out parallel to the last stretch of the Almendares river and against the grid of El Vedado. It is on the north axis, thus its main streets are on the four cardinal points of the compass. Symbolized by a Greek cross, it represents the four directions of the earth and the spread of the gospel to all directions as well as the four platonic elements. We find Greek crosses against a yellow background along the perimeter fence enclosing the cemetery, as well as part of the design diagram of the cemetery, which employs several Greek crosses at different scales thus forming an architectural tapestry. The main avenues, Avenida Cristobal Col\u00f3n, Obispo Espada and Obispo Fray Jacinto, at six hundred by eight hundred meters, forms the first cross at the scale of the city (red cross-areal photo).\n\n\n== Interments ==\n\nThe Colon Cemetery has a monument to the firefighters who lost their lives in the great fire of May 17, 1890. \nAs baseball is a leading sport in Cuba, the cemetery has two monuments to baseball players from the Cuban League. The first was erected in 1942 and the second in 1951 for members of the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame.\nIn February 1898, the recovered bodies of sailors who died on the United States Navy battleship Maine were interred in the Colon Cemetery. In December 1899 the bodies were disinterred and brought back to the United States for burial at Arlington National Cemetery.Also buried here are three British Commonwealth servicemen who are commemorated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission; a Canadian Army officer of World War I, and a Royal Engineers officer and Royal Canadian Navy seaman of World War II. The remains of the casualties are located in the mausoleum of the Anglo-American Welfare Association, with the names inscribed on the central memorial which also forms the entrance to the underground ossuary.\n\n\n== Notable interments ==\nBeatriz Allende (1943\u20131977), Chilean socialist politician, revolutionary and surgeon\nSantiago \u00c1lvarez (1919\u20131998), filmmaker\nManuel Arteaga y Betancourt (1879\u20131963), Roman Catholic Cardinal\nAlberto Azoy (?\u20131952), baseball manager\nBeatriz Azurduy Palacios (1952\u20132003), filmmaker\nHubert de Blanck (1856\u20131932), composer\nWilliam Lee Brent (1931\u20132006), Black Panther Party member\nJos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca (1888\u20131942), world chess champion\nFederico Capdevila (1845\u20131898), officer of the Spanish army who in 1871 defended Cuban students of medicine in court\nAlejo Carpentier (1904\u20131980), writer and musicologist\nJuli\u00e1n Castillo (1880\u20131948), baseball player\nJuan Chab\u00e1s (1910\u20131954), author\nEduardo Chib\u00e1s (1907\u20131951), politician\nIbrahim Ferrer (1927\u20132005), singer\nCandelaria Figueredo (1852\u20131914), patriot in the Cuban struggle for independence from Spain\nCarlos Finlay (1833\u20131915), physician and researcher\nJos\u00e9 Miguel G\u00f3mez (1858\u20131921), president of Cuba\nM\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez (1836\u20131905), Dominican military hero\nRub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez (1919\u20132003), pianist\nNicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n (1902\u20131989), poet\nNicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n Landri\u00e1n (1938\u20132003), filmmaker and painter\nTom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea (1928\u20131996), filmmaker\nHarrison E.

          "The cemetery is very beautiful and great for photography. It is very large and there isn't a lot of shade so prepare. I think it was $5 CUC per person. It's very unique and should be on everyone's list. The ice cream store across the street was a nice treat after.",
          "Very interesting place to wander around and look at all the different memorials within its walls. The main entrance was a bit tricky for me to find when I was walking because I got my directions mixed up. I was there in the late afternoon and it was very quiet and serene. I",
          "Worth a visit huge area full of old family history on graves . Loads of tombs with damaged lids saw bones heaped up in one grave",
          "Cemetery was wonderful. We wanted to find if any family was buried there. If you gave them name and date of birth they would look it up.. no ability to do research ourselves.. like seeing all with our family names",
          "Absolutely beautiful cemetery with crypts, tombs and statues. Fascinating history, be sure to go with a guide.",
          "Wow, what an amazing places. It rivals the best cemeteries in world. Our guide covered all the details about the famous graves but I was amazing to just see the place and take photos. We were there for about 1 hour which seemed plenty of time",
          "We went here mostly because it was near where we were staying. It is a beautiful place, and the woman selling the tickets gave us some helpful advice about the areas that were most interesting. This visit also gave us an opportunity to pay our respects to the great Ibrahim",
          "As part of our journey in Cuba my friend and I visited this Cemetery. The Necropolis of Colon, is located in the Vedado, a section of Havana. Designed by renowned Spanish architect Calixto de Loira y Cardoso, the cemetery grounds were built over the course of nearly fifteen",

          "A huge and historic cemetery. We had a guide which was helpful, not sure what information is available if you don't have one. This gives you a pretty good idea of the wealth gap in old and present Cuba.",
          "This cemetary is a must see. It also helps to have a guide there is much history to be learned here. A great place to bring your camera.",
          "This place is huge. The history behind some of the people interred here is fascinating. There's even a grave where people say a miracle occurred and there were \"pilgrims\" coming to pray and bring flowers in the hope of a miracle. The cemetery is well kept and still used.",
          "Colon is the resting place for the Great and Good and Seriously Rich (and ordinary too) people who built Havana and Cuba. It's still \"alive\" as an operating cemetery. You can learn a lot of history here and \"meet\" some great Cubans. It helps to have a good guide to entertain you",
          "Visiting a cemetery isn't everybody's cup of tea, but I have visited Havana twice before and never took the time to see this cametery. It has history, unique monuments representing families with mega fortunes, and it has everyday families. When you pay the admission, they have",
          "If you have interest in visit cemeteries this is the right place to be. With the old, well preserve and big Columbus tomb (He is not there any more), the place has been well restored. There is a charge to go in.",
          "In comparison with most architectures that needed to repair and maintain in Havana, Christopher Columbus Cemetery is well kept and beautiful. There are lot of history, artworks and sculptures. Up ground tombs made with marble in different colors, one next to another. The large",
          "You can take the T3 hop on/off bus for 5CUC to the cemetery. One you enter through the gate, the ticket both isn\u2019t in the building but in a trailer to the left. To buy a map is 1 or 2 CUC but the nice ticket lady let us borrow one for free as long as we returned it. It\u2019s all in",
          "Some lady was insisting we pay her to walk around. We came by horse cart. No one speaks english so we had to leave",
          "The artwork in marble is so over the top sometimes that all you can do is stand there and stare. There is a man in charge of keeping track of who is where, a sort of registrar, who knows the place inside out. Worth speaking to him at the administration building at the start if",
          "The monuments were beautiful. our guide's name was Ruban and the driver was William. We did alot that day but well worth it . 95.cuc.",
          "Out on far west of Havana and although interesting would make a special visit to see this site,you can get off and catch the return bus after 30 mins but I felt I could see all I wanted from the bus",
          "We only viewed the cemetery as we passed around the perimeter in a vintage American car during our city tour. This is one of the largest cemeteries in the world and from our brief view certainly extended over a large area. The entrance is marked by an impressive triple arched",
          "Never thought a cemetery would be so beautiful and interesting. Worth it to take the tour. You won't be disappointed!",
          "This was such an incredibly interesting place to visit. You don't need to be a cemetery freak to enjoy this place. Make sure to go with a guide or you will miss out on some of the really interesting stories that accompany some of the grave sites.",
          "This place was amazing, and full of history and incredible tombs. Probably the most upkept area of the city, and the pride shown around how the cubans respect this place is amazing. The church onsite is beautiful, though it needs a lot of repair. If you have time, pay the",
          "To be upfront, we didn't actually go into the cemetery, we passed by the outside as part of our tour. There are separate tours in the cemetery and it looks very interesting.",
          "Beautifull necropolis of Havanna with great monuments and a rich history. Take your sunglasses with you because the sun on the white marble is killing your eyes.",
          "The guide in the cemetery was great. It was really interesting to learn about the history through the people buried here. There is not a lot of shade so be prepared for the sun.",
          "This was part of a Royal Caribbean excursion. Our guide was very knowledgable. The grounds are beautiful and well taken care of.",
          "More than a cemetery, it is a beautiful museum of sculptural art that is characterized by the silence that gives peace to the deceased who rest in this place. It is the largest cemeterium in Havana with more than 50 ectareas. It was built from 1871 to 1876 there you can",
          "This is worth a visit. Do remember this is a large working cemetery and not a proper a tourist attraction. We were give a guided tour of the church by a young lad who was training to be a historian. He gave us very interesting information about the Cemetery and guidance on",
          "My husband and I were touring Havana and passed by this beautiful cemetery. However, it was not one of our stops and we whizzed by. What we could see of the cemetery, was amazing. We will definitely come back to Havana and visit this historic place.",
          "A large , beautiful cemetery with a small church in the center. The monument to the firefighters is breathtaking. There are parts of the cemetery that have fallen to time and lack of attention.",
          "I love visiting the cemeteries around the world and this is a place to visit, if you are into graves and cemeteries. Absolutely beautiful headstones and marbel statues.",

          "Cemetery has thousands of unique memorials, headstones, etc. A 30-minute visit and stroll around is well worth your time. It is quite a unique cemetary.",
          "Took a tour of the cemetery and found it very neat to see the history and to see the customs in Cuba. From the fine architecture to the recycling of the cemetery plots. Very cool to visit.",
          "An impressive entry gate takes you onto a broad avenue, edged by the mausoleums of Havana's (and maybe Cuba's) wealthiest and oldest families, that ends at a fairly large chapel. Many of these ornate structures are suffering from lack of upkeep as its family fled to Miami after",
          "Incredibly large area built to service the needs of the city shortly after the founding in 1519. Individual mausoleums are majestic tributes to families. Christopher Columbus was buried there, and later in body was exhumed and transported to Spain. Ernest Hemminhway's bartender",
          "Wonderful craftsmanship on display in the graves and mausoleums. A lot of history is here and guides stories are fascinating. This is a huge place as worth a visit as any cemetery in New Orleans. Chapel here is also worth a visit.",
          "We had the most amazing day in Havana! This cemetery is like those in New Orleans but you can drive through them. We saw beautiful graves and learned the legend of Amelia Goyri. We even had women show up and do exactly what our guild had told us. It is a must to see.",
          "I visited as part of my excursion in Havana. I never imagined the history, the beauty of the monuments, and the stories about those buried here. Our guide told us many stories as we walked along the street and stopped at the gravesites. With over 130 acres, my time spent there",
          "This 38 acre cemetery is the largest in the western hemisphere with only one in Madrid being larger. This cemetery dates back to the 1500s.",
          "This was a HUGE cemetary; I believe our guide said there were approx 2 mil buried there - as many as currently lived there. Many celebreties too.",
          "We actually found a site where a distant relative was buried...very interesting and a pretty thorough map...this was our selection..",
          "This one happens to be one of the more beautiful ones. To see the graves of past presidents and of wealth families is amazing. You cannot believe how much money people spent to remember their loved ones.",
          "Visiting a cemetery on a city tour seemed a bit odd to us but it was really impressive and the Cubans are very proud of it.There is no need to spend a huge ammount of time here but just to admire the workmanship on some of the graves and mausoleums it is worth it.The place is",
          "Terrific Havanatur (sp?) guide and one in the cemetery to explain all to us. History of mausoleum going back centuries is amazing. How they bury and replace the dead. The monies spent for these elaborate mausoleum. A must see place of Havana.",
          "This cemetery was a historic, sociological and anthropological study. There were extravagant cemetery plots designed and built that will never be used for its original intentions since the people left Cuba. Then there was the simple side for people of lesser means which keeps",
          "It\u2019s certainly an interesting place to visit you would think people are buried above the ground but we were told they are not. I cannot believe that they say over 2 million Cubans are buried there. There are some beautiful plots and the designs and details are incredible",
          "This place is massive and unbelievable structures and artwork. The history here is incredible! If you have time stop in and check out the artwork and statues.",
          "Mix of the simple and ornate - some impressive sculpture on old family crypts. Well cared for, with a beautiful small church.",
          "The cemetery and architecture within is amazing. Incredible mausoleums and tributes built throughout the site. Well worth the visit if only for the architecture.",
          "This place is not my cuppa but each to their own it\u2019s a cemetery There are lots of people buried there and some were famous",
          "Stunning white marble Italian statuary, crypts with gorgeous bronze doors with incredibily detailed reliefs, interesting stories of 'occupants' interred there and a humble chapel. You can't take enough photos.",
          "The opulence and grandiosity of this enormous cemetery is a throwback to the pre revolutionary Cuba. The tombs and monuments are indicative of a totally different society than currently exists. The wealthy families each tried to outdo the others and so there are a lot of",
          "There is so much history here. The architecture is amazing particularly the monument to the firefighters and the chapel. Learning about the burial process was also extremely interesting.",
          "This was part of a tour from a cruise ship. Beautiful monuments. We had a guide that told us so much history. I really learned a lot and highly recommend visiting here. Also saw a ceremony going on in the chapel. We were told they did about 40 a day.",
          "We were taken here as part of a tour. An amazing cemetery, with huge monuments and incredible sculptures. It is strange to find this opulence in the poor country of Cuba. It shows what Havana was in its better days.",
          "Strolling through a cemetery may not be what one thinks about doing when visiting another country, but this is a serene and beautiful plaice. It\u2019s $5CUC for entry and another $1CUC if you\u2019d like a map of the cemetery that identifies where the more notable individuals in Cuban",
          "Giant and impressive, some of the graves are juwels to see, constructed from the finest marble shining in the Havana sunshine. 5 cuc to enter, read before you enter to visit some of the more special graves like la milagrossa (near the church in the middle)",
          "This was so overwhelming at the abundance of burials at this cemetery. i wish I had a week just to walk through and look at the beautifully crafted crypts, hear more stories about the people they represent and cultural traditions. Don't miss this lesson in history.",
          "All the graves are above ground , cemetery is largest in Havana and beautiful. Cubans who die without any money are given a free plot for 2 years then they have to pay. Not much cremation in Cuba as it is expensive and only one crematory there. And Fidel was cremated.",
          "Extremely interesting. If you are lucky, a \"guide\" will introduce themselves and walk you through the cemetery. We gave him 5 CUC for spending at least an hour walking us though and telling the history on many of the sites. Well worth the $$$ to hear the stories from a local.",
          "The architecture of these mausoleums is fantastic! Saw a copy of the Pieta, figures of entire families, the Great Pyramid, and so much more. I was less than excited to learn it was on my tour's itinerary, but now that I've seen it, I fully intend to return. Be forewarned -",
          "I was really curious to visit this place and I enjoyed it even more I expected because we took a guide. Huge place with many big names in crypts, but even you don\u2019t know the famouse people from Cuba you can enjoy an architecture of the last resting place. Their own city in the",
          "This is by far the most elaborate cemetery I have ever seen. Interesting to learn about the burial customs and see these amazing works of art.",
          "I've never been to a cemetary this beautiful before. Go with an English speaking guide (Octavio was really friendly) to have an exmplanation of some of the special tombs and statues.",
          "Better late than never... [no pun intended; TA reminds me to finish a review] This is an extraordinary world unto itself, and that's coming from someone who is not ordinarily a fan of cemeteries. It's a miniature village, really, with huge ornate mausoleums blended with simple",
          "Ok, if you like cemeteries although I expected it to be more monumental. There is the entrance fee of 5 CUC, be prepared.",
          "Interesting examples of emotional monuments to family loved ones over years. Very similar to New Orleans above ground tombs for same reasons. Historic church part of the property for families to have services & burial in same location.",
          "We stopped here with our tour guide and opted for him to walk us through the cemetery and tell us what he knows. You can opt for more inclusive guided tours but we didn't have the time. Entry is 5 CUC for adults, children are free. Beautiful and amazing. Worth a visit.",
          "When we drove up to the entrance of the cemetery I was amazed at the monuments as one was bigger and better than the next one. If I might say it looked like a competition",
          "I didn't get a chance to visit the cemetery when I was here 21 years ago. I was elated to see it now. So beautiful.",
          "This place goes on for blocks. A guide is suggested. The grounds are well-kept, and many of the tombs are artistic masterpieces in themselves. I have a real problem with anything, anywhere being named for Christopher Columbus, but it's not the Cubans fault.",
          "Interesting tour of very well kept Cemetery with marble stone encased graves. Large area with historical resting sites.",
          "We visited this location as part of our Havana tour. It was very interesting. The amount of granite and marble was amazing. You can see that there were some very rich families before 1959. We were told our church donation would be taken by the government so don\u2019t feel like a",
          "You can see how rich was the people buried here, as well know legends of some other famous couples, and heroes!",
          "We booked a tour through Royal Caribbean and were not disappointed. We learned that the Cementerio de Cristobal Colon was begun in the 1870's and was named after Christopher Columbus. The cemetery is built around a central chapel and is set up with main central streets and",
          "This is one of the most beautiful cemeteries I have ever visited. The marble and graves are maintained quite well. I would follow other people's advice to take a guided tour. And as always ... bring a camera.",
          "So much beautiful marble. Take a guided tour through there. The guides tell some fantastic stories about all of the monuments There is a church in the middle of it that has eight doors.",
          "Before the revolution, many of the well to do cemetary graves were built to resemble their home. Beautiful marble graves well maintained gives you a history lesson of the Cuban people.",
          "The statues and tombs and the stories that go along with them - wonderful to see and hear. Spend some time among the sculputures",
          "I've been to a lot of cemetery's around the world, but this one beats them all. I don't think there's one small headstone in the place. I mean huge buildings and statues were erected to honor the dead. They actually bury people one on top the other, 5 deep, then rotate them",
          "This isn't the only place that claims to hold Christopher Columbus' remains, but it sure is a nice looking cemetery.",
          "We found our tour of the cemetery very interesting. We had a guide for the tour who walked and told stories about many of the monuments and graves and our actual tour guide was very informative as well. We saw two funeral processions while taking our tour and it was interesting",
          "Cemetary is the third largest in the world. Extremely ornate tombstones for the rich and famous of Cuba. Take a guided tour for explanations of the families buried here.",
          "We stopped by to see the cemetery on our way to Revolution Square. There is a large central chapel around which the rest of the cemetery radiates. One of our group had found some anecdotal stories of some of the tombs, including the grave of Amelia Goire de la Hoz la Milagrosa,",
          "This place is massive! If you do not take a tour or someone with you that can tell you many interesting facts, then you will not know how much that you are missing. The front gate has someone buried at the top of it. Most of the tombs have many family members in them. There are",
          "We visited on a rainy day when we had little else to do. The cemetery is huge and very interesting. There are a lot of older and elaborate plots. The 5 cuc per person admittance seemed a bit steep, though.",
          "Part of our tour was stopping at the Cemetery, couldn't believe how big it is. Don't be fooled by the name, Christopher Columbus isn't buried here because of politics but he Cemetery is named after him. Some wonderful sights and great place to take photos. Important part of",
          "This was a request of one of my travel mates but i'm glad i went along. It reminded me a little of the cemetery in New Orleans - lots of over the top mausoleums and statuary galore. Had a nice tour guide who knew the history and was good at story telling. A weird but interesting",
          "On a recent cruise to Cuba we booked a tour titled 'Old Havana City Sightseeing.' Part of the tour was spent in this awesome cemetery. Our guide Luis J. Martin was personable, knowledgeable, pleasant to listen to and answered questions with ease. The cemetery is huge (138 acres)",
          "The Cubans are proud that this is a very large cemetery and we did enjoy the tour but it was too long!!! I believe we were given an extended tour as some of our other attractions we were to visit were closed as it was Sunday.",
          "On the bus back to the airport, none of those we spoke to had seen the \"Necr\u00f3polis de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n\", but it is really highly recommended. It is an absolutely massive site, with street signs on the main roads running through it. Allegedly it costs 5 CUC ($5) to visit, but",
          "Massive! If you are interested in cemeteries, then this is the place to visit. We passed by it twice on the Hop On Hop Off bus route and when we had a tour in an old car.",
          "What an interesting place on Sunday morning....so much history. I agree with going with a local guide as they can know the most interesting spots. Be ready for some serious walking and exploring...and then you will be rewarded with some beautiful monuments. Hearing the history",
          "Being, that I am an avid Genealogist, I love going to old cemeteries and my husband does a really good job of making sure that there is one to visit on every trip we take. But this one in Cuba is probably to most ornate and largest one we have ever been too. I enjoyed both the",
          "We visited this cemetery while we were on a tour. This was one of the beautiful cemeteries We have seen and I would compare it's beauty to the Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. There were many famous people buried here as well.",
          "I had requested that our guide take us here as it wasn't on the planned itinerary. He had indicated that he had never actually been to it so it was a new experience for all of us. The first thing you notice is the scale of all of the monuments. From the front gates onward it is",
          "With over 500 monuments, the beauty of this cemetery is a must see. We were not able to go inside the church as there was a funeral in progress. Our guide provided us with more information than we could absorb.",
          "Stopped here with my guide. I was amazed at the marble statues surrounding so many grave sites. This was a wonderful place to take photos. Cost was 5CUC.",
          "Unusual place to visit but my guide was most insistent that we go. It was very impressive as there are so many beautiful and interesting monuments.",
          "Visited today and had a guide who shared so much about his culture, Havana\u2019s history and some of the many people and families buried here. The people of Cuba don\u2019t have to pay to be buried but there is a modest fee to be cremated. Two locations impacted me the most in this",
          "We spent an hour or so with a very well informed, articulate guide. Clearly one could spend many, many hours at this site.",
          "If you like monuments, statues and architecture, you have to visit this place. One of the biggest cimetery in the world and one of the most important for his monuments. We were there with our kids (9 and 7 yo). It cost 5CUC / adult and it's free for kids. They give us a map",
          "Probably one of the biggest cemetery in the Latin world , even if your not religious the stone memorials a worth an hour visit",
          "There are as many stories about this cemetery and its \"inhabitants\" as there are tour guides! A UNESCO location!",
          "One of the largest cemeteries in the world, the Necropolis de Colon in Havana, and one of the most beautiful. There are around 2 million people buried in its 53,360 plots, many of which are dedicated to families or organisations. Originally designed by the Spanish architect",
          "I'm always a little intrigued by cemeteries and this one was especially interesting because our guide was able to share personal stories. If you can go with someone who knows about this and can provide additional insights, I highly recommend it. It's still work a visit even",
          "It is worth the 5cuc. The lady selling the ticket lent us her map which was helpful. A fascinating walk through history. Very photogenic. Worth a visit!",
          "The colonial era in Havana is expressed very well in this magnificent cemetery. The beautiful carrara marble statuary are exceptionally beautiful, as are the stories of some of the notables interred there.",
          "This cemetery is really lovely--lots of gorgeous stonework and small mausoleums. Lovely, but still just a cemetery, so unless you know enough about Cuba to know famous people who might be buried here, it's a bit boring.",
          "Even just driving past this beautiful place with its stunning gate is worth it, such an impressive cemetary!",
          "We also drove past the Colon Cemetery, a 140 acre cemetery known for its elaborate memorials and mausoleums. Although we just drove past it was clear to see what a beautiful place it was, with an amazing entrance gate.",
          "We had a brief stop at the cemetery on our bike tour. Looked fairly similar to the New Orleans cemeteries.",
          "I visited with a photo guide and was fascinated with the place. It think it important to go with a guide or at least do some reading to understand what you are seeing. There is a story about those with less money and the dis-interment process after two years...really sets this",
          "If you come via cruise this place is a bit far out and I would stick to the attractions in the old town, if you have more time this is a nice sidekick, just watching the mansonry and all the fine art i the partly spectalucar Mausoleen. Surely one of th more impressive cemeteries",
          "a must see when in Havana, you will discover great stone work, a vast area of a cemetry (3rd larges in the world, although I am pretty cautious with such stuff), a lot to discover and to be impressed by.",
          "A place worth visiting! You need some time to admire beautiful sculpure and monuments of the tombs. Amazing.",
          "Yes, Christopher Columbus Cemetery (Cemetario de Colon) in Havana is huge - 140 acres. It is also a very interesting place four tourists to visit (and yes, there is an admission charge of 5 CUC). The most famous grave in the cemetery is tied to the legend of \u201cLa Milagrosa.\u201d",
          "A quick drive, it is beautifully maintained the tombs and angelic statutes. Built by the State. We were told the size of the tombs are dependent upon one\u2019s standing in the community?",

          "they were sent back to Spain with his family when Spain relinquished control. I don't see any reason to visit this Cemetery and it was the Spaniards that colonized this island brutally and made its first stop on the Atlantic Slave Trade. I would encourage you to visit the Euro",

          "Rich with history! Just walking though here is something else. We went 2 times. We wandered through on our own and talked to a few of the local people. They filled us in on a few things. Take a tour, Take a Taxi, wander through. Sit awhile. People watch. Anything but just make",
          "It is good to have a guide for the cemetery Osmel Martinez booked thru Cuba Travel Services was great, speaks perfect English and knew the stories behind the graves",
          "You could spend hours or days here. Our \"guide\" showed us famous and beautiful graves and monuments. A must see!",
          "First off let me start by saying we DID NOT have a guide. We just stopped in to have a look around and had no idea how large it was. The place goes on forever! We happened to walk in at the same time as a tour so we walked near their group down the main street and listened to",
          "This is cemetery with great tombs, some are still in good shape and others were in great decay. While we were strolling around we found some signs of Santeria (dead chicken and doll).",
          "We visited this cemetery with Javier, our guide from Fernando Tours. A knowledgeable guide is definitely a plus here. In particular, we enjoyed the memorial to the firefighters who died in the fire of 1890 and the grave of Amelia Goyre de Hoz, who died on May 3, 1901 while",
          "If there's one thing Cuba knows how to do well, it's cemeteries. Christoph Colon {where he isn't - just FYI} Cemetery is colossal and WHITE! White with marble statuary, that is. The place is an art gallery of amazing religious sculpture, some of it beautifully executed. There",
          "Definitely take a knowledgeable guide to walk even a part of this awesome cemetery. The monuments and the stories behind some of them are fascinating. Definitely worth a visit- you can spend an hour or a full day, this place is massive and each lane is full of history and",
          "This lavish cemetery covers mostly the past two centuries, although the first burial was apparently that of a slave, who has disappeared. Numerous past presidents have imposing above-ground structures, but most of the plots are for families or groups, where bodies are arranged",
          "Our tour guide took us here and it was a surreal experience, and one I would not miss. There is SO much history here, and SO much marble, and it is SO peaceful. This place holds over a million people buried, and for me, it was just eye-opening at every turn, and beautiful.",
          "I've never seen such an opulent cemetery and it's well worth a visit ONLY IF you have a good tour guide or are willing to read as you walk through it. Don't miss the memorial to the fire fighters. It's interesting that a lot of the graves are empty because those who could afford",
          "I\u2019ve never seen such a big collection of marble tombstones. Over 1.3 million people are buried here.",
          "Check out, for instance, the grave of Eduardo Chibas, a relentless crusader against corruption during the 1940's and 1950's. At Chibas burial ceremony in 1951 in Havana a young Orthodox Party activist named Fidel Castro jumped atop the grave and made a fiery speech denouncing",
          "No worth visiting, tour guide didn't know if anyone famous buried there, we just walked round and came out again, waste of time and money",
          "There's a 5 CuC entry fee although you get a guided tour for about 20 minutes. It's a 130 acres I believe our guide said. I could have easily spent a day taking photos of the statues but I didn't have the time",
          "It's weird to think about a cemetery as a tourist attraction, but you should definitely visit if you have the time. Many famous Cubans are buried here and there are many famous tombs. Be sure to visit the Firefighter Memorial (on the right hand side of the main entrance avenue",
          "Visited as was struggling in Havana to fill the time. Its worth a visit if you like morsuleums (sorry about spelling). Its sad that it is decaying so much and it is dissapointing and unreasonable to have to pay Euro 5 equivilent pp to get in when Euro 40 a month is the",
          "Est\u00e1 a unos 20 minutos de la Habana Vieja, es la segunda colecci\u00f3n de m\u00e1rmol del mundo. La entrada es impresionante, tienen que pagar para entrar si eres extranjero. If you live in Old Havana, then you need a taxi to go there, you have top pay if you are not cuban. It has the",
          "Perhaps because I've visited other large cemeteries in other countries, this one in Havana didn't impress me much. Or maybe the key is to hire a guide to learn more of the stories. But, on my own, I walked around for a couple hours, and found the unique statues or mausoleums",
          "A cemetery is a strange thing to recommend viewing, but the sheer size and variety of tombs make it well worth a look. The best way to see it if you don\u2019t want to go to it specially, is to take one of the open top buses which show you the sites in Havana and also include the",
          "Took a guided tour of cemetery, explained the opulence of many of the family plots and the myths of others. There was a parade of funerals going on while were there, a very busy place.",
          "Go with a guide through this cemetery to understand the stories of this place. There are legends and the stories abound.",
          "This was not on my original things to do but the guide from Ruta Bikes recommended. I was sure glad she did. It was like going to a sculpture museum. I would recommend hiring a guide. Octavio was my guide and a wealth of information! Not a set fee - pay what you feel is",
          "A cemetery is a part of everyone\u2019s life. This one is unique. It\u2019s not so depressing as some others, because it\u2019s very bright. It has a style. The graves are beautiful. If you visit Havana I would highly recommend the Colon cemetery.",
          "It was a lot to take in, but after being there in the hot sun for 15 minutes it all kind of started looking the same. Be ware of locals who want to show you something, they will usually expect a tip. Havana is very proud of this landmark, it is quite large, but a one time thing",
          "Only peeked in, but the peek was impressive! If you are in the neighborhood, you must check it out. (We were on a bike tour with Havana Bike Rentals and swung by).",
          "This is not only Havana's main cemetery but also a national monument. I consider it a definite Must See. It has striking religious iconography alongside elaborate marble statues. It is large so allow more time than you would think.This is a spot for education and art",
          "Our cruise ship docked in Havana for two days during which we took a tour of the \"Old Town\" and surrounding areas. A cemetery would not normally be on our list of places to visit, but in this case it was. There is nothing ghoulish about this place filled with remarkable",
          "One of the main attractions in Havana. It is really interesting to understand why this cementery is so important for Havana - one of the little places where you could find preservation of sculptures in the city.",
          "Very interesting. Interesting mausoleums and tombstones. I would strongly suggest that you get an english-speaking guide. It's worth the additional fee (beyond the CUC 5 admission) and will make your visit much more meaningful. Take your time and understand the history, some of",
          "I like walking around cemeteries and graveyards (for history, architecture, knowledge) so this was a must-do when visiting Havana. I spent an hour or so here but could have spent much longer. Note: There is an entrance fee and a map of the cemetery is necessary for maximum",
          "We have lived in Havana going on 6 years and have had lots of freinds and family from Canada come. This is always one place i take them. I have been here at least. Times and i learn something new every time. Be sure to get a English speaking tour guide.",
          "If you are interested in Cuban history, this is a must to see. I have been here at least 8 times and have learnt something new everytime. Be sure to ask for an English speaking tour guide.",
          "Jumped of at the Hop on hop off stop. CUC5 to get in per person from a shed on the right of the main entrance, not at the gate. HUGE cemetery with lovely headstones etc. would have preferred if we had a guide for insightful info.",
          "We toured the cemetery as part of our city tour which we booked through the NCL cruise ship. The headstones in this cemetery are an artistic dream. The statues and monuments are huge and contained such detail. The tour guide explained about the whole funeral and burial",
          "Not too many cities have a cemetary as a tourist attraction, but this is one of them. Beautiful sculptures and monuments everywhere one turns ! Well worth the time !",
          "The sheer size and number of monuments in this cemetary make it difficult to appreciate. It seems that anyway you turn, there\u2019s another crypt or sculpture that\u2019s more beautiful than the last. The cemetary itself is huge, so most visitors can only see a tiny portion of the",
          "This is one huge cemetery. Everything is above ground and there is monument after monument. Quite impressive that it is so packed and goes on for miles. Some beautiful architecture and very interesting if you are a cemetery visitor.",
          "I knew we were going to the cemetery, but frankly I found the idea a bit strange. I have visited cemeteries in the past because a relative is very into tracing her ancestry, so have tagged along and tried to find grave stones with her. But the idea of a busload of people going",
          "Very impressive and powerful and when i visited very peaceful, not many tourists. It is a very impressive historical site.",
          "Viewing old cemeteries is an acquired taste. Being into history and genealogy I enjoy visiting them and this rather large one is certainly worth a peek or at least a drive by.",
          "It was very interesting for me to visit there. Our guide told us about the history of the place that the Christopher Columbus was dug up from here and sent back to Spain. this Cemetery shows that the government respects cuban religion and culture.",
          "Beautiful place to spend a few hours and admire the artistry of a time long ago. The central avenue of the cemetery is well preserved with many marble statues and tombs.",
          "Yeah, maybe you want to see these stones, for me it was a little bit boring..But I went there to see and experience it. Huge place anyway.",
          "Nice plce to visit. you can see this spectacular cemetry where they practice cuban cultural stuffs.Also public transport is easy to get in there",
          "Some amazing structures in which to lay their dead. It is not my thing, religion, but these places are so amazing that you have to visit. Managed to find a few shady spots to get out of the heat too.",
          "One of the main reasons for our visit to Cuba was to check out reports on damage to the Anglo-American Association war memorials in the Christopher Columbus cemetery. The Cuban government has now taken over the repair and security of the cemetery, but the memorials were damage",
          "We had a private local guide take us through the cemetery as part of our OAT in Havana! This huge old cemetery is full on many great stories. Be sure to find the Ceiele monument and hear her story! The monument to firefighters is also inspiring!",
          "We visited the cemetery as a stop in a day long cruise tour. The monuments are above ground and are quite ornate marble sculptures that completely cover the ground as far as you can see. The guide said that there are approximately 2.2 million burials here total, dating back",
          "Although this cemetery is named after Christopher Columbus, he is not buried here. he was dug up and sent back to Spain but that is another story. The monuments are all works of art and this has got to be the largest cemetery in the Caribbean. The sites are spectacular, get the",
          "This was a stop on one of our cruise ship shore excursions; very nice tour guide with strong knowledge of the cemetery and those laid to rest; very much like those is New Orleans but very well maintained; you'll appreciate it much more if you come with a working knowledge of the",
          "We visited this on our city tour of Havana and it was amazing to see all the beautiful family monuments and monuments to firefighters as well as other celebrities from before and after the revolution. Well worth the visit. I have never seen anything quite like it in the USA,",
          "If cemeteries are your thing then the crypts here are a photographers delight. There are thousands and thousands of the as far as you can see.",
          "This was, to me, a cross between the cemetery we visited in Buenos Aires where Eva Peron was buried, and the above ground graves you see in New Orleans. We were told that a few years ago it was free to enter the cemetery but then the government saw an opportunity to make some",
          "We stopped here twice on 2 different tours. The history is amazing. The guides were very informative and friendly. The chapel is amazing. I understand 40-50 funerals are held here daily. Over 2 million graves.",
          "There was just so much to see and it just leaves you speechless. The cemetery is just huge and the monuments are so ornate. The Italian marble is just beautiful. The fireman monument and the woman with the baby monument again just leave you speechless. It is worth a stop by and",
          "I suppose visiting a cemetery is not on everyone's list of what to do in Havana, but this place is worth the trip. Seeing the monumental marble structures built by wealthy Cubans is just amazing! Any Cuban can be buried here so the cemetery is HUGE. Almost 40 burial services are",
          "A beautiful cemetery. All of the family plots are made of Italian marble. Many of the mausoleums are replicas of the family homes on a small scale. The work of art is fantastic, you do need a guide to tell you some of the stories behind the plots and the people.",
          "I have only driven around the outside of this cemetery. It is huge! As a photographer and a budding genealogist, I would love to take a day to just walk through for pictures and to read the dates on headstones.",
          "This was one of my favorite sights in Havana. History, architecture, art, graves, ornate tombstones. I know it is one of the great historical graveyards of the world, but it is also an outdoor art museum to me.",
          "I have never been to a more beautiful cemetery in my life. All of the family plots are made of Italian marble. The artists came over from Italy to create these amazing works of art! The Cuban people are very proud of their cemetery and rightfully so! This is a must see in Havana!",
          "A large and interesting historical \"town\" of musoleums. Entrance fee 5 CUC - we drove inside with our taxi. Interesting to walk about and see all. Can compare this place with the cementaries in Paris. Interesting and well worth visit.",
          "Interesting cultural experience that was included in the bus tour we took. Unusual cemetery and art exhibit all in one",
          "This cemetary includes many notable and elaborately commemorated Cubans. Beautiful mausoleums, and a lovely small chapel on site as well. Graves and monuments include past government officials and politicians, Cuban firefighters lost in an 1899 fire, baseball players, chess",
          "Where ever we visit we check out the cemeteries. We look for history, dates, look. I have seen a lot of cemeteries and this one was the best. Cuba pays for all burials you just have to have a family lot/lots. Be sure you take a tour that goes in there. Beautiful place.",
          "A cemetary with lanes and a roundabout for cars, buses and traffic. We went there by bus. You have to pay a ticket to visit the cemetary. But you have to do this. We loved the monument for the bamberos (firefighters). We met a gardener who gave us more information. About the",
          "This was quite fascinating and spectacular to see such ornate tombs. The place is absolutely massive and very interesting.",
          "This is a massive and beautiful tribute to the dead of Cuba. You cannot miss it if you are in town, as it is huge. Well-kept and attractive, and full of decorative monuments.",
          "This is a stunning cemetery, full of monuments, statues, small mausoleums, and beautiful grave markers. The place goes on for several city blocks and is probably the largest cemetery I have ever beheld. I would have given five stars but for the fact that it is named for that",
          "good to see once, great architecture. while reaching the cemetery, you can have a good idea of local lifestyle.",
          "You have to pay a small fee and it is well worth it. We happened to be there when there was a funeral and a separate burial. The separate burial was different. The hearse (which is like a long bed covered station wagon) pulled in with a car and a taxi and a few people came",
          "Learning about the burial traditions of the Cuban people was very educational. The marble graves and statuary were unbelievably beautiful. Christopher Columbus was interred there for over 100 years. He was moved back to Spain during the Spanish American war lest he fall in to",
          "We walked for hours in red-hot sunshine to this rather flamboyant, magnificent and vast cemetry, in the hope of seeing C.C's tomb. Apparently its been moved and is no longer in this cemetry! Be warned. A beautiful cemetry nevertheless, but C.C isnt there!",
          "Don't go unless you are real into cementaries. I think paying 5 CUC to hang around the cementary is not worth it. Some things look cool but there are more things in Cuba than this.",
          "Nice visit and a necessary stop in La Habana. You will spend about 20 min to 30 min. $5usd/person entrance fee. Most graves from turn of XX century. Ver different from typical US cemeteries qhere no construction exists over the grave, which is marked by a plaque only.",
          "It's called Christopher Columbus cemetery. Btw he's not buried there. People are buried above ground. Nothing special here",
          "Beautifully maintained and moving - still visited by many as part of a sincere religious experience. Very hot so time your visit - and be prepared to taxi it back to your hotel on most occasions. Make sure you buy the map !",
          "We had a wonderful guide take us on a walking tour of this large and spectacular cemetery. From an artwork and sculpture stand point, it is an incredible experience. It might seem unusual to tour a cemetery but it will give you a very good sense of the history and culture of",
          "This is a 144 acre cemetery, and its beautiful - we took a horse drawn carriage through and got to hear some of the history of the various monu,nets and headstones",
          "there are all kinds of architecture on display at this HUMONGOUS cemetery: i think you could spend your entire time in Havana just looking at the people who are entombed there. And it would be interesting. Easy to reach, there are a lot of folks exploring the cemetery. and",
          "At the risk of sounding a bit macabre, as the daughter of a funeral director, this was a must visit spot. This cemetery is an interesting expression of the last 100 years or so of Cuban history. The mausoleums are intricate and so well taken care of. Cost of entry for",
          "Huge memorials with statues, sculptures or pyranmids... One can build huge monument here, but prepared: there is a total lack of any good taste. The important graves are near the entrance.You have to pay a visit to the monument of Amalia.",
          "Visit this cemetery....sounds strange but the artistry on the monuments/graves is outstanding. They have tour guides available or take the tour as part of ship tour. Amazing.",
          "We've seen the major cemeteries in Europe & Louisiana. There's a lot of marble & statues, but I don't think any rival the volume of marble angels & crosses. It was interesting to see ones that had been reused - the only name scratched out & the new family name applied. Even",
          "Wide avenues define the various sections of this central cemetery. Stories of miracles as well as adultry abound. The intimate chapel was used to view the deceased prior to buriel. Well lanscaped; vintage trees; blossoms, lowers etc. Christopher Columbus was buried in Havana but",
          "This huge facility appears well thought out and could provide a lot of information to those doing historical research, although I am unsure how many records survived the purges of the Communist Revolution in 1959, when many historical records were altered or destroyed.",
          "Cemetario de Colon is truly beautiful. From the minute you drive in, your eye is drawn to the countless marble headstones and their ornate details. While we walked on our own for a little while, we encountered a man, Ramses, who gave us an \"unofficial\" tour of the notable",
          "The cemetery San Cristobal is a place steeped in history. The mausoleums are personified in occasions. The best place on Alejandro this is a very special tour guide. This's due to the history that goes together what a being or a family lived and then killed the life places them",
          "This was the most beautiful place. This cemetery is a place you could spend hours touring the grounds. Have your camera ready!",
          "We woke early on our last day in Havana to see the cemetery before heading to the airport. That extra effort was very much worth it. Even without any context, the cemetery is beautiful and worth exploration. Getting a guide, though, takes the experience to another level. Our",
          "If your tour takies you to the Columbus cemetery, you must walk into it. The tombs are exquisite. There are many stories to the tombs. Nice to have an informed guide with you.",
          "I was impressed with the many monuments and memorials and the wealth that was in Cuba in the past. The firefighters memorial and \"La Milagrosa\" tomb were especially impressive.",
          "What I love about this place it's that it's very Organice everything it's in order and you can find so old tumb but I like but don't recommend it",
          "The monuments are beautiful and works of art! And the stories behind each are incredible. There is so much symbolism that each piece has a meaning and each monument tells the story if you know the meaning of the carvings! Worth the stop!",
          "Our tour guide had some interesting stories about tombstones. Some of these monuments were very interesting.",
          "This was only one of the stops we made while in Cuba and it wasn't a let down. The cemetery is well kept and the key to having a great time is your guide. Ours told the most beautiful story of Pedro and Catalina (yellow rose named after her). Roses line the wall of hr tomb. Just",
          "This cemetery is phenomenal and worth your time. It is still being used so please be respectful. A guided tour is probably best as there is so much to see. Some of the tombs are like miniature homes, pyramids and other unique designs. Take a hat or umbrella to protect you from",
          "When our guide shared that we were stopping by a huge cemetery, I was rather disappointed. However, with the right guide, you will learn amazing things about the history of Cuba. The architecture is phenomenal. Be sure to take a hat or umbrella as you will need it.",
          "Many people try and enter the cemetery without paying but it is worth the entrance fee for the map and suggestions from the desk. The architecture of the buildings and monuments are great for photography. After your walk you can walk down Calle 12 to a nice ice cream shop for a",
          "This cemetery is simply gorgeous. The different type of stone and architecture throughout was amazing. It is worth hiring a private guide at the entrance. They can answer all your questions and give you much more information than any of the guidebooks provide. We learned",
          "Not that impressive, but one of the places you need to see. Only takes 20 minutes to see everything.",
          "The area is beautiful, but you can see the entire thing in 20 minutes. This was part of a city tour we took in a 1957 Buick convertible.",
          "Interesting structures throughout. We found tombs of some of our ancestors (we knew ahead of time where to look). Still interesting period tombs, although the cemetery is not well kept up (the private lots especially)",
          "When we went to the Christopher Colombus Cemetary with our tour group Friendly Planet Travel, I was amazed. It was something like I've never seen before in my life. This was yet one more thing that I have experienced in Cuba where pictures just do not do it justice. The thing",
          "Havana is a fascinating place. Such a history like no other in the Americas. It is colonial, communist, and warm. It may assault your senses as an American but Americans need to be stretched. Go to Cuba, it will change you. Havana reminds me of a mixture of St Petersburg",
          "El Cementerio de Col\u00f3n is an great place to discover and is like trip to a small city for the dead. It was built in 1876 by Spaniard architect Calixto Arellano de Loira y Cardoso and ironically he also became the first person to be bury there. The cemetery is found in El Vedado",
          "This place was apologetically charging 6 CUCs to get in. It used to be free, and you would pay for a guide. Some of the gravesites were interesting, especially if you know the stories behind them. It is a huge cemetary.",
          "We were in Havana Cuba during a Royal Caribbean cruise. We visited Colon Cemetery which is also called Christopher Columbus Cemetery because he is buried there. I can't list all the famous people buried but there was also a USA soldier who was later removed and is now in",
          "when we learned we were stopping at a cemetery as part of our tour my husband was apprehensive. He learned from a friend that had previously gone that this was interesting so he was curious to see it. When you first approach the cemetery the entrance is quite stunning with",
          "This Cemetery is so interesting. All tombs are above ground and are works of art. Take the guided tour and learn the history of many of the people buried there. Go early in the day. It gets very hot as you walk around!",
          "We took a taxi out to the cemetery and walked for several hours enjoying the beautiful sights. It's amazing the cost and care that have gone into these resting places. It's well worth the taxi fare to get there.",
          "Fascinating and Beautiful. Would have been even better if we had a guide or read about it beforehand.",
          "It was very, very hot when out tour arrived at the cemetery. There is no way we could have gone through here without a guide as the 140 acres is home to more than 500 graves, mausoleums, memorials, etc. Maybe it was the heat of the day but our guide was the only guide we had on",
          "My family and I were on a bus tour that stopped here. The tour guide here gave a great explanation of the graves we stopped with gracious stories. This place is beautiful and I would recommend coming here with a tour guide.",
          "The cemetery is an interesting place if you are into gravestones. You need a guide or a map otherwise, it's just a walk. We took the city tour bus to get here that has a stop in front of the cemetery's gate.",
          "Very large his stork graveyard. The grave of the mother and infant are so moving especially with all the memorials from people who have had their prayers answered. The crypt with the Lalique windows Is breathtaking although it may be under repair when you visit",
          "I may be one one of those with a bit of the weird as part of my personality but I thought this was a pretty good stop on a walking tour of Havana. These sites contain the real history of a city. If you love the hunt, start here to find your favorite Cuban hero.",
          "Ok so this sounds weird but it was probably the coolest cemetery I have ever been to. They have this huge main gate that is just stunning architecturally speaking. Then when you go in you drive down this huge prominad that is well landscaped. After you reach the spot where",
          "This is a cemetery like you've never seen before. I highly recommend getting a tour guide to take your through as there was too much to take in. You could walk through, spend all day just glancing over every site, and still not make it through before dusk. Some sites had become",
          "I was surprised at the large size of this cemetery. Beautiful monuments and full of history. So glad we had a guide the area was very interesting. Some uneven walking areas - wear good walking shoes.",
          "We walked here from where we were staying and it was definitely worth the stop. We spent a little over an hour here, which was enough, the first view is really the attraction. Miles of white marble statues and monuments. You do not need the map, just walk down the main isle.",
          "Buried in the heart of Havana is a memorial to the history of sadness Cuba has experienced. The Christopher Columbus cemetery was supposed to host the remains of the famed explorer but never fulfilled this intent. According to the local guide, his remains were actually hosted in",
          "The Colon Cemetery was founded in 1876. Named for Christopher Columbus, the Cemetery is noted for its many elaborately sculpted memorials. This Cemetery is one of the great historical Cemeteries of the world. It is worth even a short visit.",
          "Did not actually go in but we passed in on the On/Off Bus tour. Fantastic white marble graves and crypts. 5cuc to enter if you wish. Very very big cemetary.",
          "This is a beautiful cemetery, unusual place to visit but my guide was most insistent that we go. It was very impressive as there are so many beautiful and interesting monuments. Many of the tombs look like small houses and vary from very traditional to very modern. Well worth a",
          "Not the most obvious thing to do - to visit a graveyard! but is stunning, there's tiny church structures and massive marble sculptures everywhere, the area is really well kept and worth seeing. We got there on the sightseeing bus trip, this we did route 3, we started from the",
          "I know it sounds strange, but you should definitely visit the Colon Cemetery. Don\u2019t worry, it is not morbid at all, on the contrary it is a magnificent work of art. Just get lost in its labyrinth of numerous paths and marvel at the extraordinary mausoleums and gravestones. You",
          "The cemetery is very different from those in the US. The tombs are generally above ground in marble casings. The sites are decorated with statues and artwork. The burial site for fireman killed in an explosion at the turn of the 19th/20th century is amazing. Each fireman has",
          "Headstones seem piled on top of each other. In actuality, bodies stay there for just a few years; the headstones remain. Check out the tombstones with stones on them. These are put there by Conversos who converted from Judaism. I was surprised to see so many",
          "This is like no other cemetery I have ever seen. The place is vast and it is crammed with a fantastic array of tombs and statues, packed in side by side. The area is so large that it has roads through it for traffic. The cemetery is now a national monument and there is a 5 CUC",
          "This cemetery contains some of the most elaborate tombstones and markers that I've ever seen. Absolutely amazing. We were told by our tour guide that Christopher Columbus died and in Cuba and was buried in the cemetery until Spain wanted him back. This is a must see!!",
          "Although this cemetery is absolutely spectacular,I found it hard to justify the amount of money being spent here to renovate and upkeep the tombs etc. I was impressed but also mystified.",
          "Very interesting to walk around, however beware that large tourists groups come in and invade the place!",
          "Walked along the main street and saw amazing tombs, especially the monument dedicated to the firefighters lost in a devastating warehouse fire. It is a place one could spend hours. Do not miss the grave of Amelia.",
          "What an absolutely magnificent cemetery. Everything is made out of Carrerra marble. They bury the people above ground and cover with marble slabs. The statues in this cemetery are beautiful. take the little tour if you can and learn about the lady and her child.",
          "So interesting. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and personable. Highly recommend this important part of Cuban culture and history.",
          "We had a guide showing us around, and it was fun to see the burial places of all those famous people.",
          "We spent an afternoon wandering this cemetery that was filled with gorgeous art, statues, and stained glass. Oh, the art! Admire a replica of La Pieta, marvel at the angels, and check out the memorial to the fallen firefighters.",
          "I couldn't understand why all the Havana tours included a tour of the cemetery, which I thought was strange. The monuments in the old cemetery are enormous, ornate and beautiful. It is well worth a drive through or stop to see all the statuary.",
          "I enjoy cemeteries for the photo ops and to get a sense of the history of a place...this one is truly astounding. The size of the place is extraordinary and the monuments are truly monumental. We noticed several walking tours with guides and in retrospect that might have",
          "Some amazing places of remembrance. Lots of beautiful monuments and certainly interesting place to visit.",
          "Hard to believe how big this cemetery is. It goes on for blocks. So many ornate marble tombs of all colors and styles. Interesting. Guides will describe many of the more elaborate plots. Chapel at one end is beautiful. Be wary of people's asking for $$ handouts.",
          "Went in the beginning of August so was still very hot, but was worth the trip. We paid a very fair price for a tour and went around the cemetery and got an explanation of who was buried there, the history that went with the person and why they were significant. Got to go into",
          "The history buried here is as stunning as the money in marble monuments. It is a must see while touring Havana.",
          "A little out of the way; however, every tour stops here. The cemetery is beautiful. Nice to have a tour guide explain some of the history of the cemetery.",
          "If you've strolled through Pere LaChaise Cemetery in Paris, you'll appreciate this one. It's huge and contains amazing and beautiful monuments to Havana's ancestors. A private tour guide (or guidebook) is most helpful to appreciate the stories behind so many of these monuments.",
          "The monuments are true works of art. The back stories are moving. Our tour guide was so passionate and brought these stories to life. There are funerals there every 15 to 30 minutes. They did let us all through the chapel. There was a funeral going on, so I was surprised",
          "We have visited many unique cemeteries around the world. This one is up there with the best. Very interesting.",
          "Although this is an interesting cemetery, given its history, it is not very attractive as it is almost all concrete, unlike other old cemeteries with trees and grassy areas. If you go, do so in the morning before it gets too hot.",
          "this Grand cemetery is the Largest in all Cuba and Dates back to the Glory Days of old Havana and it people... The amazing headstones, statues and memorials tell the stories of this Island in the Stream and its colorful people. This is a Historical site that will not disappoint.",
          "We have visited many cemeteries in our travels and this is one of the most fantastic sites! As we purchased our tickets (5 CUCs or approx. $5 CAN) an English speaking guide was gathering a group together. For 45 minutes she led us through many of the remarkable tombs along the",
          "Goes on for blocks and blocks. All sorts of unique and classic markers and stones. Graves are above-ground a la New Orleans.",
          "This was definitely one of the hi-lights of our trip into Havana. Check out some of the \"stories\" online before you go or go with a tour guide. There is so much to see you could spend hours and walk for miles!",
          "A massive cemetery that is well worth a visit. Funerals are held every 15 minutes, so there are always processions in and out. Interesting monuments and some with very moving stories behind them. Visiting with a guide strongly suggested. Thanks for reading. If you found",
          "a wonderful cemetery with great sculptures and stories. A must for cemetery lovers. Bring a camera. Go early, all the white marble reflects the sun and makes you feel as if you are a steak on a BBQ (sorry vegetarians). Be respectful, dress and behaviour. It is still in use and",
          "A massive and unique cemetery. Worth a detour. Get a map from the office on the left, as you enter. go early or late to avoid the heat.",
          "I'm one of those people who loves to wander round old cemetries (not in am morbid way) but this one was the creme de la creme. Packed with centuries of history & an unbelievable gravestones. Well worth a look.",
          "35-40 funerals per day are still happening in this cemetery. Using a guide really helps. Definitely see the monument for the firemen and nearby \"milagro\" statue. You may not get into the church if a service is going on. If you are a photographer you will have a lot of",
          "We were impressed by the grandeur of this place- well worth an hour spent here and enjoyed spotting the famous graves",
          "We took a taxi here from Parque Central, which only cost around 7 cuc. We got there early, around 9:30 am, to beat the heat a bit. The tourist desk is on the right when you enter and if you inquire, you can be lead through the cemetery by an English speaking guide for no cost,",
          "We toured by here in a vintage car and was going to enter when the driver told us we had to pay to get in. It wasn't much, but we also didn't want to waste our time in the car driving inside the cemetery. However, we had to go inside to turn around so we did see part of it. Eh...",
          "I have been attracted to old historic cemeterys and this one does not disappoint. It is best to have a guide who can point out the unusual and beautiful and historic crypts and scullptures",
          "We really enjoyed the marvelous sculpture of stone here. The place is well laid out and easy to roam. Many very important people in Cuba's history are interred here.",
          "Fantastic place to walk around and check out the 5th largest Cemetery in the world. It's as EPIC as the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris, France. Walk around and be friendly. We donated to a couple of different things while here, as the place is almost 500 years old. Across the",
          "When you understand how tight life is in Cuba today and has been for many years, its an almost ironic contrast to see the tonnes of Italian marble used to commemorate those who left. Some truly amazingly beautiful crypts to see here.",
          "Spent a few hours wandering through this amazing cemetery in Vedado. Amazing art work; some celebs (i.e. Ibrahim Ferrer of Buena Vista Social Club) and great stories (such as La Milagrosa's). We took numerous photos, read many inscriptions, shamelessly people watched and enjoyed",
          "If you like cemeteries - you will like this one. It is very beautiful and well kept. The amounts of tombs is so great, you really need a guide or good map of the area to know what you are looking at. Very peaceful. You can spend several house walking around the grounds.",
          "Amazing place to visit. Take a few hours to walk around. Beautiful tombs. Statues. A very peaceful place.",
          "This cemetery was founded in 1871 and is full of art and architecture. There are 40 burials every day. The coffee, rum and tobacco owners used marble from Italy to show their wealth. There are over 1,000,000 people buried in this cemetery. I suggest you have a local guide",
          "I went on a tour of the cemetery, and was amazed at the beautiful statues and monuments. I was particularly touched by the large memorial to some firefighters who were killed. Go on a cool day - hot and humid is not great for walking around in the sun for any length of time.",
          "From reading all the positive reviews we made a point of going here, from the Hop on Hop Off Bus. Our guide was overweight, and struggled to walk, and I feel we saw so little because of this. In addition his strong accent made me realize how difficult it must be for the Cubans",
          "wasn't sure about visiting this but it is impressive with about 2 million buried here. Our private tour with Compass brought us here. Our guide explained a lot of the history and famous Cubans buried here and the stories around them. That is what made the visit interesting. 5",
          "This is an amazing cemetery filled with famous and incredible not so famous people. Martyrs, Doctors, poor, victims of huge tragedies, famous families, and even one of the original members of the Buena Vista Social Club, Ibrahim Ferrer, who captivated audiences of thousands",
          "We passed by the graveyard that at one time held the remains of Christopher \"Barbarian\" Columbus. His remains were moved back to Spain when Cuba gained its independence. Our guide did not know that and we were very happy that we didn't waste time in the cemetery.",
          "Lots of beautiful crypts! The cemetery is above ground and you can see all the great buildings and headstones. It's definitely a treat to see.",
          "This is not a spooky place by any means...its more like an art museum. This Catholic museum and its graves and tomb stones certainly gives glory to the Almighty. It shows how affluent the population was in the past. The works of art are truly impressive. Most tours rush through",
          "It is one of the biggest cemeteries of the world but it is not very close to the touristic attractions. Maybe you can find a chance to stop during a sightseeing tour.",
          "This place is an interesting place to visit. It should take around one or two hours walking. There are some guides in the entrance who can explain everything. You could see the tomb of a woman who locals calls Milagrosa and is considered a saint. There are a lot of interesting",
          "A cemetery with no room to grow, yes Chris is there but you can only see the Cemetery from the street, very cramped. Is a very big, totally covered with above ground graves (Much like New Orleans). Interesting that grave sites are used over and over, after 5 years bones are",
          "Extremely interesting both for architecture and history. Do by all means know background history...guide? Remember NO restrooms!",
          "You need to go visit this place on your trip to Cuba. The cemetary is very large and beautiful, almost comparable to P\u00e8re Lachaise in Paris. Take the hop-on hop_off bus to get there and back. We were there Jan. 1st 2016.",
          "As far as the eye could see were beautiful marble headstones, statues, and building. This is a huge cemetery, the largest in Havana, maybe Cuba. It's the one place where the explosion of tourism can not touch.",
          "The Cemetario de Colon is considered to be one of the top three cemeteries in the world and for good reason. Covering 40 acres in the center of Havana it's 800,000, yes that's 800,000 graves, goes on and on and on. The vaults, mausoleums and chapels run from plain to ornate and",
          "It is an extraordinary place full of interesting funeral art and stories. Ask for a guide at the desk where you pay to get in. Well worth it. Our guide was a former professor and she brought the place to life. Walking with a map would not have been as interesting.",
          "There are over 2 million people interned here. Over 40 funerals per day. The best way to appreciate the place is to take a tour with Octavio. He knows the inside scoop on the place and can tell you many stories about the place. Some of the sculptures are so beautiful, they",
          "Situated in Vedado area, the cemetery is peaceful, beautifully maintained, and full of historic figures as well as more recent family losses. A black snake slithered across our path so keep to the sun-beaten main pathways. Retain your entry ticket if you want to leave by the",
          "I love walking the peaceful streets and alleys of the cemetery. Yes, it is huge so dont waste your time if you are in a hurry. It is too beautiful and loaded with breathtaking sculptures, architectonic jewels and stories from the country's history to do a short version. Its",
          "Often when I'm traveling, I'll duck into a cemetery if it is in some way significant. This is one of the best I've been in. Most of these above ground graves are fairly old and sometimes in varying states of decay. Because of that, there are some creepy sights such as a",
          "Even if you are not a fan of cemeteries like us, this one is absolutely stunning. The variety of elaborate grave sites, squeezed into this huge grave yard is incredible. Look out for grave of I. Ferrer of Buena Vista social club.",
          "The cemetery is massive and the best way to see it is with a guide so they can explain the meaning of the tombs and tell the stories about them. Allow plenty of time, bring water and sunscreen and just wander around. We were with an organized tour and couldn\u2019t spend as much",
          "This is the largest cemetery in Cuba at 140 acres. The marble and mausoleums are pieces of art and worth a slow walk and tour.",
          "Great way to spend a morning.We walked around and saw lots of graves ,we realized that we need a guide.My wife arrange a private tour and it was so worth it.The guide took around and explain things to us and showed us the interesting graves.The story of the lady with her baby is",
          "Our attention was focused on the huge monument for the 65 firemen who died in an explosion in Old Havana.These people still merit our everlasting gratitude. But we were even more struck by the hope and despair in the eyes of ordinary people offering flowers on the simple",
          "It is really worth a visit even if there is not so much to see except for some monuments over people and tragic events. But it is big, and it has peace and quiet, which is rare in Havana.",
          "This place was the highlight of my trip, the stories, the architecture, the iron gates, the massive trees, it goes on for miles, take a lunch go get lost in there, one place you would not regret going, pay for a guide if only for the stories, they will break your heart a hundred",
          "This cemetery is so huge, you literally cannot see the borders in any direction if you're standing in the middle. Beautiful and elaborate tombs and statuary. The church at the center is also lovely with very nice stained glass. Lots of history.",
          "Definitely worth a visit, even if you only spend an hour or two wandering around. I visited Cementerio de Colon to find our family's tomb. If you have Cuban roots and have family buried here, with some basic information (date of death) the staff can find your family members",
          "This is one of our must see selections. It is the burial spot of past presidents and socialites of Cuba. Very interesting, it costs five pecos to get in but you get a guide for that who explains the history and celebrity burial grounds. Sorry Fidel is not here or Christopher",
          "This cemetery is big and keep in mind to have sun protection with you, because you cannot walk under a lot of trees in the middle of the day. There is a map (has to be bought though) and if you do not have a guide book with you it is worth buying one. It is a really nice",
          "This is supposed to be the largest cemetery in the world and no argument here. It is difficult to communicate how expansive this place feels since it's in a very populated city. The grounds are well kept and it is a good place to walk around if you enjoy this kind of thing.",
          "Largest active cemetery in Havana and even Cuba. About 70% of the worlds carrera marble sits here in the cemetery. Come with a tour guide to take you and explain the most profound parts of history in here. Otherwise you need almost a full day, maybe 2 just to walk it.",
          "The largest and most active cemetery in all of Havana and even Cuba. We were told about 40-50 funerals take place a day in here. You will never see this much carrera marble in 1 location. There is a lot of history in here and if you want to see whole cemetery plan for almost a",
          "The guide said this is the largest cemetery in the world. Yes, the world, and I believe it. There was no way to get a photo that could show the expanse of this place. It is a quiet and beautiful place in a not so great part of Havana. This was the only area that we felt",
          "As odd as it sounds, this cemetery is beautify. The art forms carved out of marble tells stories of fallen soldiers, loved ones, rulers (both loved and not!) and the almost-saint. The cemetery does see 50-60 burials and masses a day, so do be prepared that the hearse could drive",
          "Highly recommend that you secure an English speaking guide at the entrance, for a tour. Richard walked us through the main street and really helped us understand the history of the cemetary. It's a stop on the Hop on-Hop off bus tour, really recommend.",
          "Went with a very knowledgeable guide. Wonderful history and stories. Beautiful sculptures. Very large but you get a better idea of the people and culture of Cuba.",
          "This cemetery is really beautiful, given that there are lots of ornate crypts and graves. However, there is a 5 CUC price to get in, which is strange given this is a burial site.",
          "This cemetery is undoubtedly beautiful and moving, however, it's actually not free to get in (5 CUC per person), which is odd given it is a cemetery. It's quite out of the way of the main historic part of Havana, but not too far from Revolution Square, so worth a visit if going",
          "This cemetery is undoubtedly beautiful and moving, however, it's actually not free to get in, which I find a bit tasteless given it's a burial place.",
          "Christopher Columbus may not be buried here any longed, the moved him to Spain around 1903, but the cemetery is worth the trip if you have the time. Very interesting history for many of the occupants. Get a guide and a good guidebook to help you understand what is there and",
          "What a gorgeous place, even though it's sad to see the decay taking place. If I ever come back, I'd like to do a walking tour to learn more of the history but we opted to spend an hour waking it on our own. It was about a 15-20 minute cab ride from old havana to the cemetery",
          "We enjoyed spending 20 mins here , looking at the architecture and learning of its history. Odd thing to say that a cemetery is fascinating , but it is and it's not morbid here at all as it's so well kept. It's worth a stop.",
          "This is a must see, you see graves of past presidents along with some famous people. No Christopher is not here, he was moved but for 5 pecos you also get a guide to walk you through that speaks English and is quite knowlegable, Dont forget a tip is appreciated. There is a",
          "We had a wonderful guide here who helped us understand not only the cemetery but also the history of the city.",
          "We didn't have a guide and it was a very warm afternoon when we finally reached the cemetery ( after walking to Revolution Square from the old city) so we likely missed interesting parts of the CCC; Still, the wide range of tombs, styles - from classical to art nouveau and",
          "I have visited the cemetery in New Orleans and this one is even better. A gardener help us to understand all the stories around the graves. This was an unexpected visit.",
          "I went and wandered around the cemetery as it was a place with great significance for La Habana. Be warned take an umbrella if it's a hot day, there's very little shade and it gets hot...",
          "This was a fabulous attraction. Having the tour guide to explain significance of various grave areas was great. A lot of walking, but it was fun.",
          "After a few days of the color, noise and diesel fumes one needs a quiet place in Havana. The guests at Necrpolis Cristobal Colon are indeed quiet. The cemetery is a beautiful place to spend a couple of quiet hours admiring the history and architecture in this oasis inside",
          "The cemetary is entirely above ground and an amazing experience - at lease as far a cemeteries go. We visited cemeteries in Paris, Buenos Aires and New Orleans and this was certainly up there with all those. Entry is 5 CUC per person.",
          "Some people like visiting cemeteries, others don't and find it creepy. This large and well maintained cemetery is a must for every tourist, architecture lover, and historian. Containing the tombs of many Cuban notables, there are other esoteric monuments (such as to",
          "This is part of a real cultural experience for Cuba, do visit and make the time. This is not something you would usually think about but our guide took us there and for that I am grateful. Please get a guide and make sure you go to the statue of the mother and child, and respect",
          "The Christopher Columbus Cemetery is rich in history, sculptures & stories. Make sure you get a tour guide to walk you around and tell you the stories of some of the more famous crypts.",
          "Spent around 2 hours walking around, taking photos. Only saw a few tourists, most of them arrived on a bus, walked 100m and then got back on again. Worth an excursion.",
          "The mausoleums and grave sites in this cemetery are pieces of art! One is more beautiful than the next. Don't miss the Firefighters monument or the tomb of Amelia Goyri (say a blessing or make a wish!). Don't know if there are public tours but if there are, take it! We had a",
          "Most of the tombs are made of brilliant white Carrara marble. Some very large mausoleums, lots of flat stately above ground tombs. Small chapel.",
          "The sheer scope of this is mind boggling. The variety of markers, headstones and crypts is hard to imagine. It is on the hop on hop off route and is worth checking out until the next buss comes by.",
          "not my normal choice of a great place to visit, but i will make an exception to this one the place is huge , you need plenty of time.",
          "Now cemeteries might not be everybody's idea of a fun time but this place is amazing, it's huge. We're more interested in the architecture than in who's buried there, just as well as they don't provide a map! You have to wonder why people spend so much on their crypts, maybe",
          "Referenced on the maps as Necropolis De Colon this is a huge above ground cemetery that reminded me of those in New Orleans.",
          "The Cemetery is incredible and huge. They give you a map. Rich people built large and beautiful monuments to their pain. Angels crying, massive family crypts. I was overwhelmed. If you like this kind of thing I strongly recommend visiting here.",
          "Firstly, we were charged 6cuc each for the privilege of going around the cemetery, while it was interesting this was not helped by the fact that there was very little information about the cemetery or who was buried there. It is vast and wandering around in the heat of the day",
          "Stopped hear on our cycle tour of Havana. Apparently it's the third biggest in the world. Pay to get in, probably wouldn't bother going if it was not on the cycle tour as cemeteries don't do it for me, but then that's great just me.",
          "You need to have a guide or maybe a guide book, because the stories and explanations they tell, bring everything to life. It was very beautiful with statures, vaults and mausoleums.",
          "And the tombstones are beautiful and each family holds a story. We didn't stay long, but am happy we found this place.",
          "Beautiful place ! My son loved it. He is 4 years.. And found it very interesting with all the statues and sculptures.",
          "If you are a lover of art (especially statuary) or history, this is a must see. Do not miss the monument to the firefighters or the shrine to Amelia. The church is also worthy of a visit. No ticketing or fee required. Highly, highly recommended.",
          "Colon Cemetery is one of the great historical cemeteries of the world. Havana's dead were laid to rest in the crypts of local church catacombs and later at Havana's newly opened Espada Cemetery. When locals realized there would be a need for a larger space for their community\u2019s",
          "OK, so going to a cemetary may not be on your normal list of things to do, but when visiting Havanna , this one should. Beautiful, historic and interesting. It is very big so be prepared to spend some time. We had a guide, and even though I could only understand half of what she",
          "Located on the south-wester border of El Vedado, 12th st. and Zapata Ave, and not very far from downtown this is a very large cemetery with marble tombs, crypts and statuary and, as in New Orleans, all lie aboveground . There are guides at all entrances to give a tour in your",
          "The Christopher Columbus Cemetery is massive. This site offers a large variety of marble and granite burial plots, crypts, and mausoleums dating back to 1871. The variety is also present in style, shape, size, and extravagance.",
          "We did not get a guided tour but may do that next time but of course even with an English speaking guide it is sometimes hard to understand them.. It was enjoyable to walk around but was surprised not to see any graves older than about 1885 but maybe we were not in the right",
          "If you go make sure you pay for a guide. It is not expensive and you will benefit by getting some history of the people buried there and how they actually bury people above ground.",
          "We had a guided tour of the cemetery. So much fascinating history and beautiful architecture. Reminded me of the cemeteries in New Orleans. Great way to get away from the hustle and bustle of the downtown area.",
          "So much history and interesting monuments to see. You'll never see it all in a day but it's well worth the trip.",
          "It is great to visit, especially with a guide to tell you the stories about it. Beautiful monuments and a lot of history.",
          "The cemetery has many beautiful statues. It is huge with a chapel in the middle with stain glass. You can walk around for hours and continually find things to inspire you.",
          "Spend a few hours here with your camera. Tour groups come often. Read the inscriptions - some back in the 1800s. Lovely, poignant and spiritual statutes. Just an incredible place to visit. When done, if not on a tour bus, go across the street for a beer and rest - people",
          "We toured the cemetery with a guide. It was beautiful. many tombs are being renovated. interesting to go see.",
          "The second largest cemetery in Latin America is the size of a small town full of eye opening architecture and all the history you could want, an amazing must see landmark",
          "There are a lot of old wealthy people here and famous. There are nationalities from all faiths here but one has to look. Some of the monuments are spectatularly beautiful, the marble is so beautiful,' Very peaceful and clean!",
          "Didn't know what to expect of a cemetery that covers acres and acres in the city. Tour was of main \"avenue\" only with famous family graves. Could not enter church as a funeral was in progress. A must see is Amelia's grave. A miracle is attributed to this lady and people come",
          "Seems strange that a cemetery should be something of a landmark but it is certainly on all the city tour routes. And in a very crowded city, it takes up a lot of ground!",
          "A few interesting graves (legend of the mother and baby) and the metal construction in remembrance of the revolutionaries are the main features of this cemetary. Well worth a visit.",
          "Impressive cemetery, well worth a visit. Visiting a cemetery seems an odd thing to do however this one is very peaceful and very beautiful",
          "Similar in feel to the cemetery in Buenos Aires it can be thought of as an open air museum of cemetery sculpture.",
          "Our group visited this cemetery recently, and I only have two regrets. One is that we didn't stay there longer, and the other is that I hadn't researched it before we arrived. There are achingly lovely sculptures in marble - more of them than I had time to look at. The cemetery",
          "Although it is a cemetery, it is extremely tranquil and quite remarkable. It is a little over priced at 5 CUC but worth the visit. We walked around on our own as we were on a tour but apparently you can get and guide or at least a map. If this would be of interest to you, I",
          "The big Cemetario de Colon is very atmospheric and impressive. Great photo opportunities. Guides are waiting who are willing to provide you with a tour, but you can also walk it yourself. The entrance is on the North side on Zapata and Calle 12, the exit on the West side also on",
          "This very formal cemetery has beautiful crypts and monuments. Many famous Cuban families have burials here. It is the major cemetery in Havana.",
          "Incredible monuments and interesting history. This was once the burial spot of Christopher Columbus before his remains were moved to Seville Spain. It is well worth hiring a guide when you buy your ticket.",
          "Took a cab out to the Cem Col\u00f3n kinda hoping it might be similar to the Ricoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires which it is not. There are few large monuments. Two that stood out was one to firemen who had lost their lives fighting a large fire at the end of the 19th century.",
          "This cemetary is absolutely huge! I think you could spend a week here and not see all of it. We went as part of a tour, so having a guide was very helpful.",
          "Huge cemetery. Lots of graves,some monumental others less.Colourful yellow walls contrasting with the white marble stone.",
          "Culturally speaking it's a great place to visit. The architecture is unbelievable. Lots of detail in every nook and cranny with a story to tell.",
          "We learned that this cemetery is among the top cemeteries in the world- sharing the bill with Paris - Pierre Le Chaise(sp?) the site of Jim Morrison of the doors fame and others. The architecture and art as well as wonderful superstitions make this a worthwhile guided tour.",
          "This is not something I usually visit it was part of a tour and we riding stop for very long too a photo",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Old Havana (Spanish: La Habana Vieja) is the city-center (downtown) and one of the 15 municipalities (or boroughs) forming Havana, Cuba. It has the second highest population density in the city and contains the core of the original city of Havana. The positions of the original Havana city walls are the modern boundaries of Old Havana.\nOld Havana is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHavana was founded by the Spanish in 1519 in the natural harbor of the Bay of Havana. It became a stopping point for the treasure laden Spanish galleons on the crossing between the New World and the Old World. In the 17th century, it was one of the main shipbuilding centers. The city was built in baroque and neoclassical styles. Many buildings have fallen into ruin in the latter half of the 20th century, but a number are being restored. The narrow streets of Old Havana contain many buildings, accounting for perhaps as many as one-third of the approximately 3,000 buildings found in Old Havana. It is the ancient city formed from the port, the official center and the Plaza de Armas. \nIn 1555, Old Havana was destroyed and burned by the French corsair Jacques de Sores. The pirate had taken Havana easily, plundering the city and burning much of it to the ground. After limiting the scarce defenders, De Sores left without obtaining the enormous wealth that he was hoping to find in Havana. The city remained devastated and set on fire. Since the incident, the Spanish brought soldiers and started building fortresses and walls to protect the city. Castillo de la Real Fuerza was the first fortress built; initiated in 1558, the construction was overseen by the engineer Bartolom\u00e9 Sanchez.\nOld Havana resembles Cadiz and Tenerife. Alejo Carpentier called it \"de las columnas\"(of the columns), but it could also be named for the gateways, the revoco, the deterioration and the rescue, the intimacy, the shade, the cool, the courtyards... In her there are all the big ancient monuments, the forts, the convents and churches, the palaces, the alleys, the arcade, the human density. The Cuban State has undertaken enormous efforts to preserve and to restore Old Havana through the efforts of the Office of the Historian of the City, directed by Eusebio Leal.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe Malec\u00f3n is the avenue that runs along the seawall at the northern shore of Havana, from Old Havana to the Almendares River.\nThe Paseo del Prado, Havana is the street that forms the western edge of Old Havana, being its boundary with Centro Habana.\nCastillo del Morro,  picturesque fortress guarding the entrance to Havana bay.  The construction of the castle Los Tres Reyes del Morro owed to the step along in Havana of the English pirate Sir Francis Drake. The king of Spain arranged its construction on a big stone which was known by the name of El Morro. He sent the field master Juan de Texeda, accompanied of the military engineer Battista Antonelli, who came to Havana in 1587 and began the task at once.\nLa Caba\u00f1a fortress, located on the east side of the Havana Bay.  The most impressive fortress of the Spanish colony was La Caba\u00f1a. It impresses with its 18th-century walls, constructed at the same time as El Morro.  Every night at 9 p.m., some soldiers dressed in suits of the epoch shoot from her the \u201cel ca\u00f1onazo de las nueve\u201d, (gunshot of the nine). It went off every day to warn of the closing of the doors of the wall that surrounded the city.\nSan Salvador de la Punta Fortress, In the shore opposite to the Castle of El Morro, at the beginning of the curve of El Malecon, there rises the fortress of San Salvador de la Punta, of minor architectural dimensions. It was constructed in 1590, and in 1629 the Chapter of Havana decided, to defend better the port, to join her in the night with the El Morro by using a thick chain that prevented the entry of enemy ships.\nCastillo de la Real Fuerza, The fortress or (lit.) Castle of the Royal Army is another big monument that closes the Plaza de las Armas. It was the first big fortification of the city, initiated in 1558 on the ruins of an ancient fortress. In the same year, the Crown sent to Cuba the engineer Bartolom\u00e9 Sanchez, supervised by 14 official and main stonemasons in order to reconstruct the castle, which had been set fire and destroyed by the French corsair Jacques de Sores.\nCatedral de San Crist\u00f3bal, the most prominent building on the Plaza de la Catedral.  The Cathedral was raised on the chapel after 1748 by order of the bishop from Salamanca, Jose Felipe de Trespalacios. It is one of the most beautiful and sober churches of the American baroque.\nNational Capitol, styled after the Panth\u00e9on (Paris), looking similar to the U.S. Capitol.\nGalician Center, Central Park, The Galician Center, of neobarroque style was established as a social club of the Galician emigrants between 1907 and 1914. Built on the Theater Tacon (nowadays Great Theater of Havana), it was open during the Carnival of 1838 with five masked dances.\nPlaza de Armas \u2013 the main touristic square.  The origin of its name is military, since from the end of the 16th century the ceremonies and the military events took place here.\nGran Teatro de la Havana, the Great Theater of Havana is famous, particularly for the acclaimed National Ballet of Cuba and its founder Alicia Alonso. It sometimes performs the National Opera. The theater is also known as concert hall, Garcia Lorca, the biggest in Cuba.\nThe Museum of the Revolution, located in the former Presidential Palace, with the boat Granma on display in front of the museum.\nSan Francisco de la Habana Basilica, Habana Vieja, The set of church and convent of San Francisco de Asis, byline of the year 1608, and it was reconstructed in 1737.\n\n\n== Threats ==\n\nIn 2008, Hurricane Ike destroyed many structures in Old Havana, overturning years of conservation work directed at the iconic antiquated buildings of the area.  Not only did it damage historic buildings, but it forced many of Old Havana's residents to flee for safety.  The threats that hurricanes pose adds to an already tenuous state for Old Havana's many historic buildings.  Age, decay, and neglect combine with natural factors in a complex set of threats to the long-term preservation of this historic old town.\n\n\n== UNESCO Heritage site ==\nIn 1982, La Habana Vieja was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List. A safeguarding campaign was launched a year later to restore the authentic character of the buildings.\n\n\n=== Photo gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nOld Havana is twinned with the following cities:\n\n Viveiro, Spain\n Cartagena, Colombia\n Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Mexico\n Sintra, Portugal, since 2000\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHavana\nWorld Heritage Site\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLinks to sites with casa particular and travel info on Old Havana\nHotels in Old Havana Travel and tourism\nOld Havana Restoring Hidden Treasured Murals by Vanessa Bauza, Sun Sentinel, April 11, 2004\nParticular houses in Old Havana Cheap accommodation in Old Habana",

          "Excellent choice as a day trip from Varadero. Lots of history in the city and several museums and old buildings to see. I dont think half a day was long enough, try and spend a few days in order to truly get a feel for the culture here. Ive been to Cuba over a dozen times and",

          "I'm not quite sure where it comes from but there is a real and noticeable vibe about Old Havana - it must be the buildings - some resplendent and in great order, others in stages of decay and neglect but all contributing to the Havana scene. You need to have your camera ready",

        "wiki": "Castillo San Salvador de la Punta is a fortress at the entrance to the bay in Havana, Cuba.\n\n\n== History ==\nLa Punta, like El Morro, was designed to protect access to Havana from frequent attack by corsairs. Initially, in 1559, lookouts were posted at La Punta.\nIn 1582 King Felipe II, convinced that it was necessary to reinforce fortresses and fleets, ordered the creation of a fortress system in several places of America, centered on Havana.\nJuan de Tejeda was appointed governor of the island because of his expertise in fortification. He brought along the Italian engineer Giovanni Battista Antonelli, who has been considered the most renowned professional to practice in 16th century Cuba  The works began by 1590 and went on slowly. In 1595 a hurricane severely damaged the fortress, among other reasons, due to the thinness of its walls that were then more solidly rebuilt.  By 1602 there was such a delay in the construction work that the engineer decided to make the fortress into a keep holding some 10 to 12 artillery pieces. Finally, as the years went by it was taken apart, leaving just 3 bastions.\nIn 1630, due to the short distance between La Punta and El Morro and to increase the protection of the bay, a heavy copper chain was laid between them. One can see this chain in some of the engravings of that time.\nIn 1762 the British expedition against Cuba took its toll on all the fortresses. The safety curtains and bastions of La Punta were destroyed during the invasion. At this time a chain branching out in several directions and held by heavy wood beams was laid. Its ends were tied to guns set-in at La Punta and El Morro. Some fragments of this piece still remain.\nLater on, with the Spanish back in power, a new governor arrived, fixing and enlarging the fortification system. In the 19th century some changes, such as the 4 esplanades built to accommodate a corresponding number of artillery pieces, were added at La Punta.\n\nIn 1851 the Spanish executed most of the prisoners they held at La Punta, including Venezuelan adventurer Narciso  L\u00f3pez, after a failed attempt to liberate Cuba that caused outrage in the United States. \nThe castle, in 1997, was under an intense work of restoration, (by the City\u2019s Historian Office), that gave it its original position on the rocks. Thanks to this work canons that were engraved in the rocks. The park that surrounds it, paved with striking red ceramic tiles, is a memento of the San Antonio, a Spanish ship foundered in front of the castle with a heavy load. Some of the cargo was recovered from the flotsam and now gives the area just outside the building a special and highly distinctive character.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Media related to Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta at Wikimedia Commons\n\nForts and Castles of the Caribbean Islands",

        "wiki": "The Castillo de la Real Fuerza (English Castle of the Royal Force) is a bastion fort on the western side of the harbour in Havana, Cuba, set back from the entrance, and bordering the Plaza de Armas. Originally built to defend against attack by pirates, it suffered from a poor location; it is too far inside the bay. The fort is considered to be the oldest stone fort in the Americas, and was listed in 1982 as part of the UNESCO World Heritage site of \"Old Havana and its Fortifications\".\n\n\n== History ==\nA previous fort, the Fuerza Vieja (Old Fort), was badly damaged in 1555 during an attack on Havana by the French privateer Jacques de Sores and eventually was demolished in 1582. In 1558 Bartolom\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez, an engineer appointed by King Philip II of Spain, began work on the new fort, initially known as the Fuerza Nueva (New Fort). The Fuerza Vieja was set back from the harbour, but the new fort was planned to be closer to the harbour to give it a better location. The ironworks were established in 1558, but the first stones were not laid until 1562. Construction was delayed due to complaints from local residents forced to relocate to make way for the building and from disagreements between S\u00e1nchez and the Governor of Havana. The fort was not completed until 1577, with slaves and French prisoners providing most of the labour. The fort was built of limestone quarried from the Havana shoreline and the fortification incorporated thick sloping walls, a moat, and a drawbridge. The governor, Francisco Carre\u00f1o, ordered the addition an upper storey as barracks and a munitions store, but on completion, the fort proved to be too small for practical use.\n\nDespite being positioned closer to the harbour than the Fuerza Vieja, it quickly became apparent that the new fort was still too distant from the mouth of the harbour to serve effectively as a defensive bulwark. Instead Juan de Tejeda adopted it as the residence of the Governor of Havana. Subsequent governors made changes to the building. The fa\u00e7ade of the fortress was demolished in 1851 to allow O\u2019Reilly Street to go all the way to the docks, and prevent the fort from overshadowing El Templete, which was completed in 1828.\n\n\n=== La Giraldilla ===\nIn 1634, Juan Vitri\u00e1n de Viamonte added a watchtower with a weathervane sculpted in the form of a woman, by Ger\u00f3nimo Mart\u00edn Pinz\u00f3n, an artist from Havana, and based on the figure crowning La Giralda in Seville. Although the reason for the choice of this figure, called La Giraldilla, is not known, a common belief is that it honours Isabel de Bobadilla, Havana's only female governor, who assumed control from her husband Hernando de Soto when he undertook an expedition to Florida. She spent many years scanning the horizon for signs of his returning ship (unbeknownst to her, he had died). The figure became the symbol of the city of Havana (it features on the Havana Club rum label), and the original is now in the City Museum housed in the Palacio de los Capitanes Generales in the Plaza de Armas; the figure on the watchtower is a later copy.\n\n\n== Use ==\nThe fort was home to the National Archive from 1899 and the National Library from 1938 up until 1957, when both were relocated to a purpose-built library in Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n. After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the fort housed the offices of the National Commission of Monuments and the Centre of Preservation, Restoration and Museology. The fort served briefly as the Museum of Arms, but the conditions within the fortress were not conducive to the preservation of the displays.\nIn 1977, on the 400th anniversary of completion, the building was inaugurated as a museum and used to display exhibitions of Cuban contemporary and international art. In 1990, it became the National Museum of Cuban Ceramics.\nIn 2010, Castillo de la Real Fuerza reopened as Cuba\u2019s premier maritime museum. (There is also a small naval museum in Cienfuegos.) The museum contains excellent exhibits of Cuba\u2019s maritime past from pre-Columbian days through to the 18th century with the Royal Shipyard of Havana, one of the largest in the world, which built nearly 200 ships for the Spanish Crown. The museum features a huge four-metre model of the Santisima Trinidad located on the main floor with a large interactive touch screen in Spanish, French, and English. The exhibit describes life aboard an 18th-century ship-of-the-line. The original ship was launched into Havana Bay on 2 March 1769 and was the largest ship in the world in the 18th century, with 140 cannons on four gun decks. She was one of four Cuban-built ships at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Downstairs you will find ancient navigational instruments, underwater archaeological artifacts, and gold and silver from the colonial era. Also note the original weathervane, La Giraldilla, while her replica moves in the breeze on the top of the fortress tower, which also commands a fantastic view of the city. The second level of the museum hosts many other historic and contemporary models of ships with links to Cuba and is also a good location for viewing the harbour and city skyline.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Castillo de la Real Fuerza (Castle of the Royal Force)\".

          "I am sucker for a fort, no matter where we go. While the Castillo de la Real Fuerza does not match the majesty or grandeur of El Morro or La Cabana across the bay, it is worth a stop, if you have time. One key difference at this location is that the exhibits are not curated in",

          "Beautiful historical castle. Upon entering and paying the fee we were immediately approached by one of the workers who showed us around. She spoke good English and was really a wealth of information. After she did ask for some money and we gave her 6 CUC, which she said was",

        "wiki": "La Bodeguita del Medio is a typical restaurant-bar of Havana (Cuba). It is a famous tourist destination because of the personalities which have patronized it: Salvador Allende, the poet Pablo Neruda, the artist Josignacio and many others. La Bodeguita lays claim to being the birthplace of the Mojito cocktail, prepared in the bar since its opening in 1942, although this is disputed.  The rooms are full of curious objects, frames, photos, as well as the walls covered by signatures of famous or unknown customers, recounting the island's past.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1942, Angel Mart\u00ednez bought out the small Bodega La Complaciente in Empedrado Street, in the old Havana district. He renamed the place Casa Mart\u00ednez. Angel Mart\u00ednez sold typical Cuban products and, from time to time, served dinner to the regulars. But mainly, the people who were found at the Casa Mart\u00ednez, were there to have a drink with their friends, and savor a brand new cocktail called Mojito, made with rum, mint, sugar, lemon and club soda.\nIn 1949, the cook Silvia Torres aka \u201cla china\u201d prepared the food. Very quickly, the Casa Mart\u00ednez became the centre of Havana's cultural effervescence. Attracted by the bohemian charm of the place, writers, choreographers, musicians or journalists met there in a convivial ambiance. Encouraged by a need for restaurants in the Old Havana at the end of the 1950s, the place started to serve food to everyone.\nOn April 26, 1950, the name Bodeguita del Medio was officially adopted.\n\n\n=== Name\u2019s origin ===\nAmong the first clients was Felito Ayon, a charismatic editor, who rubbed shoulders with the avant-garde of Havana, and put Casa Mart\u00ednez on the map amongst his acquaintances. It is the way Felito Ayon used to indicate the location of the Bodeguita to his friends, that made popular the expression Bodeguita del Medio, that was to become its official name in 1950.\n\n\n=== Menu ===\nThe menu is typically Cuban: boiled rice, black beans, pork shank, manioc, pig shank roasted in its juice, pork rinds and toasted fried plantains.\n\n\n=== Regulars ===\n\nNumerous writers, artists and celebrities were regulars of the Bodeguita : the general and leader of the AK3 Adnan Khan., the poet Pablo Neruda, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Gabriela Mistral, Agust\u00edn Lara, Nat King Cole, Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Joan Manuel Serrat, Margaux Hemingway and Salvador Allende. Ernest Hemingway is often mentioned but was in fact not a regular according to founder Angel Mart\u00ednez. The framed inscription that reads \u201cMy mojito in La Bodeguita, My daiquiri in El Floridita\u201d is an unlikely autograph by Hemingway, according to biographer Philip Greene. For one, Hemingway usually signed his name without loops in the \"g\" and \"y\", while the signature in the Bodeguita does include loops.\n\n\n== 1997 bomb ==\nIn September 1997 a bomb went off in the Bodeguita as part of a bombing campaign against tourist spots that injured dozens and killed the Italian tourist Fabio di Celmo.\nWhile no-one was killed in the Bodeguita, dozens were severely injured. Remarkably just moments before the explosion, the barman had agreed to have his picture taken with a tourist who later turned out to be Ernesto Cruz Leon, the Salvadorian mercenary arrested and convicted for planting the bomb.\n\n\n== La Bodeguita worldwide ==\nToday, there are establishments of the restaurant in locations outside Cuba, including Mexico, the United States, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Italy, Hungary, Macedonia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Germany, United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Lebanon, and China. In Spain, a company has opened four Bodeguitas del Medio, perfect replicas of the original Cuban restaurant. Today, tourists and locals continue to go to La Bodeguita del Medio to drink the authentic Cuban mojito.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLa Bodeguita del Medio, Kortrijk, Belgium\nlbdm.com.au La Bodeguita del Medio, Sydney, Australia\nlabodeguitadelmedio.com.mx La Bodeguita del Medio, Mexican restaurants chain\ntripadvisor.com La Bodeguita del Medio\nbodeguita.com.ua, La Bodeguita del Medio, Kyiv, Ukraine\nLa Bodeguita del Medio, Palo Alto, CA\nHavana guide.com\nHasta siempre Commandante performed in Bodeguita del Medio on YouTube\nfotopedia.com Selected photos of Bodeguita del medio\n- La bodaguita del medio in Budapest, Hungary",

          "We were in Havana last Sunday on a tour.  This was our lunch stop.  34 of us were met with a warm welcome and seated right away.  The service was amazing, the restaurant beautiful and the lunch from salad, soup, chicken with rice and \u2026",
          "Fast in and out service. Very interesting. Lots to look at. Only 3 of 15 cocktails were available at 1pm that day. Tried the croquetas, yummy but not overly flavourful. Large portions. No smiles.",
          "Very trendy place, to my eyes little bit ovepriced. But one of Havana must see places. I would consider what day time to visit bar, in my case bar as full(late lunch 15.30), but almost empty at 16.30. I guess that quality of service would be different, based on occupancy.",
          "Nice place to stop by and have a few drinks. Wide food menu. Prices are slightly high because it is a pretty touristic place. Service and ambiance are good, and the decor features a lot of Cuban memorabilia. There is often live music going on.",
          "After 2 visits to Havana I assure you the mojitos here are by far the best in town. Cheap $4 mojitos and fun to watch them make. There was love music when we were there. It was crowded but we got there before it opened so we could grab a seat.",
          "Stunning went with my wife last year. Absolutely incredible.",
          "Good food,great music and very warm people",
          "A must do whilst in Havana. The bar has a great atmosphere with plenty of mojitos going around and live music. A great place to stop by and have a few drinks. We also ate here for dinner but didn't enjoy that so much.",
          "This place is an institution. Recommend stopping by as the food is pretty good. Love the decor and the ambiance as well. Can get very crowded, so try to either make a reservation or avoid lunch/dinner rush hour.",
          "Got there with a guided tour. The atmosphere and staff are really authentic and amazingly nice. It is a time travel back to the 60's. The food was also good, while not extraordinary.",
          "Like anyone would say it's a staple of Havana. So cute and cozy. Got in just in time to sit at the bar a few tour groups popped on by making it so busy so if you're there and it's busy, go have a look elsewhere and try again. If you're not \u2026",
          "Nice place, but crowded. We didn't have to wait too long for mojito, but we had to drink it in the street. The taste was nothing exceptional, standard. Compared with other pubs it was 2x expensive.",
          "Interesting place good drinks but It's not so big crowded",
          "Nice place, food isn't cheap but I wouldn't say expensive. Drinks are a bit expensive compared with other places nearby. If you go to old Havana you need to come to this emblematic place.",
          "It's all the good that you have heard and more.",
          "Have to visit.  Very popular place and lots of people. Great atmosphere. Authentic mojitos.",
          "Touristic but good for a quick drink to cool off.",
          "Tourist trap as expected... Nothing special.\n\nIf you after awesome mojito/ drinks, go to \nJes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, La Habana, Cuba\nor even better El de Enfrente, O'Reilly, La Habana - get Bloody Mary with octopus garnish :)",
          "Great place to enjoy a mojito and a stogie. Dinner not so much.",
          "Very touristic, but it still keeps the original atmosphere. Loved the interior, the mojitos, the music and the bartender.. A must see in Cuba!",
          "This place is world famous. Lots of tourists. Better go up to the restaurant upstairs and have a lobster meal. Great food.",
          "Great Mojito-not overpriced at all!\nWorth a visit to enjoy one of Hemingway's favorite bars",
          "Hemingway made this bar famous. It is always sieged by crowds. Everybody wants to have a drink here because of Hemingway. Wrong! You should have drink here because they make the best mojito in Havana and possibly in Cuba. The bar has tremendous atmosphere. The staff is proud to work here. They make their best to feel you welcome.",
          "It's a must while in la Habana! Music is great but the musicians were rude. I was standing close to them and they were pushing us badly... I guess it should be tiring working in the crowd, since there's no division or soever. Same with the \u2026",
          "Awesome vibe, best mojitos and cigars",
          "Too crowded to go inside. Mojito was smooth and tasty, but was constantly harassed by beggars asking for money or to take a photo with them for money.",
          "Unique, special touching and bohemian place",
          "Great place for lunch or dinner with the family.",
          "Interesting place good drinks but It's not so big crowded",
          "Great place and great staff!!! I highly recommend trying one...(just due to price...7 cuc\ud83d\ude33)....its on emperado street.....off of Cuba street!! Yunior Luna tattoo is 4 or 5 places away from there.....so you can get the best artist in Cuba......then go 4 a drink!!! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Great cold drinks and a cool atmosphere",
          "A must visit when in Havana. One of the most historical places in the city. Obviously, the buzz around the venue is used by the owners to increase a bit the prices but it is still worth the experience. 6\u20ac for a mojito. Permanently packed \u2026",
          "I want and I must make tourist aware about two biggest mistakes or wrong doing from this place.  The biggest one is that the ice that they put on the drinks are from tap water, which it leads get some parasites in your stomach since the \u2026",
          "I had better mojitos for the pricep",
          "What a nostalgic place!!! Great drinks(but a little pricey...7 cuc) but it's a piece of history and great location (emparado st) in old Habana!! The best tattoos are just 4 or 5 places up the road on emperado (LUNA TATTOOS)..which I HIGHLY recommend as well!!!\ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d",
          "The place is always full, but it has the best MOJITO Cuba. It is a must if you're in Havana, so make sure you visit and drink a delicious MOJITO Cubano",
          "Mojito and very nice atmosphere",

          "The food was fantastic and the visit friendly\nWorth it !",
          "For authentic cuban. GROSS",
          "Amazing to be there and done that. Checked off bucket list. Every tourist comes to take pictures. Stay a few moments and talk to the locals. If you buy anything anywhere in havana make sure to get your change right away.",
          "Part of a tour, while on a cruise. Crowded, fair service, food interesting to try, but not for us.  We like Cuban, but in a different setting.  Sad to see a once successful country suffer like this.",
          "To visit for its historical importance!",
          "It was a very cute restaurant in the historic district of Havana. The food was amazing, I had the bacalao (codfish) in a tomato sauce and a virgin mojito. Loved it all! Would love to return!",
          "This place is impossible to enter, even the street around is full of tourists and inside the r all like sardinas in a small can, screaming and drinking..we just passed by this place quickly, absolutely nothing to do there. Many years ago when was not so many tourists in Cuba, it was a nice place.",
          "Havana classic. Take your time and enjoy having a coffee in such emblematic place. After that I recommend to have lunch or dinner at a paladar (people offer to have you at home and give you homemade Cuban food for a reduced price)",
          "A Havana Classic. Even though it's no secret and you can tell how popular this place is, it did not disappoint. Went multiple times during my stay in Havana and the service is quick and very friendly. It is amazing how a bar runs just \u2026",

          "beautify;l bar and amazing drinks",
          "Tourist place, a must come spot, but mojito is just alright.",
          "Brilliant atmosphere and music, drinks were so nice too",
          "It is worth a look simply if you want to see a bit of history as evident by the graffiti and memorabilia. While it is typically packed with camera toting tourists they do serve a good mojito and can have a good atmosphere. The live bands are wonderful. Most people just stay outside and listen to the music, its electrifying.",
          "The Mojitos were nice but expensive.",
          "Very delicious Mohito!",
          "Probably one of the most atmospheric bars in Havana. Tasty food and cocktails, good music. It's definitely worth a visit.",

          "Excellent mojitos  yum yum",
          "Really fun place! Mrs G and I went to visit the iconic place - it is the birthplace of the mojito. \n\nReally packed but great vibe in and around the place. If you can stop by, grab a drink, and hang with the locals!",

          "Nice Mojito.",
          "couldent stop drinking",

          "The best daiquiri in Havana and very good Cubano sandwich. Very tourists in the place and live music.",
          "Best atm\u00f3sphere and best live music in Havana. Very busy but the service was good especially by Cuban standard. Food above average and would definitely go again",
          "20200502 Miami vice",
          "this is a not so nice place to go, I would say that i can recommend this place to go, maybe also with family and friends. Please check the opening hours before go directly there. Have a great Christmas time.",
          "It's not on a main street. Probably the best mojito I had in Havana, and I had at least one mojito daily. It's very small but so alive and fun!  I will definitely be back my next visit.",
          "Crowded and overrated place. If you are going to charge 5$ for a tiny mojito, at least make it properly, to be fair, it was just water with mint, not even a slice of lime in the glass!!\n\nDefinitely the worst mojitos in Havana, sorry Hemingway...",
          "Must visit...\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf79\ud83c\udf79\ud83c\udf79",

          "You people have very tasty butter",
          "Small and usually packed place but the atmosphere is always fun and the cuba libre and monitors original are the best. Usually opens from 11am ish onwards and can buy sandwiches . Can buy Wi-Fi cards here but ensure they sell for 1 CUC for 1 hour ones.",
          "Home of Mojito. Great vibe.",
          "This is one of the most touristic spot in Havana. Yes it is a tourist trap, yes it is expensive, of course it is always crowded but still it is a must go place in Havana! One of the best mojito in town. It is Hemingway\u2019s favourite location \u2026",
          "Very good food and nice drinks... a must visit place in Havana",
          "Cool music and decor but complete tourist trap. $5 small, syrupy Mojitos. Band plays 3 songs then hustles you for tips then takes a 15min break.",
          "The bar is unfortunately always crowded at any time. Since this is a tourist hot spot you can even come in the morning, but you will not get a seat.\n\nAnd then you finally have a place you will probably found on umpteen Instagram profiles as \u2026",

          "One of the most famous place in the center of Havana where you can drink a good  mojito and listen live Cuban music",
          "Very nice place to visit, in fact it's one of the best touristic spots in Havana. It's a little bit expensive and crowded however it worths the visit. I recommend the mojito and sit a little bit while listening the live music.",

          "One of the most famous places in Cuba! You have to try a mojito here!",
          "The mojito and food are actually good. But lots of people came in and took pictures around which is annoying when you try to eat.",
          "More hype than anything else, just went in for a mojito and the barkeep didn't want to let us go to the top unless we were dining(it was 4pm).\nOne of our mojitos also had rotten mint leaves",
          "Seems everything is done for tourists.\nBut!\nNoce cosy plase with it's own aura.\nMojito at his place is not the best one but it is OK to make a short break and to taste this coctail.",
          "The Mojito first created here. I asked for another cocktail and they laughed! The bar was full, so I stayed outside, on the street and hang out with many tourists who were there and with locals, pulling tricks for a tip.",
          "The name brings people here. We had better Mojitos at lots of places. Wasnt really worth going there.",
          "The birth place of the mojito.great historic place.",
          "Now that was f**king awful. We wanted to have lunch there, but after I had ordered the most disgusting Mojito that I ever drank, we decided to order just bread and butter and think about where to go next. The bread was dry. The butter on the other hand seemed okay. One star for that.",
          "This place is not worth eating at as the food is sub par. If I were to visit Havana again I would definitely not eat here. From speaking with some of the locals the food here hasn't been good for all over a decade.",
          "Wonderful little bar in Cuba. To bad US visitor's are now banned from visiting.",
          "La Bodeguita del Medio, the famous venue in Havana, Cuba.\nThe place where Ernest Hemingway used to have dinner, as per the locals, as this was one of his favourite bars \nThe venue is located on a busy pedestrian road in the heart of \u2026",

        "wiki": "The National Museum of Fine Arts of Havana (Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana) in Havana, Cuba is a museum of Fine Arts that exhibits Cuban art collections from the colonial times up to contemporary generations.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was founded on February 23, 1913 due to the efforts of its first director, Emilio Heredia, a well-known architect.  After frequent moves it was finally placed on the block once occupied by the old Colon Market.  In 1954, a new Palacio of Bellas Artes was opened, designed by the architect Rodriguez Pichardo.  The original 1954 Palacio was recently reconstructed by the architect Jose Linares and a second building was taken over for the Museum.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThere are now two buildings belonging to the Museum, one dedicated to Cuban Arts in the Palacio de Bellas Artes and one dedicated to the Universal Arts, in the Palacio del Centro Asturiano,.\nThe Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts) is dedicated exclusively to housing Cuba Art collections. Spanning the 17th and 19th centuries has rooms devoted to landscape, religious subjects and the Costumbrismo narrative scenes of Cuban life. Gallery devoted to the 1970s is marked by a preponderance of Hyperrealism and the latest generation of Cuban artists whose works all reflect the strong symbolic imagery that has been prevalent in recent decades. The most notable works are those of Ren\u00e9 Portocarrero and Wifredo Lam. A modernist sculpture by noted Cuban artist Rita Lonja stands outside the main entrance.\nOther Cuban artists on display include Leopoldo Roma\u00f1ach, V\u00edctor Manuel, Federico Beltr\u00e1n Masses, Rafael Lillo, Jose A. Bencomo Mena, Manuel Vega, Domingo Ramos, Guillermo Collazo, Mariano Rodriguez, Carlos Enr\u00edquez G\u00f3mez, and Jorge Arche.\nThe Palacio del Centro Asturiano, built in 1927 by architect Manuel Bustos, houses European paintings and sculptures, along with a collection of ancient art. Originally, it was a club for natives of the Spanish Province of Asturias and after the 1959 Revolution it housed the Supreme Court of Justice.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Cuba\n\n\n== References ==\nCuba - Eyewitness Travel Guides (Dorling Kindersley Publishing, 2004) ISBN 0-7566-0172-X\nMoon Handbooks: Cuba' (Avalon Travel Publishing, 2007) ISBN 1-56691-802-2\nThe Odyssey Illustrated Guide To Cuba (Guidebook Company Ltd., 1995) ISBN 962-217-370-5\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Address ==\nPalace of Fine Arts - Trocadero Street e/Zulueta y Monserrate, Old Havana, Havana, Cuba 10200\nPalace of the Asturian Center - San Rafael, e/Zulueta y Monserrate, Old Havana, Havana, Cuba 10200\n\n\n== External links ==\nNacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana web page\n Cuba portal",
